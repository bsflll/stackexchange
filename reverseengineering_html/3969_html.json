D-810 helps deal with obfu in <b>pseudo-decompiled functions</b>, and isn't going to be a lick of help in decoding VMProtected or other kind of \"decrypt at loadtime\" protection.  All D-810 is going to do is make the psuedo-decompiled functions slightly easier to read.  Not that this isn't <b>awesome</b>, it's just not addressing the OPs concern.</span>",
