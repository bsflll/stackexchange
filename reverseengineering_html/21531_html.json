But maybe you could add some more information. In general there are only a handful of practical ways to implement the handling of hotkeys. But depending on whether this is dialog-based or not, details can differ. Possible ways (from the top of my head):\n <code>\n  SetWindowsHookEx\n </code>\n ,\n <code>\n  GetAsyncKeyState\n </code>\n ,\n <code>\n  RegisterHotKey\n </code>\n</span>\n</body></html>",

I can see the window in resource editor (I use Restorator app) and my friend pretty sure this window activates by some combination on keyboard. Window's caption has name \"Instrument Diagnostic\" and I have found Unicode of this symbols inside exe, but where a trigger placed I don't know.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
