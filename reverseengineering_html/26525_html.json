    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have an old IP camera that no longer works, doesn't start the\n  <code>\n   ipcamn\n  </code>\n  executable (application that also listens for port 80 connections).\nTherefore I cannot access it via the network and the camera doesn't perform its intended purpose.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is based on a RA5350 chip, if I attach a serial to USB adapter to it I can see it booting, then it outputs:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Data CRC 01e4cb65 != calculated CRC ed5f8089 for node at 00240af0\nData CRC 01e4cb65 != calculated CRC ed5f8089 for node at 00240af0\nData CRC 01e4cb65 != calculated CRC ed5f8089 for node at 00240af0\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The system is usable, I can move around, I even copied the contents in search of which program outputs this error.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have found that the camera uses two processes\n  <code>\n   videocatch\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   ipcamn\n  </code>\n  (this is true according to other internet resources as well).\nThe\n  <code>\n   ipcamn\n  </code>\n  is the process outputting these errors. However upon disassembling or looking at the strings contained in it or the\n  <code>\n   .so\n  </code>\n  files on the system I cannot find anything related to the error above.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd like to trace the error to its cause and see if it's fixable.\nAny ideas?\n </p>\n <pre><code># cat /proc/cpuinfo\nsystem type             : Ralink SoC\nprocessor               : 0\ncpu model               : MIPS 24K V4.12\nBogoMIPS                : 239.61\nwait instruction        : yes\nmicrosecond timers      : yes\ntlb_entries             : 32\nextra interrupt vector  : yes\nhardware watchpoint     : yes\nASEs implemented        : mips16 dsp\nVCED exceptions         : not available\nVCEI exceptions         : not available\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I also tried to rule out HW problems by copying the binaries over to a Debian MIPS system in QEMU, but I cannot run the executables on MIPS nor on MIPSEL:\n </p>\n <pre><code>user@debian-mips:~/mnt/bin$ ./ipcamn \n-bash: ./ipcamn: cannot execute binary file\n</code></pre>\n <pre><code>root@debian-mipsel:/home/user/mnt/bin# ./ipcamn \nbash: ./ipcamn: No such file or directory\n</code></pre>\n <pre><code>root@debian-mipsel:/home/user/mnt/bin# file ipcamn \nipcamn: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-II version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped\n\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The file exists and is executable.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
