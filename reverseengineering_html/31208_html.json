    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Is there a working way to embed the windows console in disasm code?  I tried\n  <strong>\n   AllocConsole\n  </strong>\n  with\n  <strong>\n   GetStdHandle\n  </strong>\n  or\n  <strong>\n   AttachConsole\n  </strong>\n  with\n  <strong>\n   PID\n  </strong>\n  of an existing console but it didn't work.  I have tried\n  <strong>\n   printf\n  </strong>\n  and\n  <strong>\n   putchar\n  </strong>\n  with no success.  I can make a console and be able to change the title (fancy way to get printf:))) but instead of output I get a black screen.\nI'm on XP and trying to get the status of I/O ports in an old MFC application.  MessageBox is a good alternative, but I/O ports send thousands of messages per second. I will be happy even if x32dbg will have this function for logging registry value somehow but new versions doesn't work on my XP\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

And then it depends how communication happens. Could be that the driver helps to map the I/O port range into the app and the app gets to directly interact with that. But otherwise you could look for\n <code>\n  DeviceIoControl\n </code>\n calls or\n <code>\n  ReadFile\n </code>\n /\n <code>\n  WriteFile\n </code>\n on some device handle (which you could glean via a tool like Process Hacker or Process Explorer).\n</span>\n</body></html>",
