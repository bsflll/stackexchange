I am wanting to have it stop in a place that I can follow and make sense of.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In general, What are some better practices when debugging a bios? Is IDA a decent debugger for this task? Is there something more meant for this task? Any other ideas are welcome also, I am really wanting to focus on reversing malware that is written to the bios.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

QEMU's\n  <code>\n   -S\n  </code>\n  option will pause boot until a debugger (gdb) is attached. IDA's debugger apparently works fine with QEMU, according to this article:\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/tutorials/debugging_gdb_qemu.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/tutorials/debugging_gdb_qemu.pdf\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
