    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have an ELF 32-bit binary and it is a stripped binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Yet, when I load with IDA Pro, I can see the function names like write, open, malloc and so on. So, I am trying to understand if the binary is stripped, then why am I still able to see these function names?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Output of file command for the binary:\n </p>\n <pre><code>ELF 32-bit LSB  executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Example of a code section from the binary:\n </p>\n <pre><code>.text:080485D0                 push    offset asome_string ; \"[ some string ]\n\"\n.text:080485D5                 call    sub_80483F0\n\n\n.text:080483F0 buf             = dword ptr  4\n.text:080483F0\n.text:080483F0                 sub     esp, 0Ch\n.text:080483F3                 sub     esp, 4\n.text:080483F6                 sub     esp, 8\n.text:080483F9                 push    [esp+18h+buf]\n.text:080483FD                 call    sub_8049EA0\n.text:08048402                 add     esp, 0Ch\n.text:08048405                 push    eax             ; n\n.text:08048406                 push    [esp+14h+buf]   ; buf\n.text:0804840A                 push    1               ; fd\n.text:0804840C                 call    _write\n.text:08048411                 add     esp, 10h\n.text:08048414                 add     esp, 0Ch\n.text:08048417                 retn\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  In the above code section, sub_80483F0 is a subroutine which takes one argument. This subroutine will then call sub_8049EA0 to calculate the length of the buffer and then write the buffer to stdout.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, _write is a symbol which was resolved by IDA Pro.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How did IDA Pro resolve _write?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can see the _write is defined inside the .plt section of the ELF as shown below:\n </p>\n <pre><code>.plt:08048330 _write          proc near               ; CODE XREF: sub_80483F0+1Cp\n.plt:08048330                 jmp     ds:write_ptr\n.plt:08048330 _write          endp\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  It has a jump stub which points to write_ptr\n </p>\n <p>\n  write_ptr is inside the .got.plt which I think will be populated with the correct value of the function pointer at runtime.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the question is, if the binary is stripped then shouldn't it have prevented IDA Pro from displaying the function name, _write in the first place?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
