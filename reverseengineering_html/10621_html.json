Is there a plugin/script to quickly compare them and see their differences?\n </p>\n <p>\n  P.S. I'm aware of the myriad of tools for doing binary diffing between two different binaries, for example for doing patch diffing .\n  <em>\n   This is not what I am looking for\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

P.S. I know you're doing C#10; don't waste your time, those two functions are identical.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
