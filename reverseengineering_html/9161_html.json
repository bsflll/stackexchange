    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am working with a Zigbee system and I have been trying to grab the network key as it is exchanged during pairing. I wasn't having much luck with the combination of TI Packet Sniffer, Wireshark and Killerbee - it kept on failing. This combination has worked for me in the past.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I installed a trial version of Perytons-M4 and captured a pairing using my CC2531 USB stick. To my surprise, this recovered the key automatically and started decrypting the rest of the data.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, in the APS_CMD_KEY_TRANSPORT message sent to exchange the key, Perytons is showing that the APS layer data is in fact encrypted already, using a key that I have not seen before (4BAB0F173E1434A2D572E1C1EF478782)\n </p>\n <p>\n  The key for many Zigbee devices is \"ZigBeeAlliance09\", which is the case here for some communications, but this is not the key being used for key exchange.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once the capture is complete, the Perytons \"Keys Management\" window shows the \"ZigBeeAlliance09\" key along with the one sent in the APS_CMD_KEY_TRANSPORT, but\n  <strong>\n   not\n  </strong>\n  the one used to decrypt the APS data.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The device is a Yale PIR camera (manufacturer's product\n  <a href=\"http://www.yale.co.uk/en/yale/couk/productsdb/alarms/-easy-fit-alarm--accessories/pir-image-camera-smartphone-alarm-only/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   page\n  </a>\n  ). I have been unable to identify the physical Zigbee modules used, but they look like\n  <img alt=\"this from the PIR\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mF1Ul.jpg\"/>\n  and\n  <img alt=\"this from the panel\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mWdIm.jpg\"/>\n  . Unfortunately I can't work out a way of getting Data out of Perytons in a way that is easy to read by others.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"Showing the encryption and key on the APS data\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3LhEj.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"Showing the keys recovered during the capture\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DZMTo.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've had a google, had a look in the Zigbee specs and had a look in the Perytons documentation, but can't find anything. Any ideas?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Joining devices decrypt the random network key in the APS_CMD_KEY_TRANSPORT message and then use the network key to encrypt/decrypt further network layer payloads. Most commercial sniffers will see the APS_CMD_KEY_TRANSPORT message and decrypt the network key. There is typically no further encryption at the APS layer for Home Automation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Light Link Profile (Such as Philips Hue) uses the same security mechanism as HA but does not use the publicly available 'ZigBeeAlliance09' trust center link key, but a secret key only given to manufactures that have devices which have passed the Light Link Profile certification process.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Smart Energy profile uses the same network layer security mechanism as HA, but has further APS layer security which uses a key transferred with certicom certificates which are very secure (as it is typically utility companies using this for metering and do not want the meter reading tampered with).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Regards,\nTC.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
