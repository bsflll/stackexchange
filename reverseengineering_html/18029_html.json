In my experience, ARM assemblers try to be intelligent and figure out the best (or only) working instruction encoding - especially when using unified syntax.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The four byte alignment is only a restriction for ldr instructions encoded as 16 bit instructions (footnote [b] in the document you linked). I suppose this restriction was made due to restricted encoding space for the constant offset in a 16 bit opcode, so the thumb instruction set designers went for a larger possible offset here.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
