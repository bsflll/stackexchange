    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  So I'm seeing this a lot in an IDA database:\n </p>\n <pre><code>; wchar_t off_BADF00D\noff_BADF00D     dd offset loc_6F0062\n                dd offset loc_740074\n                dd offset loc_6D006E+1\n                align 10h\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So given the comment at the top IDA\n  <em>\n   knows\n  </em>\n  from the code reference that this ought to be a zero-terminated wide character string.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was thinking of writing a simple IDAPython script to find instances of this and force these items to be converted to the appropriate data type automatically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, neither\n  <code>\n   ;\n  </code>\n  nor\n  <code>\n   :\n  </code>\n  showed anything, so this is neither a repeatable nor a normal comment. So what is it and how can I use IDAPython to extract it? I also tried (prompted by a comment here) if it's an anterior or posterior comment line. It wasn't.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Alternatively I'll also be happy if someone can point out how to \"guide\" IDA to do the right thing without scripting, but this sparked my curiosity, so only bonus points for that. I'd still like to find out how to get the comment shown.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I say partially because it gives\n  <code>\n   wchar_t[67]\n  </code>\n  as result for comment like\n  <code>\n   ; wchar_t aHttpSchemas_27[67]\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
