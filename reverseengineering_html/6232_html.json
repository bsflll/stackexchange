    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I can't find any disassembling programs for the various binary formats out there that can run on OSes like Android, iOS, Blackberry, etc. These are the only devices I have access to, and I am trying to learn assembly and very low-level programming for retro-computers architectures (NES, SNES, Genesis, PSX, N64, etc.).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I managed to find one hex editor for Android that does the job well enough. It's entirely possible to load up any binaries there and hand-disassemble them (meaning look at each byte and an opcode table, etc.).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Doing so, is it possible that one can completely reverse engineer, say, a game and generate some form of assembly-textual source by stepping each machine byte(s) back to assembly instructions that can be re-programmed then back to the machine executable bytes/data/etc.?\n </p>\n <p>\n  What I'm asking is, is this possible or is there a step I am missing?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
