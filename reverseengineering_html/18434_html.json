Depending on the changes, it should be possible. Obviously if you want to add a lot of new code or data, that won't be possible without changing the size, unless you delete a corresponding about of existing code from the classfile.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyway,\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/Storyyeller/Krakatau\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Krakatau\n  </a>\n  is capable of editing a classfile without changing the size. In particular, if you disassemble a classfile in roundtrip mode and reassemble it without modification, you'll get the exact classfile back. However, it still requires knowledge of bytecode and the classfile format to understand which changes you can make without affecting the size, or which things to delete to balance out increases in size.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That being said, this is likely not a fruitful approach. If the jar is checking classfile size, it is likely doing other integrity checks as well. Your best bet is to just find the integrity checks and remove them.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It works for only one class file. Though the other two class file changes the file size. I have noticed one thing that disassembling original class file with \"Krakatau\" &amp; assemble it back make the changes. &amp; running it with \"javap -c\" shows lots of difference.

The program is working fine now but after 20min the software crash automatically, because heap dump shows memory leak but I don't able to fix it. can you please take a look at this program &amp; rectify the issue if possible.
