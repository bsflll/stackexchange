Let's say the RIP offset is\n  <code>\n   0x8fe\n  </code>\n  . You add this, and the offset of the instruction itself (offset from start of .text section) plus the instruction size and you get a number. You then have to add this number to the start of the .text section, but this time, you need to include the\n  <code>\n   SectionAlignment\n  </code>\n  in your calculation. If the RVA of the\n  <code>\n   .text\n  </code>\n  is\n  <code>\n   0x400\n  </code>\n  and the\n  <code>\n   SectionAlignment\n  </code>\n  is\n  <code>\n   0x1000\n  </code>\n  , then the start of the\n  <code>\n   .text\n  </code>\n  will be at Image Base +\n  <code>\n   0x1000\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then you get the imported function names from the ILT\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#import-directory-table\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Import Directory Table\n  </a>\n  . You do this by reading the\n  <code>\n   OriginalFirstThunk\n  </code>\n  pointer to\n  <code>\n   u1.Ordinal\n  </code>\n  and then to\n  <code>\n   Name\n  </code>\n  . For more details look\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#import-directory-table\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  When doing this, you know the order that the imported functions are imported, per dll.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, you need to get the\n  <code>\n   FirstThunk\n  </code>\n  RVA, which will point to a NULL location when the file isn't loaded. However, this RVA is the start of the IAT (in run-time). The size of each import is 8 bytes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, if you see that a\n  <code>\n   CALL QWORD PTR [RIP+0xf8e]\n  </code>\n  , you calculate this number and you get (say)\n  <code>\n   0x0000022D932D2008\n  </code>\n  which is 8 bytes from the start of the IAT, you know that this call calls the\n  <em>\n   second\n  </em>\n  imported function. Since you know the order, you know which function it is.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
