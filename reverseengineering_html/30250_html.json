I understand that I can scroll by hand, or I can edit RIP. But the former may be slow and the latter is intrusive, I don't want to edit the state of the process. Is there a command for this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've found\n  <kbd>\n   Ctrl\n  </kbd>\n  +\n  <kbd>\n   Shift\n  </kbd>\n  +\n  <kbd>\n   G\n  </kbd>\n  , but this is \"Go to offset\", it doesn't accept absolute addresses.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
