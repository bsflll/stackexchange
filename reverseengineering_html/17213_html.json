My original firmware file has no symbols, so I need to find them by myself trough the internet. But here I have a certain function of which I am sure. I have some reliable xrefs to it. But sometimes, some function call the loc_'s following its start. Look here:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KPBWB.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KPBWB.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, it should start from the STMFD as usual, but here is not the case. Why?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Double-check your firmware load address and inspect the calling code; I think the call may have been bogus code too, which caused IDA to start disassembling at a wrong place.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
