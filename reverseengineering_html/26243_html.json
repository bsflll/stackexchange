Injection is not a problem in my case.)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   I need hooking onto arbitrary addresses.\nI want the hooking library saving registers, call my native function, and then restoring registers, and return/jump to specific addresses.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   It is very tedious to do this on manually at a per-site basis and therefore I want an existing library. Furthermore, x64 MSVC does not support asm. It seems that manual hook is impossible unless other tool-chain are used?\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Does such kind of hooking libraries exists?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
