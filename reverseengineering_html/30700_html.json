From this post, ADRP will set the\n <code>\n  x8\n </code>\n value to\n <code>\n  pc + 0x2d71000\n </code>\n , then zero out the lower 12 bit. Then\n <code>\n  nop\n </code>\n will do nothing (wonder if it's a hole for debugging?) Then\n <code>\n  ldr x1, [x8, 0x250]\n </code>\n will load the value in the memory address\n <code>\n  x8 + 0x250\n </code>\n . If your program has correct address (the address in the left size of the picture, provide that you don't have some kind of randomized address), then the value in address\n <code>\n  0x4151250\n </code>\n in memory will be loaded to\n <code>\n  x1\n </code>\n register. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
