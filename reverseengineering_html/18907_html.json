However first you will need to know are you looking at .NET based executable (i.e. has it loaded clr.dll or mscorlib.dll) and how does it access the database. \nTo work this out you can use a tool like\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Process Monitor\n  </a>\n  and filter on\n  <strong>\n   Process Name is  Include\n  </strong>\n  and\n  <strong>\n   Operation is Load Image\n  </strong>\n  Include. From here you can see what runtime DLLs are used (i.e. .NET or MS Visual C, etc) and what database related DLLs are loaded i.e. msjet40.dll.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A generic method that will frequently find the connection string is to simply API monitor the string C runtime functions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Download\n   <a href=\"http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    API Monitor\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Select Visual C++ Run-Time Library -> String Manipulation (CRT)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Launch/Attach to app with API monitor and look for connection strings.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  This can also be done with tools such as WinDbg and setting breakpoint on the C runtime functions and dumping the parameters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example commands like below in WinDbg would print out the unicode string in a 64-bit EXE if the wscpy_s function had been called:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0:000> bp MSVCR100!wcscpy_s \".printf \\\"msvcr100!wcscpy_s source='%mu' \\\",r8;!position;g\"\nbp MSVCR100!wcscpy_s \".printf \\\"msvcr100!wcscpy_s source='%mu' \\\",r8;!position;g\"\nBp expression 'MSVCR100!wcscpy_s' could not be resolved, adding deferred bp\n0:000> bp ucrtbase_clr0400!wcscpy_s \".printf \\\"ucrtbase_clr0400!wcscpy_s source='%mu' \\\",r8;!position;g\"\nbp ucrtbase_clr0400!wcscpy_s \".printf \\\"ucrtbase_clr0400!wcscpy_s source='%mu' \\\",r8;!position;g\"\nBp expression 'ucrtbase_clr0400!wcscpy_s' could not be resolved, adding deferred bp\n0:000> bp mscoreei!wcscpy_s \".printf \\\"ucrtbase_clr0400!wcscpy_s source='%mu' \\\",r8;!position;g\"\nbp mscoreei!wcscpy_s \".printf \\\"ucrtbase_clr0400!wcscpy_s source='%mu' \\\",r8;!position;g\"\nBp expression 'mscoreei!wcscpy_s' could not be resolved, adding deferred bp\n0:000> bp mscoree!wcscpy_s \".printf \\\"mscoree!wcscpy_s source='%mu' \\\",r8;!position;g\"\nbp mscoree!wcscpy_s \".printf \\\"mscoree!wcscpy_s source='%mu' \\\",r8;!position;g\"\nBp expression 'mscoree!wcscpy_s' could not be resolved, adding deferred bp\n0:000> bp msvcrt!wcscpy_s \".printf \\\"msvcrt!wcscpy_s source='%mu' \\\",r8;!position;g\"\nbp msvcrt!wcscpy_s \".printf \\\"msvcrt!wcscpy_s source='%mu' \\\",r8;!position;g\"\n0:000> bp ntdll!wcscpy_s \".printf \\\"ntdll!wcscpy_s source='%mu' \\\",r8;!position;g\"\nbp ntdll!wcscpy_s \".printf \\\"ntdll!wcscpy_s source='%mu' \\\",r8;!position;g\"\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
