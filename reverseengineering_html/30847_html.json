You can download the\n  <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/jvms8.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   JVM spec for version 8\n  </a>\n  and place it in\n  <code>\n   \\ghidra_XX.X.X_PUBLIC\\Ghidra\\Processors\\JVM\\data\\manuals\n  </code>\n  . The JVM.idx file describes where in the processor manual to look for the specific instruction you're asking about. If you right-clicked on a\n  <code>\n   bipush\n  </code>\n  instruction and clicked \"Processor manual\" it would then pull up your jvms8.pdf file and flip to page 396 where it talks about the\n  <code>\n   bipush\n  </code>\n  instruction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm not sure if you can add it to the end of the line. The per-instruction view in Ghidra can be customized when you click on the button at the top of the Listing window (it should say \"Edit the Listing fields\") - that will allow you, for instance, to rearrange the order the address/instruction/bytes appear. By editing the listing, you for instance can turn on the Pcode viewer that lets you see the intermediate language.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you were going to turn on instruction descriptions, that is the place you would do it. However, I don't see an option to do it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
