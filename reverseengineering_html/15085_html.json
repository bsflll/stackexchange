The full procedure is described in\n  <a href=\"https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/zyxel/p2812hnu-fx#branded_and_nonbranded\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Wiki\n  </a>\n  . However, this procedure is for installing\n  <strong>\n   OpenWrt\n  </strong>\n  on ZyXEL P-2812HNU-FX series. In my case I just want flash the regular unbranded firmware version from the manufacturer's repository, not OpenWrt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What's not clear: do I need another special U-Boot version, tailored to regular generic (nonbranded) ZyXEL firmware, or I can use U-Boot version created for OpenWrt?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
