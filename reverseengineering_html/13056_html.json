    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to solve the Sharif CTF 2016 HI2.exe challenge. This challenge requires a specific (impossible to reach) environment (64 processors, 128GB RAM, ...) to display the flag. As the executable is packed with\n  <code>\n   VMProtect\n  </code>\n  , the best alternative seems to hook functions responsible for the environment specification checks, and modify their return values at run time. I'm using OllyDbg with the StrongOD plugin. I have documented all details here:\n  <a href=\"https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/SharifCTF-2016/hi\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/SharifCTF-2016/hi\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have achieved the first step (I have modified values of the\n  <code>\n   SYSTEM_INFO\n  </code>\n  structure manipulated by the\n  <code>\n   GetSystemInfo\n  </code>\n  function) but failed to reach my second breakpoint, set on the\n  <code>\n   GlobalMemoryStatusEx\n  </code>\n  function. The program displays the following error message before my 2nd BP is reached:\n  <code>\n   A debugger has been found running on your system\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have tried to play with a few options from the StrongOD plugin (HidePEB, KernelMode, SkipSomeExceptions) but it either doesn't change anything or crashes the executable before the 2nd BP.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How can I achieve this goal? How should I configure OllyDbg and/or StronOD to prevent the program from knowing it's being debugged?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Many thanks in advance for your help.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
