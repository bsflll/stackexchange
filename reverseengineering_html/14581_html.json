    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to decompile an unknown Win32 executable using ILSpy. However, it only answers by giving me the useless message:\n  <code>\n   This file does not contain a managed assembly.\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have also tried to use other tools like\n  <em>\n   dotPeek64\n  </em>\n  and\n  <em>\n   Teleirik\n  </em>\n  without success. Virustotal tell me that it is using:\n </p>\n <pre><code>[+] COMCTL32.dll\n[+] ComMgr.dll\n[+] KERNEL32.dll\n[+] MSVCP90.dll\n[+] MSVCR90.dll\n[+] OLEAUT32.dll\n[+] SHLWAPI.dll\n[+] USER32.dll\n[+] mfc90.dll\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <strike>\n   I'm pretty sure it is made with .NET\n  </strike>\n  , since this XML is present in the code:\n </p>\n <pre><code><assembly xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\" manifestVersion=\"1.0\">\n  <trustInfo xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3\">\n    <security>\n      <requestedPrivileges>\n        <requestedExecutionLevel level=\"asInvoker\" uiAccess=\"false\"></requestedExecutionLevel>\n      </requestedPrivileges>\n    </security>\n  </trustInfo>\n  <dependency>\n    <dependentAssembly>\n      <assemblyIdentity type=\"win32\" name=\"Microsoft.VC90.CRT\" version=\"9.0.21022.8\" processorArchitecture=\"x86\" publicKeyToken=\"removed\"></assemblyIdentity>\n    </dependentAssembly>\n  </dependency>\n  <dependency>\n    <dependentAssembly>\n      <assemblyIdentity type=\"win32\" name=\"Microsoft.VC90.MFC\" version=\"9.0.21022.8\" processorArchitecture=\"x86\" publicKeyToken=\"removed\"></assemblyIdentity>\n    </dependentAssembly>\n  </dependency>\n</assembly>\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Also note that I'm using Win8 and do not have VS installed. So my questions are:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <strong>\n    What do I need to do to resolve the above error?\n   </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <strong>\n    What am I missing if anything?\n   </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <strong>\n    How can I check if I have those *.dll's listed?\n   </strong>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  EDIT: I'm now thinking it was made with plain C++...\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
