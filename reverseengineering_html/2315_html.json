I thought one couldn't use IDA for patching. I have tried playing with it. However, it gives me the following error:\n  <strong>\n   <code>\n    This type of output files is not supported.\n   </code>\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  What is this option for? What is possible usage of it?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
