I know there are a lot of open threads on the subject but I can't quite figure it out.\nFor example, this\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/14043/stack-variable-information-removed-in-ida-pro-free-version\">\n   tutorial\n  </a>\n  is very close to what I want, but I don't understand how I can display them graphically in IDA pro.\nI'm new at this, thanks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If the programmer created custom\n  <code>\n   #define\n  </code>\n  statements to associate numbers with symbolic names, this information will be destroyed by the compiler very early into the compilation process, long before the binary is ultimately created. Local variable names are also not preserved in the final binary, unless the binary contains debug information (or you have external debug information that you can apply to the binary). However, if this were the case, IDA would have already applied the information, and you would already see the proper names.\n </p>\n <p>\n  TL;DR compilation destroys all symbolic names, and generally speaking, they cannot be recovered without debug information.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
