So, before reinventing the wheel, I'd like to know if there's already some tool to do this.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It will create a .reloc section from different based images.\n  </p>\n  <h2>\n   What does it need?\n  </h2>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    At least 2 different based images of a module. The more you have images, the more your relocations will be reliable.\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n  <h2>\n   Limitations\n  </h2>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    It will only support 32 bits relocations of type (3).
