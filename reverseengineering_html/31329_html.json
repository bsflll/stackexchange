    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to analyze a GCC static library which is a part of a commercial software.\n </p>\n <p>\n  First, I used\n  <code>\n   IDA Pro\n  </code>\n  to analyze entire Lib file, but it could find only object files and was unable to disassemble objects.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, I extracted all of the inside objects by\n  <code>\n   ar -x\n  </code>\n  . Next, I used\n  <code>\n   binwalk\n  </code>\n  , It shows multiple\n  <code>\n   Zlib Compressed\n  </code>\n  regions next to the 64-bytes header (EFI x64). Is this ordinary in static libraries (existence of several zlib region)? Is it a protection method?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyway, I used\n  <code>\n   zlib-flate -uncompress\n  </code>\n  to extract sections in one of the objects after separating its zlib regions (by\n  <code>\n   dd\n  </code>\n  ), and used\n  <code>\n   IDA Pro\n  </code>\n  to disassemble the output. Although, some of the sections contain some valid strings (Unix Path),\n  <code>\n   IDA Pro\n  </code>\n  shows invalid codes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks in advance.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I tried <code>readelf -e file.obj</code>. it shows each Zlib-Compressed region is an <code>elf</code> section which has been determined in the sections header (Because offsets of sections are equal to offsets of <code>binwalk</code> zlib regions). Their name is like a function's name. A weird point is that all main sections (e.g. <code>.text</code>, <code>.data</code>,...) are zero-sized.</span>",
