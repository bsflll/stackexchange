    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I wonder if total decompilation of arbitrary non packed project .NET is possible? If no, what is the conditions that should be met to make it possible? If yes, is there tools that can automate this? I'm wondering not about basic decompilers, but about the ability of complete project recovery to compile result with VS again.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   UPD1\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Yet tried to apply only dotPeek for my case. Unfortunately the output is not looks like ready-to-go project but all errors seems to be debugable. Disadvantage is the inability to export both dlls and exe into one project automatically(poor man's editing\n  <code>\n   .sln\n  </code>\n  file required)\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   UPD2\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Seems like ILSpy has no option of export ready-to-go solutions for one/multiple .NET assemblies. Maybe there is some plugin/extension that should handle this? Will update this post if find one.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
