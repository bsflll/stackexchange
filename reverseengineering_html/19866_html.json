As part of a crackme I'm trying to reverse a weak hash function that's a little too complicated for me to undo by hand. I've been trying to execute backwards with GDB but no luck. What are the common techniques for accomplishing this task?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It's not a \"real\" hash function, so in principle I could by undo all these operations by hand. But there are so many in series it would be impractical.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
