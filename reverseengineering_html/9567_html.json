This stops you right at the entry point. From there lldb will tell you the address as well, in case this is what you are interested in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If instead you were interested in the actual main function, and not the entry point, you should have a look at the related question\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/6719/lldb-break-at-start-of-actual-code-not-entrypoint\">\n   lldb: break at start of actual code, not entrypoint\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
