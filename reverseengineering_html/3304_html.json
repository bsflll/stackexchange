When I attach to a process and view the executable modules, I want to open one. However, when I double click on one of the modules, it won't open in the main OllyDBG window, which it should. Has anyone else had a similar issue or have a solution? I run OllyDBG as administrator and I even tried running it in compatibility mode for XP. I can provide more information if it is needed to fully answer my question.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
