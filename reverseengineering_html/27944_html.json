Luckily, it still symbols attached ,but I am struggling to read the symbols and it is worth my time to demangle them. Is there a script or better yet a rule set that I can extract somehow to start this process? I am wanting to avoid the whole compiling binaries until I solve all the symbols myself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I assume there is a symbol conversion table or something documented somewhere, but either will be great.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I found a couple of scripts, but they are very incomplete.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/Chadderz121/ghs-demangle\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/Chadderz121/ghs-demangle\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/jackwakefield/ghs-demangler\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/jackwakefield/ghs-demangler\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Also, please amend your question to tell us what exactly seems to be missing. But given what you've already found, it appears to be either verbatim or a modification of the GNU C++ symbol mangling.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
