    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am trying to reverse engineer an old native application written in Borland Delphi in order to modify it for my needs:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7JJsg.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7JJsg.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The application interfaces with the special hardware and displays events that it receives in the\n  <code>\n   TDBCtrlGrid\n  </code>\n  control, that acts as a long list. Using the Spy++ tool I was able to see that it has a child window\n  <code>\n   TDBCtrlPanel\n  </code>\n  :\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IqWfW.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IqWfW.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So both are placed in the actual application as such:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5WbSz.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5WbSz.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I need to add some custom functionality to this application and namely, to be able to track when a certain hardware-related event occurs. I am not the author of this application and the company who created it is long gone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So my only solution seems to be trying to patch the executable with my own code trampoline. My goal is to trap instances when a new line is added to that\n  <code>\n   TDBCtrlGrid\n  </code>\n  control and ideally get the text from it. (Example:\n  <code>\n   5/30/2018  9:30:00 PM  Beam Alarm Zone   Alarm Zone Armed\n  </code>\n  that is the last line from the screenshot above.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've never done much in Delphi/Pascal. So I don't know its structure. To start, I need to find out how do those Delphi controls receive text for a new row to try to trap the part of the original code that does it?\n </p>\n <p>\n  PS. If it was Windows common controls, I know that they receive most notifications via\n  <code>\n   SendMessage\n  </code>\n  API. I tried that approach with Spy++, but the only messages those two Delphi controls receive were\n  <code>\n   WM_PAINT\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   WM_STYLECHANGED\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I googled a bit:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   At runtime, users can use the database navigator (TDBNavigator) to move through data in the TDBCtrlGrid object, and to insert, delete, and edit the data.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  from\n  <a href=\"http://docs.embarcadero.com/products/rad_studio/delphiAndcpp2009/HelpUpdate2/EN/html/delphivclwin32/DBCGrids_TDBCtrlGrid.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   http://docs.embarcadero.com/products/rad_studio/delphiAndcpp2009/HelpUpdate2/EN/html/delphivclwin32/DBCGrids_TDBCtrlGrid.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  From my understanding, you define a data source (this is the part I didn't understand), connect it to a data viewer widget like your CtrlGrid and add a Navigator that handles the view into the data source.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So either the program uses the TDBNavigator to add data and this might be your hook, or there is some other way to alter your data source.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd probably look for simple example code using all the above to see how one typically implements it in Delphi, then it should be straight-forward to find the proper hook location.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
