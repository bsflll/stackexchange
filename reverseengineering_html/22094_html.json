But I am not sure if it really gets all privileges the system has. Can it read/write code inside the kernel without segfaults, etc.? I want to use kernel module for unwinding the stack to kernel level to backtrace every function my program calls.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Regarding if you can have segfaults on your module the response is yes, you can crash the kernel if your module is not written properly\n</span>\n</body></html>",
