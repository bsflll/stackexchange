Right click on some data in\n  <code>\n   .rdata\n  </code>\n  brings options in which I can convert, In that window D means decimal B means binary and so on, but I have multiple Ds in which I can convert, and the values in which it can be converted are different, what is the difference between this Ds? Here is the picture\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EZIHP.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"for example\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EZIHP.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  thanks :)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So it will change the data type that is used to display the values you have.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you check closely you would notice that from the bottom the pattern is:\n  <code>\n   byte\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   word\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   dword\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   qword\n  </code>\n  . Those two at the top are probably the two are some forms of float/real numbers created from the data you're trying to convert.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
