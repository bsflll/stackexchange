If you want him to rebase his program to be the same as yours, figure out your base address (scroll to the top of your\n  <code>\n   .exe\n  </code>\n  in\n  <code>\n   Text View\n  </code>\n  ) and then have your friend go to\n  <strong>\n   Edit -> Segments -> Rebase Program...\n  </strong>\n  and when prompted have him put in your base address.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Alternatively, you can both just rebase to the same base address, e.g.\n  <code>\n   0x10000000\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Most programs don't care where they are loaded in memory, so when IDA or another program loads them, the OS just puts them wherever it wants, which is normally random either by chance or because of ASLR. If you have more questions that are significantly not answered by these answers, you should edit your question with more specifics or details.</span>",

You can get the offset for that function, global or whatever using the following IDA Python:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   Python> hex(here() - idaapi.get_imagebase())\n0x38a0aL\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  It subtracts from the address under the cursor the base address of the database. Then, you can tell your friend the offset and she/he will have to go to the beginning of the database (just press the \"Home\" key a few times), press key 'g' and enter +0xGIVENOFFSET (notice the\n  <strong>\n   +\n  </strong>\n  at the beginning) to go to the function you want to point her/him.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
