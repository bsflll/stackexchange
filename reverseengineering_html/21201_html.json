If so, you first need to identify how the object was allocated to find the call of the constructor. In this case, since there's a\n  <code>\n   g_\n  </code>\n  prefix, I assume this is a global object. The constructor is called by\n  <code>\n   _initterm\n  </code>\n  and `dynamic initializer for ...', you can find it using the xref. You should see something like this (it could be located inside a sub function):\n </p>\n <pre><code>lea rcx, <vtable>\nmov [obj], rcx\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And a call to\n  <code>\n   atexit\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once you have the\n  <code>\n   vtable\n  </code>\n  , simply do the math. :)\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Also, how can I find the vtable of the ISystem class in IDA?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  You can try to use\n  <code>\n   class informer\n  </code>\n  plugin. It'll give you the name of the class and its virtual methods. However, you won't have the name of methods since this information is lost during compilation(, unless you have symbols).\nSince you have the source, you can also try to generate code signature (\n  <code>\n   FLIRT\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   Rizzo\n  </code>\n  ) to retrieve the names.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you want to rename the offset during the call, this is a different problem. You have to create a new structure. I don't think IDA support parsing of C++ class, you can either transform the C++ class to a C structure or script it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
