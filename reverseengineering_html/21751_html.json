The first involves\n  <em>\n   Call stack view\n  </em>\n  (\n  <code>\n   View\n  </code>\n  ->\n  <code>\n   Call stack\n  </code>\n  ) that you can use when the breakpoint you set in that function from\n  <code>\n   win32u.dll\n  </code>\n  is triggered. The first one coming from your application's module will be the desired one.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Second approach is more static and takes advantage of\n  <em>\n   Intermodular calls\n  </em>\n  . Go to your application's module, right click -> \"Search for\" -> \"All intermodular calls\". You will get all external functions that your program calls and the places where they are called from. So, just search for that API function and you will get all places that it is called from in that module.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can see\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/21360/call-stack-vs-intermodular-calls-in-ollydbg/21378#21378\">\n   answer\n  </a>\n  for more details.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
