Since these are both\n  arrays of integers, each element is of size 4, although the instructions at 1\n  and 2 differ for accessing the two arrays. In both cases,\n   <code>\n    ecx\n   </code>\n   is used as the\n  index, which is multiplied by 4 to account for the size of the elements. The\n  resulting value is added to the base address of the array to access the proper\n  array element.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
