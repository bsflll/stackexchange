I also see a lot of this obfuscator on other dll, but protectionId scan result it wasn't being packed\nwith this note :\n </p>\n <pre><code>Section [0x0] 'SteveW  ' has a higher physical size than virtual size..\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and also this :\n </p>\n <pre><code>Warning : Import Table is bad !!!\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  here is the dll link :\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/appsec-labs/Advanced_Packet_Editor/blob/master/Source/PacketEditor/WSPE.dat\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   WSPE.dat\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
