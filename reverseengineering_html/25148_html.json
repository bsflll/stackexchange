    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Frequently when I use Radare2 I work mostly in hexadecimal. This means I'm constantly having to remember to type\n  <code>\n   0x\n  </code>\n  in front of addresses, which is different from the machine-language monitors I'm used to using. (I'm generally working with binaries for 8-bit systems, where decimal is rarely used when working in machine language.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there any way to set the default input radix to hexadecimal? I'd like to be able to type\n  <code>\n   s ff00\n  </code>\n  instead of\n  <code>\n   s 0xff00\n  </code>\n  at the command line, and\n  <code>\n   gff00\n  </code>\n  instead of\n  <code>\n   g0xff00\n  </code>\n  in visual mode.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And if I can do this, how does one enter decimal numbers, should that be necessary, in this mode?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Links to documentation are appreciated.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

To do so, you can modify the\n  <code>\n   libr/core/cmd_seek.c\n  </code>\n  file (which is responsible for handling seek command) as follows:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bnQsP.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"r2SeekHAck\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bnQsP.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  And then use\n  <code>\n   make\n  </code>\n  to compile the project. After this, you will get the feature you want (will also work with\n  <code>\n   g\n  </code>\n  in Visual Mode):\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MKtGY.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"r2HexSeekHack\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MKtGY.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can find the patch code below:\n </p>\n <pre><code>ut64 addr;\nif ((input[1] >= '1' && input[1] <= '9') || (input[1] >= 'a' && input[1] <= 'f'))\n{\n    char inputHex[strlen(input) + 1];\n    inputHex[0] = '0';\n    inputHex[1] = 'x';\n    int i = 2;\n    for (; i < strlen(input) + 1; i++)\n        inputHex[i] = input[i - 1];\n    addr = r_num_math (core->num, inputHex);\n} \nelse\n     addr = r_num_math (core->num, input + 1);\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
