A jailbroken device can access an iOS device's root file system from a shell or any application (such as iFile).  As of iOS 8, the Applications directory has changed to\n  <code>\n   /var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   But from\n   <a href=\"http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Seatbelt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    this\n   </a>\n   , I shouldn't?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Well, not necessarily.  If the application is running as root (think iFile or Filza), you can have read and write access to any directory on the device.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Maybe I should write a App to scan the FileSystem on a normal iPhone and a jailbreak one.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  In theory, any application can ask to read or write a file to any directory.  This is frequently how jailbreak checks are done in production apps.  If the file manager does not return an error when trying to read from\n  <code>\n   /var/mobile\n  </code>\n  , then you know the application is being run as root on a jailbroken device.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
