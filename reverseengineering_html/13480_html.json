    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <h2>\n  context about\n  <code>\n   action_handler_t\n  </code>\n </h2>\n <p>\n  IDA provides multiple features and APIs to extend and enhance it's usability, one of those features is the creation of user defined\n  <code>\n   action_handler_t\n  </code>\n  objects by inheriting\n  <code>\n   idaapi.action_handler_t\n  </code>\n  in IDAPython.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The feature involves several APIs, but one of the requirements is having a class that inherits said\n  <code>\n   idaapi.action_handler_t\n  </code>\n  class and implements two methods. One of those methods is\n  <code>\n   update(self, ctx)\n  </code>\n  (the other being\n  <code>\n   activate(self, ctx)\n  </code>\n  ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  During an IDA application's lifetime, the\n  <code>\n   update\n  </code>\n  method will be called multiple times on certain events (startup, a new IDB being loaded, focus shifts to another form, etc). Updates then communicates back wether the action should be enabled or disabled and when to query again by issuing another call to\n  <code>\n   update\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of those events is an action's\n  <code>\n   activation\n  </code>\n  call returns. The motivation is that actions performed as a result of an action being activated might potentially change the state of that same action or other actions.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  actual question\n </h2>\n <p>\n  While using IDA and certain Qt signals/slots abilities, I've created an\n  <code>\n   activation\n  </code>\n  method that returns immediately and schedules most of its login to other slots, and I'm now losing the \"post-activation\"\n  <code>\n   update\n  </code>\n  call that makes actions respond to overall state changes and change their own state (from disabled to enabled and vise versa).\n </p>\n <p>\n  My question is, how can I force an\n  <code>\n   update\n  </code>\n  call by IDA's kernel to all existing actions so that when my delayed code finishes it could manually tell IDA it should call\n  <code>\n   update\n  </code>\n  for all actions to query for their new state?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
