When printing out, I can scan for certain sequences and so I replace the first two lines with\n </p>\n <pre><code>eax = 10 * arg_0\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and then just skip printing the next line. However, there is a limit to how far I can get with that. Concatenating the next operation, which would lead to\n </p>\n <pre><code>eax = 10 * arg_0 + arg_4\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  requires to look ahead\n  <strong>\n   two\n  </strong>\n  instructions,\n  <em>\n   and\n  </em>\n  would only work for this specific combination of\n  <code>\n   mov\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   imul\n  </code>\n  , and\n  <code>\n   add\n  </code>\n  , while assuring the same destination register is still targeted and the intermediate instructions have no lasting effect on other registers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The goal is to end up with something like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>local_4 = 10 * arg_0 + arg_4\neax = local_4\nreturn\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  where obviously\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  is specifically assigned a value before a\n  <code>\n   return\n  </code>\n  , so the last line can be\n </p>\n <pre><code>return eax\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and finally the entire construction can be collapsed into\n </p>\n <pre><code>return 10 * arg_0 + arg_4\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  (which is very close to what I started with in the original trivial C program). I am struggling with the internal representation of composite lines such as the last one. The otherwise very reliable decompiler page\n  <a href=\"http://www.backerstreet.com/decompiler/creating_statements.php\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   backerstreet.com/creating_statements\n  </a>\n  casually switches between raw assembler and C-like compound statements:\n </p>\n <pre><code>if(!expr1 && !expr2)\n  ...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  without explaining how this intermediate step is stored in memory and can create the output string.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What type of intermediate storage form should I be looking at, which (a) can be constructed from the original disassembled instructions, (b) can have its elements combined and rearranged, and (c) can be translated into human-readable output such as the last line?\n </p>\n <p>\n  It may be worth mentioning that I am not aiming to create the Definitive Universal Decompiler :) My test input was compiled with an ancient version (most likely pre-1993) of Delphi Pascal, but while its assembly is not really optimized and fairly readable to begin with, I'd still like to go the extra mile and make my computer do what it does best and make it yet easier to understand the code.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <h3>\n  A longer real world example\n </h3>\n <p>\n  Below is some actual disassembly.

It's not quite as advanced a mechanism as decompiling but it has proven quite effective in restricted domains such as arcade video games. (eg\n  <a href=\"http://vide.malban.de/vectrex-programs/vecfever\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   http://vide.malban.de/vectrex-programs/vecfever\n  </a>\n  )  There have been a few of these written; I have code for work in progress that does this for 6809, 6502, z80 and Cinematronic CPUs for example (though probably not immediately usable - it's a coming-together of four separate background projects with no great urgency).  Anyway feel free to poke around and see if there's anything here that is helpful to you:\n  <a href=\"http://gtoal.com/SBTPROJECT/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   http://gtoal.com/SBTPROJECT/\n  </a>\n  (the 6809 one is probably the cleanest code if you're just browsing and not actually running it)\n </p>\n <p>\n  There's a bit of a writeup of the overall method at\n  <a href=\"http://gtoal.com/sbt/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   http://gtoal.com/sbt/\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Output looks something like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>            //        LDA   $FFFF,X                 ; 0431: A6 1F         \n      A = memory[(UINT16)(X + 0xffff)];\n  //  N = A;\n  //  Z = A;\n  //  V = 0;\n\n            //        LEAU  ,X                      ; 0433: 33 84         \n      U = X;\n\n            //        LDX   #$0EC8                  ; 0435: 8E 0E C8      \n      X = 0x0ec8;\n  //  Z = X;\n  //  N = (X) >> 8;\n  //  V = 0;\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  (the commented out lines are due to optimisation of redundant stores)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rather than output functional code for execution, you could satisfy the OP's request by outputting comments that describe in detail what the operations are doing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Other practical translators have been written by David Welch, Norbert Keher, Thomas Sontowski and others.  There is also Project Orion which is a multi-person multi-target translator headed up by Neil Bradley (respected emulator author) and several other members of the Orion mailing list - that translator had working front ends for 6502 and z80, with 68000 and 6809 also being under development, and built an internal AST (Abstract Syntax Tree, much as described in one of the earlier answers in this thread) in order to output cleaner and more efficient code to a variety of back ends including C.  (There is also some academic work produced by Christina Cifuentes et al.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Graham\n </p>\n <p>\n  PS When the output is a generic IR (Internal Representation) such as C or LLVM's internal IR, as opposed to when you produce binary directly, or indirectly by outputting asm for a specific architecture) the technique is properly called \"Compiled Instruction Set Simulation\" - but most people just call it static binary translation.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
