    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a qemu instance running a custom Linux distribution, within which I'd like to debug an (already running) application. I have already embedded a\n  <code>\n   gdbserver\n  </code>\n  inside (and have a root shell available), so I can start it with\n  <code>\n   --attach <pid>\n  </code>\n  . I also have extracted and analyzed the binary I am interested in and have an\n  <code>\n   .idb\n  </code>\n  file for it. However, when I connect to the remote GDB through IDA (via\n  <code>\n   Debugger > Attach to process\n  </code>\n  , and then selecting\n  <code>\n   0 - the running process\n  </code>\n  ), it completely ignores everything in the database. No functions, no comments, nothing. ASLR is disabled, but if somehow still needed, I can provide\n  <code>\n   /proc/<pid>/maps\n  </code>\n  . The question is, how do I inform IDA that the app it's looking at is the same as the database?\n </p>\n <p>\n  If it matters, I'm running IDA Pro 7.5 on Windows\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
