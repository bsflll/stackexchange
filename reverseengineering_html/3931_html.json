I'm able to build the library on Windows and run the script in IDA without issue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I try to do this on OSX, IDA complains that the 3rd-party library doesn't exist.  I notice that from the shell on my Mac, the version of Python I'm using is 2.7.x, but IDA says the Python version its using is 2.6.x.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Doing\n  <code>\n   sys.executable\n  </code>\n  in the IDA window and from my shell both seem to print\n  <code>\n   /usr/bin/python\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Where is this 2.6 python binary? Or, more importantly, how should I properly install this 3rd party library so that IDAPython can see it and use it?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
