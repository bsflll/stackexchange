I know what those are supposed to do, but I do not know how to treat them and I'm making no advancements in understanding the code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Short example:\nFirst instructions of my current assignment are:\n </p>\n <pre><code>seg000:00000000                 mov     edx, 61666A1Fh\nseg000:00000005                 fincstp\nseg000:00000007                 fnstenv byte ptr [esp-0Ch]\nseg000:0000000B                 pop     esi             ; EIP\nseg000:0000000C                 sub     ecx, ecx\nseg000:0000000E                 mov     cl, 33h ; '3'\nseg000:00000010                 xor     [esi+12h], edx\nseg000:00000013                 add     edx, [esi+12h]  ; \nseg000:00000016                 xor     ecx, 0FFFFFF96h\nseg000:00000019                 test    [ecx+esi*8+957C08Fh], dl\nseg000:00000020                 push    eax             ; ??????\nseg000:00000021                 mov     bl, 0DEh ; 'Â¦'\nseg000:00000023                 in      al, dx\nseg000:00000024                 popa\nseg000:00000025                 loope   near ptr 0FFFFFFACh\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I'm a bit lost at\n  <code>\n   05h\n  </code>\n  -\n  <code>\n   0Bh\n  </code>\n  as it's the first time I encounter FPU instructions, but I think that\n  <code>\n   ESI\n  </code>\n  should point to the where\n  <code>\n   EIP\n  </code>\n  is pointing to.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My main question is regarding\n  <code>\n   23h\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <pre><code>in al, dx\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Should load a in\n  <code>\n   AL\n  </code>\n  a byte from port\n  <code>\n   6A1Fh\n  </code>\n  ? Is this relevant in any way or is code like this supposed to make my work harder or hide something? Maybe it's encrypted and at some point some decrypting algorithm will kick in. Or maybe that shouldn't be viewed as code?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If your\n <code>\n  .686p .mmx .model flat seg000 segment byte public 'CODE' use32\n </code>\n was generated by IDA, then it's probable that ida wasn't initialized correctly when you started it - if you give an ARM object file to ida, and tell it it's 32 bit Intel code, it'll happily try to disassemble it as intel code, but generate nothing but garbage. This seems to be what has happened here. Posting the hex code, or the binary if it isn't too large, as others have suggested, might help someone recognize the format and provide further clues.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
