I want to know when a specific string is printed to the console. I ran the following command:\n </p>\n <pre><code>root@testbox> strings -a --radix=x binfile | grep -i reset\nd38c4  RESET\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This is the string I want to know when is being printed to the console. This could either be happening with printf or puts (which are called many many times during the flow of execution)\n </p>\n <p>\n  What is the appropriate way to use the string's memory address to tell when its being read (thus printed to the screen)?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
