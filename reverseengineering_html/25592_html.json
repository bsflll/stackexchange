I am an application developer, so this field is way out of my area of expertise. My end goal is to create a web page out of this information but this is the first hurdle I faced: getting the required data in the first place.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am currently trying to identify the nature of a file that I have suspicions might be encrypted and/or compressed (I'm still trying to learn the tell-tales of a file being encrypted/compressed). Since this is way above what I can do at the moment, it would be great if someone can help out or at least provide some guidance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is an example file (do let me know if you'd like some more examples):\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vwt4G55E-TaGvuWM86L6S-7Sbd2o0gOp/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vwt4G55E-TaGvuWM86L6S-7Sbd2o0gOp/view?usp=sharing\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So far, here's what I know and attempted:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   File is most likely a JSON or CSV (not 100% sure, but all the other unencrypted metadata files are JSON/CSV format)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   File has a lot of repeated sets of binary\n   <code>\n    ef\n   </code>\n   <code>\n    bf\n   </code>\n   <code>\n    bd\n   </code>\n   , which I'm assuming are just paddings or an attempt to obfuscate?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Most of the corresponding hexes do not really translate to a readable set of standard encodings such as UTF-8\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Any help/guidance would be appreciated.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Any hex/text editor should be enough for that purpose.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    If the file is Binary - it could have text strings inside, which could help understand the nature of the file.  In your case, no text strings appear in the file.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Some binary files have \"magic values\" - identifiers that help to understand which file format it is. for example - the 4 first bytes in\n    <code>\n     ELF\n    </code>\n    file format will be always\n    <code>\n     .ELF\n    </code>\n    . In your case, the file starts with\n    <code>\n     CE A3 EF BF\n    </code>\n    which doesn't correspond to any known format.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Next step will be to use binary tools like\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     binwalk\n    </a>\n    to identify any compressed/internal files/objects. In this case, it yields nothing.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Next step will be to calculate the entropy of the file. It could be done by\n    <code>\n     binwalk -E <file>\n    </code>\n    . in this case, it yields 0.52 - the higher the entropy it, the higher chances the file is encrypted/obfuscated. Here, it looks like the entropy is not high, meaning the file is not encrypted/obfuscated.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  So overall it looks like it's just a custom binary file format. In order to continue investigating, you need to understand which program is using the file - and in what purpose, and continue with a reverse engineering process, usually based on static disassembler like\n  <code>\n   IDA PRO\n  </code>\n  or the free\n  <code>\n   Ghidra\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
