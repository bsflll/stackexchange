I am able to change texts in the menu but I also want to add subtitles to cutscenes. Is it possible to add subtitles to cutscene.phd files?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Someone actually managed to add texts to cutscenes in 4th game with reverse engineering, even though it didn't support subtitles. There is currently a language patch for Last Revelation right now. And I can't reach the ones who made it however as I much do want to ask them how they even did that.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The other forums I link to in the other reply I noted, XeNTaX and ZenHAX, are the two communities out there that deal specifically in reversing file formats, so sign up there and inquire. If they can't help you, then I'd recommend a different approach, like perhaps a DLL injection where you hook a function related to the messages that appear on the screen. That also isn't a trivial matter for beginners, unfortunately, but you can research.</span>",
