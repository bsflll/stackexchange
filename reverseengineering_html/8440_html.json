    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've got a procedure in IDA Pro with a few local stack variables, but part of them belong to an array. I would like to define the array, but pressing\n  <code>\n   *\n  </code>\n  (Create Array) fails, and pressing\n  <code>\n   Y\n  </code>\n  (Set Type) just brings up the type for the procedure, not the variable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The same happens if I hover over an instance of its usage rather than its definition in the function prologue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Oddly enough I seem to be able to rename them just fine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How do I define a range of local variables to be an array; or, why is it not working for me?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
