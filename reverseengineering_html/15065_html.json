    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've been playing around with a cheapish ($15 on sale @ Wal-Mart) WiFi camera. It has a UART port which drops me into a shell from which I can launch telnetd and login easily. However, even though the filesystem is mounted readwrite, when I edit anything (i.e. init.d) and then reboot, the filesystem goes back to its previous state and telnetd doesn't run. :(\n </p>\n <p>\n  My long term goal is to figure out how to replace or edit the camera's streaming binary files so that it's not dependent upon a hosted cloud server to store and stream videos. (\n  <em>\n   Currently to stream from outside my house, the video bounces off their cloud server; and I must use their proprietary app!\n  </em>\n  ) My short term (current) goal is to figure out how to repack the firmware and rewrite to the camera.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was able to sniff a firmware update, and the firmware file is found at:\n </p>\n <pre><code>https://app.isecurityplus.com/seedonk/firmware/minions/A356_upgrade_00.10.008_20161107.img\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ file A356_upgrade_00.10.008_20161107.img \nA356_upgrade_00.10.008_20161107.img: u-boot legacy uImage, Imogen-X860-I, Linux/ARM, OS Kernel Image (Not compressed), 6709304 bytes, Mon Nov  7 02:33:58 2016, Load Address: 0x80008000, Entry Point: 0x80008000, Header CRC: 0x37467C4E, Data CRC: 0x93CBB08E\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  binwalk shows:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ binwalk -Me A356_upgrade_00.10.008_20161107.img \n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0             0x0             uImage header, header size: 64 bytes, header CRC: 0x37467C4E, created: 2016-11-07 02:33:58, image size: 6709304 bytes, Data Address: 0x80008000, Entry Point: 0x80008000, data CRC: 0x93CBB08E, OS: Linux, CPU: ARM, image type: OS Kernel Image, compression type: none, image name: \"Imogen-X860-I\"\n10063         0x274F          xz compressed data\n10284         0x282C          xz compressed data\n\n<etc..snip.. eventually it creates a 0.cpio file>\n\n$ cpio -idv < 0.cpio \n$ ls\n0.cpio      dev     init        lib32       media       package     run  system     var\nbin     etc     ko      libexec     mnt     proc        sbin        tmp\ncpio-root   home        lib     linuxrc     opt     root        sys     usr\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This community has been amazing and I've learned so much about RE. I've found a few posts on here about repackaging this sort of thing but I still have enough knowledge gap to fall short on knowing where my next step would be. Any guidance?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Many thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Here is the general workflow according to the\n  <a href=\"https://code.google.com/archive/p/firmware-mod-kit/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   firmware mod kit archive page at Google Code\n  </a>\n  :\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <ol>\n   <li>\n    Extract a firmware image into its component parts User makes desired\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    modification to the firmware's file system or web UI (webif)\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Rebuild firmware\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Flash modified firmware onto device and brick it (ha)\n   </li>\n  </ol>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Since extraction does not seem to be a problem and since the file system format is\n  <code>\n   cpio\n  </code>\n  and not something\n  <a href=\"http://elinux.org/File_Systems#Embedded_Filesystems\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   more exotic\n  </a>\n  , you may be able to use the\n  <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/cpio/manual/cpio.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   GNU\n   <code>\n    cpio\n   </code>\n   utility\n  </a>\n  and not need any special tools to modify the file system and then re-compress it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The modified file system will likely need to be located at the offset in the rebuilt firmware image the bootloader expects it to be.
