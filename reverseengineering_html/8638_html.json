It looks easier than loop, but I just cannot find a well-developed way to recover the statement.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Is there anyway/api/scripts to iterate C statements in IDA-Pro? Or I have to implement myself?\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Ideally it should look like this as this is essentially used in source code analysis... (sorry for this pseudo code, I just want to clarify)\n </p>\n <pre><code>let aux s =\n    match s with\n    | If e1 b1 b2 -> analyze e1 b1 b2\n    | Loop e1 e2 e3 b1 -> analyze e1 e2 e3 b1\n    | Assign v1 v2 -> analyze v1 v2 \n    | States sl -> List.iter analyze sl\n    | ...  in\nList.iter aux statement_list\n...\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
