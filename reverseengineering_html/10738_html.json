That way you are safe even in case of a possible zero day.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The idb file can then be taken out of the VM and analyzed elsewhere. The idb does not contain runnable machine code, so you are safe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you want to perform any dynamic analysis on the malware, you need to use a VM.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
