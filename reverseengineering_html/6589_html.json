    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am aware that when decompiling a jar file, it is normal for the resulting .java files to contain syntax errors, but I am unsure of why and worse off I am sometimes unsure of how to fix these syntax errors. Take\n  <code>\n   int[] arrayOfInt = new int['Â€'];\n  </code>\n  , for example. Eclipse complains that\n  <code>\n   'Â€'\n  </code>\n  does not belong. Surprise! I know this already, but why does this happen. How can I find out what this value should be?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You can see that the thing inside the quotes is two bytes, and appears to be interpreted as nonstandard upper 128 characters. I.e. JD-Gui is emitting unicode, but the charset isn't declared correctly so your editor interprets it as two raw bytes in an 8bit charset instead of a single unicode character.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One solution is to use a Decompiler that emits unicode escapes instead of raw unicode byte sequences. That way, any editor will be able to view it correctly. I'd recommend Procyon (it's a lot better than JD-Gui anyway).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Unlike JD-GUI's generated <code>.java</code> files, the ones created by Procyon only contained a single syntax error in one of the classes which was easily corrected. It would also appear that the jar file was not obfuscated, but JD-GUI's poor job at decompiling mangled the code so much that it appeared as though it had been messed with.</span>",
