Ignoring the conversion, it would still come down to finding a correctly/full implementation in a .cpu format, not seeing to many\n</span>\n</body></html>",

After a bit more research:   - there does not seem to be a ready to use tool for the conversion;   - it should be possible to create such a tool, but it is non-trivial.   For a single processor module, it may well be quicker to hand craft the module. Still, I might have a go at automating at least part of the process...</span>",
