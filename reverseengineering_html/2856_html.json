Here I take the assumption that the self-debugging is implemented based on Windows Debug APIs. So, here are my findings:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   In \"debugger\" process:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Attach/run with your debugger the process you want to study\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Look for a call to CreateProcess API with the flags\n   <strong>\n    DEBUG_ONLY_THIS_PROCESS\n   </strong>\n   or\n   <strong>\n    DEBUG_PROCESS\n   </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Follow to the closest call to\n   <strong>\n    WaitForDebugEvent\n   </strong>\n   . Usually this will be a loop for processing of all the debug event that will come from the debug-gee.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Once the event processing region was found, all is needed is to check what event exactly is being processed. Check your event according to\n   <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms679308%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    MSDN\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   In several cases there will be pair call to Get/SetThreadContext. So analyzing the structure before the SetThreadContext is called, one can actually see what region of the debug-gee was altered (if you did not know it already).\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   After all the alternations, there will be finally call to ContinueDebugEvent/ZwContinue. Until it was called the debug-gee is in freeze for the inspection.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   In \"debug-gee\" process:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Attach WinDbg to it in non-invasive mode to inspect what was changed.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Make your notes before continue.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Hope this will help.\nYour comments are more than welcome.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
