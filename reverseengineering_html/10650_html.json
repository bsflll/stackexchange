I want to make sure I do this right.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've been looking into this hex editing and there seems to be no rhyme or rhythm to what I'm editing. I've programmed before, I can wrap my head around this stuff I just don't know where to begin. The ANSI pane is full of random numbers and letters. Is there any way to find out what hex relates to the number of impulses sent out by this machine? Or at very least, how can I approach the company that made the machine and ask intelligible enough questions to them about how to find the hex code? I want to be as efficient with my time, and their's, as I can be.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
