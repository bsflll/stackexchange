At a minimum you'd have to provide a hexdump or the Base32 (or similarly) encoded form of the data. By pasting some Cyrillic letters, you seem to have already assumed a certain encoding and removed the ability of all readers to look at raw data. Please update your question. Also, have you tried\n <a href=\"https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  CyberChef\n </a>\n ?\n</span>\n</body></html>",
