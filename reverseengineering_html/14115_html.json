I use\n  <code>\n   ni\n  </code>\n  command to step over arm asm instructions. I suppose\n  <code>\n   ni\n  </code>\n  is\n  <code>\n   step over\n  </code>\n  , but it still goes into function like\n  <code>\n   BL xxxx\n  </code>\n  , and I have to use\n  <code>\n   finish\n  </code>\n  to get back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried\n  <code>\n   ni\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   si\n  </code>\n  , seems no difference, why?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This is just a guess, but without them, I suppose your BL is seen as a mere branch, not a subroutine call.
