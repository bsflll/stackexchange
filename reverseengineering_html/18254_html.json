I'm trying to make a patch for a software & when I compare this two file the only change I have seen in line 12 & 26.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As I'm not a java coder so I don't know how to do that but I read some articles & it suggests that to change a compiled java class there is only two way either get the source code or edit with bytecode editor. I tried to decompile the jar file but it shows huge error. So java byte editor is the only option.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I want to know how to change these parameters without decompiling the class file in java byte editor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Please help me.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
