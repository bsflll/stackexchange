I tried changing the above instruction to different variants as shown below:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov rax, [rsp + 48h]\nmov rax, [rsp + 48]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However, it still gives me an error.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is a valid assembly instruction. I can edit the assembly in other softwares like x64_dbg and it works with the above disassembly.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
