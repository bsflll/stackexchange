I hit a wrong key while trying it out and now some of the lines that looked like\n </p>\n <pre><code>lea     ecx, [esp+150h+var_13E+2]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  now look something like\n </p>\n <pre><code>lea     ecx, [esp+14h]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  It computed the sum of the formula to figure out the stack address, removing the stack variable name it was using. It's harder to use now. Is there a way to get back the original line?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You can have IDA regenerate it by undefining your function and redefining it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To do, so, place your text cursor at the beginning of the function, press\n  <kbd>\n   U\n  </kbd>\n  (\n  <em>\n   U\n  </em>\n  ndefine), then\n  <kbd>\n   P\n  </kbd>\n  (define\n  <em>\n   P\n  </em>\n  rocedure).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note that this will cause IDA to lose any information you manually added to the function (stack variable names, function prototype, etc.), so only do it as a last-resort.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
