I have a similar Proform-branded treadmill which accepts an iFit Wifi Module (which i don't have).  It looks like the edge connector has relatively few conductors so ought to be relatively easy to reverse engineer or control...\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Since handheld devices can connect to iFit exercise equipment with the iFit app I'd develop an app which talks the same iFit protocol. I'm actually planning to add iFit support to my own mobile application sometimes in the future. I'm looking at the\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/dawsontoth/zwifit\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/dawsontoth/zwifit\n  </a>\n  repository and I think it could be possible to decipher the protocol from that source.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
