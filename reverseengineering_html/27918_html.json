I am using x32dbg to label each function and variable of the application, I have extensive knowledge of it's inner workings  except for the rendering part, which is because Direct3D uses vtables. I have run apitrace with some success, but I want to find the addresses of the calls aswell, so that I can label them (manually).\n</span>\n</body></html>",
