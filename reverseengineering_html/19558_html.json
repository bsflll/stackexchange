I came to the conclusion that the files have been obfuscated with\n  <a href=\"https://www.php-obfuscator.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.php-obfuscator.com/\n  </a>\n  and no deobfuscate tool that I know can convert php goto/labels to loops so I strongly think this is not a duplicate question. Can goto/labels be converted to while/foreach loops?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
