This second class has methods like getIn and getOut which retrieve incoming and outgoing nodes (basic blocks), respectively. So I think using this methods should be the interface for interacting with the CFG programmatically. But sadly I didn't figure out yet how to get this PcodeSyntaxTree object, but will continue investigating.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I hope this can help you a bit!\n </p>\n <p>\n  links:\n  <a href=\"http://ghidra.re/ghidra_docs/api/ghidra/program/model/pcode/PcodeSyntaxTree.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   http://ghidra.re/ghidra_docs/api/ghidra/program/model/pcode/PcodeSyntaxTree.html\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"http://ghidra.re/ghidra_docs/api/ghidra/program/model/pcode/PcodeBlockBasic.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   http://ghidra.re/ghidra_docs/api/ghidra/program/model/pcode/PcodeBlockBasic.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  PS.: Other thing you can do is to study the code of calculateCyclomaticComplexity​ method, which uses this BasickBlock models, I think I will probably do that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  EDIT:\ngood news I think.
