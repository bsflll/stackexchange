The deal is, when I load the executable in IDA, the Debugger option in the menu suddenly dissapears.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What exactly is happening, or what am I doing wrong?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Debugging a program\n  means that its code will be executed on your system.\n  Be careful with malicious programs, viruses and trojans!\n   \n\n   \n\n   REMARK: if you select ‘No’, the debugger will be automatically\n  disabled.\n  Are you sure you want to continue?\n   \n\n   \n\n   <strong>\n    Selecting No in response to this warning causes the Debugger menu\n  to be removed from the IDA menu bar. The Debugger menu will not be\n  restored until you close the active database.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  So maybe at one point you've answered\n  <code>\n   no\n  </code>\n  and IDA remembers this in the database? Try new analysis from scratch to see if the menu gets restored.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
