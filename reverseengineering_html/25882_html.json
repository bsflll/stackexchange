Because you have more unknowns than knowns, you will not be able to know the original password, but you can still get one the passes the validation routine. You already know some of the letters due to seeing them in the disassembly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As a smaller example, say we know the first letter of a password is\n  <code>\n   G\n  </code>\n  and the that there are 6 letters. The program then sums up the letters into three variables as follows:\n </p>\n <pre><code>var1 = password[0] + password[1] + password[5]\nvar2 = password[0] + password[4]\nvar3 = password[0] + password[1] + password[2] + password[3] + password[4]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Then later we see that it checks:\n </p>\n <pre><code>var1 == 225\nvar2 == 160\nvar3 == 392\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  We can set up a matrix for this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>[1 1 0 0 0 1 | 225]\n[1 0 0 0 1 0 | 160]\n[1 1 1 1 1 0 | 392]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Using\n  <code>\n   SymPy\n  </code>\n  or something similar, we can reduce this matrix down:\n </p>\n <pre><code>from sypy import *\nA = Matrix([[1,1,0,0,0,1,225],[1,0,0,0,1,0,160],[1,1,1,1,1,0,392]])\nA.rref()\n\n(Matrix([\n[1, 0, 0, 0,  1,  0, 160],\n[0, 1, 0, 0, -1,  1,  65],\n[0, 0, 1, 1,  1, -1, 167]]), (0, 1, 2))\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Our pivots are\n  <code>\n   password[0]\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   password[1]\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   password[2]\n  </code>\n  . We already know\n  <code>\n   password[0] == 71\n  </code>\n  , we will select whatever we want for\n  <code>\n   password[1]\n  </code>\n  &\n  <code>\n   password[2]\n  </code>\n  and will try to get everything else in terms of these.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since we know that the first letter is\n  <code>\n   'G'\n  </code>\n  and has a value of\n  <code>\n   71\n  </code>\n  , the first equation is\n  <code>\n   72 + password[4] = 160\n  </code>\n  . We now know\n  <code>\n   password[4]\n  </code>\n  is\n  <code>\n   89\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   Y\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Knowing this, we can look at our next equation.\n  <code>\n   password[1] - 89 + password[5] = 65.\n  </code>\n  Rewriting:\n  <code>\n   password[5] = 154 - password[1]\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  We can now look at the last equation:\n  <code>\n   password[2] + password[3] + 89 - password[5] = 167\n  </code>\n  Rewriting:\n  <code>\n   password[3] = password[5] - password[2] + 78\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Putting it all together:\n </p>\n <pre><code>password[0] = 'G'\npassword[1] = pivot\npassword[2] = pivot\npassword[3] = password[5] - password[2] + 78\npassword[4] = 'Y'\npassword[5] = 154 - password[1]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now we just assign whatever we want for\n  <code>\n   password[1]\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   password[2]\n  </code>\n  and we will get a valid password.\n </p>\n <pre><code>password[1] = 'A'\npassword[2] = 'A'\n</code></pre>\n <pre><code># Find password[5]\nchr(154 - ord('A'))\n'Y'\n\n# Find password[3]\nchr(ord('Y') - ord('A') + 78)\n'f'\n\n# Validate password\npassword = \"GAAfYY\"\nvar1 = ord(password[0]) + ord(password[1]) + ord(password[5])\nvar2 = ord(password[0]) + ord(password[4])\nvar3 = ord(password[0]) + ord(password[1]) + ord(password[2]) + + ord(password[3]) + ord(password[4])\n\n(var1 == 225) and (var2 == 160) and (var3 == 392)\nTrue\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  It will be harder for your specific one because you the numbers are being taken\n  <code>\n   % 100\n  </code>\n  , but you know how many characters there are and what value range ASCII falls in so it shouldn't be too hard to set a limited range for the possible values.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
