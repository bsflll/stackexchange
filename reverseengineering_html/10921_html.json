For virtual functions there is also a pointer to a table of pointers that is the first offset in the structure.  Each class member is a specific offset from the beginning of the structure.  The easiest way to see this is to create a class, and assign different members to values that you know.  Then look in IDA and see the offsets that are modified with those known values.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is a good article that describes the layout.\n  <a href=\"http://www.openrce.org/articles/full_view/23\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://www.openrce.org/articles/full_view/23\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
