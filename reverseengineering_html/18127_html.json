Then I was about to write some small Z3 script but luckily stumbled upon\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/DennisYurichev/yurichev.com/blob/master/blog/CRC_cracker_Z3/CRC_cracker.py\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/DennisYurichev/yurichev.com/blob/master/blog/CRC_cracker_Z3/CRC_cracker.py\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  which is described here:\n  <a href=\"https://yurichev.com/blog/CRC_cracker_Z3/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://yurichev.com/blog/CRC_cracker_Z3/\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Basically, that is a script that uses Z3 (Microsoft's theorem prover) to calculate the CRC sum and it tries to find the polynomial, test Big and Little Endian interpretation, and an inverted input/output or not. You supply it with input data and the CRC sums they have to generate and then it tells you the parameters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That script did not produce a result for me though. That either means it's not a CRC, not a 32 bit CRC, the input/output is modified beyond simple inversion, or the supplied samples are not\n  <em>\n   just\n  </em>\n  over the 3 letters you listed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I also could not find any matching publicly known set of parameters (such as CRC32C), for that I tested some parameter sets using\n  <a href=\"https://pycrc.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://pycrc.org/\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  If your actual target was recreating the checksum I'd probably go reverse engineer the code now instead of treating it as a blackbox.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
