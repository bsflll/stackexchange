    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  When debugging the following com file in MS-DOS, I can successfully run the program with\n  <code>\n   -g\n  </code>\n  and it terminates normally, but when I trace it\n  <code>\n   -t 1000\n  </code>\n  , the program throws an illegal operation exception and terminates after +/- 800 instructions.  I traced the file manually, but I cannot see why it aborts (it does write to some data to the lower memory regions, but that shouldn't affect the debugger).\n </p>\n <p>\n  The COM file can be found\n  <a href=\"http://ul.to/sv80kses\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Both MS Debug and the Freedos\n  <code>\n   DEBUG.exe\n  </code>\n  give the same results (albeit that they crash at a different point in the execution).  Both the WinXP virtual x86 environment and dosbox give the same results.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any thoughts on why this is happining?\n </p>\n <p>\n  EDIT:\nA trace can be found in this\n  <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/dtt71c01\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   pastebin\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  This trace was made with Dosbox running the FreeDOS debugger using\n  <a href=\"http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/dos/debug/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   these software\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked into the MASM code from the debugger: normally no INT3 should\nbe used for a single-step trace. Also note the fact that all the registers and flags are messed up.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

But how exactly can I test that hypothesis? I can't put any page protection or anything in real mode.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

The Trace uses interrupt 1, so it is interrupting that write.  The next trace instruction that occurs after that last REP completes will trigger an interrupt using the partially overwritten new address instead of the debugger's one.\nThe effects are entirely unpredictable at that point.\nYou can't trace through this one automatically.  It will require some interaction from you.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
