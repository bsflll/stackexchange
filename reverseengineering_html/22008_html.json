They are for static reverse engineering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Both kinds of tools are useful, both have their places. Generally, the more complex a target is, the more you need IDA/Ghidra in addition to a debugger.\n </p>\n <p>\n  2) I would actually start out by writing  your own crackme, starting close to „hello world“, and then gradually increasing the difficulty.
