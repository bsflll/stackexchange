In some cases, compiler can event remove you code at all - you will get an \"empty\" executable :-)\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I hope that you understand, that to add all the above, compiler needs to add some code and this is even before\n  <code>\n   your code\n  </code>\n  is there. Of course, you can disable all of the above by playing with the parameters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://www.catch22.net/tuts/reducing-executable-size\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Reducing Executable Size\n  </a>\n  is a pretty good list of useful info which can help you to understand what is going on under the hood.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My suggestion is to write the following code\n </p>\n <pre><code>int main()\n{\n   return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  remove all optimizations and start your study from there by adding/removing compiler options one in a time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Have Fun!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
