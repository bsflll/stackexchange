In practice I sometimes compile a dummy binary using all the functions I expect my target to use and then open both and look for similarities. There are just too many parameters you'd have to figure out to get matching binaries. IDA has FLIRT signatures which somewhat try to handle slight differences but compiler output can drastically change. A dummy binary and the source can be enough to spot patterns, but it's still a manual task.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
