The highlighted one is the EntryPoint, you can patch the highlighted one and redirect it to your control, in my sample, I added a new executable section but remember, you have to return the control to the original program, or else it will not run properly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VCyj2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VCyj2.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Original Section\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ozHFl.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ozHFl.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Added Section using StudPE.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/y88Xa.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/y88Xa.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  After patching.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/sjHop.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/sjHop.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  As I mentioned from above, you have to return the control to the original program, so after executing the MessageBox , it will return to the original address.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/p0uN2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/p0uN2.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Reroute it to a new (or modified) section. MessageBoxA/W should be placed in your IAT if it isn't already, then just have the EP call OEP before jumping to your embedded shellcode. In your case that code would just be pushing arguments, calling import, and fixing up the stack.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
