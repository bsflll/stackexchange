Most surprising for many people is that the .NET framework itself is native.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can identify .NET DLLs in WinDbg using the\n  <code>\n   lm v\n  </code>\n  command. In case of a managed DLL it says:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0:008> lmv m MyApp\nstart    end        module name\n10310000 10574000   MyApp(deferred)             \n    Image path: C:\\...\\MyApp.exe\n    Image name: MyApp.exe\n    Has CLR image header, track-debug-data flag not set\n    Timestamp:        Wed May 21 16:34:02 2014 (537CB95A)\n...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Note the line\n  <code>\n   Has CLR image header\n  </code>\n  in the output. The .NET framework is also loaded in that process, but it is native and does not have such a line:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0:008> lmv m mscorwks\nstart    end        module name\n79470000 79a1e000   mscorwks   (pdb symbols)          d:\\...\\mscorwks.pdb\n    Loaded symbol image file: C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\mscorwks.dll\n    Image path: C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\mscorwks.dll\n    Image name: mscorwks.dll\n    Timestamp:        Tue Oct 22 03:06:42 2013 (5265CFA2)\n...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  There are good reasons to use native DLLs by a managed application:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   because it's already implemented and stable\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   for performance reasons: maybe C++ was just faster (maybe not in your case, since you don't seem to be happy with the performance)\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   PhotoViewer.dll\n  </code>\n  is a native DLL, even if dotPeek says \"Platform: .Net Framework 4.5\". This seems to be a bug, because it also reports .NET for\n  <code>\n   kernel32.dll\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The properties\n  <code>\n   Assembly platform\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   Module Runtime\n  </code>\n  seem to be a bit inconsistent anyway. Here are some combinations I tried that caused results which at least would need some explanation:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   kernel32: Platform 4.5, Runtime: none\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Jigfdt.fdt100: Platform 2.0, Runtime: 1.1.4322\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Fdt.ProfibusTransformers: Platform 4.0, Runtime 2.0.50727\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Another way of detecting .NET is\n  <a href=\"http://dependencywalker.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Dependency Walker\n  </a>\n  . A pure .NET assembly typically has only one dependency on\n  <code>\n   mscoree.dll\n  </code>\n  while native DLLs depend on different things.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
