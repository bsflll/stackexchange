I figured mise well try and crack it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first thing I did was to put the executable into\n  <code>\n   Exeinfo PE\n  </code>\n  and there was nothing special there. So next I loaded the DLL into there and it came up with\n  <code>\n   PEcompact ver.1.41 - v1.84\n  </code>\n  and it said to unpack it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I found an unpacker called\n  <code>\n   GUnPacker\n  </code>\n  loaded it in there and it gave me\n  <code>\n   Address : <0x0041E738> ---- Is OEP(FOEP) Possibly...\n  </code>\n  Not sure what to do with this since I am fairly new to the whole DLL being packed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When you load the exe it gives me a ID #:\n  <code>\n   00FF-7514-B10D\n  </code>\n  and then it asks for a serial. I loaded the DLL into\n  <code>\n   dllexp\n  </code>\n  and there is a function named\n  <code>\n   GetSerial\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also I believe it is a VB6 exe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there any way to intercept that or something so that when I debug the program I can break when it is called and retrieve the serial?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
