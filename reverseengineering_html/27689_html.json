Now I need to to patch the program to make it print the password if\n  <code>\n   strcmp\n  </code>\n  fails.\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The password is stored in\n   <code>\n    local_40\n   </code>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  But I don't know how to patch the instruction to print out the value at local_40\n </p>\n <p>\n  Instead of\n  <code>\n   MOV dword ptr [ESP],0x4b1050\n  </code>\n  what variable in this instruction should be edited? If my understanding is correct then the above instruction is loading the ESP register with the value at\n  <code>\n   0x4b1050\n  </code>\n  so how will I get the address of\n  <code>\n   local_40\n  </code>\n  ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/sZa8W.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/sZa8W.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You'll need to override some instructions before\n <code>\n  0x40151a\n </code>\n as well, and therefore to point the\n <code>\n  JNZ\n </code>\n accordingly.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
