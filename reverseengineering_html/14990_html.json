The .hex file basically encodes binary data which contains instruction in assembly language, but also data.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   What does it mean? Why can I read only some strings and not all the\n  data?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  It means\n  <code>\n   strings\n  </code>\n  could find some data its deems to be a string. it just searches the binary dump for byte sequences which reassembly ascii codes (with additional heuristics, like minimum length, different string formats, ...)\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Exacly what happen when I convert .hex file to .bin file?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  The file is decoded. its a symmetric encoding scheme as described at the source you privided.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Is there a way to extract the code in which these strings are used?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Yes, but you would need to find the code first to make this connection. Good diassemblers like IDA will find cross-references to data fields (like strings).\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you want to see the individual machine instructions, please use a disassembler like radare2, IDA, BinaryNinja, Hopper or something else capable of disassembling ARM.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
