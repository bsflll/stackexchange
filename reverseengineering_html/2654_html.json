    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I want to decrypt a polymorphic malware. In polymorphic malware there must be a decryption routine which will decrypt virus code and then execute it. I want to get this pair of encrypted code and its decrypted version and do some processing on it. For this I took this polymorphic malware from offensive computing website.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://oc.gtisc.gatech.edu:8080/search.cgi?search=bolzano\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://oc.gtisc.gatech.edu:8080/search.cgi?search=bolzano\n  </a>\n  MD5:    6eb5fdc7a80cb6b551b7aee3242ea9e4\nSHA1:   8f9a97ef3388bc21367f245715d1e930c7dd81c0\nSHA256:     0613e465dc0473c210c6e905ce938eaf6adcea800b116d0651f22c782ffb1cdb\nOCID:   1663401483\nOriginal Filename:  Virus.Win32.Bolzano.3628\n </p>\n <p>\n  This virus can be executed in windows NT. So I created vm for windows NT 4.0 SP6. And loaded virus in Ollydbg 1.10. I directly executed executable there. After few seconds virus terminated with exit code 5B. Does this means that when I executed virus , it is decrpyted by decryption routine and executed ? What are ways I can find decryption routine in that virus so that I can understand the exact position of decrypted virus. If I understood that I can put break point after decryption routine and recover the pair.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In report, it is written that this virus checks for debugger. But how can I see in code that it is checking for debugger and how it behaves in case of debugger. I am not sure whether report I got is correct or not. In executable there is call to GetTickCount API and I read that this API is used to check for debugger. But how can I confirm whether GetTickCount API used in code is for debugger or for some other purpose.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

In that particular case I saw the usage of\n   <strong>\n    NtCreateSection\n   </strong>\n   which you also should monitor.\n   <ol>\n    <li>\n     After loading the malware in Debugger, try to search for dynamic control transfer, like jumps/calls to value stored in register/de-referenced memory.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Also put BPs on APIs responsible for memory de-allocation (VirtualFree) so you could dump the buffer before its gone.\n    </li>\n   </ol>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  And for the end, do not immediately rush to a debugger, try to run the malware and look what it does by using\n  <strong>\n   ProcMon\n  </strong>\n  for example.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   UPDATE:\n  </strong>\n  \n\n  Advise before you dive into dealing with real malware:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Write very simple program.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Download UPX compressor - its open source, as there are a lot of malwares that use it too :)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Compress your program with UPX\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Now, try manually decompress your program from the compressed one.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Have fun!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Could you suggest me any simple polymormphic malware which I can use at initial stage and find its encrypted/decrypted pair. I put break point on VirtualAlloc/VirtualAllocEx but it seems virus is not coming here and don't stop its execution. Also regarding tool ProcMon, this tool can be run on windows XP and higher version, but virus which I am using is exectable on windows NT. So I can not use this tool.</span>",
