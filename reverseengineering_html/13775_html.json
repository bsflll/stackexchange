The program returns with an error immediately.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have even tried setting a breakpoint over the string text of the error message in the\n  <code>\n   .data\n  </code>\n  segment, and even then no breakpoint.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What is causing this? Why can't I just step through a process to see where its contacting the serial port?\n </p>\n <p>\n  How is it possible that its hiding at this level?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Also, depending on the program it could use/require a specific driver through which it talks to the serial port or it could use simply\n <code>\n  CreateFile\n </code>\n or its native counterpart\n <code>\n  NtCreateFile\n </code>\n . But in general when communication with a driver is involved you can expect there to be a call to something like\n <code>\n  CreateFile\n </code>\n . Windows is not so dissimilar to Unix, since the object manager namespace also has just a single root and you talk to devices the same way as you read/write files.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

It took a ton of filtering, but I eventually found a reference to CreateFileA. Odd, because Ida Pro does not reference CreateFileA anywhere. Either way, it works!
