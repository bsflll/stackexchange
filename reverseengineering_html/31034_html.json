    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  So, before you shout at me to go on google I would just like to say I am new to reverse Engineering. Like I have been doing it for a hour. So, I was doing a bunch of crackmes.one using the search all string references and changing it to always say yes. But then I run into this software:\n  <a href=\"https://crackmes.one/crackme/63445b9533c5d4425e2cd7cf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://crackmes.one/crackme/63445b9533c5d4425e2cd7cf\n  </a>\n  I treat it like any other use die and see that it is unpacked. But when I search for the string nothing pops up. I am guessing this is because of the Xor encryption. How would I decrypt software (if that's the right term)? and for future cases when I don't get told the encryption method how would I be able to tell?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
