But the addresses in the textfiles are completely static and do not respect rebased DLLs.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   A forum user\n   <a href=\"http://www.blizzhackers.cc/viewtopic.php?f=71&t=310891&start=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    posted a plugin named \"Dynamic Debugging\"\n   </a>\n   which would solve my problems as it can load stored comments and labels with a base address I can manually specify. However, the thread is from 2006, and the download cannot be found on the net anymore, not even in archives.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Anyone knowing a plugin or still having the \"Dynamic Debugging\" plugin?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

For those who want to try it: Start a Visual Studio Developer prompt (yeah, you'd need VS) and type in\n </p>\n <pre><code>editbin /DYNAMICBASE:NO C:\\Game\\game.exe\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  It should modify the PE header to disable ASLR in that executable and all DLLs it loads. But as said, it had no effect for me.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
