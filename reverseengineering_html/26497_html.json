    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  in pwnlib there is a possibility to search for particular bytes, e.g. as follows for 0x66 byte:\n </p>\n <pre><code>print(next(p.elf.search(b'f')))\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  which in turn results in the following output:\n </p>\n <pre><code>4195268\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Having this value it is possible to examine it as an address in radare2:\n </p>\n <pre><code>pd 1 @ 4195268\n\n        0x004003c4      666c           insb byte [rdi], dx\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And it refers properly to a sequence of bytes containing desired 'f' (0x66).\nHowever, this is neither a physical address nor a virtual one:\n </p>\n <pre><code>[0x00400520]> ?v 4195268\n        0x4003c4\n[0x00400520]> ?p 4195268\n        0x000003c4\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And I couldn't get it from radare2 directly. Instead, searching for bytes in r2 results in reference to virtual address, not to the value returned by ELF class from pwntools.\n </p>\n <pre><code>[0x00400520]> /x 66\n\n0x004003c4 hit10_0 66\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So, what is it actually an address of? And how I can get the same value returned by pwntools in radare2?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
