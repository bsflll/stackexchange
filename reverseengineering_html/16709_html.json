When I close Olly, and then reopen it after a crash, the assembly window is at a different location. How do I search for my comments to jump back to where I was working? I've tried ctrl-g to search for them, but that only seems to search through the assembly code itself.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Back in the days I used\n  <a href=\"http://www.openrce.org/downloads/details/107/Labelmaster\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   LabelMaster\n  </a>\n  for this task.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  On a personal note, I highly recommend to use x64dbg which is an active open-source project, unlike Ollydbg which is absolutely outdated. Moreover, x64dbg is inspired by OllyDbg so you should not have too many problems with migrating to it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here are some resources:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://x64dbg.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    x64dbg main website\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    The project's Github repository\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://x64dbg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    x64dbg's documentation\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  For the record, you can list your defined comments in x64dbg by pressing\n  <kbd>\n   Ctrl\n  </kbd>\n  +\n  <kbd>\n   Alt\n  </kbd>\n  +\n  <kbd>\n   C\n  </kbd>\n  or by clicking the \"View\" menu and choosing \"Comments\".\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
