Research efforts like\n  <a href=\"http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   BitBlaze\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"http://dslab.epfl.ch/proj/s2e\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   S2E\n  </a>\n  have used modified versions of Qemu to trace kernel mode components for bug finding.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The key difference, I think, is that Qemu/Bochs as whole system emulators do not present a by default view of the program under inspection as a DBI does. A DBI allows for dynamic editing of the program by default. Emulators have the primitives required to effect DBI, they can read and write memory and by extension program code, but they do not provide the API that PIN does for program modification.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So the best I can do is, you can use Qemu to make a kernel mode DBI and others have done this, but I don't know of something more usable out of the box.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

And QEMU etc. emulate a fairly limited range of hardware. The S2E project has done a little bit of work in this area by <a href=\"http://dslab.epfl.ch/pubs/ddt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">using symbolic execution to fake out the missing device inputs</a>, but it's not a panacea. A real kernel DBI solution that can run on real hardware would be better.</span>",
