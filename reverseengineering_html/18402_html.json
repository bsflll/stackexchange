There's no documentation for Hopper Debugger Server, nor am I finding mention of it in the Hopper documentation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any tips on how to make this work?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Here's the procedure that needs to be followed:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Open a copy of the executable to be analyzed in Hopper on the host Mac\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Put a copy of the executable to be analyzed on the VM\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Install Hopper Debugger Server on the VM and launch it\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   In Hopper on the host Mac, choose Debug > Select Debugger\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Select the VM\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Change the path to the executable to the correct path on the VM, rather than the path to the file on the host Mac\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Begin debugging in Hopper on the host Mac!\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  I heard from someone else that doing this caused a beachball on their machine, but don't have details. This worked for me, using the following:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Hopper 4.3.24\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Hopper Debugger Server 2.4\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   macOS 10.13.4 on the host Mac\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   macOS 10.12.6 on the VM\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
