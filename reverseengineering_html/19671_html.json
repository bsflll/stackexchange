    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a Petrainer PET998DRU shock collar (similar to\n  <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00W6UVROK\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   this one\n  </a>\n  ) that got partially chewed up by the dog it is supposed to train. I salvaged it to the point where I have the following buttons:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Mode (to select light, beep, vibrate, and zap\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Activate (to send appropriate stimulation)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Up arrow (to increase the amount of stim)\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  The display does not work so I don't know what the setting (which stim and how much) is on other than trial and error.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have followed the method on here:\n  <a href=\"http://brettleaver.com/collar/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   http://brettleaver.com/collar/\n  </a>\n  to get as far as I have gotten but the protocol differs on this model and I have only been able to figure out the device ID and the stim type (I think). I can replay the packets on a separate 433Mhz transmitter and the collar responds appropriately but I want to figure out the whole packet. The amount of stim is what I need helping decoding.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Logic for beep\n  </strong>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/08buD.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Image for beep (no duration is encoded by design)\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/08buD.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I decoded this as\n  <code>\n   0xDF 7E DE ED 7F D6 AB\n  </code>\n  If this is wrong, then please let me know because it may give me a clue as to why I can't figure out the rest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Logic for zap\n  </strong>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aBYSv.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Image for zap (unknown duration)\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aBYSv.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I decoded this as\n  <code>\n   0x‭DF DE DE ED 6F 7A AA C0‬\n  </code>\n  . The last bits to finish up the last octet are assumed to be logic 0's. Maybe this assumption is wrong though.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I decoded the other packets similarly but I won't post all the images.\n </p>\n <p>\n  EDIT: I have since gotten captures of vibrates and zaps where I know the duration is 0.\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Light:\n   <code>\n    0xDE FE DE ED 7F D5 AB\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Beep:\n   <code>\n    0xDF 7E DE ED 7F D6 AB\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Zap:\n   <code>\n    0x‭DF DE DE ED 7F EA AB‬\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Vibrate\n   <code>\n    0x‭DF BE DE ED 7F DA AB\n   </code>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  All the packets except the Light start out with\n  <code>\n   0XDF\n  </code>\n  . The next position (7, F, D, or B) seems to determine stim type. The next 5 are always\n  <code>\n   0xE DE ED\n  </code>\n  so that seems to determine the device ID. All the characters after that are encoding the duration of the zap or buzz and then something to do with a checksum of some sort.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is what I got for the buzz stim in sequential order. After recording each one, I incremented by one and then sent the command again:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    0x‭DF BE DE ED\n   </code>\n   <strong>\n    <code>\n     7F AD 55 80\n    </code>\n   </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    0x‭DF BE DE ED\n   </code>\n   <strong>\n    <code>\n     7F 6D 55 80\n    </code>\n   </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    0x‭DF BE DE ED\n   </code>\n   <strong>\n    <code>\n     7F 56 AA C0\n    </code>\n   </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    0x‭DF BE DE ED\n   </code>\n   <strong>\n    <code>\n     7E ED 55 80\n    </code>\n   </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    0x‭DF BE DE ED\n   </code>\n   <strong>\n    <code>\n     7E D6 AA C0\n    </code>\n   </strong>\n   ...\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  An interesting thing I found is that one of the following patterns are always present but I can't figure out the significance:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    0x__ _B 55 60\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    0x__ _D 55 80\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    0x__ _6 AA C0\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    0x__ _5 AA B0\n   </code>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  EDIT: Another interesting thing to note is that there is never 2 consecutive zeros.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Assuming I haven't made a huge mistake from the beginning (this is my first attempt at reverse engineering something), does anyone see an obvious encoding scheme or checksum that is being used?\n </p>\n <p>\n  My end goal is to code up a new 433MHz transmitter and make it controllable with a yet to be made mobile app.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
