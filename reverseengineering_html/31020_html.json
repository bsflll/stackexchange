    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am currently trying to de-obfuscate a Java program (i.e. find each class name and namespace, each method name and each method parameter name).\nTo do so, I started by using Enigma (the fork from FabricMC).\n </p>\n <p>\n  But I have access to old sources that are\n  <strong>\n   not\n  </strong>\n  obfuscated and I was wondering if I could automatically de-obfuscate the part of my Java program that did not change since then.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Basically, I have:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Version 3 that is non-obfuscated.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Version 6 that is obfuscated.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Version 7 that is obfuscated.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Version 9 that is obfuscated.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  and I want to de-obfuscate automatically as much symbols as possible in Version 9.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Are you aware of any tool that can do this? Currently, I am navigating the unobfuscated files of Version 3 by hand and mapping Version 9 on Enigma by hand too, which is quite a long and tedious process.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note: all the subjects I found during my research were about de-obfuscating without access to any prior, non-obfuscated, sources. I would like to extract the maximum I can from the non-obfuscated sources I obtained.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
