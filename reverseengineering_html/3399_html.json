Many of them describe these conventions on their websites. For example:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/shared/malwarenaming.aspx\">\n    http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/shared/malwarenaming.aspx\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/security_response/virusnaming.jsp\">\n    http://www.symantec.com/security_response/virusnaming.jsp\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"http://www.avira.com/en/support-malware-naming-conventions\">\n    http://www.avira.com/en/support-malware-naming-conventions\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  AV vendors will sometimes try to use the same names as other AV vendors for well-known malware families, but this is not guaranteed and is becoming less and less common. For example, Microsoft, Sophos, CA, and McAfee all refer to the well-known Conficker family as \"Conficker\", but Symantec refers to it as \"Downadup\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  Even when AV vendors agree on a family name, they will hardly ever be in-sync on variant names. So for example, a file detected by Microsoft as Conficker.B might be detected by CA as Conficker.C.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is why whenever you want to refer to a specific malware variant, it's always best to give the detection name\n  <em>\n   and\n  </em>\n  the AV engine name. Or better yet, just give the file hash and let people look it up on a site like VirusTotal.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Generic detections are designed to catch as many malware samples as possible while avoiding false positives. They can be made to trigger packers or obfuscation, unorthodox behaviors etc. While this improves coverage the end result is that you can have multiple, unrelated malware samples detected under the same name. This makes it harder to identify which specific malware you are facing. Microsoft usually does a good job of detecting samples with their specific name so I usually look at their detection name first.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the example you give all the names are generic : Obfuscated_A probably triggers on obfuscated code, WS.Reputation.1 is most likely based on file reputation and Malware-Cryptor.General.2 probably detects a packer.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

For example MyDoom\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Schmugar chose the name after noticing the text \"mydom\" within a line of the program's code. He noted: \"It was evident early on that this would be very big. I thought having 'doom' in the name would be appropriate.\" (Source: Wikipedia)\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  And Flamer had a lot of functions named \"Flame\" in it's program code. \nWhile I was working at an anti-virus company I always had a great fun with the naming practice. The reason for the names is to make sure you are talking about the same malware (md5 hashes talk really difficult). Also to decorate the families (malware that is 'just' a bit different but mainly the same). This is why you get Conficker.A and Conficker.B (like @JasonGeffer said) . The reason Microsoft's B is Sophos A is because Microsoft found a different sample of the family first in its honeypots :)\n </p>\n <p>\n  other websites that might interest you:\n  <a href=\"http://www.caro.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://www.caro.org/\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"http://www.eicar.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://www.eicar.com\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
