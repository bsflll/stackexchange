But why? Of course the computer is executing machine code in the end, not CIL. So what clutters the x86-64 code so much when running a .NET application? Is the general rule to use native debuggers on native code and tools like ILSpy on .NET?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It is a - bytecode - assembly language for a virtual machine which is an abstract stack-based CPU - by abstract I mean not implemented in hardware.\n  \n\n  Therefore, x86 gdb cannot make sense of the .Net bytecode given that all it knows is x86 assembly. \nBut, in general you can easily reverse a bytecode into source code (because the VM states are more deterministic than those of a hardware CPU) or debug it using and .Net virtual machine with debug capabilities (i.e. ILSpy). \nIf you want more info on debuggers/decompilers/... for .Net check out this\n  <a href=\"http://scottge.net/2015/07/16/best-net-decompiler-tools/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   link\n  </a>\n  .\nAlso, if you debug with gdb, you're most likely to be debugging the VM assembly code rather than the .Net bytecode of the application. In other words, what you are seeing is the VM running bytecode, not the bytecode running.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
