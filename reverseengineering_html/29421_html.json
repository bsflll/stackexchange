The RTTI clues say that the game uses directX classes(DxSurface, DxImageBase...) So I think it will help organizing classes from the bottom.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  1-1. For acquiring vtable and struct info of compiled directx class, I planned to compile some sample codes with directx library.\n </p>\n <p>\n  1-2. With compiled PDB symbol, I expect to measure the size of some class, and more precise class information(that the class will implemented into struct and struct_vtbl).\n </p>\n <p>\n  1-3. After successive 1-2, I'll apply this result to original project, reversing the old game.\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Does this plan valid for reversing the game?\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    I did the way mentioned above with libjpeg, but the compiled function call was usercall and the one in the actual game use cdecl call. How can I change calling convention in a whole project?\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It will provide the original naming for the functions it can find.

Even if you do, then you probably want to start building your reversed project from few functions.

I've done the way starting from a few functions(what you suggested). How I felt something's wrong because there were bunches of big class governing the functions. To reverse the project from a function to bunches of class, I'm designing the way to easily reconstruct a class.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
