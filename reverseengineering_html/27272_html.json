Possibly the data initialised is used later on, in\n <code>\n  sub_180005AD0\n </code>\n for example, and since it doesn't contain what the program expects, it crashes. Try to debug the patched version: put a breakpoint at\n <code>\n  1800060EA\n </code>\n and keep pressing\n <code>\n  F8\n </code>\n (step over) until it crashes. You will find the procedure causing error.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
