Microsoft CRT provides\n  <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zb3b443a\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   functions\n   <code>\n    _c_exit\n   </code>\n   and\n   <code>\n    _cexit\n   </code>\n  </a>\n  for such cpurpose, but it seems glibc\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/lattera/glibc/blob/master/stdlib/exit.c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   does not have anything similar\n  </a>\n  . So you may have to simulate calling of the\n  <code>\n   atexit\n  </code>\n  handlers manually to perform cleanup.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
