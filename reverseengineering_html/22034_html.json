It was compiled using Visual C++ 6.0 and uses the Win32 API. I am trying to figure out what happens when I click any particular button in the application. The problem is, whenever I stop execution using a debugger (x32dbg) execution is in a Win32 DLL file, not in an application function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any suggestions on how to tackle this? How do I determine what happens when I click any particular button?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
