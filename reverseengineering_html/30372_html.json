    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm currently reversing a PowerPC Gekko program and saw a\n  <code>\n   bne\n  </code>\n  instruction that branched on the condition register after a\n  <code>\n   rlwinm\n  </code>\n  function. Perfect. That makes sense.\n  <code>\n   bne\n  </code>\n  is checking the third bit of the\n  <code>\n   CR0\n  </code>\n  bit field in the condition register. I assumed checking\n  <code>\n   CR0\n  </code>\n  was default and that made sense.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the next few lines, there was another\n  <code>\n   bne\n  </code>\n  instruction that followed a\n  <code>\n   cmplwi\n  </code>\n  instruction. Cool, I can probably guess that we're branching after the\n  <code>\n   cmplwi\n  </code>\n  (I'm pretty sure this is a loop, probably a for loop). However, my documentation seems to say that\n  <code>\n   cmplwi\n  </code>\n  modifies the\n  <code>\n   CR3\n  </code>\n  bit field in the condition register.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Both instances of\n  <code>\n   bne\n  </code>\n  did not have a\n  <code>\n   CRx\n  </code>\n  argument as I saw in my documentation, so I'm lost as to which bit field it's checking.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Which bit field in the condition register does\n  <code>\n   bne\n  </code>\n  check when the condition register is unspecified?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
