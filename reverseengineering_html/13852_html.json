I suspect the malware either restores\n  <code>\n   MZ\n  </code>\n  before actually running the file, or uses a custom loader (a la RunPE) to map and execute it, and of course the custom loader can be coded to handle the\n  <code>\n   SR\n  </code>\n  signature in addition (or instead of)\n  <code>\n   MZ\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
