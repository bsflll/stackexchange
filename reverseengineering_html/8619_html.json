I've been searching for an easily scriptable way to do this with either gdb, or volatility under Linux, and have found no commands that just do this. The purpose is to parse the results for various corruptions / inadvisable practices.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Do any exist? It seems like something a lot of people might use.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So far I think I would need to chain what I learned from\n  <a href=\"https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/73627/how-to-find-heap-memory-of-a-running-process\">\n   https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/73627/how-to-find-heap-memory-of-a-running-process\n  </a>\n  (using /maps to find the heap address) with either volatility of GDB, but I am very surprised that there isn't a command that does this out of the box.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If this is an issue, append something like\n  <code>\n   break memcpy\ncont\n\n  </code>\n  in front of the dump command. This will still be a problem if, in a multithreaded program, one thread hits\n  <code>\n   memcpy\n  </code>\n  while another does a\n  <code>\n   malloc\n  </code>\n  , and your\n  <code>\n   memcpy\n  </code>\n  might never be called if the compiler inlines it everywhere, so you might need to get quite fancy here to get a good result.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
