It is simply the compiler's view on what the code meant, and the compiler will optimize away most of the readability. :P\n </p>\n <p>\n  Take that \"decompiled\" function, and first off, let's turn it into compilable C.\nFor the most part, that just means stripping off the\n  <code>\n   @<register>\n  </code>\n  stuff from the function and parameter names. We don't care about registers any more. That's the compiler's job. :P\n </p>\n <pre><code>int sub_10001000(unsigned int a1, int a2)\n{\n  unsigned __int16 v2;\n  unsigned int v3;\n\n  v2 = (unsigned __int8)a1;\n  v3 = a1 >> 8;\n\n  return *(_DWORD *)(a2 + 4 * v2 + 3144)\n  + (*(_DWORD *)(a2 + 4 * (unsigned __int8)v3 + 2120) ^ (*(_DWORD *)(a2 \n  + 4 * BYTE1(v3) + 1096) + *(_DWORD *)(a2 + 4 * ((unsigned __int16)(v3 \n  >> 8) >> 8) + 72)));\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now...see all that\n  <code>\n   *(_DWORD *)\n  </code>\n  stuff? It happens every time we use\n  <code>\n   a2\n  </code>\n  . That hints that\n  <code>\n   a2\n  </code>\n  should be a\n  <code>\n   _DWORD *\n  </code>\n  . Note that when we do that, C will change what\n  <code>\n   a2 + (whatever)\n  </code>\n  means. (It'll add (whatever) * the size of a\n  <code>\n   _DWORD\n  </code>\n  , which is almost certainly 4.) We also have to adjust the stuff inside so that instead of adding 4 * X, we simply add X.\n </p>\n <pre><code>int sub_10001000(unsigned int a1, _DWORD * a2)\n{\n  unsigned __int16 v2;\n  unsigned int v3;\n\n  v2 = (unsigned __int8)a1;\n  v3 = a1 >> 8;\n\n  // 786 = 3144/4, 530 = 2120/4, 274 = 1096/4, 18 = 72/4\n  return *(a2 + v2 + 786) \n  + (*(a2 + (unsigned __int8)v3 + 530) ^ (*(a2\n  + BYTE1(v3) + 274) + *(a2 + ((unsigned __int16)(v3\n  >> 8) >> 8) + 18)));\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now, look at the things we're doing with\n  <code>\n   v2\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   v3\n  </code>\n  . Converting them to 8-bit unsigned integers, shifting them by 8...taking \"byte 1\"...etc. And it's all based on\n  <code>\n   a1\n  </code>\n  . Basically, this code is treating\n  <code>\n   a1\n  </code>\n  not as one 32-bit integer, but as\n  <em>\n   four 8-bit integers\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    v2\n   </code>\n   is\n   <code>\n    a1\n   </code>\n   converted to an unsigned byte. The effect that\n   <code>\n    v2\n   </code>\n   is the least significant, ie: first, byte of\n   <code>\n    a1\n   </code>\n   .\n   <code>\n    v3\n   </code>\n   is the remaining three bytes.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    (unsigned __int8)v3\n   </code>\n   is the first byte of\n   <code>\n    v3\n   </code>\n   , making it the second byte of\n   <code>\n    a1\n   </code>\n   .\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    BYTE1(v3)\n   </code>\n   uses a function/macro/whatever that is apparently built into IDA. It represents the second byte of\n   <code>\n    v3\n   </code>\n   , and the third byte of\n   <code>\n    a1\n   </code>\n   .\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    ((unsigned __int16)(v3 >> 8) >> 8)\n   </code>\n   contains an unnecessary cast, a side effect of decompilation. (\n   <code>\n    v3\n   </code>\n   is a 24-bit quantity in a 32-bit package, but the decompiler wasn't smart enough to remember that. So it added the cast in order to lop off the high byte, which is already provably zero.) It is equal to\n   <code>\n    v3 >> 16\n   </code>\n   , which is equivalent to\n   <code>\n    a1 >> 24\n   </code>\n   , and thus to the fourth byte of\n   <code>\n    a1\n   </code>\n   .\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Let's add that observation to the code.\n </p>\n <pre><code>int sub_10001000(unsigned int a1, _DWORD * a2)\n{\n  unsigned __int16 v2;\n  unsigned int v3;\n  unsigned __int8 b0, b1, b2, b3;\n\n  v2 = (unsigned __int8)a1;\n  v3 = a1 >> 8;\n\n  b0 = v2;\n  b1 = (unsigned __int8) v3;\n  b2 = (unsigned __int8) (a1 >> 16);\n  b3 = (unsigned __int8) (a1 >> 24);\n\n  return *(a2 + b0 + 786) + (*(a2 + b1 + 530) ^ (*(a2 + b2 + 274) + *(a2 + b3 + 18)));\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  C says that\n  <code>\n   *(pointer + offset)\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   pointer[offset]\n  </code>\n  are equivalent. Let's see if this increases readability any.\n </p>\n <pre><code>int sub_10001000(unsigned int a1, _DWORD * a2)\n{\n  unsigned __int16 v2;\n  unsigned int v3;\n  unsigned __int8 b0, b1, b2, b3;\n\n  v2 = (unsigned __int8)a1;\n  v3 = a1 >> 8;\n\n  b0 = v2;\n  b1 = (unsigned __int8) v3;\n  b2 = (unsigned __int8) (a1 >> 16);\n  b3 = (unsigned __int8) (a1 >> 24);\n\n  return a2[b0 + 786] + (a2[b1 + 530] ^ (a2[b2 + 274] + a2[b3 + 18]));\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So the formula even fits on one line now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, since we no longer use\n  <code>\n   v2\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   v3\n  </code>\n  in the function (aside from calculating the byte values, and we can do that ourselves), we can get rid of them.\n </p>\n <pre><code>int sub_10001000(unsigned int a1, _DWORD * a2)\n{\n  unsigned __int8 b0, b1, b2, b3;\n\n  b0 = a1;\n  b1 = a1 >> 8;\n  b2 = a1 >> 16;\n  b3 = a1 >> 24;\n\n  return a2[b0 + 786] + (a2[b1 + 530] ^ (a2[b2 + 274] + a2[b3 + 18]));\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  C has an 8-bit-integer type:\n  <code>\n   uint8_t\n  </code>\n  . And every modern C compiler knows about it. So we can get rid of these compiler-specific names.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, since C99, we can declare a variable where it's first initialized.\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <stdint.h>\n\nint sub_10001000(unsigned int a1, _DWORD * a2)\n{\n  uint8_t b0 = a1;\n  uint8_t b1 = a1 >> 8;\n  uint8_t b2 = a1 >> 16;\n  uint8_t b3 = a1 >> 24;\n\n  return a2[b0 + 786] + (a2[b1 + 530] ^ (a2[b2 + 274] + a2[b3 + 18]));\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Notice now, also...when you put the numbers in order, any two adjacent numbers will have the same difference between them (256). And the first value is not at\n  <code>\n   0\n  </code>\n  , but at\n  <code>\n   18\n  </code>\n  . Looks like\n  <code>\n   a2\n  </code>\n  is actually being treated as a pointer to a struct that looks somewhat like this (as far as we can see)...\n </p>\n <pre><code>struct example {\n    DWORD unknown[18];\n    DWORD w[256];\n    DWORD x[256];\n    DWORD y[256];\n    DWORD z[256];\n};\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  which would be used like...\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <stdint.h>\n\nint sub_10001000(unsigned int a1, struct example *ex)\n{\n    uint8_t b0 = a1;\n    uint8_t b1 = a1 >> 8;\n    uint8_t b2 = a1 >> 16;\n    uint8_t b3 = a1 >> 24;\n\n    return ex->z[b0] + (ex->y[b1] ^ (ex->x[b2] + ex->w[b3]));\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But we can't know much more from this code alone -- including what the function is supposed to do -- so it's impossible to come up with much more meaningful names. The rest of the code should help with that.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
