However, when you'll do that, the rest of the malware's code will execute from within the unhandled exception function and you'll lose control of the debugged program. To make sure you're still controlling the execution flow, you should place a breakpoint at the function passed as an argument to\n  <code>\n   setunhandledexceptionfilter\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Some context and background\n </h2>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   setunhandledexceptionfilter\n  </code>\n  is used to set a user provided function as the function called when exception was not handled by any exception handler, just before the process is terminated. That function should be in charge of object cleanups and clean termination in the case of an unhandled exception.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There are several ways to use\n  <code>\n   setunhandledexceptionfilter\n  </code>\n  as an anti-debugging trick, but most will involve implementing a crucial part of the program inside the new unhandled exception handler, and then resume the rest of the code execution from within the exception handler.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you don't mind, pls give me the step by step explanation for handling the setunhandledexceptionfilter(). It will be very useful for me.
