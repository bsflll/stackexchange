Although ELF is a well defined executable format, its seems IDA tries to disassemble the file as\n  <em>\n   RAW\n  </em>\n  . This means it doesn't parse the file format and can not tell apart code from data.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you are utilizing IDAs free version, this is most likely due to the problem that is does not include arm support.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YJUfY.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YJUfY.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, you could use other tools, such as objdump, radare2 or even online services like\n  <a href=\"https://onlinedisassembler.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   onlinedisassembler.com\n  </a>\n  for free.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
