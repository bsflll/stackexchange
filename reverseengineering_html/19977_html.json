The default port is 23946.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This works alright.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, if I already have a process running on the Linux Machine with PID: 400. How can I attach Remote Linux debugger to this already running process?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can see that linux_server provides only the following options:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ ./linux_server --help\n  -i...  IP address to bind to (default to any)\n  -v     verbose\n  -p...  port number\n  -P...  password\n  -k     keep broken connections\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Thanks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
