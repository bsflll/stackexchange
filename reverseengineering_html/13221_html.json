It was a really hard work, but at the moment I can somewhat understand, that which part of the binary is responsible for what. But I'm stuck at the end, and I have no idea how to continue it. This is what I've found out:\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know, that the size of the first image is a 9*3.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is some kind of table at the begining of the file:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0x08 0x08 0x10\n0x08 0x08 0x08\n0x00 0x00 0x00\n0x10 0x10 0x18\n0x18 0x18 0x20\n0x10 0x14 0x18\n0x08 0x08 0x10\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And this is the image data:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0x09 0x00 0x03 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x00\n0x0c 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01 0x03 0x09 0x01 0x01 0x02 0x11 0x01 0x01 0x02 0x02\n0x01 0x0f 0x0f 0x03 0x0a 0x03 0x08 0x05 0x08 0x04 0x08 0x03 0x09 0x00 0x09 0x00\n0x0c 0x00 0x02\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The number of elements in the table can be divided by three, so I think it is some kind of RRGGBB palette.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But I have no idea, how to decode the imagedata. It's size is not 9*3, so It may be compressed. It is a really small image, and I think that this is why the compression made the binary bigger than it was before.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Edit:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've uploaded this file here:\n  <a href=\"https://ulozto.net/!Rku8rxNXT/2npflecb3-drk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Download file\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've colored it, to better understand it's structure.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first part of the file:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nKsPT.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"hex1\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nKsPT.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The red section is just some kind of file signature.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The brown part is the file length in bytes.

I implemented the algorithm in JS, and the source code is available here:\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/K-Adam/DrekDecoder\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/K-Adam/DrekDecoder\n  </a>\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Summary\n </h2>\n <p>\n  Each line starts with a flag byte. It tells the decoder how many pixels to write and which mode to use. There are three possible write modes:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Opaque\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Transparent\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Skip\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  In opaque mode each pixel is represented by one byte, which references an RGB color in the palette. In transparent mode, the pixels are pairs of bytes: [Alpha, ColorIndex]\n </p>\n <p>\n  After each sequence a control byte follows. Its structure is different from the flag byte, and also different in each writing mode. This control byte will tell how many pixels to write and which mode to use next, or if the end of the line is reached.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Details\n </h2>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Flag byte\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  If the flag is zero\n  <code>\n   (flag == 0x0)\n  </code>\n  , then the line is empty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If the LSB is set\n  <code>\n   (flag & 0b1)\n  </code>\n  then there is an offset at the beginning of the line, and the decoder will start in\n  <em>\n   Skip\n  </em>\n  mode. The rest of the bits will represent the length of the offset\n  <code>\n   (flag >> 1) + 1\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  If the second bit is set then transparent, otherwise opaque mode will be used:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mode = (flag & 0b10) ? Transparent : Opaque\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The number of pixels can be found in the 5 MSB\n  <code>\n   (flag >> 3) + 1\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Skip mode\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The decoder will simply write\n  <code>\n   n\n  </code>\n  empty pixels to the output. The next byte will be a control byte.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If LSB is set, then the decoder will switch to transarent mode. The other 7 bits represent the number of transparent pixels.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If the three LSB is\n  <code>\n   0b100\n  </code>\n  then the decoder will continue in\n  <em>\n   Skip\n  </em>\n  mode, otherwise it will change to\n  <em>\n   Opaque\n  </em>\n  mode. The other bits represent the number of pixels\n  <code>\n   (vv >> 3) + 1\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Opaque mode\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Each data byte references an RGB color in the palette.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If the LSB is set, then the decoder will switch to transparent mode for\n  <code>\n   (v1 >> 1) + 1\n  </code>\n  pixels. Otherwise the three LSB of the control byte is the flag:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   0b000 End of line\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   0b110 Continue in opaque mode\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   0b100 Switch to skip mode\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  The rest is the number of pixels\n  <code>\n   (v1 >> 3) + 1\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Transparent mode\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The transparent blocks are represented by sequence of pairs: [Alpha, Color]. The 5 MSB of the alpha byte is the transparency (0-32). The color byte references an RGB color in the palette.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The two LSB of the control byte is a flag:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   0b10 End of the line\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   0b11 Switch to opaque mode\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   0b01 Switch to skip mode\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   0b00 Continue in transparent mode\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  The rest of the bits is the number of pixels\n  <code>\n   (v1 >> 2) + 1\n  </code>\n  , except for transparent mode, where it is\n  <code>\n   (v1 >> 3) + 1\n  </code>\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Decoding process\n </h2>\n <p>\n  Since the colors are referenced by index, two bytes are needed to represent a transparent pixel. By looking at the bottom-left part of the mountain, it was clear from those alternating patterns, that it has to be transparent there. The colors around the round icons were also not right, so I suspected that the outer pixels are half transparent as well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the large image\n  <code>\n   0xFE\n  </code>\n  appears after each 32 bytes. It does not reference a color from the palette, so it has to be some kind of control byte.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then I started to write down the bytes in binary, where the color seemed not right. I grouped these values by where by where they appear, and then I spotted, that the least significant bits are similar on the boundary of transparent and opaque regions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After further analysis, when I was able to decode the smaller icons by hand, I implemented the algorithm, and tested it for larger ones. From there, it was easy to eliminate the remaining anomalies in the result.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Latter I deduced it is not color at all and does not belong to palette data but to header data.

Possibly some post processing or lighting was applied to it or there is some mistake in the decoding. It is hard to decide as I have no access to the original App and or knowledge of its inner workings. You should check more Images to see if there are some artifacts or not. The small images are unusable as you do not know the content and also the size is small for any significant details to reveal ...\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     Transparent images\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Well\n    <strong>\n     Iter Ator\n    </strong>\n    spotted that some files are not decoded properly and deduced that it has something to do with transparency (as the images was icons and later also sprites). So some more in depth analysis was take in place to make some progress.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    After some thinking and looping in circles I create special debug views so I can see encoded image data , reference screenshot and the corresponding palette colors in some convenient way to spot patterns or dependency.

Then I painfully cross-reference both\n    <strong>\n     ScanLines\n    </strong>\n    in Paint and after comparing all the icons I got start deducing encoding format. The gaps means some kind of flag or prefix, sequence or special command. After implementing these rules into decoder then suddenly the images got looking much better.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I got in a state where all the icons I got was pixel perfect but after more images came in (sprites) it was obvious that some codes may be variable and more in depth analysis of the chunks in file is needed to search for some code table or dictionary.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To help with the analysis I rewrite the decoder debug view to separate class with capability to recognize perfect color match (square) and close color match (circle) to better asses the codes on non transparent pixels first.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/trIRs.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     <img alt=\"better debug view\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/trIRs.png\"/>\n    </a>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    I started with rules like this:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    From it I deduced this (not fully OK see the code for actual state):\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    first 2 Bytes are flags\n03 unknonw flag/command skip flag can follow!\n   </p>\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     <p>\n      also end sequence 23 (flag and pixel follows as 01)\n02 end of scanline\n01 flag and pixel follows, end of sequence (if not in first 5 pixels)\nstart of sequence:  13,17,23,27,2B\npixel follows:      0D,0F,12,15,16,18,1A,1C,1D,1E\nflag or pixel follows:  06,07,0C,0E?,10\n     </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     <p>\n      sequence can not start as first pixel otherwise it is pixel\n     </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     sequence can stop after 5 pixels already done else 01/03 is just pixel\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n   <p>\n    I improved it much more later directly in the decoder\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     ScanLine offsets\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    As I find out if the first BYTE of\n    <strong>\n     ScanLine\n    </strong>\n    was used as offset for transparent images some of the images looks much better.\n    <strong>\n     Ite Ator\n    </strong>\n    found out that it is the offset and LSB bit is switch of this capability. I found out that  if the first BYTE of first\n    <strong>\n     ScanLine\n    </strong>\n    is\n    <code>\n     0xFC\n    </code>\n    then it is not transparent image and the decoding is described in first bullets. I introduced\n    <code>\n     mode 0/1\n    </code>\n    variable to recognize this in the decoder. And The offset is active only in mode 1 (transparency). Also I found out that the\n    <code>\n     offset=(flag>>1)+1\n    </code>\n    as it makes more sense from encoding efficiency side (test confirms it was correct assumption).\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     File chunks\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In search for missing code table or dictionary I started to dissect the file-format (each BYTE that is not used yet). After some coding and analysis I added another debug output to decoder that creates text for each file/frame in aligned form so I can easily compare between all the images I got as comparing in two ro more hex-views is not very convenient.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Here the header data:\n   </p>\n   <pre><code>file                          K  E  R  D              file_size        frames image_ofs

If you need help with the meaning of the gfx code see:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/21699076/2521214\">\n    gfx rendering in C++\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Also File access functions may have a bit different name. I commented the code a bit but it should be obvious anyway. At least for those that already did things like this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The defines just switch between debug and normal decoding. If not present then you do not need the debug image class\n  <code>\n   img\n  </code>\n  at all. To keep this simple and also in 30KB limit I removed the code for the debug draw class (those who want/need it look in the edit history). That means ignoring all the\n  <code>\n   _debug_draw\n  </code>\n  defines ...\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now the icons defined pixels are decoded correctly. But I did a lot of assumptions and may not work on all images. I would need more examples with ScreenShots to make it more robust. The codes itself should encode alpha channel and may be also position/offset.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I changed few codes and now I am temporarily ignoring the\n  <code>\n   0x02\n  </code>\n  end of\n  <code>\n   ScanLine\n  </code>\n  which make mess when not properly decoded codes are present. Also I added few special cases I found out. The x-offset for mode1 is also present.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the code find line:\n </p>\n <pre><code>// image data (decoded)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  That is where main decoding is. The decoding variables are:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    _pixel\n   </code>\n   - next\n   <code>\n    BYTE\n   </code>\n   is pixel\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    _sequence\n   </code>\n   - sequence of pixels follows (ending by\n   <code>\n    0x01\n   </code>\n   or\n   <code>\n    0x03\n   </code>\n   if more then 5 pixels rendered)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    _stop\n   </code>\n   - end of scanline marked by\n   <code>\n    0x02\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    seq\n   </code>\n   - just counter of how many pixels in sequence has been processed\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  In comments some of the codes are marked\n  <code>\n   // OK\n  </code>\n  those are not conflicting and straightforward. The rest of comments means what codes are following:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    pXX\n   </code>\n   means pixel\n   <code>\n    0xXX\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    cXX\n   </code>\n   means code\n   <code>\n    0xXX\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    ?XX\n   </code>\n   means not sure if pixel or code\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    ?pXX\n   </code>\n   means most likely pixel\n   <code>\n    0xXX\n   </code>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  The Transparent ScanLine data starts after first BYTE so do not skip 2 BYTEs just one !!!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here some previews:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HR8Q6.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"new previews\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HR8Q6.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  And the Dragon frames:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Xskyl.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"dragon frames\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Xskyl.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   The C++ source for the decoder:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <pre><code>#ifdef _debug_save\nAnsiString dbg_hdr=\"file                          K  E  R  D              file_size        frames image_ofs                                                                                                                                                                                                   palette_ofs used_colors\\r\n\";\nAnsiString dbg_img=\"                                                                        frame sz          xs          ys                                                                                                                                                                                                                      xs    ys                \\r\n\";\n#endif\nvoid load_drk(Graphics::TBitmap *bmp,AnsiString name)\n    {\n    AnsiString s,fnam;\n    fnam=name.SubString(1,name.Length()-4);\n\n    // variables\n    BYTE *dat;\n    int hnd,adr,adr0,siz;\n    int i,x,y,xs,ys,sz,mode,frame,frames;\n    DWORD *p,*dir,pal[256],r,g,b,a;\n    // allow direct pixel access\n    bmp->HandleType=bmDIB;\n    bmp->PixelFormat=pf32bit;\n    // read file into memory\n    hnd=FileOpen(name,fmOpenRead);\n    if (hnd<0) return;\n    siz=FileSeek(hnd,0,2);\n        FileSeek(hnd,0,0);\n    dat=new BYTE[siz];\n    if (dat==NULL) { FileClose(hnd);
