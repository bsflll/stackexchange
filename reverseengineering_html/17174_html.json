If the first time you run IDA is with the\n    <code>\n     -S\n    </code>\n    flag, IDA will hang on that screen and you'll need to manually accept it (either in that execution or a previous one). You could also work around it by manually creating the marker IDA uses, but i'll let you figure that out yourself.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    While running, IDA pops up multiple other dialogs you'll need to accept, answer and approve (the disassemble a new file, one loading symbols, etc...) those may be automatically dismissed by providing the\n    <code>\n     -A\n    </code>\n    flag (A stands for autonomous). This won't avoid the license agreement mentioned in the previous paragraph, and will even make it hidden and harder to accept.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Your script may no be behaving with IDA. This basically means that IDA is designed as an interactive tool and not a command line tool, and one side-effect of that is that it will not automatically perform a peaceful exit once the executed script is done. You'll have to call\n    <code>\n     idc.Exit(exitcode)\n    </code>\n    when your script finished, or otherwise it'll just hang in there forever. You may also want to consider calling AutoWait()` at the beginning of your script.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  P.S.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You may want to consider the\n  <code>\n   -A\n  </code>\n  and/or\n  <code>\n   -c\n  </code>\n  (and there's a small chance you'll want to look at\n  <code>\n   -a\n  </code>\n  as well) flags instead of the\n  <code>\n   -t\n  </code>\n  one (which I don't think will do what you desire).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
