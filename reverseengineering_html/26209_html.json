        {
            "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  In your screenshot, you can see a thin strip of gray between the title of the window (\n  <code>\n   Functions window\n  </code>\n  ) and the column headers (e.g.\n  <code>\n   Function name\n  </code>\n  ). If you hover your mouse in that gray area, it will expand and the title text (\n  <code>\n   Functions window\n  </code>\n  ) will appear again, as in the following screenshot:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Cy2K4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"mouseover on the gray area beneath the title\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Cy2K4.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once that happens, hold down the left click button and move the window. You will see a number of icons appear around the edges, and in the center of the IDA window, as follows:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4ChPt.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"after clicking/dragging the gray area\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4ChPt.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Your first option is to ignore those icons, and drag the window into the area with the tabbed window names (e.g\n  <code>\n   IDA View-A\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   Pseudocode-A\n  </code>\n  , etc). The window will become an ordinary tab again. This is probably what you want.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Alternatively, you can drag your mouse onto one of the aforementioned icons to get a split-screen view. I recommend playing with them to get an intuitive feel for what the icons do, but here's a textual description:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Leftmost/center-left icon : the current tab will now be split into two panes, with the one you dragged in on the left, and the active one on the right\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Rightmost/center-right icon: ditto, except the one you dragged will be on the right\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Topmost/center-top icon: the screen is split into two panes; the existing tabs will be in the bottom pane, and the current window will be in the top pane by itself\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Bottommost/center-bottom icon: ditto, except the one you dragged will be at the bottom\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
