    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I compiled the following C++ code with\n  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinGW\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   MinGW\n  </a>\n  and opened it in OllyDbg 2.01. And the program stops at the following lines:\n </p>\n <pre><code>CPU Disasm\nAddress   Hex dump          Command                                  Comments\n00401570  /$  83EC 1C       SUB ESP,1C\n00401573  |.

Likely this is because you confuse the executable's entry point address (where Olly breaks) with the address of your\n  <code>\n   main()\n  </code>\n  function (where you expect it to break). You should locate your\n  <code>\n   main()\n  </code>\n  and set a breakpoint there manually instead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is a lot going on behind the scene before execution flow reaches\n  <code>\n   main()\n  </code>\n  . The code that gets control first is hidden within the C Run-Time (CRT) library provided by your compiler and is linked in automatically when you link your executable. This code (aptly named CRT startup) is responsible for setting up various things when a C program starts up, mainly, initializes all the internals of the C runtime (there is a lot of other stuff which I won't mention here), performs C++ static objects' constructor calls, and at the end calls your\n  <code>\n   main()\n  </code>\n  . So to get things going, the linker sets up the entry point to inside this startup machinery, which is exactly what we observe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note: It is possible to strip all the CRT stuff from your executable at the expense of not having the C runtime library linked. Not sure whether this is what you would like to have.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
