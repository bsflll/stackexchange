I am using apktool. \nI get many errors and but i get thw files. But then many of its smali files doesnt have a .end method in its code which makes a recompile impossible.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can someone help me or decompile it?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Its this file\n  <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/05kj2x4zie734b9/com.asobimo.iruna_en-1.apk?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   https://www.dropbox.com/s/05kj2x4zie734b9/com.asobimo.iruna_en-1.apk?dl=0\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks in advance\n </p>\n <p>\n  //Edit: I figured out why it didnt work as I wanted to. The game has some kind of protection in apk since this year. So I used an older version of apk from 2014, and edited its files and set its version to actual version with APK Edit v0.4. Then save new apk and im fine =)\nThanks though for you help\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Among other things, there's a lot of things you can do in bytecode that don't correspond to Java language features, and even in the ideal case, it is hard to restructure certain complex code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Decompilation is useful for understanding code, but if you want to edit it, you need to learn how to patch things at the bytecode level. The easiest way to do this for APKs is using baksmali.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Running baksmali gives you a directory with a smali file for each class in the dex file. You can then edit the smali to make the changes you want, and run smali to reassemble everything into a new dex file. Then of course you have to add your\n  <code>\n   classes.dex\n  </code>\n  back into the apk, then sign and format it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
