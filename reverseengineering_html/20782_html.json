To calculate where the execution continues, I have to get the location of\n  <code>\n   pop edi\n  </code>\n  (00002504), undefine everything after\n  <code>\n   pop edi\n  </code>\n  , and redefine as code at the location of\n  <code>\n   pop edi\n  </code>\n  + 5 (00002509) , or at least that's what I understood from searching here.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, the problem is that when I undefine everything after\n  <code>\n   pop edi\n  </code>\n  , IDA freaks out and does not undefine anything.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With the experience I have, when doing this I noticed that all the instructions after the undefine are well, undefined.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This does not happen. Here are some pictures to show this:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LwlHi.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LwlHi.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  After undefining:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Jfi1d.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"After undefine\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Jfi1d.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  What is happening here?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Check the NASM documentation *NASM supports two special tokens in expressions, allowing calculations to involve the current assembly position: the $ and $$ tokens. $ evaluates to the assembly position at the beginning of the line containing the expression; so you can code an infinite loop using JMP $. * This trick is used to get the current address of the code, e.g.: relocatable code.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

            "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <pre><code>call $+5\npop edi\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This code basically retrieves the address of the\n  <code>\n   pop edi\n  </code>\n  instruction into edi. The reason why this works is simple.\n  <code>\n   call\n  </code>\n  does two things:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   push the\n   <em>\n    next instruction's\n   </em>\n   address onto the stack\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   jump to the address given in its operand\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  But\n  <code>\n   $+5\n  </code>\n  just means \"current position + 5\" and the length of this call instruction is 5 bytes, so it jumps to\n  <code>\n   pop edi\n  </code>\n  after pushing the\n  <em>\n   address\n  </em>\n  of\n  <code>\n   pop edi\n  </code>\n  on the stack. And then\n  <code>\n   pop edi\n  </code>\n  fetches that address from the stack into edi.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And why would you do that? Because sometimes you don't know where your code is located but need to supply an absolute address to someone. If you write code you can easily tell relative offsets, say that a string is 500 byte from the start of your code block. To get an absolute address you then use the\n  <code>\n   call pop\n  </code>\n  trick to get some anchor point and then can add whatever offset to it to turn it into an absolute address without having to know the code's location at runtime.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
