Maybe I'm not understanding something correctly, but I dont see a way to determine which type an instruction is using from looking at the machine code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does it even matter on the CPU level, and is just a feature to make the assembly programmer's life easier? Since for example LDMFD and LDMIA are equivalent operations (I think?).\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/m0ttK.jpg\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/blkgF.jpg\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RiN8J.jpg\"/>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
