The auto analysis did a great job and the code is readable but I have 1 snag with the address offsets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Currently a large part of the code uses a static address offset which are set into [a0]. I know this to be a value of 0xd0008000 and it never changes but can't figure out a way of forcing this during the analysis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, the code will load an address register like this:\n[a0]0x50f0\nI know this should should be 0xd000d0f0 but the auto analysis will just show [a0]0x50f0.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can force each reference on a local basis by hitting Ctrl+R and manually adding the offset but I'm interested to know what the correct method is.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks,\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dave\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
