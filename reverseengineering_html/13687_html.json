    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I need to debug .so of my.apk, I'm working on a phone with android 5.0, using ida 6.8's android_server. It seems ok for attaching ida to the process, but when clicking something on the apk there is message box that shows an exception(see the image), and breaks at this line:\n </p>\n <pre><code>system@framework@boot.oat:7314709E DCB    8\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And the 'call stack' window is empty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/p55Ot.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"boot.oat exception\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/p55Ot.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The problem happens with android 5.x + ida 6.8,  or android 7.0 + ida 6.8\nbut it works fine on android 4.x + ida 6.5\n </p>\n <p>\n  But I tried another apk, there is no such problem.\nAny idea?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Update 1\n  </strong>\n  According to comments from @ws, it's something wrong with segment type: ARM(0) and THUMB(1), here's what I tried:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Press Alt+G at that line, a window popups and shows the segment register value is 1, I modified it to 0, run.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Then it breaks at another place with same exception. I did that again.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Then it goes to boot.oat, but this time is different. Even after modified it to 0(ARM), it breaks at this line about 6~7 times\n   <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YpvZW.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YpvZW.png\"/>\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   And finally it breaks at some random code with same exception, such as memset in the image below. Then program crashes if continue run.\n   <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GZlUd.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GZlUd.png\"/>\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
