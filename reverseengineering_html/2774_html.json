It compares the content of the accumulator (\n  <code>\n   AL\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   AX\n  </code>\n  , or\n  <code>\n   EAX\n  </code>\n  ) against the current value pointed at by\n  <code>\n   ES:[EDI]\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  When used together with the\n  <code>\n   REPNE\n  </code>\n  prefix (\n  <em>\n   REPeat while Not Equal\n  </em>\n  ),\n  <code>\n   SCAS\n  </code>\n  scans the string searching for the first string element which is equal to the value in the accumulator.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Intel manual (Vol. 1, p.231) says:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   The SCAS instruction subtracts the destination string element from the contents of the EAX, AX, or AL register (depending on operand length) and updates the status flags according to the results. The string element and register contents are not modified. The following “short forms” of the SCAS instruction specify the operand length: SCASB (scan byte string), SCASW (scan word string), and SCASD (scan doubleword string).\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  So, basically, this instruction scan a string and look for the same character than the one stored in\n  <code>\n   EAX\n  </code>\n  . It won't touch any registers other than ECX (counter) and EDI (address) but the status flags according to the results.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
