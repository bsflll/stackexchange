This kind of code-relict often results from a function that's present in source code, but doesn't ever get called*, so IDA didn't assign a name to it. If this is the case, you:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   generally don't want to include the function in your analysis, because the program never uses it anyways\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   can search for a longer sequence of functions that are unused**, which might identify whole source files that got linked in accidentially but aren't used in the program\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   can use the space of these functions for code caves that \"enhance\" the program's functionality; for example, i sometimes use them for a sequence of open/write/close calls that log some intermediate values.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  You sabotage this by making unused functions real functions, which may or may not be important to your use case.\n </p>\n <p>\n  (*) However, the function might be a class method, which is referenced from the vtable, but never called directly, which misleads IDA\n </p>\n <p>\n  (**) If you have two functions\n  <code>\n   a\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   b\n  </code>\n  , both of which get never called from the outside, but\n  <code>\n   a\n  </code>\n  calls\n  <code>\n   b\n  </code>\n  , IDA will still give\n  <code>\n   b\n  </code>\n  a\n  <code>\n   sub_\n  </code>\n  name, which interferes with identifying unused functions\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I mean, it does not change any instructions, symbols, variables, etc. It shouldn't change any xrefs either and thus shouldn't have any effects on a static control flow analysis, right? Or am I missing something?</span>",

Defining this code as a function may insert it to auto-analysis queue and all incorrectly defined references from this mistakenly recognized code may break another functions. This problem also occurs when working with obfuscated code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unfortunately as @Guntram Blohm said, the functions that called indirectly might be not recognized as such, so the solution for this problem is still needed. I'd suggest a bit better algorithm for creating such functions:\nDon't convert each instruction to function automatically.\nFind all function prologues instead (for example something like 2 pushes in the functions on your picture), and try to create a function where you can recognize this prologue only.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It can be done with IDAPython by using function\n  <code>\n   idc.MakeFunction(prologue_address)\n  </code>\n  without second parameter. In such case IDA will try to define function borders automatically.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
