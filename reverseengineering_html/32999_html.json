    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  First, sorry for my bad english.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have some program that heavely virtualized and doing dll injection behavior.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The target process is x86 process and execute in wow64 system.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I saw the target process's dump after dll has been injected, the dll is allocated after 0x7fffffff address. (PE Header seems deleted)\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fuQrfu6t.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fuQrfu6t.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, I used APIMonitor tool and hook several suspicious API, the program just call VirtualAlloc API and address beyond 0x7fffffff was given by it's parameter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3K9uocnl.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3K9uocnl.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I heard the address after 0x7fffffff in x86 process is used by kernel. So, I think just using VirtualAlloc API to allocate after 0x7fffffff will not be succeed, even if program execute on wow64 system.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And, I just make program that using VirtualAlloc API with higher address and test it, the allocation failed with ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS(0x1E7)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there any way that allocate address after 0x7fffffff in x86 process using VirtualAlloc API?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I hope for your guide. thank you.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
