For example, if you have a function that implements the\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Encryption_Algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   TEA algorithm\n  </a>\n  , scanning the disassembled file for\n  <code>\n   9e3779b9\n  </code>\n  could help you. (There's a tool named signsrch that does this for many well-known encryption and checksum variants). Or, if you know the function uses a certain string, search for this string, then check where it's cross referenced.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You might be even lucky enough that the programmer used an\n  <code>\n   assert\n  </code>\n  (or similar) macro. Depending on the Compiler, this often translates to a\n  <code>\n   printf\n  </code>\n  which includes\n  <code>\n   __FUNC__\n  </code>\n  which in turn is replaced with the function name, so an assert macro will most likely put the function name as a string, along with a cross reference from your function, into your binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once you have a string that you know belongs to your function, use\n  <code>\n   CTRL-R\n  </code>\n  on it to find where it's referenced in code (\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24554127/ollydbg-2-01-finding-a-command-referencing-a-static-string\">\n   longer explanation on stackoverflow\n  </a>\n  ).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
