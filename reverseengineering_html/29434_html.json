You will have to make your own transformers (either by yourself or utilizing work already done by one of these apps). It looks like the intent is to decode the values by calling that String function with two int parameters. Shouldn't be too hard to extract parameters from the bytecode and invoke the method to get back the original strings. Even the TryHackMe page says you need custom tools to finish this...\n</span>\n</body></html>",
