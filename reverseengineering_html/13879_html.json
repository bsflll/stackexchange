What is the best way to convert it to a binary so I can use binwalk?\nSo far I've tried converting it with\n  <code>\n   srec_cat hex.file -Intel -Output binary.file -Binary\n  </code>\n  . I have tried to analyze the converted file with binwalk but the only results I get are:\n </p>\n <pre><code>SHA256 hash constants, little endian\nCertificate in DER format (x509 v3), header length: 4, sequence length: 678\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Am I doing something wrong?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit: after using\n  <code>\n   binwalk -Ive binary.file\n  </code>\n  I managed to extract some files. The files are not detected correctly but when I look at the files I see bits of text used on my device.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit 2: I don't think the firmware is compressed. But I'm not sure if it's encrypted. What's the best way to check this?\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ file binary.file\nbinary.file: data\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Using\n  <code>\n   strings -n 10 binary.file\n  </code>\n  I get a seemingly valid list of strings.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
