    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am trying to reverse a portion of a game, that game loads a DLL file called \"ddraw.dll\".\nMost of the DLL file functions don't appear by their names but appear by their addresses\n </p>\n <p>\n  for example:\n </p>\n <pre><code>; The function address '67415A6A' but no name\nddraw.67415A6A\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So, I have known that can download the PDB symbols file for the \"ddraw.dll\" file to make all their functions appear by their names instead of their addresses.\n  \n\n  And that is what I did, I have downloaded the symbols for \"ddraw.dll\" using the command\n  <code>\n   symdownload/downloadsym\n  </code>\n  and download it to the path \"x64dbg\\x32\\symbols\", then I reopen the debugger again to see what happened but nothing happened, all functions still appear by their addresses.\n  \n\n  I tried to use\n  <code>\n   symload/loadsym\n  </code>\n  command to load \"ddraw.dll\" symbols but it always gives me \"invalid module\" although, I have written the command correctly\n  <code>\n   symload path\\game.exe, path\\symbols\\ddraw.pdb,0 or 1\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   How do I solve that problem?\n  </strong>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
