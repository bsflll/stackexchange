I have been getting the below error while trying to debug. I googled around and found the Microsoft no longer offers symbols exe as downloads and we need to link the MS symbols server in windbg. I tried that route too, but still failed to get rid of this error.\n </p>\n <p>\n  ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.  Defaulted to export symbols for ntdll.dll - \nntdll!DbgBreakPoint\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way I can download the symbols for windows xp sp3 on to my local machine and then run the windbg.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
