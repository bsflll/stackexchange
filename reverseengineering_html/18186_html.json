So, I want to put a breakpoint at that line to step through.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But Immunity says:\n </p>\n <pre><code>No memory on the specified address\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  When I search that specific address. How do I add a breakpoint in immunity to the this line in IDA?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It randomly changes the base address for binaries so people cannot rely on fixed addresses if they try to write an exploit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There are a few ways to disable it, some global, some for specific executables.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The easiest way to disable it for a single executable is opening it in a PE editor and removing/renaming the\n  <code>\n   .reloc\n  </code>\n  section - it is required to move the code around and if it isn't present, the base address from the header will be honored by the loader.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or to disable it for the whole system, use regedit to add this value:\n </p>\n <pre><code>“MoveImages”=dword:00000000\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  under this key:\n </p>\n <pre><code>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Memory Management]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and then reboot.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
