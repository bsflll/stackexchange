Frida is a toolkit\n  for building tools, and even though we provide a few sample tools it\n  should be up to you if you want to have them installed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Up until now this meant anyone building a tool using our Python\n  bindings would end up depending on colorama, prompt-toolkit, and\n  pygments, because our CLI tools happen to depend on those.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Well, that changes now. If you do:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <code>\n    $ pip install frida\n   </code>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   You will now only get our Python bindings. Nothing more. And this\n  package has zero dependencies.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The CLI tools might still be useful to you, though, so to install\n  those do:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <code>\n    $ pip install frida-tools\n   </code>\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
