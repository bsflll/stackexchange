Am I correct? If not, what do you think the data structure is? If it is a single array, why is it been accessed through 2 different \"heads\"\n  <strong>\n   <code>\n    word_4305fc\n   </code>\n  </strong>\n  and\n  <strong>\n   <code>\n    word_4305FE\n   </code>\n  </strong>\n  ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   ADDED:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The following is in response to the comments below. Thank you, guys, so much for your input! I really do appreciate it and RE community in general. I feel as if my question needs certain clarification. I do realize that this is an array. I also clearly see that\n  <strong>\n   <code>\n    Variable_1\n   </code>\n  </strong>\n  is an index to the array. In addition, I can see iteration. However, it is not my question. What I am really looking for is clarification or possibly an explanation. How would I be able to distinguish if this array is indeed more complex data type? Why did compiler choose to refer to this data type with 2 different angles: using 2 global variables both\n  <strong>\n   <code>\n    word_4305fc\n   </code>\n  </strong>\n  and\n  <strong>\n   <code>\n    word_4305FE\n   </code>\n  </strong>\n  ? Is there a specific reason for it? Is it an indication of more complex data type?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Consider the following C code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>short array[256];\n\n// ...\ncx = array[variable_1+1];\n// ...\n\n// ...\ndx = array[variable_1];\n// ...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Consider the choices that the compiler has in compiling these snippets of code.  It could produce code like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov eax, [ebp+Variable_1]\nxor ecx, ecx\nmov cx, word_4305FC[eax*2+2] ; note the +2 and the -FC address\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Or maybe:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov eax, [ebp+Variable_1]\ninc eax ; note this\nxor ecx, ecx\nmov cx, word_4305FC[eax*2] ; note the -FC address\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Or, in the case of what you posted, this is an equivalent code sequence:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov eax, [ebp+Variable_1]\nxor ecx, ecx\nmov cx, word_4305FE[eax*2] ; note the -FE address\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  What the compiler did was to eliminate the \"+2\" in the address displacement, or the \"inc eax\" in the index computation, and replaced it by adding 1*sizeof(short) to the address of the array.  This allows for a more optimized computation that does not have any increments taking place at runtime.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
