As the malware investigator notices interesting behavioral characteristics, he modifies the laboratory environment to evoke newcharacteristics. To perform this work, theinvestigatortypically infects the isolated system while having the necessary monitoring tools observe the specimen's execution. Some of the free tools that can help in this analysis phase are Process Monitor, Process Explorer, RegShot and Wireshark. Several free on-line tools can automate some aspects of behavioral analysis; there are also several free frameworks you can use to script the analysis process in a local lab.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     Code analysis\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    reverse-engineers the malicious program to understand the code that implements the specimen's behavior. When looking at compiled programs, this process involves using a disassembler, a debugger and, perhaps, a decompiler to examine the program's low-level assembly or byte-code instructions.A disassembler converts the instructions from their binary form into the human-readable assembly form. A decompiler attempts to recreate the original source code of the program. A debugger lets the analyst step through the most interesting parts of the code, interacting with it and observing the effects of its instructions to understand their purpose. OllyDbg and IDA Pro Freeware are popular free disassembler/debuggers that can handle Windows programs.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     Memory analysis\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    examines memory of the infected system to extract artifacts relevant to the malicious program. In the context of reverse-engineering malware, memory analysis can help identify malicious code that is trying to hide itself (i.e., rootkits), can clarify the program's run-time dependencies, and can explain how the specimen was used on the victim's system. Memory analysis saves time and allows theinvestigatorto take shortcuts when studying the specimen's behavior or code. Free tools for performing memory analysis are The Volatility Framework and its malware-related plugins, as well as Memoryze and the associated Audit Viewer program.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I Hope this would be an added Value to the above response\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
