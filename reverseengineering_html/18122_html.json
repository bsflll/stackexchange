IDA output window displays the following error message:\n </p>\n <pre><code>WaitForEvent() failed; please make sure that all unresolved bpts/expressions could be evaluated before continuing\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  or breakpoint is completely ignored. This command does not help either:\n </p>\n <pre><code>sxe ld:driver\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I tried to replace the first byte of driver's\n  <strong>\n   DriverEntry\n  </strong>\n  code with\n  <strong>\n   CC\n  </strong>\n  opcode (\n  <strong>\n   int 3\n  </strong>\n  ). After that virtual machine window silently closes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does anybody know how to break on\n  <strong>\n   DriverEntry\n  </strong>\n  of such driver? Thanks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
