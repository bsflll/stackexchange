    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've got a program that i'm trying to debug a little bit by trying to make sense of a function or two, there's already some info that i've downloaded via a idb file and it's helped me get somewhere. But i'm kind of stuck on a part where i've got something like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>BYTE3(v1) = 0;\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This is from the ida hex-rays plugin which has made some nice c-pseudo code for me. I can't double click the function and get it translated in some way so i don't really know how to understand what it does, my guess is that it takes either the third or fourth byte of an int. So my question is, how would i be able to find this function and look at it's disassembly at least if it can't be translated by hex-rays? The signature if that helps at all looks like this according to ida:\n  <code>\n   _BYTE __fastcall(int)\n  </code>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
