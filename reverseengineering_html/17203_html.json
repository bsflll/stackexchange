What if this is a struct and I want to define it... Can I do this in x64Dbg and if so, how? I do see a Struct tab in the hex dump area, but if I right-click, there is no option to define a struct.\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vb4zy.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vb4zy.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It is however possible to define structs and visit them in memory (similar to 010 editor). The main sources of information about this are\n  <a href=\"https://x64dbg.com/blog/2016/12/04/type-system.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"https://x64dbg.com/blog/2016/11/27/weekly-digest-14.html#types\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  As an example if you have the following code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#pragma pack(1)\nstruct MyStruct\n{\n    int a;\n    bool b;\n    const char* c;\n};\n\nvoid test(MyStruct* p)\n{\n    MyStruct* s = p;\n    s->a = 0x1234;\n    s->b = true;\n    s->c = \"Hello world\";\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    MyStruct s;\n    test(&s);\n    return s.a;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  You use the\n  <code>\n   Parse header\n  </code>\n  option in the\n  <code>\n   Struct\n  </code>\n  tab to parse the following header:\n </p>\n <pre><code>struct MyStruct\n{\n    int a;\n    bool b;\n    const char* c;\n};\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This will load the structure (use the command\n  <code>\n   EnumTypes\n  </code>\n  to see a list of types). Now when you're paused at the disassembly of the\n  <code>\n   test\n  </code>\n  function you can use the\n  <code>\n   Visit type\n  </code>\n  option from the\n  <code>\n   Struct\n  </code>\n  tab to show the contents of the memory at\n  <code>\n   ecx\n  </code>\n  in a structural way:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7m0js.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The addresses of the structure members will also be added as temporary labels so you can see what an instruction refers to in the info box:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mtHFg.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  This feature has not been further developed because there was a lack of interest from the community.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
