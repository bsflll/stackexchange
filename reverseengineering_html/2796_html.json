If the breakpoint is hit, you can trace up the call-stack to \nsee what code is reading your input text and where in memory it's being stored. If neither breakpoint is hit, you can try setting a conditional breakpoint on\n  <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644950%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\">\n   <code>\n    SendMessage()\n   </code>\n  </a>\n  , filtering it to only break on the\n  <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632627%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\">\n   <code>\n    WM_GETTEXT\n   </code>\n  </a>\n  message.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If the above methods fail, you may want to statically analyze the program to find where it's creating the text box window and how it's handling input to the text box. Searching for window creation API calls and/or cross-references to strings related to the text box (static labels, error message strings, etc.) can be helpful.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
