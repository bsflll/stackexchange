I see Strings, and I wish to find out where these strings are referenced in code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KaVEa.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KaVEa.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have tried to find cross-references to these strings in the code but there aren't any.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Am I totally naive and missed out something totally obvious to the initiated? Could the strings be referenced by some obtuse run-time calculation of address (to obfuscate references) rather than just straightforward absolute/relative reference (which IDA mostly could work out?)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Many thanks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This could be why you are not seeing xrefs for those strings.  Without more information, that's my best guess.  I would try to find the beginning of that list of strings and look for an xref there.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
