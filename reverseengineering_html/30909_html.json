Stepping through assembly, I get to the following instructions:\n </p>\n <p>\n  '''76B7CC12 | 8B4C24 54                | mov ecx,dword ptr ss:[esp+54]           |'''\n </p>\n <p>\n  If I continue to step through the assembly, the program continues to open and start up, but for some reason x32dbg stays on this line. What's going on here? There is not a breakpoint here.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
