There is very little information on the Internet on how to solve such problems.That's why I decided to study obfuscation to understand how it works, if I can understand how it works then I will be able to find signatures in the code.\nWhere can I read more about obfuscation? What are the good resources to understand the techniques and required programming?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm solving this\n  <a href=\"https://crackmes.one/crackme/6701d1419b533b4c22bd0d8f\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   crackme\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
