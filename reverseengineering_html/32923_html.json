Aside from manually loading as \"Portable executable for AMD64 (PE)\" with \"MetaPC\" as the processor type) what options do I have to have IDA help me make sense of the managed and unmanaged parts of such an assembly?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Many DLLs created with C++/CLI are mixed assemblies.\n </p>\n <p>\n  PS: \"assembly\" in this question refers to the .NET/CLR concept, not to the assembly language.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
