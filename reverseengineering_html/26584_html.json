I read that radare2 was written to recover data from disks, and I'm thinking that the word files still have their \"magic numbers\", and maybe I could use that tool, but I have no idea how to start.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I omitted the hard disk specifics because I don't think they matter that much, I'll modify the post just in case. (I didn't know a better place to post - sorry)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

As the answer already states, if you are risk averse and the data is precious enough you may want to make use of one of the services where you send the HDD to the service offering it. Usually the way this works is that they will assess how much they will charge you and only if you agree, they'll do it and charge for it. Typically the initial costs are merely for shipping to the service and back.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

This will copy the data off the drive into a file from which you can attempt to recover the data using all manner of tools. For example\n  <a href=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-access-a-system-image-and-restore-individual-files-using-windows-10s-native-vhd-support/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   mount the image on win10\n  </a>\n  or using\n  <a href=\"https://www.kalilinux.in/2019/09/foremost-kali-linux-recover-deleted-files.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   foremost on kali\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The more risky path is to plug the drive into the IDE to USB adapter and then plug it into your laptop. That may work and you may be able to pull the files up and copy them off.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd create the image (ISO), and then try mounting the image on windows 10 to see what shows up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or just plug it in via USB on a windows machine. If you have no reason to believe the drive is damaged, then KISS.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
