    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm new to reverse enginnering and currently following Lena's tutorials. I wanted to put my new skills to use and wanted to reverse a simple game:\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/Zolomon/labyrinth\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/Zolomon/labyrinth\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I think I'm stuck somewhere in ntdll. How do I get out of that? It's after the game as been instantiated then everything stops working.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was hoping I would be stuck in the game loop and from there I was hoping to capture in-game movements.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Below is a picture where I've put breakpoints right before the game window is created.\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TCeMO.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TCeMO.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2fmAI.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2fmAI.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
