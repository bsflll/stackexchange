The program jumps there after the unpacking is done.\nI took the\n  <code>\n   bin/ls\n  </code>\n  file, and checked with\n  <code>\n   readelf -h\n  </code>\n  that the entry point is\n  <code>\n   0x404870\n  </code>\n  . I packed it with upx, and in gdb set a breakpoint at this address:\n  <code>\n   b *0x404870\n  </code>\n  . I expected that the program will stop there, but apparently it terminates without stopping at this address. Am I misinterpreting something?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Once you have unpacked it, ImportREC can help reconstruct your executable without the packer. I don't know what you 're dealing with, but if you check out a video of how each of them work and get the basics, you will most likely succeed.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
