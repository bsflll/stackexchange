We expect to find code in module named\n  <code>\n   crackme4\n  </code>\n  or similar.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Looking at the stack, it's easy to find the address:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/u20XV.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Image of stack\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/u20XV.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  That one is not prefixed with\n  <code>\n   <system_module_name>.\n  </code>\n  , so I guess it's code from the crackme.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In case the stack is corrupted, it's possible to use\n  <kbd>\n   Alt\n  </kbd>\n  +\n  <kbd>\n   F9\n  </kbd>\n  (execute until user code).\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  About finding the corresponding address in IDA, it's described at\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/q/1833/25171\">\n   this question\n  </a>\n  :\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   If only the base is changed, but offsets are constant\n   <em>\n    [...]\n   </em>\n   , you can just rebase the program in IDA.
