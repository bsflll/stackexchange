The program has to be analyzed for this to work, I wrote a script which analyzes the program and then extracts the assembly code, but the issue is that the first time i run the script, it can't detect the current Listing window and gets a NoneType error (even though the script was analyzed), but if I run the script again after it has been analyzed once, then the assembly code is displayed.   Is there a way where the script extracts the assembly code the first time the script has been run?</span>",
