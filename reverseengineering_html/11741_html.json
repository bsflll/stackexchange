Here is what I found\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7FxfV.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7FxfV.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know how to code a bit in C and .net and thought maybe it would be possible with guidance.

Looking at the cross references and the surrounding API calls might tell you how they are being used.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Perhaps using a utility like strings might help to discover if there is more embedded text.  If you think the files might be obfuscated you could try Didier Steven's xorsearch tool.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
