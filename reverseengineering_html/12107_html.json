    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  A couple of days ago I ran into an executable called \"carckme\" which was a GUI application. So I decided to figure out the serial number it generates. Properly I found out the function but when it came to debugging I had some problems with IDA pro. Everything seemed okay but it didn't stop executing the app at the breakpoint. I guess it could be because of multithreading, as you know GUI applications are implemented multithreaded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I came up with this issue because I couldn't really find the answer, I was wondering to ask here, at first to get to know the reason, and secondly to ask you to find and try to tackle the problem by issuing a way to make it solved.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It's hard to guess which of these happened or why without more context.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
