    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a piece of malware for windows / x64 which is packed, so IDA only recognizes the unpacker routine as data. This is the aspect of the zone just after loading the binary in IDA:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bPDYw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Section of undetected code\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bPDYw.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I want to print the disassembly instruction in that zone, so I use this piece of IDAPython code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>cur_addr = 0x75014F\nend_addr = cur_addr + 0x28\nwhile cur_addr <= end_addr:     #For 0x28 bytes print instructions\n    instr = idc.generate_disasm_line(cur_addr, idc.GENDSM_FORCE_CODE)\n    print (f'\\t+ {hex(cur_addr)} :\\t {instr}')\n    cur_addr = idc.next_head(cur_addr)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I have identified that\n  <code>\n   0x75014F\n  </code>\n  has the unpacker. Then, for\n  <code>\n   0x28\n  </code>\n  bytes I want to print the pseudocode from this position. After executing that, the output is…\n </p>\n <pre><code>    + 0x75014f :     pop     r13\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So, only one instruction is decoded. The reason is\n  <code>\n   idc.next_head\n  </code>\n  is pointing much farther than 0x28 form my interesting zone. I suppose that at the end of all the\n  <code>\n   dq\n  </code>\n  definitions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, in IDA, I press “C” to convert the zone to code. This is the aspect in IDA now:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LkIB0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Section of code of interest\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LkIB0.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  After that, the script works as expected and this is the real result:\n </p>\n <pre><code>    + 0x75014f :     pop     r13\n    + 0x750151 :     jmp     short loc_750155\n    + 0x750155 :     push    rbx\n    + 0x750156 :     cmovb   ebx, [rsp+8Ch]\n    + 0x75015e :     pop     rbx\n    + 0x75015f :     rol     dword ptr [r13+4], 66h\n    + 0x750164 :     jmp     short loc_750168\n    + 0x750168 :     ror     dword ptr [r13+8], 0FDh\n    + 0x75016d :     cmova   rsi, rsi\n    + 0x750171 :     xor     dword ptr [r13+0Ch], 8A6B7B58h\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  My question is, how to force (with IDAPython) convert a data zone to code? It seems that\n  <code>\n   idc.generate_disasm_line\n  </code>\n  is not enough.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Note: This is part of a reverse me challenge. I needed to find all the call instructions and see the code at which they pointed. Knowing the disassembled code, I could discard irrelevant code (in, out, muls, divs…). Then, by visual inspection of the non-discarded code, I could find out the unpacker. As my IDAPython code was not working I needed to press \"C\" in IDA to check all the undiscarded routines. If it were working my job would have been easier.\n  </em>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
