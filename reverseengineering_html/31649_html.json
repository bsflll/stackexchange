However there is a cache directory\n  <em>\n   /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.miui.gallery/files/gallery_disk_cache/full_size\n  </em>\n  containing thumbnails in 750x1000 resolution.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I identified a picture which is the preview for the above entry. However the file name cannot be found in the database. also the mtime is slightly different, although I am sure that is the same picture.\n </p>\n <p>\n  the file name of the thumbnail picture is (I don't know what it is)\n </p>\n <pre><code>57818493be39acef0f61b5530ead56a244cc9f50672635f49f1c5e31b1f33ad0.0\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  the calculated sha1 and sha2 of the thumbnail picture is\n </p>\n <pre><code>277a7e182228906ca92dd969d4929a6171da3f8b\n1366c580e9f8e6ed28347401942934bc8d3ac7257112033e2a40c49f5973b253\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  assuming the thumbnail file name is the sha2 of the original picture, is there any way to assign the sha2 to sha1 without having the file? maybe with bruteforce or something?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Because assuming the contained SHA-1 value is from the original image file it doesn't make sense to lookup the thumbnail by the hash of the original file data hash. Calculating the hash is pretty CPU intensive, especially for JPEG images it may be faster to load the JPEG image directly in a lower resolution than calculating the hash for looking up the thumbnail.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

It is possible that the thumbnail file-name hash is not on the picture content but on its file-name and meta-data. To see how the database and the thumbnails are generated I would try to decompile the gallery app.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
