First and second requires some work (maybe there are some already existing tools of which I don't know and which allows it? so I don't have to prepare it all myself), and third seems a bit over-excessive. \nJust to expand my knowledge - what are the other options?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This has the benefit of not loading the DLL into every process that loads user32.dll (which is an issue with #3), and you can do this Import Table addition easily with a tool like\n  <a href=\"http://www.woodmann.com/collaborative/tools/index.php/IIDKing\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   IIDKing\n  </a>\n  :\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://www.woodmann.com/collaborative/tools/index.php/IIDKing\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"IIDKing\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Sxe2n.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This IIDKing program adds dll to the import table of a PE file you pick and adds functions from that dll to the import address table(IAT) of a PE file you pick.

For the sake of example, let's assume your application\n   <code>\n    someprog.exe\n   </code>\n   used a dll\n   <code>\n    vendor.dll\n   </code>\n   , from which it imports the\n   <code>\n    ShowCopyright\n   </code>\n   function.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Using a hex editor, change the string\n   <code>\n    vendor.dll\n   </code>\n   in the executable to\n   <code>\n    hacker.dll\n   </code>\n   .\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   In the startup of your DLL, use\n   <code>\n    LoadLibrary(\"vendor.dll\")\n   </code>\n   and\n   <code>\n    GetProcAddress(\"ShowCopyright\")\n   </code>\n   to get a function pointer to the real\n   <code>\n    ShowCopyright\n   </code>\n   function.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Also, in your DLL, provide a\n   <code>\n    ShowCopyright\n   </code>\n   export that does nothing but jump to the\n   <code>\n    ShowCopyright\n   </code>\n   address you just retrieved.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Rename your DLL\n   <code>\n    hacker.dll\n   </code>\n   and put it into the application's search path.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Note this depends a bit on how many DLLs the executable program imports, and if you find one where you don't have to \"simulate\" several dozen API entries, or resources, or whatever can be linked to a dll.\n </p>\n <p>\n  EDIT:\n </p>\n <p>\n  After finishing my post, i found Jason's answer, which seems to be a bit more professional and easier. But, at least, my solution needs no tools except a hex editor :-)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The\n  <code>\n   AppInit_DLLs\n  </code>\n  approach you mentioned doesn't work anymore to the best of my knowledge. At least not as easily, especially when UEFI Secure Boot is enabled.\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   DLL placement attack\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/xperf/image-file-execution-options\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    <code>\n     ImageFileExecutionOptions\n    </code>\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  In both cases it depends on the target binary, so let's go through it.\n </p>\n <h3>\n  DLL placement attack\n </h3>\n <p>\n  I've run this in the past on Windows 7, but\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   the rules have changed since then\n  </a>\n  . The way I made it work was as follows. I figured out one (vendor-provided) DLL loaded by the program without a full path (I picked the one with the least number of imports). I then wrote a stub DLL which would simply pass through all function calls to the real DLL (loaded by full path) and print out useful info for me. The return value would simply be returned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It's easy to figure out the function prototypes of exported functions, so this was the lazy option for me.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  <code>\n   ImageFileExecutionOptions\n  </code>\n </h2>\n <p>\n  This method is used by Process Explorer to make itself a replacement for Task Manager. Here's how that looks in action:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\\taskmgr.exe]\n\"Debugger\"=\"\\\"C:\\\\PATH\\\\TO\\\\PROCEXP.EXE\\\"\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now the value name probably gives it away already, this was previously used for a totally different purpose.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Either way you can (ab)use it to achieve what you want. You write a little stub loader, acting as the \"debugger\". There isn't much to it, you don't even have to implement any of the debugger APIs, although you could.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All you'll want to do is to use\n  <code>\n   CreateProcess\n  </code>\n  or similar to create a process with its main thread in suspended state upon \"start\". You can pass on the command line arguments as you wish (although it is, admittedly) a bit involved with\n  <code>\n   CreateProcess\n  </code>\n  and friends.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The suspended main thread is where you can detour to your own code ... typically a simple piece of shell code that does nothing other than load\n  <em>\n   your\n  </em>\n  DLL and then return to the original entry point. Et voila, you have loaded\n  <em>\n   your\n  </em>\n  DLL into an application.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The nice part about this second method is that it scales pretty well, since you basically only have to write this sort of \"debugger\" (loader) once. So it can be kept generic.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This method amounts to doing (from the command line):\n </p>\n <pre><code>loader.exe C:\\path\\to\\hijacked\\application.exe argument1 argument2 and more arguments\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  ... except that to the user this will be transparent. And I think inside your loader you can even use\n  <code>\n   argv[0]\n  </code>\n  to get the path to the hijacked executable, IIRC.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now you may think that this is some weird security issue and wonder why it's gone unnoticed. It's not a security issue insofar as you have to be privileged to set the\n  <code>\n   ImageFileExecutionOptions\n  </code>\n  in the first place.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As a side-note: I\n  <em>\n   think\n  </em>\n  it's even permissible to name the containing key (\n  <code>\n   taskmgr.exe\n  </code>\n  in the above registry file) with the full path to the executable to be hijacked.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
