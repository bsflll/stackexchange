    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am currently reverse engineering a piece of 16-bit software (originally written in C/C++ from what I can gather).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have identified a function that seems to print text to the console. The text to be printed is passed into the function as a parameter, however Ghidra doesn't seem to be handling the strings properly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The function is decompiled as follows:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/U5YR2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"PrintToConsole Decompilation\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/U5YR2.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The assembly for this function is:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8NvTu.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"PrintToConsole Assembly\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8NvTu.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So Ghidra picks up on the string, however when I attempt to double-click it (to go to it's relevant location), the following error appears:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HydAI.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Invalid Address Error\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HydAI.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is making identifying where strings are utilised extremely hard, as I cannot search for where a string is utilised within the program's code. I don't understand how Ghidra can pickup part of the name of the string, but won't then let me click through to it?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I also seem to be getting a lot of global variables names like this in the disassembly:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IQxJm.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Global Variables with Unfamiliar Naming\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IQxJm.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  And when I go to rename them, I get the following error:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jES0D.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Rename Failed Error\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jES0D.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have no idea if these two issues are related or not?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any suggestions?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks,\nJames.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Merging the blocks has now solved this issue, however I still don't seem to be able to double click on the string values in the decompilation.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
