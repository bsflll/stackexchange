    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  So, I have a program which I am 99% sure it is using Lua as when I look at string references I see this:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/dppK1.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Lua Copyright Version\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/dppK1.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Which I am understanding that somewhere in this program they have statically linked a Lua C or something of the sort, so I did a quick Google for Lua 5.2.1 Libraries, I found\n  <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/files/5.2.1/Windows%20Libraries/Static/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   this\n  </a>\n  which is a link to the Source Forge for Lua static libraries for 5.2.1, so I downloaded it, opened up the IDA SDK, and ran:\n </p>\n <pre><code>.\\pcf.exe .\\lua52.lib .\\lua52.pat\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  which returns:\n </p>\n <pre><code>...\\lua52.lib: skipped 0, total 793\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Which I interpret to understand it found 793 signatures or something similar, so then I ran:\n </p>\n <pre><code>.\\sigmake.exe .\\lua52.pat .\\lua52.pat\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Which returns an error;\n </p>\n <pre><code>.\\lua52.pat: modules/leaves: 767/793, COLLISIONS: 1\nSee the documentation to learn how to resolve collisions.\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Which I assume meant I had to use the -r switch, so I reran it\n </p>\n <pre><code>.\\sigmake.exe -r .\\lua52.pat .\\lua52.sig\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  It generated no errors and produced the sig file, so I dropped it in the sig directory in IDA which lets it show up, so when I go to apply\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7c2aa.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Lua Signature Image In IDA\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7c2aa.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  it shows up which I expected, I add it to IDA, it tells me there are\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/h0VXe.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Proof of references\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/h0VXe.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  references, but nothing I am \"sure\" is Lua gets renamed? Is that expect or not? I know this line\n </p>\n <pre><code>sub_140856EE0(v1, (__int64)\"field '%s' missing in date table\", \"year\");\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  is Lua because when you google the middle field it tells it's a Lua using a Lua function. Finally I've ran a reanalyses to make sure it looks back through the file to give it a once over.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Have I missed something obvious here?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
