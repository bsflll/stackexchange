More specifically,\n  <code>\n   $r\n  </code>\n  is a variable which holds the height of the console. This command is shown on Visual Disassembly mode (\n  <code>\n   Vp\n  </code>\n  ) and usually is not executed by the user. The command is used by the mode in order to show\n  <em>\n   N\n  </em>\n  instructions from the binary where\n  <em>\n   N\n  </em>\n  is the height of the console (number of lines). This provides the user with a better, and more interactive, reverse engineering experience.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To show the full list of variables you can use the command\n  <code>\n   ?$?\n  </code>\n  .
