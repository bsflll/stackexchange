    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've a\n  <strong>\n   huawei envizion 360\n  </strong>\n  , which doesn't provide any API for other application. But I want to read raw data from this device, to an android or to a raspberry-pi for debugging and development purpose. I need\n  <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.huawei.cvIntl60&hl=en&gl=US\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   an android application\n  </a>\n  to record video or take picture from this external device.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But when I tried to debug this application using Android Studio, I got :\n </p>\n <pre><code>Missing debug symbols\n                    To debug the APK, native libraries (*.so files) must have debug symbols.\n                    The following libraries are missing debug symbols:\n                    * libViewController.so\n                    * libijkffmpeg.so\n                    * libijkplayer.so\n                    * libijksdl.so\n                    * librtmpClient.so\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I was told that I can't get those debug symbol, due to r8 processing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So my question is how can read raw frames/data from this device. Any idea ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I just have to read data so that I can embed data directly in my application. So my main goal is to decode how those data are being read.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
