Unfortunately, the compiler placed them directly behind each other in memory. This seems to confuse IDA when calculating the graph connections for those nodes:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"Graph for 1st jump table\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3ld8y.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Edit, as the the wording of the question was probably misleading\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The graph node shows 9 outgoing connections. 5 of them are true connections, the next 4 are not - they belong to a different jump table that happens to be directly after this one in memory. I'd like to tell IDA \"This jump table has 5 valid entries, ignore the other ones when creating the graph node\". Is there any way to do this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   The original question was:\n  </em>\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   The first jump table has 9 connections, 4 of which don't belong to\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   statement. (The second one, ommited here for brevity, has only one connection). Is there any way to tell IDA to remove the extra\n  connections from the first table, and possibly create new connections\n  from the 2nd table to the corresponding targets?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  I already tried defining the jump tables as arrays, then undefine the function and re-define it as code, but that didn't change anything.\n </p>\n <p>\n  (I'm using IDA 5.0, as this is a hobby project, and i don't want to spend several hundred bucks on something i'll use a few times a year).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

What I think you need is to separate the jumps into one per line, and you do that with the array command {*} and uncheck all the checkboxes.

My problem is that the graph node has nine outgoing connections, where it should have only five of them, so some of the links are just wrong, and the graph is more complex than it should be. I'd like to somehow tell IDA \"this jump table has 5 entries, even if it seems to be 9, because the last 4 belong to a different jump table\". Unfortunately, your \"doesn't know how to handle jump tables, no matter how you configure them\" means it's probably impossible.</span>",
