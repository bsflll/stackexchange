The\n  <code>\n   dylib\n  </code>\n  is not signed by default in this project, but it just running well when try to open it.

Jailbreaks usually disable signature checking completely to allow unsigned homebrew software to run.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Apparently only libraries which are listed as dependencies of the executable in the header (\n  <code>\n   LC_LOAD_DYLIB\n  </code>\n  and similar commands) are checked, and those loaded with\n  <code>\n   dlopen\n  </code>\n  are not.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is mentioned indirectly in the\n  <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Procedures/Procedures.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Code Signing Guide\n  </a>\n  :\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   As with other Gatekeeper functions, this check is performed the first\n  time the app is run. It does not apply to libraries that the app loads\n  itself using the\n   <code>\n    dlopen\n   </code>\n   function, although those libraries are still\n  potentially subject to library validation, as described in Using\n  Library Validation.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Following the link, we see this passage:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Starting in iOS 8 and macOS 10.10, the system offers library\n  validation as a policy for the dynamic libraries that a process links\n  against.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The policy is simple: A program may link against any library\n  with the same team identifier in its code signature as the main\n  executable, or with any Apple system library. Requests to link against\n  other libraries are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In iOS, an Apple system library is a\n  library that Apple mastered into the OS image. In macOS, an Apple\n  system library is a library shipped in /System/Library. The team\n  identifier is the 10-character alphanumeric string, such as\n  YH9SZ5LKR4, associated with your developer account, and recorded in\n  your Apple-issued signing certificate. \n  In iOS, library validation is\n   <strong>\n    always enabled\n   </strong>\n   for all apps. There is nothing you need to do to opt\n  in.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  So it would seem that\n  <code>\n   dlopen\n  </code>\n  <em>\n   should not\n  </em>\n  be able to load unsigned libraries in iOS 8 and higher, though I have not checked this.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
