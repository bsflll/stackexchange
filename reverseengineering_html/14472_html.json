    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm a beginner at this and I'm following tutorials but I am kind of stuck.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I found a function that accesses all characters X position in game. I found this using Cheat Engine and here's how it looks:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/h5xio.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/h5xio.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  All these addresses are X positions of characters in game.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked up this function in IDA and the functions looks like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>double __thiscall sub_427380(int this)\n{\n  return *(float *)(this + 80);\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So I managed to hook this function and read the values in C++.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's the code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>double hookedFunction(int i)\n{\n    float f = *(float *)(i + 80);\n    return originalFunction(i);\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This works but when I try to read values from other offsets that I found using the \"Dissect Data/Structures\" function in Cheat Engine I'm stuck.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's the structure from one of the addresses I found in Cheat Engine:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QyPt7.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I subtract 80 from the address and I create a new data structure in Cheat Engine it looks like this:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7mcuZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7mcuZ.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So here's where I need help. How do I read the string at offset 0040 and the 4 bytes at offset 003C in my hooked function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried doing stuff like:\n </p>\n <pre><code>DWORD d = *(DWORD *)(i + 0x3C);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But whatever I try I can't get the right values.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
