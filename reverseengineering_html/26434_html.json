One example is C++'s\n  <code>\n   nullptr\n  </code>\n  , that since C++11 is the required definition of\n  <code>\n   NULL\n  </code>\n  .

The answers mention several historical machines that had non-zero null pointer bit-patterns.  (i.e. what you'd see in the asm for code like\n  <code>\n   do {...} while(p = p->next);\n  </code>\n  )\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Remember that in asm, pointers are just 64-bit (or 32-bit) integers\n  </strong>\n  .  The whole idea of\n  <code>\n   NULL\n  </code>\n  is in-band signalling, not some special thing that isn't even a pointer-sized integer.  So we have to pick some constant.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   0\n  </code>\n  is a convenient sentinel value because many ISAs can branch slightly more efficiently on a value being non-zero than checking for any other value.  e.g. ARM has\n  <code>\n   cbnz\n  </code>\n  to branch on non-zero without needing a\n  <code>\n   cmp\n  </code>\n  .  x86 has a minor code-size optimization of\n  <code>\n   test eax, eax\n  </code>\n  /\n  <code>\n   jnz\n  </code>\n  instead of\n  <code>\n   cmp eax, 0\n  </code>\n  /\n  <code>\n   jnz\n  </code>\n  .  (\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33721204/test-whether-a-register-is-zero-with-cmp-reg-0-vs-or-reg-reg/33724806#33724806\">\n   Test whether a register is zero with CMP reg,0 vs OR reg,reg?\n  </a>\n  ).  If FLAGS are already set by another arithmetic instruction, no\n  <code>\n   test\n  </code>\n  would be needed, but that's unusual for null pointer tests: usually you don't do math on a pointer and\n  <em>\n   then\n  </em>\n  test for NULL.\n </p>\n <p>\n  (You're not seeing that optimization in your asm because your debug build stores to memory before testing.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also,\n  <code>\n   0\n  </code>\n  is easy to generate.  Some large number might take a larger instruction, or more instructions on some ISAs, to create in a register.  (e.g. x86\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33666617/what-is-the-best-way-to-set-a-register-to-zero-in-x86-assembly-xor-mov-or-and\">\n   <code>\n    xor eax,eax\n   </code>\n  </a>\n  instead of\n  <code>\n   mov eax, imm32\n  </code>\n  ).  And zero-initialized static storage like\n  <code>\n   static int *table = NULL;\n  </code>\n  can be in the BSS instead of\n  <code>\n   .data\n  </code>\n  - modern systems zero-init the BSS.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  On some systems (especially embedded) the\n  <code>\n   0\n  </code>\n  address isn't special, and you actually have system-management stuff there, like the start of a table of interrupt handlers.  So\n  <code>\n   0\n  </code>\n  can be a valid address, as well as being equal to\n  <code>\n   NULL\n  </code>\n  .  This kinda sucks, so this is where one might actually want a non-zero object representation for null pointers.  @Simon Richter\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/26434/does-null-in-windows-equal-to-zero/26442#comment40961_26435\">\n   comments\n  </a>\n  about hacking an ARM compiler to use\n  <code>\n   0x20000000\n  </code>\n  as the NULL bit-pattern.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On systems using virtual memory (like Windows), we can simply avoid ever mapping the page containing that address, which helps detect bugs by making sure NULL-dereference actually faults.  (Remember that undefined behaviour in C and C++ is\n  <em>\n   not\n  </em>\n  required to fault, but it's certainly convenient if it does.)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
