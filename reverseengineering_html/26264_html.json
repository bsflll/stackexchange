That's not possible with any debugger. If you mean you want to set a breakpoint\n  <strong>\n   at a particular address\n  </strong>\n  that only fires when\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  is\n  <code>\n   1\n  </code>\n  , that's doable.\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Set a breakpoint on some instruction with\n   <code>\n    F2\n   </code>\n   .\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Right-click on the instruction and choose\n   <code>\n    Edit breakpoint...\n   </code>\n   .\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Write\n   <code>\n    EAX == 1\n   </code>\n   in the\n   <code>\n    Condition\n   </code>\n   field on the dialog box.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  The\n  <code>\n   Edit breakpoint\n  </code>\n  dialog is described in great detail in the IDA manual.
