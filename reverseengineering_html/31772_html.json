There is a feature which is called \"map to another variable\".\nbut it asks from me to map from the variable from a list. How do u know the exact variable to map into ? (I can assume which variable, but it could be a mistake and continuing in reverse engineering the program could lead to mistakes in next). In Ghidra, it figures the correct variable by itself.\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Are there any tips for IDA users ?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Is there any automation for IDA like in Ghidra ?\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
