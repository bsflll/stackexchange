Try to track down the login error shown, maybe you can find the check which triggers it and disable it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Instead of patching the app itself, you can also try an external solution which would target external libraries to bypass pinning. You'll need to find out which SSL library the app uses and how it detects the certificate mismatch, then either patch the library on disk or in memory, at runtime.\n  <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/149325/disable-or-bypass-ssl-pinning-certificate-pinning-on-android-6-0-1\">\n   This post\n  </a>\n  gives some possible solutions that might work for that.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

But it needs a rooted phone, and it will most probably disable SSL on every app and connection. And for security purposes, I'd like to avoid this solution.  I've read many papers from researchers, going through certificate pinning on Tinder, and there's no mention of a tampering check, or needs for an external things. That's why I concluded that it's either out of date, or the most probable one, is that I'm not skilled enough since I'm a beginner.</span>",
