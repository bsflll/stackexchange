    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I made IDA load an ~70MB executable, and it's been analyzing it for about 16 hours now (still not finished, although it's over half done). While there\n  <em>\n   is\n  </em>\n  progress, the progress is very, very slow. On the other hand, a 5MB file is analyzed within about 5 minutes. I remember a 40MB executable taking about 30-40 minutes to analyze, but this is nothing compared to >16 hours.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hopper took about 2 hours (and used 6GB of RAM!) to analyze the same file, but it managed to complete it. After looking at the disassembly, it seems that the executable in question tends to use many function pointers (over directly invoking functions)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is this normal? Is there anything I can do to speed up the process?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Check your appropriate system tools (resmon/task manager in windows, top/vmstat in linux) for the amount of available/memory and disk activity. And ofc, make sure you're using the 64 bit version of IDA.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

It's running on one core, and very few other processes are taking up extra CPU, so I don't think it's a resources issue :) And yes, I'm using the 64-bit version of IDA (the executable in question is 64-bit as well)\n</span>\n</body></html>",

This means that for every function added, it sorts the entire view. When operating on >100k functions, this can take a considerable (>1sec) amount of time. So if you have ~200K functions, the analysis will take forever, more or less.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I highly recommend closing (hiding is not enough) all views except the\n  <code>\n   Output window\n  </code>\n  . This should speed things up quite a bit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Regarding the RAM, being a 32bit application, IDA can only take up up to about 3GB of memory. From my experience, it handles 100MB binaries well.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Each refresh in the status window is maybe half? a second, maybe a third, but it seems to be less than 16 bytes. Then again, I recall there being many, many small functions, about 5 instructions long, or less (in fact, the pictogram on IDA is entirely blue! minus the beige data, and the grey/black, of course)</span>",
