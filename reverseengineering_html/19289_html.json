    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  i perform a loop in assembly where i am parsing the sections of ntdll change their memory permissions with\n  <strong>\n   VirtualProtect\n  </strong>\n  and then revert them back to their original permissions. the code looks like this:\n </p>\n <pre>\nlea eax, [OldProtect]\npush eax                      //here it will store the old protection value\npush PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE\npush dwSize                   //size of section\npush lpAddress                //start address of section\ncall Virtual_Alloc\n...\nblahblah\n...\nlea eax, [OldProtect]\npush eax\npush OldProtect               //the protection value to revert\npush dwSize                   //size of section               \npush lpAddress                //address of section             \ncall Virtual_Protect\n</pre>\n <p>\n  The loop runs correctly on the first three sections\n  <b>\n   .text\n  </b>\n  ,\n  <b>\n   .RT\n  </b>\n  and\n  <b>\n   .data\n  </b>\n  which have initial memory permissions\n  <b>\n   ER\n  </b>\n  ,\n  <b>\n   ER\n  </b>\n  ,\n  <b>\n   RW\n  </b>\n  respectively.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The problem is that the in the next section which is the\n  <b>\n   .mrdata\n  </b>\n  section and it is readable only, the memory protection changed succesfully from\n  <b>\n   R\n  </b>\n  to\n  <b>\n   ERW\n  </b>\n  . But When i try to revert back to the old protection the return value is 0x00000050 in eax and i get an exception.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What i want to ask is  why? Is this a false use of VirtualProtect? Or has something to do with the .mrdata section\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
