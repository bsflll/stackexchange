Most VMs ultimately have a similar high-level structure, as laid out in the following image, where there is a central point of dispatch to which almost all handlers ultimately return execution flow. (Although this is not true for all VMs; in so-called \"direct threaded\" VMs, the handlers pass control directly to one another instead of using a central dispatcher.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MMKWa.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"VM obfuscator schema\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MMKWa.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, one tempting answer to this question would be to look for a loop that ultimately transfers control into a table with pointers. However, VM protections quite often apply a lot of obfuscation to their interpreters -- dead code insertion, pattern-based obfuscation, constant unfolding, breaking the code up into chunks and interspersing\n  <code>\n   jmp\n  </code>\n  instructions between them -- so even if you are looking at the obfuscated code for a VM, the high level structure from the previous image might not be readily apparent. Another common thing for commercial-grade VMs to do is to obfuscate the \"dispatcher\" part -- for example, by applying some sort of transformation to the pointers in the table, and/or by replacing the\n  <code>\n   jmp\n  </code>\n  with something like\n  <code>\n   push\n  </code>\n  /\n  <code>\n   ret\n  </code>\n  instead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Given that it can be difficult to determine this statically, it might be easier to determine it by tracing through the obfuscated code dynamically. If there seems to be a common location that the obfuscated code executes very frequently, that might be the fetch/decode/dispatch portion of the figure above. (Of course, as previously mentioned, direct-threaded VMs won't have this feature.)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
