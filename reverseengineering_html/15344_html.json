I am attaching gdb to the process late enough to break on the\n  <code>\n   mov\n  </code>\n  reading the canary to\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  . Therefore, reading\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  is not an option to me. How can I read (\n  <code>\n   x/w\n  </code>\n  ) the canary location (\n  <code>\n   gs:0x14\n  </code>\n  ) in gdb?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
