    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a Ubuntu 18.04 memory dump (entire RAM), and while I was acquiring it with LiME, I had a Python program running. Using Volatility, I want to recover its data structure values which are located in Python program process heap. The\n  <code>\n   linux_proc_map\n  </code>\n  plugin gave me the virtual addresses I should be looking through.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For now, I am trying to find out how CPython PyObjects appear in memory, but I'm not sure what values to look for, so scanning for specific values will be difficult. I only know the name of the data structure...\n </p>\n <p>\n  Has anyone else on here tried to recover program data structures from process memory?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
