If you're trying to get the parent minstruction, though, because your result resides in an moperand, you might be able to combine\n <code>\n  build_def_list\n </code>\n to get an\n <code>\n  mlist_t\n </code>\n , and then\n <code>\n  mblock_t.for_all_uses\n </code>\n if you only need it for a single mblock. In my (limited) experience,\n <code>\n  mlist_t\n </code>\n and the\n <code>\n  for_all_*\n </code>\n methods are more reliable for doing searches, especially because you're not limited to just an mblock.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
