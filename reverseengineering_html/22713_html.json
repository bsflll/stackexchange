It was too large of a binary to do during the challenge so I am doing it now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am having trouble finding the\n  <em>\n   main function\n  </em>\n  because the entry function is not the same as if this was written in C and compiled with GCC. I was wondering how I could go about finding the main function and if there were any resources that could assist me in my endeavors.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
