Is there any known method to pass integrity?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried the same on a rooted phone with\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/chiteroman/PlayIntegrityFix\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Play  Integrity Fix module (magisk)\n  </a>\n  installed and have gotten the same result.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Are there other function which are used to determine app integrity that I can hook?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So I would expect that Google implemented the check at least in Play Services or even distributed between Play Services and some backend server.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Not sure if it is possible to do the same if the one app has been modified and uses a different APk signature.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

(In a simalar way that the Play Integrity Fix module fools the services on rooted phones to pass PI. I think that it might perhaps work when I fake the getPackageInfo.signatures result, I will try it when I find some time. The app should normally be installed from the Play Store (if not it gives a warning to do so).\n</span>\n</body></html>",

It's a four way communication; between android app, app server, google play services & google servers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unless you reverse engineer the play services, anti-tampering will be difficult to bypass. I'm not even sure if you can bypass it even after reverse engineering google play services.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  What is the solution ? How can I change the app's code/behavior ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Don't tamper with the app statically. Root your phone, and use frida or LSPosed to hook & tamper with the app. That will ensure that signature integrity isn't broken & you have actually modified the app code. Make sure your rooted phone passes Play Integrity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If the amount of code you are changing is huge & hooking dynamically will slow the app down, then there are also ways to solve it.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  How can I see this protection in action ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Install \"Play Integrity API checker\" from play store. Open it and click \"Check\", and after the results, click on \"<>\" button to see the response. Take a screenshot or note it down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, just resign the app & install it. Try it again, it'll pass the tests again. Click on \"<>\" to see response and screenshot/note it down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, compare both responses. You'll notice that it'll fail some tests. \"UNRECOGNIZED_VERSION\", \"UNEVALUATED\" is what you'll see on some values instead of positive values. That's app integrity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Source code of both the app itself & server is available on Github. Try tampering with them (it should be easy now, right ? Since you have the source code now ) and try to pass those failed test. Spoilers: You won't be able to, because Google checks for the app's signature, not app itself.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Reference:\n  <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10183279\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10183279\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
