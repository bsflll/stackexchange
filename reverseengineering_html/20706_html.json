Then, a simple\n  <code>\n   push\n  </code>\n  will overwrite the saved\n  <code>\n   rip\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  As you can notice on the first picture, your saved\n  <code>\n   rip\n  </code>\n  is at\n  <code>\n   0x5561dca8\n  </code>\n  and, your\n  <code>\n   rsp\n  </code>\n  as well. Therefore, a\n  <code>\n   push\n  </code>\n  operation will store the address of the\n  <code>\n   touch3\n  </code>\n  function as return address of the stack-frame.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nothing really difficult here.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
