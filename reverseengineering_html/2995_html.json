    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Some days ago I coded a simple code to test a buffer overflow exploitation on x86 system. In order to keep it simple I disabled ASLR and NX so there are no protection that could cause weird behaviours.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is my C code to exploit:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid read_txt(){\n        char txt[64];\n        printf(\"Write something:\");\n        gets(txt);\n}\n\n\nint main(){\n    read_txt();\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I also wrote my own shellcode that just prints a string. As far as I know the payload should be something like this, fill the buffer with NOP instructions + shellcode, add 0x41414141 (AAAA) to overwrite EBP register and finally I override the return address with an address pointing to the middle of the NOPs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Actually it does not work in that way and my payload is as follows:\n </p>\n <pre><code>[1-\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x31\\xc0\\x31\\xdb\\x31\\xc9\\x31\\xd2\\xb0\\x04\\xb3\\x01\\x68\\x20\\x3b\\x29\\x20\\x68\\x68\\x73\\x65\\x63\\x68\\x20\\x48\\x69\\x67\\x68\\x48\\x6f\\x6c\\x61\\x89\\xe1\\xb2\\x0f\\xcd\\x80\\xb0\\x01\\x31\\xdb][2-\\x41\\x41\\x41\\x41][3-\\x89\\xf4\\xff\\xbf][4-\\x89\\xf4\\xff\\xbf]\n\n1- NOPs + Shellcode = 60bytes\n2- AAAA =4 bytes (Padding to fill the buffer, if NOP+Shellcode fills 64bytes it does not work)\n3- Address to override EBP (In the middle of NOPs)\n4- Overrides Return Address\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This exploit works on gdb but fails if I pass the payload directly to the program, and I think that the problem is that just before the program executes gets() function the disasembler shows the\n  <strong>\n   leave\n  </strong>\n  instruction which points esp to ebp and causes an error.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is the disassembly of read_txt() function:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0x0804844c <+0>:    push   %ebp\n   0x0804844d <+1>: mov    %esp,%ebp\n   0x0804844f <+3>: sub    $0x44,%esp\n   0x08048452 <+6>: movl   $0x8048510,(%esp)\n   0x08048459 <+13>:    call   0x8048320 <printf@plt>\n   0x0804845e <+18>:    lea    -0x40(%ebp),%eax\n   0x08048461 <+21>:    mov    %eax,(%esp)\n   0x08048464 <+24>:    call   0x8048330 <gets@plt>\n   0x08048469 <+29>:    leave  \n   0x0804846a <+30>:    ret    \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And this is the execution of the exploit on GDB:\n </p>\n <pre><code>(gdb) x/20x $esp\n0xbffff47c: 0xbffff480  0x90909090  0x90909090  0x90909090\n0xbffff48c: 0x90909090  0xc0319090  0xc931db31  0x04b0d231\n0xbffff49c: 0x206801b3  0x6820293b  0x63657368  0x69482068\n0xbffff4ac: 0x6f486867  0xe189616c  0x80cd0fb2  0xdb3101b0\n0xbffff4bc: 0x41414141  0xbffff489  0xbffff489  0xbffff500\n(gdb) s\nWarning:\nCannot insert breakpoint 0.\nError accessing memory address 0x90909090: I/O Error.\n\n0xbffff489 in ??

Also as secondary question why I can't fill the 64bytes buffer with NOPs+Shellcode?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Regards.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

There have been recently a question about this here. You can read:\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2983/how-to-predict-address-space-layout-differences-between-real-and-gdb-controlled\">\n   How to predict address space layout differences between real and gdb-controlled executions?\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  In your case, you may just have to adjust your address by adding/subtracting 96 bytes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can, also, give you a few tricks with\n  <code>\n   gdb\n  </code>\n  to help you a bit with this:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <code>\n     info frame\n    </code>\n    : This command gives you a full image of the frame you are in.

It is extremely useful to observe if you reach the right spot in the memory to modify. You may set a breakpoint on\n    <code>\n     read_txt\n    </code>\n    and display the content of the\n    <em>\n     saved eip\n    </em>\n    before and after the\n    <code>\n     gets()\n    </code>\n    is called in order to see if the modification occurred properly.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    When hitting a:\n   </p>\n   <pre><code>0xbffff489 in ??

But, it might be assembly code, especially if it is your shellcode. So, to disassemble it you can use either of these commands:\n   </p>\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     <code>\n      disas 0xbffff489,+40\n     </code>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     <code>\n      x /10i 0xbffff489\n     </code>\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Hope this help.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
