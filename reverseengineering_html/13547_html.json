Further probing might reveal that the file does not\n  contain a complete ZIP archive, but just a section which is compressed\n  with the ZIP deflate algorithm, and supposed to be decompressed with\n  the ZIP inflate algorithm (likely version 1.1.3, as the output of\n  strings revealed). Therefore, the fictitious file might be further\n  separated into its components by using a custom tool which iteratively\n  applies the inflate algorithm to the file, until the generated result\n  makes some sense (e.g. until the result contains some recognizable\n  clear text strings).\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  It seems to be the very same case for new, except that your inflate's version is 1.2.3\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
