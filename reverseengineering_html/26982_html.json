    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've dug into files of a game that was made in Unity (which uses C# language)... and i was interested in extracting 3D models and textures etc. I understand that\n  <strong>\n   data\n  </strong>\n  and\n  <strong>\n   obb\n  </strong>\n  are separate, BUT! In my case, both of these have the same contents. Half textures are in\n  <strong>\n   data\n  </strong>\n  and half in\n  <strong>\n   obb\n  </strong>\n  .. i've been able to extract from data, but i came to a stop when i looked inside\n  <strong>\n   obb\n  </strong>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  What i saw was a file named\n  <strong>\n   res.bytes\n  </strong>\n  , and i've been looking for ways to open/extract from a byte format but in the end it led me to scripting. Yes i've tried reverse engineering tools and other simple methods such as renaming it to\n  <strong>\n   .zip\n  </strong>\n  ... no luck.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If there's anyone who knows how to open this byte file with a script i'd appreciate it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I think that way we could find the used compression method.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
