Is there a way to to somehow edit the file to make it be as if the ELF file was originally compiled with the -g flag?\n(I guess part of my issue is that I also don't understand exactly what the -g flag adds for gdb, so I'm not sure if its possible to add whatever it adds)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
