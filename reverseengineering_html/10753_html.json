    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I frequently see code formatted like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>push arg\npush arg\n(...)\nmov ecx, arg\ncall function\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  If I need to call that function in Assembly, it's fine. But since I know how to consistently get the base of the functions, for the sake of organization and simplicity, I'd like to use typedefs in a DLL to call the functions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The problem's that I have no idea how to make a call use ecx to pass data. Unless I'm mistaken,\n  <code>\n   func(arg,arg)\n  </code>\n  will always assemble to two pushes and a call. If I don't use ecx the function crashes because it's a pointer to an object and it needs to be that. Is there any way to do this without inline assembly which I'd like to avoid?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
