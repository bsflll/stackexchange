It is shown below:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0LLrZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0LLrZ.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any idea of why the wildcard mnemonic couldn't be disassembled with Ghidra? Even directions to next steps in uncovering them will help :D\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you for your time!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The other instructions don't look like regular assembly code either, just a bunch of register moves without any purpose. The\n  <code>\n   ??\n  </code>\n  just means that those bytes couldn't be decoded to an instruction, which is expected to happen if Ghidra is trying to disassemble data that isn't actually code.\nIf you are sure that those bytes are really code, you might be using the wrong processor.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
