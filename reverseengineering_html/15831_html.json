    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  i have been trying to get the address of a function and use that hex number for other calculations. I have read that you cannot get the address of a function like you get the address of a variable in c/c++. I have tried casting to\n  <code>\n   void*\n  </code>\n  and function pointers but none of them seems to be working. As I get different numbers everytime I try to assign the address to a variable or pass it to a function or use it in any way.\n </p>\n <pre><code>int main(){\nstd::cout<<&funct<<std::endl;\n}\n\n//Output is: 0x010111b3\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But when I look at the disassembly the function starts at 0x01012580. And the difference is not constant. It might be a compiler issue but i don't know how to fix it. Can anyone help me please?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   UPDATE\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   SOLVED\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The issue was with the compiler options. When built using g++ i would get the normal address of the function. But when built using visual c++ compiler i would get a different address rather than the original address of the function. However switching 'Enable Incremental Linking' option off in the 'Project Properties->Linker->General' option solved my problem.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks to everyone.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
