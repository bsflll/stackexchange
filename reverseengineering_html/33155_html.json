I managed to do the following so far:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Dump the firmware from the SPI flash.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Running strings on the bin file gave the default AP name and its PSK, and a potential boot password.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Running binwalk on the file gave the below output, and this is where I am stuck. I was expecting something like uboot header or squashfs, but I am puzzled by what I am getting.\n    <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GskD8csQ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     <img alt=\"binwalk analysis\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GskD8csQ.png\"/>\n    </a>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Extracting the components with binwalk -Me gave the below result.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <h2>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fzZOq0W6.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"binwalk extraction results\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fzZOq0W6.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </h2>\n <ol start=\"5\">\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    I made more trials and ran\n    <code>\n     binwalk -Me\n    </code>\n    and\n    <code>\n     strings\n    </code>\n    on all files and dumped the output to a text file \"fw_contents.txt\"\n    <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/MSw8UWiJ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     fw_contents\n    </a>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Running\n    <code>\n     binwalk -Me\n    </code>\n    on file \"80100.7z\" gave what looks like c-source files but I failed to extract any of those files.\n    <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Cb3O4Sar.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     <img alt=\"80100.7z with binwalk\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Cb3O4Sar.png\"/>\n    </a>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    Updates:\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  I tried to extract the firmware parts manually following the memory map found in the bootlog file, and compare the extracted components to what\n  <code>\n   binwalk\n  </code>\n  extracted. The only part that matches was the\n  <code>\n   rootfs1\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   80100.7z\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried also exporting the config file from the router homepage, then I changed a single character in the default SSID name, then exported the config file again for comparison. The files were completely different. So, I guess the config file is also encrypted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried using \"unlzma\" and \"7za\" to extract the 10000.7z and 80100.7z but the files were unrecognized.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I do not know what I am looking at here, and would really appreciate it if you could provide some guidance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am happy to share the firmware\n  <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/pqbnz65zgwyfbbyde8ekx/etis_03.bin?rlkey=r897incg8nwbxodbrr8eiuait&st=gybnh0fg&dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   firmware.bin\n  </a>\n  and the bootlog\n  <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/2hf5uudr2n2xbugivf5e4/Etisalat_ZXHN_H168N_V3.5_Serial_log_normal_00.log?rlkey=jrc0gojeuo3o04isckyiiyd2d&st=kdr3pm47&dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Normalboot.log\n  </a>\n  ,\n  <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/qbcl053o7wqiul5rnvxv4/Etisalat_ZXHN_H168N_V3.5_Serial_log_testmode_01.txt?rlkey=96tnmo6hf7rpf7tov21pc8w02&st=dnvm2gke&dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Testmodelog.log\n  </a>\n  files if someone is interested.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
