You can add a structure via Structures window (View-->Open Subviews-->Structures, or\n   <kbd>\n    Shift-F9\n   </kbd>\n   ) , import the header file via File-->Load file-->Parse C header file, or\n   <kbd>\n    Ctrl-F9\n   </kbd>\n   (this will also import typedefs if needed) or use a type library as described in\n   <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/13175/how-to-import-windows-ddk-headers-into-ida\">\n    How to import Windows DDK headers into IDA?\n   </a>\n   .\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   After that you should locate cursor at the function definition, press\n   <kbd>\n    Y\n   </kbd>\n   and enter C function prototype as it stated in the function definition.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Good luck.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
