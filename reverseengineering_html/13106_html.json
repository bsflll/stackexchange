I read that ollydbg has an option to break on user input, such as a button, but since the application is question is 64 bit that's not an option. Any help on where to go from here?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Then Right click->\n  <em>\n   Message breakpoint\n  </em>\n  , a window will pop up, now select the desired window message based on what you want to pause your program after. In case of a button,\n  <strong>\n   WM_LBUTTONUP\n  </strong>\n  would do it, in case of an editbox\n  <strong>\n   WM_KEYUP\n  </strong>\n  will also work and so on, you got a ton of messages to choose from. Then you got a couple more checkboxes, select \"\n  <em>\n   ...current window\n  </em>\n  \" to pause only when the message is passed to the selected window.\nNow, sometimes these windows procs BPs won't work or even pause as expected, in this case, try checking\n  <code>\n   Use TranslateMessage\n  </code>\n  option and that would do it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
