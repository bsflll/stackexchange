However, I've seen many binaries where\n  <code>\n   argc\n  </code>\n  instead is retrieved from\n  <code>\n   esp + 4\n  </code>\n  , or\n  <code>\n   esp + 8\n  </code>\n  . Is this correct, or am I missing something? Also, why do these offset differ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/X2FWQ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Figure 3-31\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/X2FWQ.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If this happens, then the init procedure calls \"main\", pushing argc on the stack. After the call, [ESP] will point to the return address and [ESP+4] will contain argc. At the beginnig of main, a PUSH EBP will move ESP another 4 bytes back, now [ESP+8]=argc.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

The\n  <code>\n   main\n  </code>\n  is called by the C library startup code so it will follow the standard calling sequence rather than \"Initial process stack layout\". For 386, it means that\n  <code>\n   argc\n  </code>\n  will be the first value passed on the stack after the return address, and\n  <code>\n   argv\n  </code>\n  will be the second. I.e. at the beginning of\n  <code>\n   main\n  </code>\n  , the layout will look like this\n </p>\n <pre><code>|                |\n+----------------+\n| argv           | <-- esp+8\n+----------------+\n| argc           | <-- esp+4\n+----------------+\n| return address | <-- esp\n+----------------+\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  If the compiler decides to use the frame pointer, then\n  <code>\n   argc\n  </code>\n  will be typically accessed as\n  <code>\n   [ebp+8]\n  </code>\n  due to the extra 4 bytes taken by the saved\n  <code>\n   ebp\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
