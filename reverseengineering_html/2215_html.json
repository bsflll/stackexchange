    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to understand very basic stack-based buffer overflow\nI'm running Debian wheezy on a x86_64 Macbook Pro.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have the following unsafe program:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nCanNeverExecute()\n{\n        printf(\"I can never execute\n\");\n        exit(0);\n}\n\nGetInput()\n{\n        char buffer[512];\n\n        gets(buffer);\n        puts(buffer);\n}\n\nmain()\n{\n        GetInput();\n\n        return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I compiled with\n  <code>\n   -z execstack\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   -fno-stack-protector\n  </code>\n  for my tests.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have been able to launch the program through gdb, get the address of\n  <code>\n   CanNeverExecute\n  </code>\n  function which is never called, and overflow the buffer to replace the return address by this address. I got printed \"I can never execute\", which is, so far, so good.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now I'm trying to exploit this buffer overflow by introducing shellcode in the stack. I'm currently trying directly into gdb: break in\n  <code>\n   GetInput\n  </code>\n  function, set buffer value through gdb and jump to buffer adress with\n  <code>\n   jump\n  </code>\n  command.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But I have a problem when setting the buffer:\nI have a breakpoint just after gets function, and I ran the programm with 512\n  <code>\n   a\n  </code>\n  characters as input.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In gdb, I do:\n </p>\n <pre><code>(gdb) p buffer\n$1 = 'a' <repeats 512 times>\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The input was read without any problem, and my buffer is 512\n  <code>\n   a\n  </code>\n  I then try to modify its value. If I do this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>(gdb) set var buffer=\"\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and try to print buffer, its length is now 511! How come??\n </p>\n <pre><code>(gdb) p buffer\n$2 = '\\000' <repeats 511 times>et:\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And when I try to set it back to, for instance, 512\n  <code>\n   a\n  </code>\n  , I get:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Too many array elements\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I can set it to 511\n  <code>\n   a\n  </code>\n  though, it is really that las byte that doesn't work... How come, is there a simple explanation?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
