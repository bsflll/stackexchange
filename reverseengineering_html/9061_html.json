Before the patch, this value is pushed onto the stack at EIP\n  <code>\n   639C2C58\n  </code>\n  because other code in the function will likely make use of it later. After the patch, the\n  <code>\n   mov eax, ebx\n  </code>\n  instruction is effectively a no-op since the call to\n  <code>\n   CFormElement::EnsureCollectionCache\n  </code>\n  will overwrite\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  As for why the compiler made this change, it's difficult to say without seeing the rest of the function. Perhaps after the patch, the code in the rest of the function gets the value of the\n  <code>\n   int\n  </code>\n  argument from the stack relative to\n  <code>\n   ebp\n  </code>\n  as opposed to grabbing it from the top of the stack.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
