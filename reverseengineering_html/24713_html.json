For example, the following two snippets will likely be compiled to the same binary even though the source is different:\n </p>\n <pre><code> int f(int x)\n {\n  return x+1;\n }\n\n int g(int y)\n {\n  return ++y;\n }\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  (check on\n  <a href=\"https://godbolt.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://godbolt.org/\n  </a>\n  )\n </p>\n <p>\n  That said, if you do want to prove that (for example) two functions are equivalent, you can try many different approaches, e.g.:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   manual comparison of assembly code/binary diffing (may not work if very different compilers or optimizations settings were used)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   decompile both functions and compare outputs (same caveat)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   if the input state is not huge, you can run both functions with all possible inputs and compare outputs\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   in some cases things like symbolic execution or\n   <a href=\"https://yurichev.com/news/20200410_CBMC_etc/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    SMT solvers\n   </a>\n   can be applied\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  A more generic problem of detecting authorship of arbitrary code is called \"code provenance\" and there are several papers on the topic, e.g.:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <em>\n    Who Wrote This Code? Identifying the Authors of Program Binaries\n   </em>\n   (Nathan Rosenblum et al.)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <em>\n    BinPro: A Tool for Binary Source Code Provenance\n   </em>\n   (Dhaval Miyani et al.)\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
