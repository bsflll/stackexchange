Some values are addresses but some are just int values with only 8 bits. Do they use this form because this value is frequently used in other programs and needs to check before use like critical section or sth\n </p>\n <pre><code>if ( (unsigned __int64)v3 < v4 )\n  {\n    while ( 1 )\n    {\n      v6 = *v5++;\n      if ( v6 > 0x3Fu )\n        break;\n      if ( v6 )\n      {\n        ++v1;\n        v5 += v6;\n        if ( (unsigned __int64)v5 < v4 )\n          continue;\n      }\n      goto LABEL_6;\n    }\n    v7 = WPP_GLOBAL_Control;\n    if ( WPP_GLOBAL_Control == &WPP_GLOBAL_Control\n      || (*((_DWORD *)WPP_GLOBAL_Control + 7) & 0x800) == 0\n      || *((_BYTE *)WPP_GLOBAL_Control + 25) < 4u )\n    {\n      return 0i64;\n    }\n\n\n\n.data:00007FF7B0829D40 WPP_GLOBAL_Control dq offset WPP_GLOBAL_Control\n.data:00007FF7B0829D40                                         ; DATA XREF: Aging_UpdateAgingTime+32↑r\n.data:00007FF7B0829D40                                         ; Aging_UpdateAgingTime+39↑o ...\n.data:00007FF7B0829D48                 align 10h\n.data:00007FF7B0829D50 ; PWSTR g_genericDesiredAttrs\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you look for xrefs (\n <code>\n  x\n </code>\n in IDA) to\n <code>\n  WPP_GLOBAL_Control\n </code>\n you should see only two instances of\n <code>\n  w\n </code>\n (write) with everything else being reads. In a driver I am reversing right now I see the writes only in\n <code>\n  WppInitKm\n </code>\n and\n <code>\n  WppCleanupKm\n </code>\n . Probably slightly different for user mode, but in all likelihood similar. Much of the WPP/ETW/tracelogging details can be gleaned from headers and the tools that preprocess your code, if you employ WPP.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
