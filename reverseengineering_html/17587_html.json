The firmware is loaded FROM the driver and then the device will enumerate again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It seems there are many usb packet sniffing tools, software or hardware.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Then usb drive is being shown as some new usb device, to which a flasher program can connect and upload/download the firmware. In most cases switching to this programming mode requires to connect specific pins on the usb drive board. Or it automatically switches to the programming mode when usb drive firmware gets corrupted.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
