I even tried to run\n  <code>\n   FixupELFExternalSymbolsScript.java\n  </code>\n  plugin but it only works for ELF and not Mach-O.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What can I do for my first framework which depends on the types and classes defined in other frameworks to be able to access them so I could use them in the decompiler view?\n </p>\n <p>\n  If it matters I'm analyzing these macOS frameworks on a Windows host.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
