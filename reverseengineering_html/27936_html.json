On DIE (Try the Nauz File detector) if the default one doesn't find it (for more luck). If DIE doesn't have Nauz try download the stand alone here :\n <a href=\"https://github.com/horsicq/Nauz-File-Detector\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  github.com/horsicq/Nauz-File-Detector\n </a>\n</span>\n</body></html>",
