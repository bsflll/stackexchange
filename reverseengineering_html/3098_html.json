(I searched extensively in the menus etc. but couldn't find such an option)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Context: I want to see how a program I created using Xcode was compiled into machine code using Hopper to view the machine code. My program is stripped during build but I do have its symbols in a\n  <code>\n   .dSYM\n  </code>\n  package.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
