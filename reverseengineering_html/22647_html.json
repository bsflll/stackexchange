Appcall mechanism highly depends on the type information\n  of the function to be called. For that reason it is necessary to have\n  a correct function prototype before doing an Appcall, otherwise\n  different or incorrect results may be returned.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  If it's an elf and you don't have Ida,\n  <a href=\"https://lief.quarkslab.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   LIEF\n  </a>\n  is a good option.
