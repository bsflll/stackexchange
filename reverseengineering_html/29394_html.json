It loaded a dotnet assembly DLL from its Resources:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/z5Tuw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"the malware calling a method from loaded DLL\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/z5Tuw.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried stepping into\n  <code>\n   InvokeMember\n  </code>\n  function, but could not go further when hitting this call:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iv9ey.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iv9ey.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've dumped the DLL to file to analyze it statically, but the code is protected by SmartAssembly, so I cannot fully understand its behavior.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My question is: how can I step into the code of the method called by \"InvokeMethod\"? If I cannot do it directly, is there any workaround?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
