However it still seems to say int when it should be an array of my struct.  <code>seg002:00AEAD78 ; int stru_AEAD78[] seg002:00AEAD78 stru_AEAD78     sStorageItem &lt;0&gt;        ; DATA XREF: Recv16_Character:loc_408EF2w</code>  Or is it possible to have two definitions at the same place?</span>",
