Most executables have no or very few exports but there are also legitimate executables with many exports. Packing can hide exports but might also leave them visible so it’s not a reliable indicator either way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It’s better to use other means of detecting packed files: entropy, signatures, runtime analysis and so on.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
