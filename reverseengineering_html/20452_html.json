    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I had recently this situation where in a program I was debugging I found:\n </p>\n <pre><code>03CD38D4:  8B15 8C5FF703  MOV EDX, DWORD PTR DS:[3F75F8C]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  If I look for these bytes in the physical file I found nothing. I assumed this is because the reference to\n  <code>\n   3F75F8C\n  </code>\n  , which might change over each instance of the program, is being randomised by Windows. So I could not change the value directly in an hexed - say change\n  <code>\n   3F75F8C\n  </code>\n  to\n  <code>\n   3F75F88\n  </code>\n  (I suppose I can do it with some math involving the\n  <code>\n   base\n  </code>\n  , though).\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Can someone explain\n   <strong>\n    in detail\n   </strong>\n   how Windows proceeds when loading the PE file to randomise all these bytes? I have found\n   <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/18556/how-do-aslr-and-dep-work\">\n    posts\n   </a>\n   and info on how ASLR works, but I am more thinking on the steps that the OS makes to put the file in memory with the randomised addresses - i.e. how it goes from the actual bytes in the executable \"8B15 XXXX\" to \"8B15 8C5FF703\" as in my example.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   How the OS knows where the bytes that have to be randomised are (which exact addresses), and do it in a timely fashion?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Will this OS process breaks if I\n   <code>\n    NOP\n   </code>\n   the whole instruction? (I am asking because I do not know if there is some sort of predefined index table, I only know there is a flag in the PE to mark ASLR)\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   EDIT\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  As per the answer, what I undestood is that Windows will look into the\n  <code>\n   .reloc\n  </code>\n  section and will change one by one the references pointed in the section based on the random base. Then, if I modify the bytes of the instruction, since they have been defined in the\n  <code>\n   .reloc\n  </code>\n  section, my new bytes will be modified (probably I am wrong, but this is what I understood)\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, I am not able to find out how Windows \"obtains\" the instruction:\n </p>\n <pre><code>03CD38D4:  8B15 8C5FF703  MOV EDX, DWORD PTR DS:[3F75F8C]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Which is in file offset\n  <code>\n   482CD4\n  </code>\n  stored as:\n </p>\n <pre><code>MOV EDX, DWORD PTR DS:[B25F8C]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The image base is\n  <code>\n   400000\n  </code>\n  and base of code\n  <code>\n   1000\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I cannot find anything in the\n  <code>\n   .reloc\n  </code>\n  section that points to\n  <code>\n   03CD38D4\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   482CD4\n  </code>\n  or similar.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So Windows uses the <code>.reloc</code> to find all \"pointers\" that have to be realocated, correct? I have been looking at <code>.reloc</code> with PEview and cannot find where the pointer to the instruction is. Knowing that the instruction is in <code>file offset=482CD4</code>, with original ref value=[B25F8C]<code>, being </code>image base=400000` and <code>base of code=1000</code>, how Windows creates the final value [3F75F8C]?</span>",
