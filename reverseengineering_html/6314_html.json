Naturally, this means that it's a frequent source of vulnerabilities, to the point where a lot of people have just disabled the plugin entirely, and even Oracle has made it harder to run applets automatically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So if you want to find your own vulnerability, it's just a matter of looking through the standard library code (everything in rt.jar is privileged) and find something that does sensitive operations without properly validating the caller's permissions.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
