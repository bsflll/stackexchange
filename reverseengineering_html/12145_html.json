I'm looking for a table of byte frequencies for byte values v. architecture.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I recognize that those values will vary by compiler, operating system ABI / API, application, and binary format, but for my purposes I'm assuming they vary most markedly by architecture, and:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   I just need frequencies for the actual executable code- the\n   <code>\n    .text\n   </code>\n   section- not the entire binary.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   the binary's targeting one of the most common end-user operating systems from 1985 - 2005 (so, old-style unices, Linux, VMS, DOS, Windows NT, MacOS, or OSX).\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   it was compiled with default flags on the most common compilers for those systems\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <del>\n   If all that fails, I'd at least want a list of\n   <code>\n    nop\n   </code>\n   opcodes for all the most common architectures, since I think it's probably fair to assume most compilers use nops for padding, and runs of nops will help me figure out where a good entry point for a disassembler would be.\n  </del>\n  Wait, there's\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP\">\n   this list on wikipedia\n  </a>\n  . Thank you, wikipedia.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  my use case\n </h2>\n <p>\n  I have a snippet of a binary, which I'm pretty sure is executable object code (sans headers / section information. I think it's the\n  <code>\n   .text\n  </code>\n  section (or whatever you'd call that) in its original format).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm not\n  <strong>\n   sure\n  </strong>\n  that it's even from a binary, but when converted to a grayscale bitmap it has some clear patterns (stripes at regular intervals), and I've noticed that the bytes\n  <code>\n   FF FF\n  </code>\n  appear often enough, and beside other bytes in the form\n  <code>\n   Fx\n  </code>\n  , that I get the feeling I'm looking at high memory addresses. The shannon entropy is low enough I'm pretty sure it's not compressed or encrypted (around 7.76), but all 256 possible byte values are represented.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can't actually give the hexdump itself for personal reasons.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Can you tell if striping is regular or has subpatterns? If the former, it is probably a RISC architecture (all instructions are 4 bytes long) like SPARC or MIPS, otherwise it is some kind of instruction set similar to PDP-11 (all instructions are of even length, but it varies). After you've narrowed the field, you'll have to do a word-based analysis, because in most architectures with word-based instruction format the opcodes aren't byte-aligned.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
