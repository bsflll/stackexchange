True, Linear Sweep doesn't handle data properly, and jump tables & shellcodes are usually a source of disassembly errors.

Meaning, the jump is taken only if the previous instruction - which is certainly a\n  <code>\n   cmp\n  </code>\n  or a\n  <code>\n   test\n  </code>\n  - returns true. The\n  <code>\n   x86\n  </code>\n  ISA (instruction set) allows to jump in the middle of instructions, or a byte stream if you like.

It means that it disassembles instructions one after one. Like this:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    First it goes to the entry point and disassemble the first instruction (and get its size):\n   </p>\n   <pre><code>4028c0:       41 57                   push   %r15\n</code></pre>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Then, knowing the size of the previous instruction, it updates the current address to the next instruction and disassemble it (and get its size again):\n   </p>\n   <pre><code>4028c2:       41 56                   push   %r14\n</code></pre>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    And, it iterates again and again (go back to 2) until it reaches the end of the current section:\n   </p>\n   <pre><code>4028c4:       41 55                   push   %r13\n4028c6:       41 54                   push   %r12\n4028c8:       55                      push   %rbp\n4028c9:       48 89 f5                mov    %rsi,%rbp\n4028cc:       53                      push   %rbx\n...\n</code></pre>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   objdump\n  </code>\n  implementation add only one small increment on this simple algorithm, it will start on every symbols even if it appear in the middle of the current disassembled instruction. Meaning that you may have the following case (I encountered it while studying an obfuscated software):\n </p>\n <pre><code>   4028c0:       41 57                   push   %r15\n   4028c2:       41 56                   push   %r14\n   4028c4:       41 55                   push   %r13\n   4028c6:       41 54                   push   %r12\n   4028c8:       55                      push   %rbp\n   4028c9:       48 89 f5                mov    %rsi,%rbp\n   4028cc:       48 85 c0                test   %rax,%rax\n\n00000000004028cd <.f668>:\n   4028cd:       85 c0                   test   %eax,%eax\n   4028cf:       53                      push   %rbx\n   ...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The disassembler first disassembled\n  <code>\n   4028cc\n  </code>\n  as an amd64 instruction, but a symbol was at\n  <code>\n   4028cd\n  </code>\n  . So, the algorithm reseted to this value and started over from there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally, be aware that the linear sweep algorithm is widely known as being incorrect. It may be mislead very easily. Its main problem is that it does not take into account the semantics of all the instructions, so when reaching a dynamic jump (\n  <code>\n   jmp %rax\n  </code>\n  ), the algorithm won't be able to follow the execution flow. Of course, there are many other ways to mislead this algorithm, I won't try to be exhaustive here on all these techniques (note that\n  <em>\n   recursive traversal\n  </em>\n  is not really better).\n </p>\n <p>\n  To get back to your original questions:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    The linear sweep algorithm cannot track the execution flow of a program. And won't be able to jump over a data if it lays in the middle of instructions. Yet,\n    <code>\n     objdump\n    </code>\n    may incidentally be correct when a symbol point to the instruction where to jump in the middle of the previous instruction (see the case I described before).\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    To obtain a proper disassembly of this program, there is no hope with\n    <code>\n     objdump\n    </code>\n    . But, you can use\n    <code>\n     gdb\n    </code>\n    and collect an execution trace by instrumenting it though a Python script. Also, other disassembler won't be tricked by this simple layout. You may try\n    <code>\n     radare\n    </code>\n    or, as Benny suggested, IDAPro. I can also advertise a bit my own tool which is\n    <code>\n     cfgrecovery\n    </code>\n    from the\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/perror/insight\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n     Insight framework\n    </a>\n    (but it's a bit overkilling for such a simple trick).\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
