The likely problem is you are corrupting the .res file; note this is a compiled binary format, you cannot just modify it in a simple text editor, despite it containing the manifest contents in a text format. After exporting, if you make the text longer you will need to modify the .res file header, some basic details here\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/menurc/resource-file-formats\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/menurc/resource-file-formats\n  </a>\n  Alternately edit the .res file in Resource Hacker or Visual Studio then compare the files at a binary level to see what is being modified. Once you have a valid .res file to import your commands will work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can manually confirm your .res file is the problem by using Resource Hacker to manually replace your .res file, if you have corrupted it you will get a failure message.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With a corrupt .res file you will see something like this:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HDkVe.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HDkVe.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  With a valid .res file you will see output like below:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UJvni.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UJvni.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
