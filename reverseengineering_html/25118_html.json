    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  When reverse engineering a big application, it can be very useful to be able to see the network traffic it generates.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Because of this, many applications use HTTPS to communicate with their servers. Bypassing this has become easy to do with tools like Charles (SSL Proxy).\n </p>\n <p>\n  As a result, some applications have begun to use Certificate Pinning which does not allow a proxy to intercept traffic.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What are some solutions around this problem, ideally, I'm looking for a methodology, tools and techniques to do this in Windows applications.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
