    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'd like to get the inferred value of a register at a particular point in the disassembly listing in a Ghidra script.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In my case the target instruction is a\n  <code>\n   rdmsr\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   wrmsr\n  </code>\n  instruction, which reads or writes the MSR at\n  <code>\n   ecx\n  </code>\n  . While I could walk back through the previous instructions and look for a simple\n  <code>\n   mov ecx, const\n  </code>\n  pattern, there are significantly more ways to set\n  <code>\n   ecx\n  </code>\n  to some known value that the decompiler is capable of inferring.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've tried calling\n  <code>\n   getRegisterValue\n  </code>\n  on the\n  <code>\n   rdmsr\n  </code>\n  instruction, passing in a\n  <code>\n   Register\n  </code>\n  type describing\n  <code>\n   ecx\n  </code>\n  , but this just returns\n  <code>\n   None\n  </code>\n  . Is there a way to infer register values at a particular instruction?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's the disassembly:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mk8VS.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"disassembly\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mk8VS.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  And the decompiled result:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wvPUo.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"decompiled code\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wvPUo.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's the P-Code:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZwJKI.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"disassembly with p-code\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZwJKI.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I don't have a binary to test how these instructions are handled exactly though. If they in any form contain the information that they depend on the value of\n  <code>\n   ecx\n  </code>\n  then I would expect that the decompiler will optimize the PCode instruction to directly use the constant as the PCode argument instead if possible, like in the attached image. A quick glance into\n  <code>\n   x86.sla\n  </code>\n  seems like\n  <code>\n   RDMSR\n  </code>\n  is indeed defined in a way that should allow this to happen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The general results of any kind of value analysis that happens inside the decompiler is not exposed in a way that I know of though.\n </p>\n <p>\n  [0] This is not the PCode from the instruction but from the decompiler token. You can get this by clicking on a token (like\n  <code>\n   ioctl\n  </code>\n  in the decompiler and then accessing\n  <code>\n   currentLocation.token.pcodeOp\n  </code>\n  in the Jython shell\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
