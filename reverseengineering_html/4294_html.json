    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am working on some malware that currently only runs with Windows 7 is detected. I would like to use CaptureBAT, but it doesn't work on Windows 7 (with the exception of network monitoring). Is there an alternate to this that will capture deleted files?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I imagine this will need to work at the Kernel leverl for API hooking as well. I have looked at a couple of alternatives including using PowerShell to monitor file changes (\n  <a href=\"http://dereknewton.com/category/powershell/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://dereknewton.com/category/powershell/\n  </a>\n  ) and also to use the WMI process for logging data, but neither of them are a great solution and I want all captured files that the malware attempts to delete.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does anyone know of a tool that will work on Windows 7 for this?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Why not just rebuild it for Windows 7?\n </p>\n <p>\n  And based on my 10 seconds of skimming Capture BAT's described functionality, it seems that\n  <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Process Monitor\n  </a>\n  might be a viable alternative.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
