My question is simple:\n </p>\n <p>\n  In figure 4, we see at (7)\n  <code>\n   TEX.ProcessEnvironmentBlock\n  </code>\n  : is this a comment, or was IDA able to figure this out?\nWhen I reverse engineer the same payload, I see\n </p>\n <pre><code>edx, fs:[eax, 30h]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And at (8) I see:\n </p>\n <pre><code>edx, [edx, 0Ch]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  is my IDA set up not correct? I heard about hard coded vtable values(?) which have an integer identifier. Not sure if I am mixing up things at the moment, but is that what we are looking at?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

To do the same yourself, place your cursor over the memory operand (i.e.,\n  <code>\n   [eax+30h]\n  </code>\n  ) and press\n  <code>\n   T\n  </code>\n  to bring up the list of possible structures to apply.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two more notes. IDA knows about many structures, but you might have to do a few things before you're able to select them from the\n  <code>\n   T\n  </code>\n  window as described above. If you don't see the structure you want in that window:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    The first thing to try is to go to the structures window (\n    <code>\n     Shift-F9\n    </code>\n    on Windows, or\n    <code>\n     View -> Open subviews -> Structures\n    </code>\n    ) and press\n    <code>\n     Insert\n    </code>\n    to create  a structure. Then select\n    <code>\n     Add standard structure\n    </code>\n    , and choose the one you want.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    If the structure you want doesn't appear in the window popped up by\n    <code>\n     Add standard structure\n    </code>\n    , you might have to load a type library first. Go to\n    <code>\n     View -> Open subviews -> Type libraries\n    </code>\n    , then right-click and select\n    <code>\n     Load type library...\n    </code>\n    to see the list that IDA has available.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
