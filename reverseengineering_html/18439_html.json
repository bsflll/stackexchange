    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have been fascinated by reverse engineering after making several emulators and  finding the\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/pret\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   pret\n  </a>\n  community. I love the idea behind decompiling old games and recreating source code that recompiles into a matching file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I recently found an old game that was hosted by Cartoon Network that I must have played around ~2001. I downloaded the source file and it is 514 Kb file with a\n  <code>\n   .dcr\n  </code>\n  extension.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If this is anything like any other computer program, this file should store all of the games logic, images/sound, etc. that is interpreted by the Adobe Shockwave VM.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is it a feasible task to reverse engineer and extract data/code from a compiled\n  <code>\n   .dcr\n  </code>\n  file, or is this technology too outdated and proprietary to try and reverse engineer and test? Apparently the\n  <code>\n   .dcr\n  </code>\n  file is generated by the \"Director\" application. Does this mean that if I wanted to RE this game, I would have to find the exact Director version they used when creating the game so it compiles into the same bytecode? Is this too complex of a project for a single person?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Recently I researched options again and I discovered that recently someone developed:\n <a href=\"https://github.com/ProjectorRays/ProjectorRays\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  github.com/ProjectorRays/ProjectorRays\n </a>\n You can use this to decompile DCR files and also convert them into workable DIR files that can be opened with director. I used this program and it perfectly decompiled the game I was originally posting about. Good luck.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

A great initial point of reference for you is\n  <a href=\"https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=252\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   this post on the ZenHAX forum\n  </a>\n  , where a script or two have been created for use with their program,\n  <a href=\"http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   QuickBMS\n  </a>\n  . That won't teach you how to reverse the format, but if you spend some time reading\n  <a href=\"https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-28180.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   what QuickBMS scripts are comprised of\n  </a>\n  , you'll end up travelling down the path of reversing file formats using archives themselves as the sample.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I actually worked on reversing a Director application not too terribly long ago. I made notes and documented what I'd found at the time\n  <a href=\"https://www.betaarchive.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=428167#p428167\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"https://www.betaarchive.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=428500#p428500\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  , so those may be useful for ancillary points in regards to your studying.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally, you'd probably be best suited to inquire around both the\n  <a href=\"https://zenhax.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   ZenHAX\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"http://forum.xentax.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   XeNTaX\n  </a>\n  forums, since they both primarily focus on reversing file formats. That should all get you started quite nicely in the direction you're interested in heading. =)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
