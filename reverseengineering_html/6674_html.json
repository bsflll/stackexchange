I checked with a couple of tools and came to know that the file is compressed with PECompact. I think it also has reverse-engineer protection enabled because debuggers are not able to load it but other tools can disassemble it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, my question is how do I unpack the DLL and start debugging ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It looks like a very easy system to unpack.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The script\n  <a href=\"https://tuts4you.com/download.php?view.2932\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   PeCompact 2.xx - 3.xx OEP Finder\n  </a>\n  by atom0s found the OEP correctly for every unpackme I tested.  Please note that you will need to ignore a couple of exceptions (INT3 breaks and Memory access violations), but the anti-debugging will be defeated by the\n  <code>\n   DBH\n  </code>\n  instruction in ODBGScript.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For some of the unpackmes I found a simple API redirection was also present: each reference to the KERNEL32 API was redirected to a couple of instructions where the correct value was loaded in EAX followed by a\n  <code>\n   JMP EAX\n  </code>\n  instruction (see image):\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"API redirection\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5vQ5z.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  For such cases, I wrote this small script to solve the redirection (You will need to set the hard-coded value to the address of the first wrong entry):\n </p>\n <pre><code>var oep\nvar next\n\nmov oep, eip\nmov next, 00460974  // FIXME\n\nFIX:\n    mov eip, [next]\n    sto\n    mov [next], eax\n    add next, 4\n    cmp [next], 0\n    jne FIX\n\nmov eip, oep\nret\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Once this second script is completed you can dump the file and fix the IAT as usual.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, it is not clear in your post if your problems are due to the fact that you are working on a DLL instead of an EXE file. If that's the case, you can either use the\n  <a href=\"http://www.ollydbg.de/Loaddll.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   LOADDLL tool\n  </a>\n  or modify the PE header to load the DLL as an EXE (Here is an\n  <a href=\"http://www.pctools.com/security-news/unpacking-a-suspicious-dll/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   example\n  </a>\n  of how to do it on LordPE).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
