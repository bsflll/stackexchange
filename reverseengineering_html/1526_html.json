I've used Didier Steven's tools with great interest for a while, but cannot make sense of how to use his\n  <a href=\"http://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/pdf-tools/\">\n   PDF decomposing\n  </a>\n  /\n  <a href=\"http://blog.didierstevens.com/2008/10/20/analyzing-a-malicious-pdf-file/\">\n   analyzing tools\n  </a>\n  , even after watching some of his videos. They seem to require significant understanding of the underlying PDF construction, and possibly much more.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For SWF files, the tool\n  <a href=\"http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/Following-the-Wh1t3-Rabbit/SWFScan-FREE-Flash-decompiler/ba-p/5440167\">\n   SWFScan\n  </a>\n  is the kind I'm looking for: you load the file in question into the tool. From there, you can explore the links, scripts, and images. It even auto-analyses code and shows which parts may have security issues and what the issue is for each one, then gives a webpage reference with more information.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does anyone know of a good open-source GUI for Windows that can load a PDF and not execute it but extract all the scripts, compiled code, text, links, images, etc.? Ideally, it would show the relation of each, like when you click on a certain image, it would tell you what script(s) are run, which URL it goes to, and let you see the image on its own.\n </p>\n <p>\n  PDF's are so common, next to SWF, that this kind of tool seems like it would already be common. I may have overlooked it/them.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
