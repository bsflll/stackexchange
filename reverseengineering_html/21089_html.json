    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Imagine you are reverse engineering a software. This software uses a library, which is obfuscated and encrypted. The library contains a function, lets call it\n  <code>\n   secret_function\n  </code>\n  . This function is a pure function (i.e. it doesn't have any side effect and when called with the same arguments it returns always the same output).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Assuming i can call\n  <code>\n   secret_function\n  </code>\n  how may times i want, with whichever arguments i want, but i can't peek at the implementation, is it possible to build an equivalent function in another language (python for example), only analyzing the input and output values?\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is an example implementation of\n  <code>\n   secret_function\n  </code>\n  :\n </p>\n <pre><code>int secret_function(int a, int b) {\n    if (a == 234) {\n        return b*2 - a;\n    }\n    return a*b;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  A way to archive this i thought of is to call the function with every possible argument, (in the example 2^32 * 2^32, assuming a 32 bit int) and store all of them, to return them based on the arguments, like a giant lookup table. But this doesn't seem very efficient, if at all possible.\n </p>\n <p>\n  UPDATE:\nYou can assume that the function is working with fixed size arguments. So no strings or variable length arrays.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Even a simple genetic algorithm can very quickly get you to \"use a * b, unless a == 234\" (I've actually made a solver specifically for this kind of problem, though in a more general mathematical formula case). In the end, it's a rather ordinary optimization problem, where you're balancing off the storage space, computation and preparation time needed to give the correct result. More complicated algorithms can take longer to solve, which is one of the reasons why encryption works - those algorithms are specifically designed to make it extremely labor intensive to go from a set of known inputs and outputs to the private key used for the encryption.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But in any case, to have\n  <em>\n   certainty\n  </em>\n  , you must try all possible inputs. That's easy enough (though certainly laborious) for a couple integers, but quickly gets untenable for something like a string.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This is basically one of the basic problems in the machine learning field, so I would look that way instead of trying to generate a lookup table for 2^32 * 2^32 values.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You should obviously be careful that you won't have 100% guarantee that the function is equivalent and also remember that in particular fields how the output is computed is as important as the output itself. Take encryption functions: having the same outputs but exposing informations (due to memory leaks, power usage spikes and so on) for side channel attacks means that the \"equivalent\" function is in fact far worse than the original (to the point it might not be a suitable replacement).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

For instance:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   If you can't assume anything about the function\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   your model of it\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   reproduce exactly the correct value, you have no choice but to evaluate all 2^64 possibilities.

For instance, a function which is completely wrong 2^-32 of the time might be perfectly acceptable, so if you know that the special case is no bigger than this you can just pick a few random values (almost certainly not accidentally picking\n   <code>\n    a = 234\n   </code>\n   ) and solve the linear equations.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   You might not reasonably know that the function has linear parts, but know that it's no more complex than some other function. The parameters to this more complex function, when fitted to outputs from the secret function, would produce a function which matches linear behaviour for the values obtained from the function, but wouldn't necessarily be guaranteed to behave linearly for untested values; the possible behaviours of any function you choose to fit must hence endeavour to match the range of behaviours that can be considered plausible under your assumptions.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  These are big fields, and there are plenty of options that may be available to you with the benefit of the specifics of your problem.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
