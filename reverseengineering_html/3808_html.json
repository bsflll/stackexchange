For a variety of languages.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, not all dependencies nor all relationships between classes will be discovered as operation definition bodies are not parsed, thus Activity model of an operation cannot be derived ( nor its Activity Diagram ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Microsoft in Visual Studio 2010 ( I believe, through to 2015 ) included an Operation to Sequence Diagram generator for any operation selected in the editor. It has since been dropped, probably due to it being restricted to managed languages.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To derive State Machine model / diagram would also need to be cognitive of the coding convention originally employed in the source to be meaningful.  Perhaps this is an area that Machine Learning might have impact.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Collaboration Diagrams have been dropped from UML.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm suprised that parsing op bodies has not been up taken by vendors, EA, MagicDraw, not even Eclipse Papyrus for Java.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hope that helps,\nRegards\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
