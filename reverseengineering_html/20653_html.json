If you know the address of the destination, you can add an out-going cross-reference from the source address to the destination using\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idapython_docs/ida_xref-module.html#add_cref\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   add_cref\n  </a>\n  . These will show up if you press ctrl-X at the destination, or X at the source. You can also add a comment at the call site with the target address, which will result in basically a \"hyperlink\" that you can double-click or press 'enter' with your cursor over.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
