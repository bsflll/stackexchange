Even if I disable this through right click, it gets reseted every debug session. I also tried to save the desktop with the synchronization disabled, but it gets enabled again after session restart...\n </p>\n <p>\n  How can I stop IDA from synchronizing these views?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have no plugins that could cause this behavior.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
