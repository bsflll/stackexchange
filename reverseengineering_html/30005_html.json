Of course, you don't use any of the constants, so like we explained in comments on\n <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71024004/what-are-the-differences-between-different-ways-to-define-a-constant-from-perfor\">\n  your SO question\n </a>\n , no part of the assemblers output corresponds to them at all; your output is the same as for an empty file.
