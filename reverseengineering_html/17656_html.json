    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am new to disassembly, and I'm trying to understand how a 32 bit binary is operating. I have the evaluation (free) version, 32 bit (\n  <code>\n   Version 7.0.170920 macOS x86_64 (32-bit address size)\n  </code>\n  ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm used to debugging by stepping through a program, reading variables as necessary. I don't see an ability to do this in IDA, but I assume it must be there, and I'm simply missing it. (Having seen\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/11601/how-can-i-step-through-instructions-in-ida-and-know-the-current-eip\">\n   this question about python\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/13520/stepping-through-arm-firmware-image#13529\">\n   this question about ARM\n  </a>\n  , surely this must be an option for 32 bit binaries...)\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm also totally open to suggestions for a different disassembler than IDA, but I'm looking for something that is free - at least for an evaluation period of several days.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
