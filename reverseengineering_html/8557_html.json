What I am assuming is that there is a place in the binary that spells this out, but I'm not sure exactly where this information is stored.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How do you figure out the page permissions for an ELF binary from a disassembly?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

When the kernel loads up a binary into memory, it only cares about 3 types of headers.\n  <code>\n   PT_LOAD\n  </code>\n  indicating whether or not the content corresponding to the header needs to be loaded into memory,\n  <code>\n   PT_GNU_STACK\n  </code>\n  indicating whether or not the stack needs to be made executable and\n  <code>\n   PT_INTERP\n  </code>\n  for determining the interpreter used to execute the binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So yes, the kernel sets the stack as non-executable or executable depending on whether or not a program header is present in the ELF. The ELF process can later use\n  <code>\n   mmap/mmap2/mprotect\n  </code>\n  libc/system calls to give executable privileges to specific pages in memory.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
