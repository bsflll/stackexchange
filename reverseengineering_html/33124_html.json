There's a local variable (that either I have incorrectly typed, or Ghidra did it itself) that I try to retype to\n  <code>\n   int\n  </code>\n  . They are the same size in memory. It has some incorrect\n  <code>\n   enum\n  </code>\n  type.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I right-click on it and select \"Retype variable\" and then type \"int\" and click OK:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/y8pYNg0w.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/y8pYNg0w.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ghidra starts churning something and then after a second or two ... nothing changes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Why is it refusing to change the type this local variable?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
