But doing\n  <code>\n   strlen@<rax>\n  </code>\n  tells me that 'location rax is not allowed here'. Also, I'd like to flag exactly where the length is being used.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is what I have now:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov     rdi, rcx ; strlen_string\ncall    strlen\nmov     [rbp+var001], rax  \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and this is what I want to have with the new type declaration:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov     rdi, rcx ; strlen_string\ncall    strlen\nmov     [rbp+var001], rax ; string_length\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  How can I do that? Is it even possible?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I have also never seen IDA name return value locations so unless I've missed it the whole time, you'd probably need to write your own script for that.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
