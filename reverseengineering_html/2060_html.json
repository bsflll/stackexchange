It's been downloaded\nmany millions of times. However, I've moved on to other things and\nhave no plans to continue its development. Please don't ask for the\nsource code, I'm not releasing it, nor is it for sale. Colin Wilson\nhas written an open source Resource Editor which may interest those\nlooking for source code. Otherwise, Anders Melander has also created\nanother excellent Resource Editor which is still being developed.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  While this is not a direct answer as to why Resource Hacker can't work with some PE files, you may follow the author's suggestion to try out the open-source\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/stefansundin/xn_resource_editor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   XN Resource Editor\n  </a>\n  or Anders Melander's\n  <a href=\"http://melander.dk/reseditor/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   free Resource Editor\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you can reproduce the same issues in Colin Wilson's open-source XN Resource Editor, it may be much easier to inspect (via Delphi's debugger) and find the root cause.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
