    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've extracted an apk(react native) with dex2jar and jar to java through jd-qui and also with apktool, and I can view the source code but there is no clue where are the HTTP requests in the source code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I intercept the apk traffic I can see all the requests to graphql endoint but I cannot see in the source code, where they are triggered or stored.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I searched the extracted source code with some keywords such as\n  <code>\n   grahpql\n  </code>\n  endpoint name, and the server address but still no result.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And the code seems not obfuscated to me, just some parts are like;\n </p>\n <pre><code>@Metadata(d1 = {\"\\000\\026\n\\002\\030\\002\n\\002\\020\\000\n\\000\n\\002\\020\\002\n\\000\n\\002\\030\\002\n\\000\\bf\\030\\0002\\0020\\001J\\020\\020\\002\\032\\0020\\0032\\006\\020\\004\\032\\0020\\005H&\\006\\006\"}, d2 = {\"Lcom/x/z/E2EModule;\", \"\", \"launch\", \"\", \"intent\", \"Landroid/content/Intent;\", \"app_release\"}, k = 1, mv = {1, 7, 1}, xi = 48)\npublic interface E2EModule {\n  void launch(Intent paramIntent);\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Is there any way to reach where these requests are triggered or stored on the source code?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
