Why does it use the 32-bit registers for the calls?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So, you end-up with\n  <code>\n   RSI\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   RDI\n  </code>\n  which are containing the right values and you only had to transfer 32 bits from the memory to the registers... It may be seen as a small optimization.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
