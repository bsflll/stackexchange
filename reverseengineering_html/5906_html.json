Upon running it on my Raspberry pi, it segfaults without giving me any warning. Moreover, I'm unable to set breakpoints anywhere(even on the entry point). Is there some gdb/ARM quirk that I should be aware of? This has happened on an earlier occasion too with another CTF challenge.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I do get the feeling that my questions is incomplete -- however, I'm not sure what additional information I could provide to help diagnose the problem. If you could let me know what additional information is required, I could update the question with that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some output :-\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ file arm_crack1\narm_crack1: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.16, BuildID[sha1]=0xbb39a930c55e6d62c7cc083bb94567adcfe5cc3b, stripped\n$ ldd arm_crack1\n    not a dynamic executable\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I haven't tried taking a look at the binary to see if there is any dependencies. If it doesn't depend on any libraries it's probably doing syscalls directly which can change between kernel versions.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
