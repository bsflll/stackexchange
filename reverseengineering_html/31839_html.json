    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  So, I was testing a Yara rule which goes like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>rule macro_auto_run\n\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Document with macro that auto runs\"\n        \n    strings:\n        $s1 = \"AutoOpen\"\n        $s2 = \"Workbook_Open\"\n        \n    condition:\n        ($s1 or $s2)\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I created a Word file, then created a macro in the document with the name, AutoOpen, put some code in it and attempted to test it against this rule.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It did not trigger. Then I ran the utility\n  <code>\n   strings\n  </code>\n  on it. It couldn't find the word \"AutoOpen\". Used another hex editor like HxD, still nothing. Did a Unicode, Ascii search for the string as well. Nothing! I am wondering why.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit: Figured out that I need to unzip the archive and then search within those files.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
