    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  during an analysis, I had the following situation: The main thread allocates some space, the base address is 002E0000. Then it put opcodes (of the new thread) to that place. So, 002E0000 was the starting address of the new thread and later it called\n  <code>\n   CreateRemoteThread()\n  </code>\n  API and Ollydbg switchs to 002E0000 (dwCreationFlags was set to 0 , so the new thread started immediately)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, my question: When I try to set a BP on one of the virtual addresses of the new thread, I get the following error message.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IUnRN.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I also tried on Hardware BPs but it did not help. Why I can not set the BP ? In the main thread, everything was ok. How can I bypass this to analyze the new thread with all the BP setting features of Ollydbg ? Note: I am using Ollydbg v1.10\n </p>\n <p>\n  best regards,\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
