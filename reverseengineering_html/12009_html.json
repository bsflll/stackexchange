    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  When dealing with linux binaries, I like IDA as my static analysis tool and gdb as my debugger. However I have not found an effective way to integrate the two with each other.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To give an example, let's say I want to place a breakpoint. I will find the place in IDA. Then I will switch from graph to text mode, copy the instruction's address, switch to another window where gdb is running, enter in \"b *0x\", paste, and then I have my breakpoint. If PIE is enabled the process is worse. This is cumbersome. Furthermore, when stepping in gdb I don't have all the names or comments I've declared in IDA.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a better way to deal with this synchronization?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
