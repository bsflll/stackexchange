If there is no-prior knowledge I do assume you know Java and like to puzzle. Lets have a look at the most basic steps of reversing an APK.\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The first and most important rule in Reverse Engineering is, you want to know what makes it tick. This requires research, thus first research how APK works.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   First I would read the basic information about the file format, use Wikipedia (\n   <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APK_(file_format)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    APK on Wikipedia\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   After having an idea what I want to reverse I'll look for known tooling, either use Google or recommended\n   <a href=\"http://www.woodmann.com/collaborative/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Woodmann\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Ok, so Wikipedia said it was a zip file. So first unzip it, then pick-up the file and tooling that you are interested in ( classes.dex )\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   A quick Google resulted produced a\n   <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1249973/decompiling-dex-into-java-sourcecode\" title=\"Dex2Jar\">\n    stackoverflow question\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   After that you got Java, so woodmann has some Java decompilation tools.\n   <a href=\"http://www.woodmann.com/collaborative/tools/index.php/Category:Java_Decompilers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Java Decompilation at Woodmann\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Good luck, don't give up and remember if it's hard it is worth it. If it is too hard, try harder. :)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
