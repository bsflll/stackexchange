Apart from encryption techniques, you can also check other anti-reversing techniques like the good-old code obsfucation, junk bytes and how malwares analyze your runtime environment, your registry (if in windows) and your running threads to see if they are being debugged.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
