I am doing this via an arduino uno.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The problem i am having is that when i connect to it via serial (baud 115200) i get the correct output from the device but any key i press seems to come up as a random character. Is there a setting that i need to change in putty? What am i missing?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The following screenshot is just holding down the \"h\" key.\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9xzUL.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9xzUL.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
