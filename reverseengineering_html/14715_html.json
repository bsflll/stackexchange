    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to extract some images from a PS Vita game. I've managed to get a load of .bin files with names 00000.bin, 00001.bin and so on, but the file types are not the same.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Each even numbered file is a GXT file, which I have converted into PNG images, but they appear to be cut into pieces, similar (but not the same) to this:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rlODM.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://i.sstatic.net/rlODM.jpg\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the webpage where I found the above image, there was a program linked that is supposed to put the cut images together to form new images. However, this program requires both a PNG file and a LAY (layout) file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Each odd numbered file has this hex header:\n </p>\n <pre><code>11 00 00 00 42 01 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I assume this is the LAY file needed, but I am unsure about how to convert the BIN files to LAY. Simply changing the file extension does not work, TrID says that it is \"100.0% (.) LTAC compressed audio (v1.71) (1001/2)\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is an example of a pair of BIN files, and the PNG version of 00000.bin:\n  <a href=\"http://www.filedropper.com/binandpngfiles\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   http://www.filedropper.com/binandpngfiles\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm stumped about what to try next. Any guidance would be appreciated.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
