I analyze the new thread and at the end of that, it calls\n  <code>\n   RtlExitUserThread\n  </code>\n  and the thread is terminated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To visualize, you can consider the following:\n </p>\n <pre><code>  PUSH EAX                              ; dwCreationFlag = 0\n     .\n     .\n     .\n  CALL DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-28]           ; CreateRemoteThread\n     .\n  (lines which I would also like to analyze)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  As I described, the new thread starts and it ends with a call to\n  <code>\n   RtlExitUserThread\n  </code>\n  but I would like to analyze the lines after the call to\n  <code>\n   RtlExitUserThread\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  How can I go back to the main thread, because there was a lot of lines to analyze (after the call to\n  <code>\n   CreateRemoteThread\n  </code>\n  )?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
