From the link:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   This isn't a binwalk related question, as binwalk does not re-build binary images. However, you might want to take a look at the firmware mod kit, which uses binwalk for extraction and can re-build many router firmware images automatically (it may even work on this particular firmware):\n   <a href=\"https://code.google.com/archive/p/firmware-mod-kit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    https://code.google.com/archive/p/firmware-mod-kit/\n   </a>\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Now unfortunately,\n  <em>\n   firmware-mod-kit\n  </em>\n  hasn't been updated for a while, but is probably your closest bet. Otherwise, you may want to use the output of\n  <em>\n   binwalk\n  </em>\n  and try to \"cut and paste\" original and modified sections of the firmware file using the\n  <a href=\"http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dd.1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   dd\n  </a>\n  . Note that this will likely work only with very simple firmware images, as anything with checksums and sections/file length will have to be modified manually. I was able to make it happen in very limited cases where the firmware was mostly a header with a file system appended to it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
