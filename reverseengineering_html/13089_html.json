    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Are there any decompilers that generate pseudo-code that is interactive? By interactive, I mean you can select a variable and rename it. Or you can select a function call and rename the function. Or you can select an instruction in the disassembly and it will take you to the equivalent line in the pseudo-code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know that the HexRays plugin for IDA Pro can do this but are there any alternatives that also have this interactive functionality?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am looking for an interactive decompiler (meaning the output should be C-like pseudocode) - not an interactive disassembler.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The closest to a half interactive decompiler is\n  <a href=\"https://derevenets.com/\">\n   Snowman\n  </a>\n  , but is not really interactive (unless selecting which function you want to decompile when using the IDA Plugin is considered interactiveness.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is a toy \"decompiler\" (if the name is appropriate, as it's more a translator to pseudo-C than anything else) in Hopper but is neither interactive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Boomerang, REC, and all the other abandoned decompiler projects that I know, were created either as command line batch tools or had a GUI just to let you select a binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, as said at the beginning: the only interactive decompiler for native codes is the Hex-Rays one.\n </p>\n <p>\n  PS: I don't know why people is not focusing in the question instead of proposing their favourite tools... A disassembler is not an interactive decompiler.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I do have binary ninja (signed up for a beta tester) and I have to say: It is nowhere near as functional as vivisect.\nBinja only has a better graph layout and few more extras on the IL side.
