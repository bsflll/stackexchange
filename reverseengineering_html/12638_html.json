I get no errors and nothing in the Windows event viewer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am using the latest version of immunity from their website.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there anywhere else I can look for the cause of the problem? Is this a known issue? Does anyone know how to fix this problem?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cheers!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I had Python 3.5 installed on my Windows 7 laptop.  Immunity would open and then immediately close.  I installed Python 2.7 and, when I launched Immunity Debugger, it came up perfectly.  So, in addition the your environmental variables, also be careful about which version of Python you're running!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
