Most reverse engineering tools have a separate view for strings, because those are usually exceptionally useful to reverse engineers. Amirag already pointed that out for IDA.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In terms of Android that C++ file is likely going to end up as a shared object in ELF file format. These are binary files with a known structure. Simply by looking at the exported functions/symbols, it will be trivial to find the \"secret\". Even if you were to obfuscate this further, it would still not help. Obfuscation is\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   security through obscurity\n  </a>\n  . It's not\n  <em>\n   actual security\n  </em>\n  . So even writing that string as some xor-ed array of bytes or using the\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   Caesar cipher\n  </a>\n  will add no tangible protection if that's the goal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Furthermore you should\n  <strong>\n   never ever\n  </strong>\n  include the private key in code that ends up with the user. The reason why it's called a secret is because it should be\n  <em>\n   kept secret\n  </em>\n  . Just \"mangling\" the representation of this secret with a compiler isn't going to help at all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If it's a secret the user shouldn't see, this belongs on the server-side or into a HSM (hardware security module), but\n  <em>\n   not\n  </em>\n  on the user's machine in\n  <em>\n   any\n  </em>\n  form. There is no other way to reconcile\n  <em>\n   mistrusting\n  </em>\n  the user and at the same time placing \"secrets\" into the user's hands. It's the fundamental conundrum of software protection mechanisms also.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

However, if you mean Windows Notepad, that has typically huge problems with Unix line breaks and besides, there's no telling how many line breaks there are anyway in a binary. So the text may appear in one long line. That said, if your ten-year-old knows to turn it on, they can make use of the Word Wrap feature to mitigate that problem to some extent.</span>",
