    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Ditto. Any technique that allows to intercept sys calls issued from a shared object file? At runtime, the shared object is\n  <code>\n   dlopen\n  </code>\n  'ed by main().\n </p>\n <p>\n  One candidate is to use static binary rewriting (e.g. dyninst). But as I tried, it throws an error (saying about\n  <code>\n   r_debugCheck()\n  </code>\n  failed). Wondering if anyone had experiences in this task.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
