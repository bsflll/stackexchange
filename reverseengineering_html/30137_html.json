I don't even know what the character in front of “Star” means.\n </p>\n <p>\n  “SAV500D” seems to be the model, the following lines seem to be serial numbers. I have two of them, only the first line is the same.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks a lot for any help!\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ny15b.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"soc\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ny15b.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
