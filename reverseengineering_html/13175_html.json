They go so deep, they make me spend more time on adding structs rather than actually reversing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there any way of doing this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I did try parsing the file I need with\n  <kbd>\n   Ctrl\n  </kbd>\n  +\n  <kbd>\n   F9\n  </kbd>\n  , but IDA doesn't understand stuff like e.g.\n  <code>\n   #include\n  </code>\n  s and errors, making this option impossible to use\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Now load the test driver into IDA. If done correctly, All types should be available.\nYou should be able to export all types via\n  <code>\n   File->Produce File->Dump typeinfo to IDC file...\n  </code>\n  then load the script back\n  <code>\n   File->Script File...\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
