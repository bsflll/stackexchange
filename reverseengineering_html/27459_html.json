It is the one at offset\n  <code>\n   0x1180\n  </code>\n </p>\n <pre><code> 115: int main (int argc, char **argv, char **envp);\n │           0x00401180      55             push ebp \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  but the rest is wrong.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If we look at the code in the main function especially around the call to your first identified function we can see.\n </p>\n <pre><code>0x00401193      50             push eax\n0x00401194      6800214000     push str.Enter_Your_Pass_Key_:__n ; 0x402100 ; \"Enter Your Pass Key : \n\" ; int32_t arg_8h\n0x00401199      e8b2feffff     call fcn.00401050\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  From the arguments passed to this function (const string \"Enter Your Pass Key\") we could indicate that the function at offset\n  <code>\n   0x1050\n  </code>\n  is more like a printing function than one that validates your input.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also further code that looks like this\n </p>\n <pre><code>0x004011a4      51             push ecx                    ; int32_t arg_ch\n0x004011a5      6818214000     push 0x402118               ; \"%s\" ; int32_t arg_8h\n0x004011aa      e811ffffff     call fcn.004010c0\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  indicates that here we take the input from the user so it would be hard to validate it before getting it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Spotting function that does the validation is also simple in this task, as it is just before some comparison and printing good/bad info.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In here the comparison is at\n  <code>\n   0x11c1\n  </code>\n  and the function before is\n  <code>\n   0x0401100\n  </code>\n  and it takes the user input as an argument. So that's good indicators that it is the validation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And inside this function we can see that a interesting string is being loaded to a local variable\n </p>\n <pre><code>0x0040110d      c745f4f82040.  mov dword [var_ch], str.elite ; 0x4020f8 ; \"elite\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and later it is being compared (byte by byte) with our input. So the valid input is for this program is \"elite\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ieyhA.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ieyhA.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
