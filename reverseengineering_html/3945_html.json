    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I want to know how to accomplish this task with python pydbg. How does pydbg trace an instruction? For instance: should I set a breakpoint at the instruction address? Then what should I do?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Instruction:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Address                Opcode\ngame.exe+31C2CB        eax,[ecx+00000FB0]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So, using pydbg. I want to find out what addresses does this instruction access.\n </p>\n <p>\n  More Info:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Platform: Windows 7 x64\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Python 2.7\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Game: World of warcraft x32\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  What I am actually doing is a Bot that will read the player's health from the process memory and depending on the percentage it will heal him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The problem is that the address for the player's health is dynamic. I've followed a lot of guides on how to find pointers for dynamic addresses / how to defeat DMA, but with no success.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, I am trying to find another way of finding the player's health address which is by tracing the instruction that accesses it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can do this by using cheat engine but I want to implement this feature into my bot so it can automatically find the player's health address.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It all depends on what you exactly want, my guess is to write a Cheater Application of sorts (due to the term cheat engine).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thus I'd recommend to use a standalone Module.\nThese are a small list of Python modules that can disassemble code:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   pydbg\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   pyida\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   distorm\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   radare2\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   pyew\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   byteplay\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I've searched for pydbg, downloaded it, played with it for a while and read about it on <a href=\"http://pedramamini.com/PaiMei/docs/PyDbg/private/pydbg.pydbg.pydbg-class.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pedramamini.com/PaiMei/docs/PyDbg/private/â€¦</a> its really awesome and even helps in memory reading which i hope i knew about it earlier! but i still have no clue how to trace the instruction. Thanks again.</span>",
