How can I save back a binary after having edited the hex view?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

More precisely, IDA never modifies the input file.\n  The image of the input file which was loaded to the database will be\n  modified.  You can modify the image of the input file:\n  </p>\n  <pre><code>    - change a byte\n    - change a word\n    - enter an assembler instruction (only for IBM PC)\n</code></pre>\n  <p>\n   IDA will display the original value, the current value and file\n  offset. If the file offset is equal to 0xFFFFFFFF then the current\n  byte comes from a compressed page (LX/LE/NE iterated pages, for\n  example) and/or it is not possible to tell the file position.  You can\n  create a difference file and use an external tool to apply the patches\n  or you can apply the patches directly to the file using IDA.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The following commands are availabe:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Patch byte or word  Assemble...  Apply patches to input file...\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   See also:   Produce EXE file  Produce DIF file  Edit submenu.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
