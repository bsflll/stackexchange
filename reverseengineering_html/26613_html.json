Finding\n  <em>\n   what\n  </em>\n  tools to use is. I am pretty experienced with Python, but am open to using any language to patch and create a new executable automatically. Has anyone automated a workflow like this before? I know this stack exchange should be more geared towards specific reverse engineering questions, but I figured this might be the best place to post my question. Thanks to all of those who reply in advance.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
