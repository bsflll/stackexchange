    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  My situation is that I'm trying to find the send function of an online game. I found the buffer pointer and looked what accesses to it. It was obviously an instruction, which used the buffer pointer, but if I breakpoint on that instruction it doesn't contain the buffer ptr.\nWhy are the values different if I breakpoint?\nFirst Picture: edx stores the adress of the buffer.\nSecond Picture: Breakpoint on that same exact instruction, but edx is not the same, which doesn't really make sense.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HjoCx.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"edx stores the adress of the buffer\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HjoCx.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lRNbv.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"breakpoint on the same exact instruction\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lRNbv.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
