    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to remove a nag screen. Its window style is 16C80000, which should translate to\n  <code>\n   WS_VISIBLE | WS_CLIPCHILDREN | WS_CLIPSIBLINGS | WS_CAPTION | WS_SYSMENU\n  </code>\n  . So, in the call to CreateWindowExW() I set a conditional breakpoint at\n  <code>\n   PUSH EAX\n  </code>\n  , which determines the style.\n  \n\n  The conditions I tried were\n  <code>\n   [EAX] == 16C80000\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   [EAX] == WS_VISIBLE | WS_CLIPCHILDREN | WS_CLIPSIBLINGS | WS_CAPTION | WS_SYSMENU\n  </code>\n  . Both give the same results.\n  \n\n  What happens is that the conditional breakpoint pretty much acts as a normal breakpoint I think. I get breakpoints at\n  <code>\n   Style = WS_POPUP\n  </code>\n  , and many other styles which I didn't specify. What I'd like is to find out what I'm doing wrong so that I can find the call to that goddamn nag :)\n  \n\n  <img alt=\"Screenshot\" src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/e04bae3cdaecec0531553e372c5be442.png\"/>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In the screenshot you can see that I've set a conditional breakpoint at <code>PUSH EAX</code>. It made a breakpoint when EAX was 80000000, even though the condition was equal to <code>[EAX] == 16C80000</code>. Why?</span>",
