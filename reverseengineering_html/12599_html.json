The call to _grSstScreenHeight is returned in eax and then saved in ebx, and finally moved in edx.\nThe call to _grSstScreenWidth is returned in eax.\n </p>\n <p>\n  so sub_457048 will be eax (width) and edx (height) which is correct.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The intermediate step to store the value in ebx, is because it's not known to the caller if _grSstScreenWidth will overwrite edx (as it is allowed to, according to the STDCALL calling convention\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#stdcall\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#stdcall\n  </a>\n  ). On the other hand, _grSstScreenWidth has to preserve ebx.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You're right however, IDA did not seem to see that the value returned by _grSstScreenWidth was to be stored in v4\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
