    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <h3>\n  Background\n </h3>\n <p>\n  In my endeavor to RE my router, I'm trying to emulate a router's firmware inside a QEMU MIPS system. I have debian-mips installed to a virtual disk that runs just fine. Its a MIPS32 Big Endian system. I don't have any issue with the debian system. I have extracted the root file-system and uploaded it to the debian-mips system.\n </p>\n <h3>\n  Issue\n </h3>\n <p>\n  My issue is when I attempt to run any of the binaries from the router firmware:\n </p>\n <pre><code>root@debian-mips:~/firm# chroot . ./bin/busybox.old \n./bin/busybox.old: can't load library 'libcms_boardctl.so'\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However, I know it's there:\n </p>\n <pre><code>root@debian-mips:~/firm# ls -l ./lib/public/\ntotal 1512\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root    7280 Jun 28 18:27 libcms_boardctl.so\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root   11320 Jun 28 18:27 libcms_msg.so\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root  148944 Jun 28 18:27 libcms_util.so\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 1083432 Jun 28 18:27 libcrypto.so.0.9.8\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root  275712 Jun 28 18:27 libssl.so.0.9.8\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Maybe my google-fu is lacking, but there is not much information on the internet about chrooting MIPS environments. Thank you for your time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit add'l file info:\n </p>\n <pre><code>root@debian-mips:~/firm# file public/libcms_boardctl.so \npublic/libcms_boardctl.so: ELF 32-bit MSB shared object, MIPS, MIPS32 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, corrupted section header size\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If someone has more information why this happens please leave me a comment :)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
