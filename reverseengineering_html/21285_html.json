The initial number of rotations is the ASCII value of the last letter of the string plus 5.\n </p>\n <pre><code>def encode(the_string):\n   ALPHABET='ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n\n   encoded_string = ''\n   rotations = (ord(the_string[-1]) + 5) % 25\n\n   for i in range(0, len(the_string)):\n       alphabet_rotate = ALPHABET\n       print('Rots:',rotations)\n       for j in range(0, rotations):\n           alphabet_rotate = alphabet_rotate[1:-1] + alphabet_rotate[0] + alphabet_rotate[-1]\n\n       encoded_string += ALPHABET[alphabet_rotate.index(the_string[i])]\n       rotations += (ord(the_string[i]) - 2) \n       rotations %= 25\n\n   return encoded_string\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I am trying to write a decoding method however I am struggling to find the the correct offsets for the rotations. I am reversing the direction of the shifts. Also the lookup of the decoded letter works in reverse. Is this the correct approach? Any help will be appreciated.\n </p>\n <pre><code>def decode(the_string):\n    ALPHABET='ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n\n    decoded_string = ''\n    rotations = (ord(the_string[-1]) + 3) % 25 # <== 1. PROBLEM HERE\n\n    for i in range(0, len(the_string)):\n        alphabet_rotate = ALPHABET\n\n        for j in range(0, rotations):\n            alphabet_rotate = alphabet_rotate[-2] + alphabet_rotate[0:-2] + alphabet_rotate[-1]\n\n        decoded_string += alphabet_rotate[ALPHABET.index(the_string[i])]\n\n        rotations += (ord(the_string[i]) +20 ) # <== 2. PROBLEM HERE\n        rotations %= 25\n\n    return decoded_string   \n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

However I had a short look at it and I don't think there's a way to decode the string directly. The first and all subsequent rotations depend on the last plaintext char. We do not know that char and it isn't part of the encoded string. That only leaves bruteforce until one decoding makes sense, if I didn't miss an obvious hint.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Therefore, I don't think we can decode a given string directly.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Plaintexts with characters outside A-Z can be encoded but I'm not sure we can decode them properly. For my analysis I assumed A-Z inputs only.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    There seems to be some oddness around rotations because effectively it does\n    <code>\n     idx % 25\n    </code>\n    instead of 26. If the input character is below 65 (='A'), it will be rotated to 'Y', not 'Z'.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  That said, the following decodes a given encoded string and a given initial rotation which is not known:\n </p>\n <pre><code>def decode(string,initial):\n    alph = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n\n    rot = initial\n\n    decoded = \"\"\n\n    for i in range(len(string)):\n        c = string[i]\n        plain = alph[(alph.index(c)+rot) % (len(alph)-1)]\n        decoded += plain\n\n        rot += ord(plain)-2\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  If we add a line to the encode function to spit out the initial rotation we can test this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>print(decode(encode(\"HELLO\"),84))\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  prints\n  <code>\n   HELLO\n  </code>\n  correctly given the initial rotation of 84 as printed by the modified\n  <code>\n   encode\n  </code>\n  function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now we have one clue to verify if we got the proper decoding. The first rotation and the last plaintext character are in relation:\n </p>\n <pre><code>first rot = ord(last plaintext char) + 5\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So we can test all initial rotations and the verify the above.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   However\n  </em>\n  , the equality is under modulo 25. For example the 'HELLO' line can be properly decoded with the initial rotation 84 - but also with 9 (which you get by doing 84 % 25).\n </p>\n <p>\n  If we write a function to find a proper decoding like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>def find_decoding(string):\n    for i in range(26):\n        decoded = decode(string,i)\n        if ((ord(decoded[-1])+5) % 25) == i:\n            print(\"Key %d valid: %s\" % (i,decode(string,i)))\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  we can then find initial rotations for which the mentioned relationship holds. Interestingly 'HELLO' seems to be a rare input with multiple possible keys in the range 0-25:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Key 4 valid: CTQVJ\nKey 9 valid: HELLO\nKey 14 valid: MOGBT\nKey 19 valid: RYBQY\nKey 24 valid: WJVGE\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  but any other string I tried randomly only had one valid initial rotation.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
