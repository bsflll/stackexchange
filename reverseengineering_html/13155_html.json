    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I wonder how is that possible.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I found debugger detection in TLS Callback function - there is conditional jump after some check.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I step over it with debugger and modify ZF flag to bypass detection everything works fine. But when I try to patch this jump to the opposite (jne to je) application freezes and bombards me with OutputDebugString.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I don't save patch to the file, I patch it while process is in memory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was interested how this patch is detected, so I set Hardware Access Breakpoints on bytes that I patched, and then run it. Breakpoints weren't hit, and yet application changed it behavior just like it always do when I patch.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Notice that difference in code flow have nothing to do with this detection since when I modify ZF flag application works fine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I am very baffled, how does this application detects that patch, when it doesn't apparently access memory that I patched? Or is Hardware Access Breakpoint imperfect? I am interested in general ideas, how would you go about detecting whether your code was patched or not, without hitting hardware breakpoints.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
