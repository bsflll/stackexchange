In this case I would pair the device with dummy wifi network, and then redirect all the packets to your computer via wifi proxy with software like Burp Suite, that allows sniff and intercept packets out of the box. It can also work with https if the device doesn't check if the server certificate is correct.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Now, I'm willing to build a longer term solution with my 8 AC units scattered around my house, connected onto a meshed wifi setup. The wifi pairing process is a PITA, and I don't think I'll be able to put them all in the range of one single access point. If it was only about reverse engineering, I would probably do what you say with one AC unit; but when I'm done, I want to run a custom control server replica, and I feel like it will work smoother the way I 'm thinking.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

This way, all of their internet-bound traffic traversers the router, and you can monitor everything passively from there. The router can serve DNS, which you will be able to customize to do what you'd like. On the router, you could run a simple packet capture with tcpdump, intercept HTTP using mitmproxy, and/or redirect all traffic to a server of your choice.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
