I suggest you ask additional, specific, questions as you continue your process.\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  First steps would probably be to get the apk, extract the java & native code from it and reverse your way to the encryption algorithm.

This is a well known attack model, and any decent symmetric encryption algorithm is expected to withstand it, though it's possible they're using a homegrown or broken algorithm. If they're using asymmetric crypto, there's no chance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As mentioned above, you should start by reversing the application itself. That will hopefully tell you which algorithm they are using, and if they are using symmetric crypto, it will probably tell you the key as well.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
