I want to highlight the code paths taken so that I only reverse engineer the parts that are being executed. Unfortunately, Lighthouse only plugs into IDA Pro and Binary Ninja paid versions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Perhaps there is a free plugin for Ghidra or radare2/Cutter?\n </p>\n <p>\n  If such a plugin is not available, how can I go about making something like that? What would be the basic building blocks?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
