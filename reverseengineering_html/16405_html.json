For example, RTF usually begins with\n  <code>\n   {\\rtf1\n  </code>\n  , contains many embedded commands  (some using nested\n  <code>\n   {}\n  </code>\n  for parameters) and ends with a matching\n  <code>\n   }\n  </code>\n  . If there is extra data after the final\n  <code>\n   }\n  </code>\n  , it's not part of the document but could be part of the payload used by the exploit inside the main body. It is of course not a 100% indicator of a malicious file but just one of the possible hints that it should be checked more thoroughly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To confirm, you can try running it on this sample RTF file from Wikipedia:\n </p>\n <pre><code>{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fswiss Helvetica;}\\f0\\pard\nThis is some {\\b bold} text.\\par\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Add some extra data at the end and see if it triggers the warning.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
