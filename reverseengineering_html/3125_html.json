Why it's impossible to reassemble Silverlight5 runtime  with\n  <code>\n   ildasm\n  </code>\n  /\n  <code>\n   ilasm\n  </code>\n  ?\n </p>\n <pre><code>ildasm.exe /out=System.Windows.Browser.il System.Windows.Browser.dll\nilasm.exe /dll System.Windows.Browser.il\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  It works perfectly with .NET runtime and with Silverlight applications but not with Silverlight runtime.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
