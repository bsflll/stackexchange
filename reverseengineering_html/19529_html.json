Currently I've downloaded a copy of the firmware and uncompressed it. I opened the folder with the filesystem contents and found\n  <code>\n   compat squashfs.tmp squashfs.tmp.md5 version.tmp vmlinux.tmp vmlinux.tmp.md5\n  </code>\n  . I checked to see which file was the biggest and found\n  <code>\n   squashfs.tmp\n  </code>\n  to be the biggest at about 78MB in size. I ran binwalk with the -e flag but that didn't extract the filesystem.
