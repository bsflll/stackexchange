If he/she has the same behavior happen by attempting to patch via another program, then the issue isn't x32dbg. Finally, from the bottom of OP's post: <code>\"Any ideas why the patches are not working? Do I need to take a different approach?\"</code> Perhaps, with that approach being to try a different program.</span>",

HxD did edit them correctly, however; the application still closes.  Also, the values at the addresses weren't what I expected (84 and 74).   I'm currently writing a C++ application to boot it on the fly and hopefully bypass.</span>",
