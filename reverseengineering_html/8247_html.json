The second breakpoint is for deleting that hardware breakpoint.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the condition script for the hardware breakpoint you can do whatever you want: check for a specific value being written, check surrounding values etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note:\n  <a href=\"http://www.cheatengine.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   CheatEngine\n  </a>\n  was written expressly for tasks like that. You might get results quicker and more easily if you get CheatEngine instead of trying to make sense of IDAs meagerly documented - and often quite bizarre - interfaces.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's a rudimentary script that you can adapt by modifying the test in\n  <code>\n   target_check_()\n  </code>\n  and adapting the stack offset in\n  <code>\n   set_target_breakpoint_()\n  </code>\n  . The values there are from a quick test that I did to ensure that the code works.
