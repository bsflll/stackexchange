But for actually changing anything I would need a connection between the decompiled code and the bytecode.\nIs there a tool that can show this\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

There are a number of tools you can use for this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As for understanding the connection between source code and bytecode, that's just a matter of practice. I'd recommend starting by reading the JVM specification. Then compile some simple Java examples and take a look at the resulting bytecode. Luckily, Java RE is a lot easier than native code, so you have experience with that, it shouldn't be too hard to learn.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
