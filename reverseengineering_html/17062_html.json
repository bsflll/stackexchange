    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Given the sample code below:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <iostream> \n\nstruct Data {\n    int a;\n    int b;\n    int c;\n};\n\nint main() {\n    Data *d = new Data;\n    d->a = 1337;\n    d->b = 1338;\n    d->c = 1339;\n\n    std::cout << d << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Printing out the address of the pointer\n  <code>\n   d\n  </code>\n  is never the same (which seems logical). But the pointer that points to the base of\n  <code>\n   d\n  </code>\n  is also never the same.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way to find a static address that is always the same and points to the base of\n  <code>\n   d\n  </code>\n  ? Or do I need to do this with a signature scan?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The main purpose is to always have a pointer to the base of\n  <code>\n   d\n  </code>\n  , without disassembling it when I restarting the program.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
