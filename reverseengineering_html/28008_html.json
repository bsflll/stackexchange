I am just amazed, how easy this was possible, Thank you very much. btw: I can't accept a comment as a solution - if you dont mind, just post it as answer; I will accept.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

If the binary is not obfuscated/protected, you just have to open-up your application in a .NET editor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  DnSpy is the one that I find the most complete. Other software can be used, like ILSpy for instance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Theses tools allows you to edit the decompiled code, then to re-compile it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In your case, you have to find where this IP is being declared, change it to whatever you want, then recompile the binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is not allays that easy, but you are lucky: you found the easier reverse-engineering case :)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
