    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to debug Control Panel and I'd like to disassemble\n  <code>\n   shell32.dll\n  </code>\n  . Because control panel is a 64-bit executable, it loads the 64-bit version of the dll (contrary to the name). When I view the disassembled code in debug mode, I can confirm that it is indeed 64-bit. Ida claims that it's located at\n  <code>\n   C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\shell32.dll\n  </code>\n  ; however this dll is entirely 32-bit. I also checked\n  <code>\n   C:\\WINDOWS\\SysWOW64\\shell32.dll\n  </code>\n  , but it's also 32-bit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can someone explain what's going on here?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The effect occurs when a 32-bit executable requests a copy of a file in the Windows directory.  Since a 64-bit result would probably make no sense to a 32-bit executable, you get the 32-bit copy instead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you use Explorer to copy the file from the system32 directory, and then examine the result, you will find that it is a 64-bit executable.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
