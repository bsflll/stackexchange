This is how it look in Ollydbg over Windows XpSp3 32Bit:\n </p>\n <pre><code>MOV EAX,ESP\nADD EAX,0x20\nCMP EAX,0xFFFFF\nJLE SHORT 008A3E51\nCMP EAX,0x12A5B0\nJLE SHORT 008A3E38\nJMP SHORT 008A3E26\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  In above at\n  <code>\n   CMP EAX, 0x12A5B01\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   0x12A5B0\n  </code>\n  is\n  <code>\n   Eax\n  </code>\n  value in Register.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If it is the same then jump or not.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, my problem is that this\n  <code>\n   Eax\n  </code>\n  value differ as per change in different OS.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Which result in a fail.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, what is the correct and Generic way to get the same compare value in all Window OS ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I assume he has a function that he wants to patch - do something special if called from a specific point during execution, do \"the normal thing\" everywhere else. \"How can i patch a function in an existing binary so it behaves differently under very specific circumstances\" is probably the question the OP should have asked, but i'm peeking into a crystal ball here.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Your\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  register is initialized from the stack pointer, which may be different dependent on OS, OS Version, ASLR, loaded DLLs+DLL Versions,  localization, and probably a bunch of extra stuff that doesn't come to mind right now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You just shouldn't assign any meaning to any specific stack pointer value. You can assume it gets initialized to a value that can hold a certain amount of stack space you can\n  <code>\n   push\n  </code>\n  stuff to, and you can compare the value before and after some\n  <code>\n   push\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   pop\n  </code>\n  operations, but the absolute value just has no meaning whatsoever. So your question 'how can i get the same value in all Windows OS' doesn't really make sense.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Of course, you can replace your\n  <code>\n   mov eax, esp\n  </code>\n  with\n  <code>\n   mov eax, 123456h\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   xor eax, eax\n  </code>\n  , and you'll have the same value guaranteed on all versions of Windows. But while this is technically an answer to your question, it's quite probably quite useless as well.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
