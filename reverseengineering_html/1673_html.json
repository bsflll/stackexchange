The binary program is composed of two parts:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   A decoder\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   An encoded payload\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  When executed, the binary first goes to the decoder and decode the\npayload that unveil the real assembly code. At the end, the decoder\njumps to the decoded payload and execute the code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The benefit of this technique is that statically disassembling the\nbinary will not give you hints on what is really doing the program.\nSomehow, it forces the analyst to execute first the decoder part (for\nreal or symbolically) and, then, look at the decoded payload.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the proposed example, the decoder part is the following:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0804840c <main>:\n 804840c:       be 1e 84 04 08          mov    $0x804841e,%esi\n 8048411:       89 f7                   mov    %esi,%edi\n 8048413:       b9 26 00 00 00          mov    $0x26,%ecx\n 8048418:       ac                      lods   %ds:(%esi),%al\n 8048419:       34 aa                   xor    $0xaa,%al\n 804841b:       aa                      stos   %al,%es:(%edi)\n 804841c:       e2 fa                   loop   8048418 <main+0xc>\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  You can see that there is a loop between\n  <code>\n   0x8048418\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   0x804841c\n  </code>\n  which apply a xor\n  <code>\n   0xaa\n  </code>\n  to each byte in the payload (from\n  <code>\n   0x804841e\n  </code>\n  to\n  <code>\n   0x804841e + 0x25 = 0x8048443\n  </code>\n  , the loop counter is\n  <code>\n   %ecx\n  </code>\n  ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, the best way to know what is done in the payload is to take\n  <code>\n   gdb\n  </code>\n  and to set a breakpoint after the decoder has completed his task:\n </p>\n <pre><code>GNU gdb (GDB) 7.4.1-debian\nCopyright (C) 2012 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later\n(gdb) break main\nBreakpoint 1 at 0x804840c\n(gdb) run\nStarting program: ./instruction_camouflage\n\nBreakpoint 1, 0x0804840c in main ()\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Lets check that the code hasn't change.\n </p>\n <pre><code>(gdb) disas\nDump of assembler code for function main:\n=> 0x0804840c <+0>: mov    $0x804841e,%esi\n   0x08048411 <+5>: mov    %esi,%edi\n   0x08048413 <+7>: mov    $0x26,%ecx\n   0x08048418 <+12>:    lods   %ds:(%esi),%al\n   0x08048419 <+13>:    xor    $0xaa,%al\n   0x0804841b <+15>:    stos   %al,%es:(%edi)\n   0x0804841c <+16>:    loop   0x8048418 <main+12>\n   0x0804841e <+18>:    and    0x29(%edi),%ecx\n   0x08048421 <+21>:    inc    %esi\n   0x08048422 <+22>:    scas   %es:(%edi),%al\n   0x08048423 <+23>:    sub    %ecx,0x5a(%esi)\n   0x08048426 <+26>:    sub    %ebp,-0x52(%esi)\n   0x08048429 <+29>:    ret    $0x2e9c\n   0x0804842c <+32>:    scas   %es:(%edi),%al\n   0x0804842d <+33>:    mov    %al,0x55541742\n   0x08048432 <+38>:    push   %ebp\n   0x08048433 <+39>:    and    0x69(%esi),%eax\n   0x08048436 <+42>:    loop   0x8048407 <frame_dummy+39>\n   0x08048438 <+44>:    mov    $0xc5,%dh\n   0x0804843b <+47>:    mov    %ch,%bh\n   0x0804843d <+49>:    vshufps $0x8b,%xmm6,%xmm4,%xmm1\n   0x08048442 <+54>:    mov    0x909090aa,%al\n   0x08048447 <+59>:    nop\n...\n   0x0804844f <+67>:    nop\nEnd of assembler dump.\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Let's put a breakpoint just after the loop and continue till it is reached.\n </p>\n <pre><code>(gdb) break *0x0804841e\nBreakpoint 2 at 0x804841e\n(gdb) continue\nContinuing.\n\nBreakpoint 2, 0x0804841e in main ()\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now, we should be able to access the code as it will be executed.\n </p>\n <pre><code>(gdb) disas\nDump of assembler code for function main:\n   0x0804840c <+0>: mov    $0x804841e,%esi\n   0x08048411 <+5>: mov    %esi,%edi\n   0x08048413 <+7>: mov    $0x26,%ecx\n   0x08048418 <+12>:    lods   %ds:(%esi),%al\n   0x08048419 <+13>:    xor    $0xaa,%al\n   0x0804841b <+15>:    stos   %al,%es:(%edi)\n   0x0804841c <+16>:    loop   0x8048418 <main+12>\n=> 0x0804841e <+18>:    and    %ebp,%esp\n   0x08048420 <+20>:    sub    $0x4,%esp\n   0x08048423 <+23>:    and    $0xfffffff0,%esp\n   0x08048426 <+26>:    add    $0x4,%esp\n   0x08048429 <+29>:    push   $0x8048436\n   0x0804842e <+34>:    call   0x80482f0 <puts@plt>\n   0x08048433 <+39>:    mov    %ebp,%esp\n   0x08048435 <+41>:    ret    \n   0x08048436 <+42>:    dec    %eax\n   0x08048437 <+43>:    gs\n   0x08048438 <+44>:    insb   (%dx),%es:(%edi)\n   0x08048439 <+45>:    insb   (%dx),%es:(%edi)\n   0x0804843a <+46>:    outsl  %ds:(%esi),(%dx)\n   0x0804843b <+47>:    and    %dl,0x6f(%edi)\n   0x0804843e <+50>:    jb     0x80484ac <__libc_csu_init+76>\n   0x08048440 <+52>:    and    %ecx,%fs:(%edx)\n   0x08048443 <+55>:    add    %dl,-0x6f6f6f70(%eax)\n   0x08048449 <+61>:    nop\n   ...\n   0x0804844f <+67>:    nop\nEnd of assembler dump.\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And, still there is these strange instructions after the\n  <code>\n   ret\n  </code>\n  , lets visualize it as a string.\n </p>\n <pre><code>(gdb) x /s 0x08048436\n0x8048436 <main+42>:     \"Hello World!\n\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So, we found all the pieces of the program and how it works.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
