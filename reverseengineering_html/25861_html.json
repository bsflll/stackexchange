    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I got a Greenlite AIRZ thermostat which connects to my home wifi so that I can change the settings remotely on my phone. The Android app is, however, difficult to use, so I'm thinking about making my own. I found its IP address, put it in a browser, and it said verbatim\n  <code>\n   File / not_found\n  </code>\n  . The thermostat also rejects my request to connect to port 21/22. How should I proceed from here? Is the underscore between\n  <code>\n   not\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   found\n  </code>\n  a quirk of a specific server that would allow me to probe further?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The second best option would be to look at the network traffic and hope that it's easy to figure out how it works from that. If that also doesn't work the last option in my opinion would be to attack the device itself: As mentioned in other responses you are looking for UART, JTAG or other debug ports. Also you can look for SPI Flashes, NAND Flashes, eMMC Memory and read those out then. But this is the most difficult method which should only be followed when the other methods don't work or you have a good reason to do so (to discover \"secret\" functionality for example).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
