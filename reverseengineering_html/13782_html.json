I'm considering two 5 hour sessions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The objective is for the students to be able to use linux tools and and reverse engineering tools (specifically radare2/GDB) to start doing CTFs and crackmes to practice. The target audience is software engineers, developers and students. Having said that and after a few conversations with potential participants, quality here is mediocre at best so I rather prepare for the worse and assume some participants won't even know the behind the scenes of a compilation process.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What I have so far is the following:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Linux usage\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Memory map\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Binary sections\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Passing function arguments\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Radare installation\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Quick intro to x86 assembler\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Gdb\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Stacks - return address\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   stack canaries\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Buffer overflows\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Shellcode\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Nop slides\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   CTFâ€™s challenges\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
