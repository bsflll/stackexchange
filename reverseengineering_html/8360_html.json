Since the text search in IDA doesn't seem to have a regex function, I'm not sure the best way to get this done. Perhaps a script?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I also realize this may be complicated by the fact that some of the I.P adresses may not exist as strings.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Or better, you'll find way too many. Even your \"Hello world!\" string might be 110.145.154.154 ..
