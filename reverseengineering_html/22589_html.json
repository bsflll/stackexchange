I have added a new section to the\n  <code>\n   PE32+\n  </code>\n  file and made the new section as the entry point. Some simple instructions are added in the new segment. Now I want to go to the old entry point after executing the new segment, then continue execution from there. I read the articles for\n  <code>\n   PE32\n  </code>\n  that are using\n  <code>\n   assembly\n  </code>\n  language instructions. But I am not able get it working for\n  <code>\n   64 bit\n  </code>\n  (tried to add\n  <code>\n   .asm\n  </code>\n  files). Please help me with any useful information. Is it possible to do it in\n  <code>\n   C++\n  </code>\n  ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
