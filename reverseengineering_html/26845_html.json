To use it I have to do something like :\n <code>\n  pin -t ./my_module.so -- ./test\n </code>\n . What I'd like to know is if it's possible to compile it as a standalone. Rather than giving my \"my_module.so\" I'd like just create a binary that way people won't have to download Pin and module, only my binary to use it.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

If you don't want to add instrumentation, then you can provide a blank \"pintool\" (without any calls to instrumentation routines, just the main function). If you want to remove \"pintool\" then your pin framework will be purposeless.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
