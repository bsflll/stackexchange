I'm trying to get at these loaded classes for further analysis, but thus far I haven't had any success in figuring out the format of the archive file. Since the classes are loaded into memory anyway, and I used a Java profiler to get a short list of the specific classes and objects that most likely contain what I'm looking for, is there a way to intercept these classes from memory, a core dump, as they're loaded, or through any other means, and inspect/save them? Assume I have full control of the system, and I can stop or modify the program in any way.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

An agent is a tool that provides instrumentation capability for an application. Speaking of agents, there are two broad ways they can be developed:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   In pure java\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   In C/C++ in the form of native agents.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  A native agent has more capability than a pure Java agent, but for your purpose it is sufficient. At some point in the execution flow, the class loader has to load and decrypt the encrypted classes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sample code is provided below. The agent registers a callback (the\n  <code>\n   transform\n  </code>\n  method) to be notified whenever a new class is being loaded. Within the callback we simply dump the contents of the class to disk.\n </p>\n <pre><code>import java.io.*;\nimport java.lang.instrument.*;\nimport java.security.*;\n\npublic class dumper\n{\n  //A java agent must have a premain method which acts as the entry-point\n  public static void premain(String agentArgs, Instrumentation inst)\n  {\n    System.out.println(\"agent loaded\");\n\n    // Register our transformer\n    inst.addTransformer(new transformer());    \n  }\n}\n\nclass transformer implements ClassFileTransformer\n{\n   // The transform method is called for each non-system class as they are being loaded  \n   public byte[] transform(ClassLoader loader, String className, \n                           Class<?> classBeingRedefined, ProtectionDomain protectionDomain, \n                           byte[] classfileBuffer) throws IllegalClassFormatException\n   {\n     if (className != null)\n     {\n       // Skip all system classes\n       if (!className.startsWith(\"java\") && \n           !className.startsWith(\"sun\") && \n           !className.startsWith(\"javax\") && \n           !className.startsWith (\"com\") && \n           !className.startsWith(\"jdk\") && \n           !className.startsWith(\"org\"))\n       {\n         System.out.println(\"Dumping: \" + className);\n\n         // Replace all separator charactors\n         String newName = className.replaceAll(\"/\", \"#\") + \".class\";\n\n         try\n         {\n           FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(newName);\n           fos.write(classfileBuffer);\n           fos.close();\n         }\n         catch (Exception ex)\n         {\n           System.out.println(\"Exception while writing: \" + newName);\n         } \n       }\n     }\n     // We are not modifying the bytecode in anyway, so return it as-is\n     return classfileBuffer;\n   }\n }\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I have a writeup on this process here:\n  <a href=\"https://1drv.ms/b/s!Akx1Hfr1ER7pgVv_ixpjTu-G6yer\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   Reversing An Obfuscated Java Malware\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you have the classfile, you can just diassemble it, find all calls to defineClass (or reflection methods that might potentially call defineClass), and insert a logging function before the call to dump the result. You could use\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/Storyyeller/Krakatau\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   the Krakatau disassembler/assembler\n  </a>\n  for this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The biggest risk is if the obfuscated code is using introspection, it could mess things up. For example, the code might compute a checksum of itself, in which case modifying it at all will cause problems.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If that is the case you have two options: 1) find all the introspection checks and remove/modify/mock them out, or 2) modify the JVM itself. The later approach would be completely invisible to the obfuscated code, but is harder to do.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One other thing to try is to look into the Java Agent interface. I haven't used it myself, so I can't say much about it, but this will potentially let you access all loaded classes at runtime with no code modifications.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
