After extending function end and correcting stack I've found that IDA doesnt refresh graph. The green nodes should be one continuous node. Is there any way to fix it?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In my situation it was due to exceptions in sub_1B64A30. If function is flagged as \"noreturn\", IDA's analysis stops after calling it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, in order to repair graph one should unflag \"noreturn\" (I once had a case, where I couldn't do it tho), undefine calling function, define it back.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
