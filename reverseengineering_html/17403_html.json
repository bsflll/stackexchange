There are many Java decompilers out there, I won't list them all.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Disassemble .class to \"assembly\" (usually Jasmin syntax), modify it, assemble back.\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/Storyyeller/Krakatau\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     Krakatau\n    </a>\n    is a good tool that should be able to do it.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Use a tool that can modify/patch the bytecode directly in the .class file.

This is somewhat implementation-specific but here's one example I know about which uses Java debugging protocol (JWDP):\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/CrowdStrike/pyspresso\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     https://github.com/CrowdStrike/pyspresso\n    </a>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
