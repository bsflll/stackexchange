I think one of the recent versions attempted to introduce compatibility, though. So it'd depend on the Lua version. And then there could be the case of LuaJIT which uses an entirely different bytecode, but whose bytecode is portable. Aside from that any kind of extensions (and there's a plethora of patches against the vanilla Lua) could modify how the bytecode looks. What the numeric type is would also have an influence and so on ... I'm afraid there's no canned solution for this kind of problem.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Even a specific version might be implemented in various different ways. Lua is a scripting language, it doesn't care as much about what goes on under the hood as long as the car runs ya know? They may implement it differently.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
