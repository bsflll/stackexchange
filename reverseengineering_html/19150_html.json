Often orders of magnitude slower than other arithmetic operations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It turns out that if divisor is constant you can avoid the expensive division operation using clever arithmetic tricks to a set of considerably faster operations (multiplications, additions and shifts), thus reaching overall faster performance at the expense of slightly larger code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is often called \"division by magic numbers\" because those numbers indeed often look like randomly selected numbers, that is not, however, the case. Compilers (and sometimes humans, too) use those tricks often nowadays, since size of code is less of an issue thanks to the exponential growth of storage capacity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The general approach is that we can develop an equation like the following:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   X / Y == X * (1/Y) == sqrt((X * 2^n) * (1/Y)), 2^n) == ((x << n) * 1/Y)>>n\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  In your case,\n  <code>\n   0xE38E38E38E38E38Fui64\n  </code>\n  with a shift of\n  <code>\n   3\n  </code>\n  bits is the hardcoded magic number used for division by 9 for unsigned 64 bit integers. Since your code actually shifts by 5, the actual divisor equals\n  <code>\n   9 * 2^2\n  </code>\n  =\n  <code>\n   36\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
