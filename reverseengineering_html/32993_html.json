I hvae some log files that mostly contain android device modem and ap logs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The file extension varies depending on the chipset. There is specific tool provided by the chipset manufacturers to open those logs and see inside manually.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But I want to build a log analysis tool that will read and analyse those log files. For that I first need to decrypt or decode the information in those log files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have no idea how should I proceed. Can anyone help?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
