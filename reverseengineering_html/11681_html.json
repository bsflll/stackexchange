However when I try do exactly as they say, I get the following error:\n  <code>\n   sh: 1: rsc: not found\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  From what I can see,\n  <code>\n   rsc\n  </code>\n  is an extra utility that would have come in with Radare1. See\n  <a href=\"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/raring/man1/rsc.1.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I understand that ! causes Radare to execute a shell command so I therefore need the\n  <code>\n   rsc\n  </code>\n  utility. However I cannot find it anywhere!\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm using Radare2 0.10.0 compiled from git and Boomerang compiled from git as well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does anyone know what the state of these two tools working together is?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Boomerang hasn't been yet added to r2 in this version, you can use\n  <code>\n   pdc\n  </code>\n  and\n  <a href=\"https://asciinema.org/a/20904\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   retdec\n  </a>\n  (see r2pm). We are actually working on\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/radare/radeco\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   radeco\n  </a>\n  . But you can always contribute and maybe add back this support to r2 ? That would be interesting\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
