Class::Function shows up as Class__Function)\n </p>\n <p>\n  How can I make it so that in the function window it will show the actual symbols and not underscores? Every database that I open shows the function names like this except mine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am using IDA Pro 7.0\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Here is an example for Visual Studio applications:\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Visual_C%2B%2B_name_mangling\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Visual_C%2B%2B_name_mangling\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Just a basic example:\nName a function:\n  <code>\n   ??1@ClassName@@@Z\n  </code>\n  will be translated into\n  <code>\n   ClassName::~ClassName()\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit:\nNames will show as comment. If you want them to show as actual names, open Options menu, Demangled names and choose \"names\".\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
