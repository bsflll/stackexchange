    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am debugging an apk app that I do not have the sources for. I want to debug it on a smali level, not decompiled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I used to do this with apktool, but looking at their website, smali-debugging is deprecated and they point to SmaliIdea - a plugin for android studio. So I installed that, and indeed - it works fine: I can step, set breakpoints, view smali registers (v7,v8,v9 etc) when I set a watchpoint on them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What I cant do is actually modify those registers / local variables. I can see them when I set a watchpoint on them, but cant assign a value.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Looking at \"planned features\" of SmaliIdea:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Show all registers with a value in \"locals\" pane\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Ability to set the value of a register in \"watch\" pane\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  It doesnt say I cant modify a register at all right now, but doesnt exactly confirm it either.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This used to be possible with ancient apktool version though! A pretty hefty regression, I would say. (Going back is impractical, too much changed)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Question: How can i modify those smali registers while debugging? is there a register view I am missing or something? How do other people debug APK on smali level?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
