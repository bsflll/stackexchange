    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  My friend and I am trying to decrypt the Assembly-CSharp.dll file from an Android game which was written in Unity3D.\nNormally these files are readable when using something like JustDecompile, but this one is encrypted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We managed to modify the APK so that it is debuggable and also managed to get the stuff running so that we can debug the APK in IDA Pro.\nThis runs fine so far and we can also set breakpoints and all that stuff.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But when debugging the APK in IDA Pro we are not able to find the points where the client is decrypting the Assembly-CSharp.dll file as this seems to happen in libmono.so.\nHere is an example what the encrypted DLL looks like right now:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/M2nw4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/M2nw4.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  and what it should look like (from a game, made by me with unity):\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fvSYA.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fvSYA.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  After making some adjustments of how the files are loaded from the APK, we were able to load libmono.so and also libunity.so into IDA, but we can not debug these files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Whenever we want to debug them the IDA system tells us that these files can not run by themselves. Now we have 3 possible ways how to get to the point we want to:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Finding the correct entry for libmono.so over debugging the classes.dex file\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Loading libmono.so or libunity.so to jump step by step to the point where the Assembly-CSharp.dll gets decrypted and extract the DLL (not sure how to do this yet ^^)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Finding a way to load the libmono.so into IDA and debug it with another tool (I found a tool here which is called native-shim, this could probably help us).\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You can see a repeating pattern that is easy to pick out if you find areas that are supposed to be all 0's.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It appears that the encrypted files have a 16-byte header that is likely\n </p>\n <pre><code>    4-byte     file-signature  (0x0b25c4fa)\n    4-byte     file size\n    4-byte     file size (duplicated ?)\n    4-byte     flag?\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The rest of the file is the encrypted file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With one small difference .. at least the first 2 bytes of the unencrypted file is mangled somehow to obscure it further.  For a dll, start by setting the first 2 bytes to\n  <code>\n   0x4D5A\n  </code>\n  , that should get it recognized by some tools such as 010Editor.  You may have to play with the DOS_HEADER (the first 64 bytes of a dll) structure to see if it makes sense.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You can try another guide about dump decrypted dll using IDA but with broken english.
