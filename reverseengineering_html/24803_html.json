I see this link:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/199545/how-does-a-zip-file-detect-a-correct-password\">\n   How does a zip file detect a correct password?\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the answer of this question, it said CRC is used to check if a password is correct. It also paste a code snippet from Info-zip to prove this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, after carefully studying the Info-zip source code, as below:\n </p>\n <pre><code>    if ((ush)(c | (b<<8)) != (GLOBAL(pInfo->ExtLocHdr) ?\n                           ((ush)GLOBAL(lrec.last_mod_dos_datetime) & 0xffff) :\n                           (ush)(GLOBAL(lrec.crc32) >> 16)))\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I find when there is ExtLocHdr in the zip item, the lower 2 bytes of last_mod_dos_datetime, instead of the CRC, will be used to verify the password. But this is not mentioned in the file format specification in\n  <a href=\"https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT\n  </a>\n  at all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Why?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
