    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a DLL with a large number of functions in IDA Pro. I would like to make a script that can scan the instructions within each of the functions looking for a specific instruction. For my specific case right now, I am looking for functions that shift left (shl). I am not sure which register is being shifted so I would like to keep it versatile. I do know that it is only shifting one place in this specific case.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know python on a very basic level, and I know IDA-Python on a non-existent level. Please help me with suggestions on how to access this data inside IDA.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit:\n  \n\n  I have read through\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8860020/is-there-a-way-to-export-function-names-from-ida-pro?rq=1\">\n   this question\n  </a>\n  and it says that there is no direct access to the list of functions that have been discovered by IDA.  You have to specify a starting function address.  Is there any better way to list functions?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Of course, you'd need to handle some specific cases, instruction size and all, but that's the general idea.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
