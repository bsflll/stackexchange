I learned in the above linked question that anterior and posterior comments are supported, but what about other events such as when I press\n  <kbd>\n   h\n  </kbd>\n  (e.g.\n  <code>\n   2Ah\n  </code>\n  becomes\n  <code>\n   42\n  </code>\n  ) to change the number to base 10 (and back) or\n  <kbd>\n   r\n  </kbd>\n  to show it as character (e.g.\n  <code>\n   2Ah\n  </code>\n  becomes\n  <code>\n   *\n  </code>\n  ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  How would I go about to catch these?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   NB:\n  </strong>\n  in general this question would also relate to IDA versions prior to the ones supporting a particular event notification. E.g. the IDA SDK 6.4, according to Igor, introduced notifications for anterior and posterior comments. How can I get older versions and 6.4 to co-operate w.r.t. those events in conjunction with\n  <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/collabreate/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   collabREate\n  </a>\n  ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know that it is allowed to reverse engineer IDA itself, so what I am looking for are pointers.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Discover the mechanism by which the action in which you are interested is triggered, and then patch IDA (or use DLL injection etc) to send some sort of custom notification.  However, I doubt it will be that easy; you could expect, perhaps, multiple code paths responsible for the same action.  I expect if it were that easy, Hex-Rays would add the notifications themselves.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

In the same manner I managed to add and edit menu items and tool bars manually, it is definitely possible to look up the context menu popup when right-clicking in IDA's disassembly view or hooking the hotkeys.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/11181/adding-a-toolbar-to-ida-using-pyside/12999#12999\">\n   This RE.SE\n  </a>\n  answer of mine might be a good place to start.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
