Last time I had a similar hassle where I wanted keep on the fly changes in olly, I just wrote up a dll patch and after injecting attached olly.

So it is the normal behavior that they don't load whenever you restart the program.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you want to keep your patches between two executions, you've got two solutions :\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Patch definitely your binary, so you won't have to do the patches again :\nAfter you make a change to the code, highlight the changes, right click on it, choose 'Copy To Executable'. You can choose the current selection of what you just changed, or, you can choose to copy all changes to the executable.\nWhen you select one, it will popup a new window which is the new file, right click in the new window that popped up, and choose 'Save file' and it will save the changes to the given file that you choose.\nStep by step animation :\n    <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/G1J7EVP.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     http://i.imgur.com/G1J7EVP.gif\n    </a>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Use a plugin such as\n    <a href=\"http://rammichael.com/multimate-assembler\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     Multiline Ultimate Assembler\n    </a>\n    so you can write your patches, save them and load them whenever you want during execution time.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
