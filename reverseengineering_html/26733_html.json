    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Context:\n  </strong>\n  I have a proprietary Tandberg Data RDX QuickStor Internal USB3 drive bay for PC (item number\n  <code>\n   8666-RDX\n  </code>\n  ) and some storage cartridges for it.\nEsentially, these are just regular TOSHIBA\n  <code>\n   MK3276GSX\n  </code>\n  2.5\" SATA drives in some fancy housing and the corresponding SATA-to-USB-3.0 adapter bay.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   The catch:\n  </strong>\n  The SATA Drives are protected with an ATA password and the bay unlocks them when inserted. I cannot use them if i connect them directly to my PC and all of my attempts at triggering an ATA Secure erase or obtaining an OEM master password failed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   My question:\n  </strong>\n  Is there a sane way to obtain the ATA password, e.g. by soldering a few wires onto the SATA connector in the drive bay and recording some data with an oscilloscope for later analysis?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I once asked about this\n  <a href=\"https://superuser.com/q/1506588/1117550\">\n   on the superuser stack exchange\n  </a>\n  but the answers were limited to software based solutions. I wasn't able to succed with that approach.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
