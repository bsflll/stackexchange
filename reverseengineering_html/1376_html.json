To be more precise\n  <strike>\n   , AppInit DLLs are actually loaded only by the processes that link user32.dll.\n  </strike>\n  ,as peter ferrie points out, AppInit DLLs are loaded by user32.dll after it has been loaded. \nThe actual registry path differs between 64bit and 32bit version of OS.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So for for 32 bit DLL on 32 bit systems the path is:\n </p>\n <pre><code>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows\\AppInit_DLLs] \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  For  64 bit DLL on 64 bit system :\n </p>\n <pre><code>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows\\AppInit_DLLs]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  For for 32 bit DLL on 64 bit system:\n </p>\n <pre><code>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows\\AppInit_DLLs] \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Multiple entries are split with space or comma, and the path to the DLL must not contain any spaces for obvious reasons.\nOn Vista and later, the AppInit DLLs need to be signed, tho the registry value\n  <code>\n   RequireSignedAppInit_DLLs\n  </code>\n  can be set to 0 which disables this requirement.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
