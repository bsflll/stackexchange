In Cutter v1.10 (December 20, 2019) the team\n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/r2gui/status/1208106040954359808\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   introduced\n  </a>\n  native and remote debugger support. By default, the STDIO of the debuggee is redirected to the Console Widget inside Cutter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Downloading the latest release\n  </strong>\n  \n\n  To download the recent version of Cutter you can go to the\n  <a href=\"https://cutter.re\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   official website\n  </a>\n  and click on the Download button. It will automatically detect your OS and give you the right file to download.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Debugging\n  </strong>\n  \n\n  Open Cutter and choose a file to analyze. On the following dialog configure the settings as you wish, you can leave it as-it for the defaults.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the interface of Cutter you can start debugging by\n  <strong>\n   either\n  </strong>\n  of the following ways:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Press\n    <kbd>\n     F9\n    </kbd>\n    to execute native debug\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Click the green button at the top of the interface to start Debug\n    \n\n    <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Gq6lZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Gq6lZ.png\"/>\n    </a>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Click on the \"Debug\" menu and choose Start Debug\n    \n\n    <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/G7kEz.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/G7kEz.png\"/>\n    </a>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Then, click Play and the program will run. On Linux, you will see the STDIO in the Console Widget (open it from Windows -> Console). You can interact with it and send it input.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8ilEr.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8ilEr.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
