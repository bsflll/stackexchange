I searched the MSDN documentation and looked into the header file to find a layout of the class, but couldn't find anything that helped me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Where would I retrieve such member / memory layout information about MFC classes?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Possibly only in the professional version of VStudio. Until some years ago, I had made many projects with MFC, and it was always possible to step into the MFC sources.
