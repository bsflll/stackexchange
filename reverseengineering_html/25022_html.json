I have searched through the file and found text in Spanish, French, English, and in Japanese. The problem is that it is hidden from the jumbled text, and Extracting text one by one would be very tiring. Is there a way to extract these strings of text?\n </p>\n <p>\n  BTW I'm currently running on Windows and my system can't edit Virtualization settings.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uxXi6.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uxXi6.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It can search for ASCII/Unicode strings in the binary image and print them to the stdout which you may of course redirect to file for further examination.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
