    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I was trying to extract data from an Android app which uses SQLcipher. SQLcipher is an extension of SQLite that encrypts database files with 256-bit AES.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Within the APK, the library lies in\n  <code>\n   lib/libsqlcipher.so\n  </code>\n  . I'm curious if I can extract the encryption key simply by modifying\n  <code>\n   libsqlcipher.so\n  </code>\n  (e.g. modify\n  <code>\n   sqlite3_key\n  </code>\n  function so that it logs the encryption key to file). The plan is to compile my own version of\n  <code>\n   libsqlcipher.so\n  </code>\n  , repack APK, install it, and run it on a device.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Will this method work as expected? It sounds too easy to be true:)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
