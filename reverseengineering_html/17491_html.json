    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  While reverse engineering a game using the Hex Rays decompiler I was looking for how an array of NPC's was accessed. I found the array but I don't quite understand the unusual formula for getting the index of the NPC. First an integer is\n  <code>\n   &\n  </code>\n  with\n  <code>\n   0xFFF\n  </code>\n  then the result is multiplied by 4 to get the index.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Example:\n </p>\n <pre><code>dword_1F4A8A5C[4 * (v3 & 0xFFF)]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I'm really not sure if this is standard or if it's weird output from the Hex Rays decompiler. If anyone has an explanation please let me know. Thanks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

And I had the misconception that it was an array of pointers to structures. Not an actual array of structures. Thank you, you've helped tremendously.
