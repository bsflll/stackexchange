Working in IDA Pro 6.8 on a 64-bit executable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am not able to modify the jmp address for this instruction:\n </p>\n <pre><code>    ........   \n    .text:0000000141BAFB57 loc_141BAFB57:                          \n    .text:0000000141BAFB57                 lea     rcx, [rbp+520h+var_20]\n    .text:0000000141BAFB5E                 lea     rdx, abc_data\n    .text:0000000141BAFB65                 call    sub_141CCAC80\n    .text:0000000141BAFB6A                 jmp     loc_141BAF9D6\n    .text:0000000141BAFB6A subroutine endp\n    .text:0000000141BAFB6A\n    .text:0000000141BAFB6F\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I want to either change the jmp address from loc_141BAF9D6 to loc_141BAFA9C or simply nop the instruction...\n </p>\n <p>\n  every time I attempt this in IDA Pro 6.8 it moves the jmp (or the nop) instruction outside the subroutine endp closing, and therefore IDA gives me now a SP-Analysis failed error... example:\n </p>\n <pre><code>.text:0000000141BAFB57 loc_141BAFB57:                          \n.text:0000000141BAFB57                 lea     rcx, [rbp+520h+var_20]\n.text:0000000141BAFB5E                 lea     rdx, abc_data\n.text:0000000141BAFB65                 call    sub_141CCAC80\n.text:0000000141BAFB65 subroutine endp ; sp-analysis failed\n.text:0000000141BAFB65\n.text:0000000141BAFB6A                 jmp     loc_141BAFA9C\n.text:0000000141BAFB6F\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I've tried editing the instruction via Edit > Patch Program Assemble, directly in HEX view, using IDAPatcher, and using Fetanyl plugin... it always moves the instruction outside of the endp statement, breaking the code...\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is this not possible in general or what am I doing wrong ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've tried OllyDbg but it does not open 64-bit files...\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I think that it is bug in IDA (editing last instruction of the function removes it from the function, I succeeded to reproduce this behavior), but you can work it around by fixing the function after patching.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The easiest way to do it is as follows:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   After doing the patching\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Place a cursor to the instruction removed from the function in IDA-View-A window (regular assembly window)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   and press E. This will define the end of function to the current instruction, which means to the address where it was before.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  You can do the same by editing the function end address in function properties dialog (Edit->Functions->Edit Function or\n  <kbd>\n   Alt-P\n  </kbd>\n  .\nGood luck.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
