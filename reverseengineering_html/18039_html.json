The parent process is the shell, since the shell was the process that started the \"hello world\" process. When printing to the terminal (\n   <code>\n    STDOUT\n   </code>\n   ), the child process is sending data to the parent process (the shell).\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   take a look at the binary and look at the disassembly of the\n   <code>\n    main()\n   </code>\n   function. The \"hello world\" string is hardcoded in the\n   <code>\n    .rodata\n   </code>\n   section of the binary. It is not written to the stack at any point. In\n   <code>\n    main()\n   </code>\n   , a\n   <em>\n    pointer\n   </em>\n   to its location is written to the stack as an argument to the\n   <code>\n    printf\n   </code>\n   function.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   the runtime stack of a process is a space in virtual memory whose use is managed by the compiler. The stack is written to and read from by the CPU, which executes the instructions generated by the compiler. The stack does not perform any sort of action or computation; this is the purpose of the CPU. You should read the Q&A here:\n   <a href=\"https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/76871/how-are-variables-stored-in-and-retrieved-from-the-program-stack/76874#76874\">\n    How are variables stored in and retrieved from the program stack?\n   </a>\n   . Note that if a programming language does not permit recursion, a stack is not even required.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <blockquote>\n    <p>\n     A\n     <em>\n      shell\n     </em>\n     is a special-purpose program designed to read commands typed by a user and execute appropriate programs in response to those commands. Such a program is sometimes known as a\n     <em>\n      command interpreter\n     </em>\n     .\n     <sup>\n      1\n     </sup>\n    </p>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p>\n    When you type\n    <code>\n     $ ./hello\n    </code>\n    , the shell will read this command and proceed to call\n    <a href=\"http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     <code>\n      fork\n     </code>\n    </a>\n    and\n    <a href=\"http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     <code>\n      exec\n     </code>\n    </a>\n    to start a new process (I strongly urge you to read\n    <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1653340/differences-between-fork-and-exec\">\n     Differences between fork and exec\n    </a>\n    ).\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     Since each process occupies its own space in virtual memory and is as a result isolated from every other process, the shell and the new process started by the shell must use services provided by the kernel in order to share data\n    </strong>\n    . The Linux I/O model provides one way for processes to communicate with each other using\n    <em>\n     file descriptors\n    </em>\n    :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote>\n    <p>\n     All system calls for performing I/O refer to open files using a file descriptor, a (usually small) nonnegative integer. File descriptors are used to refer to all types of open files, including pipes, FIFOs, sockets, terminals, devices, and regular files. Each process has its own set of file descriptors.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     By convention, most programs expect to be able to use the three standard file descriptors listed in Table 4-1. These three descriptors are opened on the program’s behalf by the shell, before the program is started. Or, more precisely, the program inherits copies of the shell’s file descriptors, and the shell normally operates with these three file descriptors always open. (In an interactive shell, these three file\n  descriptors normally refer to the terminal under which the shell is running.) If I/O redirections are specified on a command line, then the shell ensures that the file descriptors are suitably modified before starting the program.\n     <sup>\n      2\n     </sup>\n    </p>\n   </blockquote>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XjXz8.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Table 4-1 Standard File Descriptors\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XjXz8.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  This means that if one wishes to print to the terminal, one must make a\n  <code>\n   write()\n  </code>\n  system call using the already open\n  <code>\n   stdout\n  </code>\n  file descriptor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is a simple example program to make things more clear:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <stdio.h>\n#include <sys/types.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n        pid_t current_PID = getpid();\n        pid_t parent_PID = getppid();\n\n        printf(\"Current process ID: %d\n\", current_PID);\n        printf(\"Parent process ID: %d\n\", parent_PID);\n\n        return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  We can retrieve the process ID of the shell via the\n  <code>\n   echo $$\n  </code>\n  command (\n  <code>\n   bash\n  </code>\n  is assumed to be the shell here).\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ echo $$\n29760\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Then we compile and run the example program (which I simply called\n  <code>\n   pid\n  </code>\n  ):\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ ./pid \nCurrent process ID: 9071\nParent process ID: 29760\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The parent process ID is that of the shell which started the\n  <code>\n   pid\n  </code>\n  process.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To see what is happening at the CPU level, here is disassembly of\n  <code>\n   main()\n  </code>\n  with comments explaining the relevant operations:\n </p>\n <pre><code><main>:\npush   %ebp\nmov    %esp,%ebp\nand    $0xfffffff0,%esp\nsub    $0x20,%esp\ncall   8048340 <getpid@plt>  #
