The descriptor entry describes the base address, limit (size) and some other attributes of the segment (data or code, 16- or 32-bit).

Since 32bit processors segment registers are rarely used as offset addresses for the simple reason 32 bit is enough to represent a pretty big address range.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Instead, some segment registers (\n  <code>\n   CS\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   SS\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   DS\n  </code>\n  ) are now used for permissions, memory protection and paging, while others are used as general purpose registers, or OS specific structures (such as\n  <code>\n   FS\n  </code>\n  in 32bit windows and\n  <code>\n   GS\n  </code>\n  in linux and 64bit windows).\n </p>\n <p>\n  To find out more, I suggest you read about memory protection, protected mode, and modern OS memory management and paging.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
