One solution you could have is to add something like this to your\n  <code>\n   .idapythonrc\n  </code>\n </p>\n <pre><code># define functions to do the jumping\ndef jump_func_start():\n    Jump(GetFunctionAttr(here(), FUNCATTR_START))\n\ndef jump_func_end():\n    Jump(PrevHead(GetFunctionAttr(here(), FUNCATTR_END)))\n\n# Compile IDC wrappers to call the python\nidaapi.CompileLine('static j_f_start() { RunPythonStatement(\"jump_func_start()\"); }')\nidaapi.CompileLine('static j_f_end() { RunPythonStatement(\"jump_func_end()\"); }')\n\n# Add the hotkey\nAddHotkey(\"Ctrl-Alt-K\", 'j_f_start')\nAddHotkey(\"Ctrl-Alt-J\", 'j_f_end')\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  After that you can just type whatever hotkey you set and it should go to the start / end of the function\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Other example of such is the sintax highlight, it doesn't even have the possibility of change the color of specific instructions. Sometimes I find myself wanting to generate a .dbg of the IDB and go to the olly/x64dbg to do static analysis due to the lack of these features. Thanks anyway :)</span>",

If you just want to color the instruction, there's a ColorInstruction command (Edit | Other | Color instruction) you can set  a hotkey for it by searching for ColorInstruction in the shortcuts menu (Options | Shortcuts). I commonly use that when reversing along with GraphColor / GraphDefaultColor to markup IDBs with paths taken</span>",
