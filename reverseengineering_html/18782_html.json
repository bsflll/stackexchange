    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  My machine at work has recently been updated to Windows 10, from Windows 7, and it has become incredibly slow. The IT has installed a bunch of new tools for security and protection after the upgrade but they are saying the problem is not with their tools. I have been trying to figure out what is going on. I am not the only engineer who has having this problem and almost all Windows 10 users are experiencing this issue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I started monitoring some of the installed programs using\n  <a href=\"http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   API Monitor\n  </a>\n  and I have noticed that any system call related to disk I/O is taking a really long time to return. I capture a run of the application and then parse the summary and try to find the hottest API calls.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I monitored the program that I myself am developing and the following API calls take around 70% of the total time:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    _wopen\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    CreateFileA\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    fgets\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    ReadFile\n   </code>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I assumed it might be a disk related issue but in safe mode everything works as expected and feels snappy. I tested the same app in safe mode and the above API calls are still the hottest calls but they barely make 5% of the total running time. This makes me believe the problem is not disk but rather some other installed service on my machine that monitors all disk I/O related API calls and makes my machine so slow. However I don't know which application is interfering with the API calls.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How can I find why a specific API call is taking so much time? Can I step into windows kernel and debug this issue?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I hope this is the right place for this post.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In general the upgraded systems also seemed slower for me, although newly installed Windows 10 installations weren't affected. Debugging or reverse engineering is probably not  of any help. Timing in a debugger, for example, will be completely skewed. So how do you expect to judge the speed? You may want to read on the RandomAscii blog or get a book on performance analysis on Windows. The on-board (and free-of-charge) Microsoft tools have only gotten better since Windows 7.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

I just used the API monitor tool to track which Windows API functions are being called. The tools is essentially like\n <code>\n  strace\n </code>\n for Linux. It times every syscall. Now, what I am trying to figure out is why these windows API calls are slow. I am experiencing the same issue with all programs and not just my custom program.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

They have to share the processor with all the other processes, services, drivers and so on. There may be a myriad reasons why a specific API call is slow, and it's quite unlikely the API itself is a problem. Especially with I/O, there are all the caches, drivers, and hardware itself (i.e. HDD/SSD) to consider. To get a global picture you can use something like already-mentioned\n  <code>\n   xperf\n  </code>\n  , Windows' own Performance monitor,  or possibly the nice\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/google/UIforETW\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   UIforETW\n  </a>\n  GUI wrapper around them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is a good starting point for investigating Windows performance issues using ETW:\n  <a href=\"https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2015/09/24/etw-central/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2015/09/24/etw-central/\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
