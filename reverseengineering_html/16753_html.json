    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'll be releasing a piece of software soon and I'm looking for good protectors. The three that came to my attention were: Enigma, Themida and VMProtect. I searched a lot online but I couldn't find many comparisons. They are all in a similar price range so that is not a huge problem. I was wondering what the main differences are between them? Virtualization, string encryption, packing etc. I couldn't find much info about that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All replies are appreciated! Thanks\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

All details shown are from my own personal research.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This comparison will only include the protectors I personally have a licence for: VMProtect and Themida. I do not have a licence to Enigma, so I cannot tell about its protection features.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I will also not be including the licencing features of either, I will only be talking about the protection methods they employ.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To get us started, here is the \"unprotected\" version of a simple loop function that we will be protecting with both protectors to see what they output.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/icsmw.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/icsmw.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   VMProtect\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  VMProtect has 3 protection modes:\n  <em>\n   Mutation\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <em>\n   Virtualization\n  </em>\n  , and \"\n  <em>\n   Ultra\n  </em>\n  \" (both methods combined)\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Mutation\n  </em>\n  does what it says it does: it\n  <strong>\n   mutates\n  </strong>\n  the assembly code to make automated analysis of it harder. The resulting mutated code varies drastically per compilation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jCdNZ.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jCdNZ.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the other hand,\n  <em>\n   Virtualization\n  </em>\n  translates the code into a special format that only a special virtual machine can run. It then inserts a \"stub\" function to call the VM where the actual code was supposed to be ran.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/B3hka.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/B3hka.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note that this VM inserts a lot of overhead. The original ~100kb application was increased to around ~600kb after protection using this method. You can decrease the size though by turning on the packing feature inside of VMProtect.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is also functionality for checking if debuggers are being ran, string encryption, methods of grabbing a unique identifier for the computers hardware, etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Themida\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Themida is a little different from VMP. While it also has the same protection features of VMP, it does it much differently and has a few more features that VMP does not have. Note though that these features that VMP does not have do not work on all application types.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For Themida's\n  <em>\n   Mutation\n  </em>\n  , it does it quite differently to VMP. It adds lots of random operations to the assembly instead of specifically mutating each opcode.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1gMkw.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1gMkw.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Themida's\n  <em>\n   Virtualization\n  </em>\n  however has one cool feature that VMP does not: Multiple VM architectures. Themida has the ability to have different virtual machines (using a different architecture) inside of the same application. There is also different 'styles' of VM: some faster but less secure, some more secure but less fast, etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DI7k0.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DI7k0.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Of course, the problem with this is pretty obvious: the size. A protected application with all protection options disabled is around ~2mb from the original ~100kb. Luckily, Themida also has a packing feature to reduce the size, where it reduced it to around ~1mb.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Themida also has a few other features:\n  <em>\n   \"ClearCode\"\n  </em>\n  , where it clears the assembly after it ran,\n  <em>\n   \"Encode\"\n  </em>\n  , decrypting the code at runtime and re-encrypting it after it was executed, string encryption, and functions to check code integrity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Conclusion\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Both protections are quite good when used properly. Which one you buy is up to you, not me, so I would recommend you to choose wisely for the application you wish to protect and to see which features you specifically want.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
