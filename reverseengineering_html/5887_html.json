And, second, I see a direct link to reverse engineering here... The fact that the complexity of an algorithm is not related to the quality of reversing the program is actually something controversial that should be discussed before being thrown away.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

It defines a\n  <em>\n   measure of potency\n  </em>\n  to classify the different types of obfuscation and order them in terms of added complexity compared to the original program.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unfortunately, this way of classifying obfuscation transforms is quite naive. Mainly because the complexity of a program gives an idea of how much operations you need to process it, but has no clue on how much it is difficult to simplify it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, adding a lot of unnecessary variables and extra loops to the program will increase a lot its complexity. Yet, an optimizer with a simple static-analysis of the program may recover the original program.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the contrary, replacing a sequence of complex instructions by a simple look-up table that will mimic perfectly this sequence of instructions will lower the complexity of the program, but figuring out what is the original sequence of instructions just by looking at the table might be quite hard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, except for some very specific cases, the complexity of a program is not a trustworthy way to measure its difficulty to reverse.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In fact, we do not have any complete and objective way of measuring how good is an obfuscation... nor does cryptographers have a way to say that a cryptosystem is safe (but, they have tools that can give them much more confidence than we have in our schemes right now, so we should maybe take a closer look at what they do as our fields are getting more and more intimate in these days... just my personal feeling about that).\n </p>\n <p>\n  [1]\n  <em>\n   <a href=\"https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/2292/3491/TR148.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    A Taxonomy of Obfuscating Transformations\n   </a>\n  </em>\n  by Christian Collberg, Clark Thomborson and Douglas Low.
