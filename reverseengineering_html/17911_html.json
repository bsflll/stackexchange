It produces IL code which then can be interpreted as C#, F# or VB.NET. dotPeek doesn't allow you to use any other language for previewing but for example\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   dnSpy\n  </a>\n  ,\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   ILSpy\n  </a>\n  allow you to pick your favourite one. Just wondering if there's any tools that allows F#. Not sure/haven't seen one.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Despite this, are there reliable methods for distinguishing C# binaries from F# ones via static analysis? Dynamic analysis?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  There are some hints that can guide you. Check the references. If something is referencing the\n  <code>\n   FSharp.Core\n  </code>\n  then probably was written in F#. On the other hand if it doesn't probably it was not :)\n </p>\n <p>\n  F#'s dlls usually have a lot of attributes put on classes like\n  <code>\n   [FSharpInterfaceDataVersion]\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   [CompilationMappingAttribute]\n  </code>\n  being used. Check them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There's one more thing. F# compiler is capable of using a\n  <a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/fsharpteam/2011/07/08/tail-calls-in-f/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   tail-recursion\n  </a>\n  by generating\n  <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.emit.opcodes.tailcall(v=vs.110).aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   tailcall opcode\n  </a>\n  which is not the case with C# (at least for now). That could be an indicator. But it could be also manually crafted to use it after being written completely in C#.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
