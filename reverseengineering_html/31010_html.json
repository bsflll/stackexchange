However, I don't know which pdb file is responsible for the file(dns.exe) that I'm debugging.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any ideas?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I loaded all the symbols finally. I type dns.exe in 'load pdb' file tab and IDA loaded automatically. I guess the debug directory is specified in the file. Some of function names are pretty weird. My question is can IDA load unmatched pdb files in this case or I'm good to go?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

But you haven't mentioned the IDA version or what OS you are on. I was therefore assuming it's Windows. But if it's not it might obviously behave different from how it does\n <i>\n  with DIA\n </i>\n on Windows. But I haven't had firsthand experience for the Linux and Mac versions since Hex-Rays stopped giving all OS versions in a single license. I am only using IDA via Crossover or Wine on Linux and otherwise on Windows.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
