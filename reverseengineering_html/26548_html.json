Ida has some configuration files that can limit certain analyses, however this would also reduce analysis result. And this may not have a large effect on your binary. Therefore the best option is just to wait or in case you want to analyze multiple binaries open them at the same time in multiple IDA instances.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
