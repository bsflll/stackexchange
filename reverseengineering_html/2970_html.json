Now I know how to decrypt this data, and it has some encrypted code. I could of course, put the encrypted data into some separate file, run the decryption on it, and then let IDA process it, but then it looses connection to the original executable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is it possible to replace the encrypted data 1:1 with the decrypted one, so I can let IDA process it, in the context of the executable?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The decrypted code is position independent and doesn't need any new segments, so I try the idea with the memory snapshot first, as it sounds simpler. I guess in the long run, learning the python interface might have benefits though. :)</span>",
