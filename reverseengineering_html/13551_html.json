But don't use the above where there is no input, as the\n  <code>\n   nNumberOfBytesToRead\n  </code>\n  will cause olly to allocate an unknown size of memory since the variable has not been initialized, hence the crashes.\nOr at-least initialize the variable before using it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
