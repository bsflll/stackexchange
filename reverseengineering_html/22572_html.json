    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Good afternoon,\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am looking to try me skills at extracting some data from a proprietary format. I have made some progress but I wanted to contact the experts to see if I could gain some insights. The format in question is the '.clip' format created by the software 'clip studio paint'. Specifically this is a raster graphics editor (Photoshop-like) which I would like to get the image data from. There should, in the most basic usage, be a bunch of layers, each being an image. (For raster graphics, not vector)\n </p>\n <p>\n  The format seems to be not encrypted or compressed, but rather split up in some kind of archive format. All regular archive tools I have tried can't make any sense of it (zip, tar, etc). It might be an archive format more common to windows which I am not as familiar with.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Manually parsing the file with python I was able to find a raw sequence near the end which is in sqlite3 format. I was able to extract this and read the tables which contain the majority of the metadata. Unfortunately this does not shed much light on a way to extract the image data. I was able to split on a few delimiters I found in the file but still I would not find any image algorithm which was able to make sense of the delimited parts.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Outer delimiters in the file seem to look like:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   b'CHNKHead'\n b'CHNKFoot'\n b'CHNKExta'\n b'CHNKSQL'\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  And there are also many inner delimiters in some of these chunks like:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   b'B\\x00l\\x00o\\x00c\\x00k\\x00D\\x00a\\x00t\\x00a\\x00B\\x00e\\x00g\\x00i\\x00n\\x00C\\x00h\\x00u\\x00n\\x00k'\nb'B\\x00l\\x00o\\x00c\\x00k\\x00D\\x00a\\x00t\\x00a\\x00E\\x00n\\x00d\\x00C\\x00h\\x00u\\x00n\\x00k'\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  (I am guessing the special null byte separation to reduce the chance that this sequence matches other binary data?)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyway I am attaching my little python split and save script and the sample CSP file I am trying to read, incase anyone was interested in taking a look.\n  <a href=\"http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=04264848249049623399\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=04264848249049623399\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
