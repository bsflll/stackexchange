    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  New to decompiling, and code generally. Trying to decompile a windows 3.1 game (text adventure), so I can build it up again. Because at the moment it doesn't work (even on windows 3.1).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I decompiled the exe with\n  <a href=\"http://vbdis4.angelfire.com/VBDIS3.67e_Reloaded_Rev3_DoDi_s_VB3Decompiler.7z\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   DoDi (7z File)\n  </a>\n  which was recommended in one of the answers to\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3983709/vb3-decompiler\">\n   this question\n  </a>\n  on SO.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This threw an error when decompiling the exe 'an already known error occurred'. Probably not very helpful, but I mention it just in case.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, it decompiled fine to\n  <code>\n   .mak\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   .frm\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   .bas\n  </code>\n  files. I compiled the program again in Visual Basic 4, after correcting some syntax problems, but I get a totally non-interactive window in which none of the buttons work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This makes me think that it needs to talk to the code in the dll, but is not doing so. DoDi won't decompile dlls, and I have yet to find a decompiler which will handle 16-bit (NE/New Executable) dlls.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, I assume I need to decompile this dll too. How? The game files are in\n  <code>\n   draquest.zip\n  </code>\n  , which is here\n  <a href=\"http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXgamesXpc.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   archived here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In other words, you always start with the decompiled output, look for errors, fix them, repeat until everything seems ok. What might help you is try various options from\n <a href=\"http://www.program-transformation.org/Transform/VisualBasicDecompilers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  here\n </a>\n , and compare their outputs  to improve your source code.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

If the event handler functions aren't firing, it's likely because the handlers aren't properly registered in\n  <code>\n   ONLYFORM.FRM\n  </code>\n  . However, you already have the code, so any future questions on how to fix the event handler registration should go to\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">\n   https://stackoverflow.com/\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
