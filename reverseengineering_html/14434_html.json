A related question can be found\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9885545/how-to-find-the-main-functions-entry-point-of-elf-executable-file-without-any-s\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  . The main issue is that a stripped elf file has no\n  <em>\n   main\n  </em>\n  symbol. Instead, the loader uses the\n  <em>\n   e_entry\n  </em>\n  header field, which points to the C libs initialization code. When the initialization is done, it will yield execution to the program.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, IDA is able to reconstruct the entry point by searching for this indirect jump.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Have a look at the very start of the .text section, you will find these lines:\n </p>\n <pre><code> 8048637:   68 86 b7 04 08          push   $0x804b786\n 804863c:   e8 9f ff ff ff          call   80485e0 <__libc_start_main@plt>\n 8048641:   f4                      hlt \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The value being pushed here right before the call to libc's start function is the actual entry point. I hope this helps.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
