Do you know good articles/books/advices or another resources where I could read this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know that there are several function call conventions but it would be nice to know about artefacts of compiler code generation that aren't worth of attention while reversing.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This is not your typical \"for beginners\" book. The author keeps adding content but the original title remains. It is actually\n  <em>\n   beginner to intermediate\n  </em>\n  level but of course that depends on who you are talking to :)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
