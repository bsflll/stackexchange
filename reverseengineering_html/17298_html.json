PDB files are used by developers to debug their program and is commonly removed from the binary before it distributed to the client. Most chances is that you won't find debug symbols inside most of the real-world binaries.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Symbol files hold a variety of data which are not actually needed when running the binaries, but which could be very useful in the debugging process.\n </p>\n <p>\n  PDB files typically contain:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Public symbols (typically all functions, static and global variables)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   A list of object files that are responsible for sections of code in the executable\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Frame pointer optimization information (FPO)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Name and type information for local variables and data structures\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Source file and line number information\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Microsoft publishes all the PDB files for all operating systems and other redistributed components on its symbol server. This makes it easy to debug an application that uses these DLL or executable files. You can use the Microsoft symbol server to resolve symbols, together with any local symbols for components that were built on your computer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can find more information about how radare2 interpret PDB files in the following links:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/content/analysis/symbols.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Symbols information | radare2book\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://github.com/radare/radare2/blob/master/doc/pdb/pdb_usage\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    PDB Usage | radare2 docs\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   PDB vs SDB\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  As you probably figured out by now, SDB and PDB are two different things and for debugging purposes, PDB is much more helpful.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Further reading:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa264882(v=vs.60).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Linking by ordinal\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"http://www.ragestorm.net/blogs/?p=68\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Import Symbols by Ordinals in Link-Time\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee416588(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Debugging with Symbols\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/symbols-and-symbol-files\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Symbols and symbol files\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-pdb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Information from Microsoft about the PDB format\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Also, while you you certainly say how pdbs are more helpful it isn't clear to me coming into this how it's more helpful. How can I see the information added by the pdb in <code>Name and type information for local variables and data structures</code> It seems I have the same information before and after? I'd like to be able to see what the pdb added that radare didn't already know with the sdb.</span>",
