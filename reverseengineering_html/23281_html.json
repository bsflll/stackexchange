I want to reverse engineer a x86-64 desktop UEFI to add hardware support.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since I have the actual hardware available, are there debug interfaces that run via actual hardware & would produce a better output than say...working through HexRays or OllyDbg?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Along similar lines, are there debuggers than can be fed useful information about the system being emulated? In the case of a UEFI, I'm thinking chipset information, where graphics are coming from, connected components, types of ports, etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In theory it again requires (a little more affordable) Intel hardware like\n  <a href=\"https://designintools.intel.com/Silicon_View_Technology_Closed_Chassis_Adapter_p/itpxdpsvt.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Closed Chasssis Adapter\n  </a>\n  but some people figured out how to enable it on consumer hardware using\n  <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/eiselekd/d235b52a1615c79d3c6b3912731ab9b2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   a regular USB3 cable\n  </a>\n  .
