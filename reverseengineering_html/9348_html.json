But it doesn't take an immediate arg, so you need a constant (-4) in memory.  You need to detect wrapping around zero, and avoid\n  <code>\n   cmp\n  </code>\n  .  This instruction set extension was first supported in Broadwell (barely available for desktops, and not even all currently-for-sale laptops have it.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyway,\n  <code>\n   clc / adcx  minus_one, %ecx\n  </code>\n  instead of\n  <code>\n   dec %ecx\n  </code>\n  would save net instructions (one clc to save a\n  <code>\n   seto\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   addb $127\n  </code>\n  to save/restore the overflow flag), which isn't much.  13 uops is still more than my other answer, using an MMX reg for sub/mask to avoid touching flags.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another possibility is using\n  <code>\n   lea\n  </code>\n  , and zeroing the high bits with a non-flag-affecting left and right shift (\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_Manipulation_Instruction_Sets#BMI2\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   BMI2\n  </a>\n  (Haswell) instruction set's\n  <code>\n   SHLX / SHRX\n  </code>\n  ).

And an immediate shift count isn't available either, so I still needed to push/pop eax to get a 2nd register.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So this is 11 uops on Intel, all single-cycle latency.

If they're in the same cache-line as index, that's not a big deal.  It does take significantly more instruction bytes.  On the upside, it's branchless, so inserting it all over the place won't pollute the branch predictor with a lot of taken branches.
