So the chip should have been available at that time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  8 of the pins are connected to the main controller, which is a known part:\nSAB80515\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/udc10.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"SAB80515\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/udc10.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am also trying to get at least a part of the board schematic.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you.\n </p>\n <p>\n  EDIT 1: The chips connects this way, I have to check the other pins left blank at the moment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PuBL2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Schematic simplified\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PuBL2.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Your best best bet is examining what the pins connect to and analyzing what they may do. Since its a one off chip the chance of finding a datasheet is slim to none.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The big chip is a variation of the\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MCS-51\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Intel 8051\n  </a>\n  which is common in 80's car technology.

I don't know if this chip would be based on a standard chip and then relabeled or maybe it is an independent development. I will update the original question showing the connections with the main controller.</span>",
