At one point Petzold walks the reader through how to build a computer counting machine using only parts that would've been available ~100 years ago. If you've never taken an electronics class and concepts such as gates and boolean logic aren't very clear, start here. You'll learn about these concepts without even realizing it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After reading that (which you can finish in a couple evenings), then you could move on to GDB. I'm sure others can make better recommendations than me on GDB, but I found this book helpful the times I've used GDB:\n  <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781593271749.do\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   The Art of Debugging with GDB and DDD\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  To answer the question about registers, I think an image can make this most clear. Note that this only covers 32-bits, but should be easy enough to see how the 64-bit registers expand on this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fXjfs.png\"/>\n  source:\n  <a href=\"http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
