If I modify it, the camera says the firmware is broken. Of course, the same thing happens when I modify the firmware payload. I've tried CRC32, CRC16, MD5sum, but I can't figure out how to reproduce the checksum.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's a brief layout of the firmware file:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Size in bytes  Description\n4              Hardware or OS version\n512            Model information (consistent on firmware updates for same model)\n8              Firmware version\n4              Checksum (different on all firmwares) In this case, `8A 73 D8 D4`, or 0xd4d8738a.\n4              Checked several firmwares, generally just \"1\".\nvariable       Payload (bit flipped)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  (I've gotten the payload disassembled, but I haven't been able to\n  \n\n  get the strings correctly referenced to the code.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any advice or recommendations would help greatly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've stored my code over at\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/petabyt/fujifilm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/petabyt/fujifilm\n  </a>\n  . If you want to try it out, you should be able to run:\n </p>\n <pre><code>wget https://dl.fujifilm-x.com/support/firmware/hs20WAkw7ifA/FPUPDATE.DAT -O hs20exr.DAT\nmake t=u f=hs20exr.DAT\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
