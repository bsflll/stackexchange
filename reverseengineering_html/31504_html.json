See the\n  <code>\n   %IDADIR%\\python\\examples\\core\\extend_idc.py\n  </code>\n  for the following snippet:\n </p>\n <pre><code>from __future__ import print_function\n\nimport ida_expr\n\nif ida_expr.add_idc_func(\n        \"pow\",\n        lambda n, e: n ** e,\n        (ida_expr.VT_LONG, ida_expr.VT_LONG)):\n    print(\"The pow() function is now available in IDC\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Failed to register pow() IDC function\")\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Next, your C/C++ plugin code can invoke IDC functions. See\n  <code>\n   %IDASDK%\\plugins\\ex_debidc\\ex_debidc.cpp\n  </code>\n  for an example of how to use\n  <code>\n   expr.hpp::exec_idc_script\n  </code>\n  , whose prototype is as follows:\n </p>\n <pre><code>/// Compile and execute IDC function(s) from file.\n/// \\param result       ptr to idc_value_t to hold result of the function.\n///                     If execution fails, this variable will contain\n///                     the exception information.\n///                     You may pass nullptr if you are not interested in the returned\n///                     value.\n/// \\param path         text file containing text of IDC functions\n/// \\param func         function name to execute\n/// \\param args         array of parameters\n/// \\param argsnum      number of parameters to pass to 'fname'\n///                     This number should be equal to number of parameters\n///                     the function expects.\n/// \\param[out] errbuf  buffer for the error message\n/// \\retval true   ok\n/// \\retval false  error, see errbuf\n\nTHREAD_SAFE inline bool exec_idc_script(\n        idc_value_t *result,\n        const char *path,\n        const char *func,\n        const idc_value_t args[],\n        size_t argsnum,\n        qstring *errbuf=nullptr)\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Thanks, this sounds like it could be doable. Not quite what I had in mind, but it may get me closer.</span>",

There's a variety of ways to think about and approach your question; this is just one of them. I have a feeling that <code>expr.hpp</code> probably holds a more direct solution to your problem; you can probably run an IDAPython script directly somehow, but I couldn't tell you exactly how.</span>",
