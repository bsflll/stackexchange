My command to run it from the command line is:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   ida64 -A -SC:\\path\\to\\script\\databaseAll.py C:\\path\\to\\ELFexecutable\\target0\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  If I open the file in the graphical interface first and pack the database, then it works from the command line in creating the database correctly, but otherwise it has a lot of information that's missing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Am I doing something wrong? How do you properly run a script from the command line?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
