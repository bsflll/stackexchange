And if so how do I find out which libraries and where to get them? (\n  <code>\n   info sharedlibrary\n  </code>\n  didn't yield anything)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If your files with debug symbols on the PC are the ancestors of the stripped files running on the remote target device, then the addresses match and the debugger can use those local files to lookup symbols for the addresses reported by the remote target.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pointing at local files with debug info is what the hints about \"set solib-search-path\" or \"set sysroot\" are suggesting to you, specifically for system libraries used by the program you are debugging.  Typically you would also invoke the debugger with a local copy of the program you want to debug, so that it can access the symbols (and perhaps even find the high level sources) of the program as well as the libraries.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That said, this may not be all that relevant to you.\n </p>\n <p>\n  First, debugging the internals of system libraries is rarely interesting, unless you suspect a problem there.  Rather, what is interesting is the way in which an application\n  <em>\n   uses\n  </em>\n  system libraries, ie the calls it makes and the results it gets (the same information you might get by running with\n  <code>\n   ltrace\n  </code>\n  interception)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Because\n  <em>\n   dynamic link symbols\n  </em>\n  remain even in stripped executables, a good debugger when properly configured can decode dynamic link symbols and the Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) and identify the dynamic library functions being called, even when you have no other symbols or sources for either the system libraries or the program.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
