I'd want to use this file's types in another database.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried to export the types using \"Create C header file\" and \"Dump typeinfo to IDC file\", but neither worked properly. Trying to import the generated C header file to the second database fails due to templates. The exported IDC file doesn't include all of the types present in the first database.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Seems like IDA doesn't support importing types that use C++ features, like templates. I was wondering if there's any way to work around this. I wouldn't want to start manually renaming and importing the types since there's thousands of them.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
