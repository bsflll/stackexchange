    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am using the following IDC script in IDA:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <idc.idc>\n\nstatic main()\n{   \n    for (i=0; i<10; i++)\n    {                           \n        PauseProcess();\n        \n        GetDebuggerEvent(WFNE_SUSP, -1);\n        Message(\"%s\n\", GetFunctionName(ScreenEA()));\n            \n        ResumeProcess();    \n\n        //Sleep(50);                      //does not work, see remarks below\n        //GetDebuggerEvent(WFNE_SUSP, 1); //same\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The main idea is to pause/resume process at regular intervals and check what is the current function (for profiling purposes).\n </p>\n <p>\n  What I am searching for is a IDC function that will pause the script for a given amount of time (eg : 50ms) while the process will be still running. A function that would resume debugged process execution from a suspended state and run code for a given amount of time will be OK too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What I have tried so far :\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <code>\n     Sleep(time)\n    </code>\n    : does not works as expected as it stop the execution of the debugged process as well (which is not what I want). I would like process to continue running while script is waiting.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <code>\n     GetDebuggerEvent(WFNE_SUSP, 1)\n    </code>\n    : idea is wait for suspend event (which will never happen) and use timeout (set to 1 second here). It works but the issue is time is specified in seconds which is a too big interval (it would have been OK if I could specify it in milliseconds).\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
