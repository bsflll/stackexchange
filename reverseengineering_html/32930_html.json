    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a Motorola 68K binary file that contains a table of a few hundred function pointers. If I set their data type to Pointer32, Ghidra interprets them as pointers as shown:\n </p>\n <pre><code>00100000 01 20 96 94     addr       DAT_01209694\n00100004 01 20 96 b2     addr       DAT_012096b2\n00100008 01 20 96 d0     addr       DAT_012096d0\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However, while the function pointers are stored as 32-bit values, they use a unique segment/address scheme:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   <code>\n    AA SA AA AA\n   </code>\n   (the segment in this project is always 2 and needs to be ignored when parsing the pointer address)\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Essentially, I need to make a 32-bit pointer data type that \"ignores\" the S part of the address, such that the data would look like this if it was correct:\n </p>\n <pre><code>00100000 01 20 96 94     addr       DAT_00109694\n00100004 01 20 96 b2     addr       DAT_001096b2\n00100008 01 20 96 d0     addr       DAT_001096d0\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I'm somewhat new to Ghidra, so any pointers (pun intended) to where I can read up on creating custom pointer types would be greatly appreciated!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
