Your question lacks\n <i>\n  all\n </i>\n the relevant details such as - but not limited to - the jurisdiction you are asking about. Unsurprisingly you will hardly find lawyers among this crowd and if you happened to find one, I doubt you'd get free advice. While we tend to be aware of legal implications of our actions in  jurisdictions relevant to us, advice you get from us may be severely flawed. So for example despite our saying otherwise, you may still end up being sued.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

If searching for legal advice you should really consult an expert in the relevant legal field instead of community-driven sites\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  First of all, cracking a program is not the same as finding a vulnerability in it. Although cracking a program may cause financial damages to the manufacturer, it does not pose any risk to the users. Additionally, except for unique\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   DRM\n  </a>\n  -ed software and where advanced anti-theft features are in place, manufacturers do not tend to combat cracks\n  <em>\n   too\n  </em>\n  thoroughly, piracy is an accepted lost of revenue to some extent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'll start by pointing at a relevant Israeli proverb -\n  <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fhe.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2F%25D7%259C%25D7%2594%25D7%25A9%25D7%25AA%25D7%2599%25D7%259F_%25D7%259E%25D7%2594%25D7%259E%25D7%25A7%25D7%25A4%25D7%25A6%25D7%2594\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Peeing from the diving stand\n  </a>\n  :\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   The statement is based on the fact that everyone knows that many pee in the swimming pool. While the general public prefers to ignore this wrongful act that it can not act against, the public will not stand in silence if someone does the same thing, peeing in the pool, from the diving stand.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  This goes to say if you're doing something wrongful, which you're aware might have legal implications, you should at least do it in private and not boast about it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, for the legality of cracking a piece of software and reporting that to the manufacturer; Although this greatly depends on the laws in the country / state you live in, it is usually not\n  <em>\n   illegal per say\n  </em>\n  but does violate most End User License Agreements, which you're bound to by using the software.
