    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am exploring MacOS Deckset app.\nIt has a trial version available on the official website.\nBut there's a cracked version available on torrent trackers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I want to know what was changed by the people who cracked that app: strings? symbols? few assembly instructions?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Both (genuine and cracked) versions are available as .DMG installers.\nI've extracted Deckset.app containers from both of them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, I'm able to explore\n  <code>\n   Deckset.app/Contents/MacOS/Deckset\n  </code>\n  binary in\n  <code>\n   Hopper\n  </code>\n  tool.\nBut as the cracked version is patched, I want to understand what actually was patched.\nFor this, I used\n  <code>\n   radiff2\n  </code>\n  tool from\n  <code>\n   Radare2\n  </code>\n  toolset:\n </p>\n <pre><code>radiff2 genuine.app/Contents/MacOS/Deckset cracked.app/Contents/MacOS/Deckset  > bin_diff.txt\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  It gave me output like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0x00000e98 901e => 101c 0x00000e98\n0x0000201c 109a => 9097 0x0000201c\n0x0027d486 770c => 585e 0x0027d486\n0x0027d48b 04 => 03 0x0027d48b\n0x0027d493 2c => 24 0x0027d493\n0x0027d49a 511a => 5097 0x0027d49a\n0x0027d49d 00 => 01 0x0027d49d\n0x0027d49f 05 => 00 0x0027d49f\n0x0027d4a3 fe00010000 => 07fade0c02 0x0027d4a3\n0x0027d4aa 53bcfade0c02 => 507300020100 0x0027d4aa\n0x0027d4b2 50ee => 0000 0x0027d4b2\n0x0027d4b5 020500 => 0000b3 0x0027d4b5\n0x0027d4b9 01 => 00 0x0027d4b9\n0x0027d4bb 00 => 30 0x0027d4bb\n0x0027d4be 012e => 0003 0x0027d4be\n0x0027d4c2 0060 => 027e 0x0027d4c2\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now, when I open \"genuine\" app in Hopper, and search for either\n  <code>\n   0x00000e98\n  </code>\n  , or\n  <code>\n   901e\n  </code>\n  , or\n  <code>\n   101c\n  </code>\n  , it gives nothing useful.\n </p>\n <p>\n  E.g. when I do\n  <code>\n   Menu > Navigate > Go to Address or Symbol\n  </code>\n  and enter\n  <code>\n   0x00000e98\n  </code>\n  , it gives me such segment:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/D9Bb2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/D9Bb2.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  I don't see nor\n  <code>\n   901e\n  </code>\n  , neither\n  <code>\n   101c\n  </code>\n  in this segment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What am I doing wrong?\nDo you know better tools for doing this (except IDA Pro, because it's expensive)?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
