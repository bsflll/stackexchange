    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I was playing around with some golang code I wrote, and I modified the Go BuildID. However, I had to pad whatever I wanted the buildID to be with characters so that it was the length of the original string.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I found that both\n  <code>\n   hexedit\n  </code>\n  and Ghirda's Byte Viewer (which allows modifying bytes) do not allow you to delete bytes (unless I cannot figure out how) from a file. I am wondering whats the reasoning, is there some sort of checksum they don't want you to overwrite? What about files where a checksum is not a concern?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Which tool can I use to modify hex bytes, including deleting them from the file?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
