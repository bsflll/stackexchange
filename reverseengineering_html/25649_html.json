Only debug symbols will give you a generic way of accessing the\n  <code>\n   argc\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   argv\n  </code>\n  symbols from the frame that represents\n  <code>\n   main\n  </code>\n  .

But without knowledge of <i>either</i> the symbols <i>or</i> the exact architecture, I doubt that merely switching to the respective frame will yield anything meaningful. Because you need to know how <code>argv</code> and <code>argc</code> would be located on the stack in absence of their symbolic names or have symbols to reference them ... as a sidenote: what I wrote <i>will</i> work.

I'll be curiously looking at whatever clever tricks others are able to conjure up for this. But given the volatile nature of registers, I doubt you have a chance of recovering that information - basically anywhere beyond the first few instructions of <code>main()</code> ... I don't find \"arguments to main\" as unambiguous as you seem to find it, though. Although the loophole with changing the contents of the command line exists.
