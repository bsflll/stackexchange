I haven't been able to track down a root cause or solution, unfortunately. Point being, I don't think you're missing anything; Ghidra just has rename issues sometimes. Maybe related:\n <a href=\"https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues/193\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues/193\n </a>\n</span>\n</body></html>",

So maybe, you should open up another issue on Github using the most recent Ghidra version and a minimum example to reproduce the issue. In my experience, the developers are very helpful and react to every opened issue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After renaming a variable, Ghidra will re-run the analysis of the currently displayed function. In some phase of this analysis it then seems to decide to get rid of the variable you\n  <em>\n   just\n  </em>\n  renamed. And for some reason it\n  <em>\n   then\n  </em>\n  sometimes decides to introduce a new variable doing the exact same thing your renamed (and now removed) variable did before with a new name. This effectively looks as if the rename was canceled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In my experience it sometimes help to\n  <strong>\n   Commit Local Names\n  </strong>\n  and/or\n  <strong>\n   Commit Params/Return\n  </strong>\n  (select it from the context menu of the Decompiler view). I realize, this is not a satisfying answer because I myself don't know exactly what's going on there, but from a practical perspective this solved the problem for me multiple times, so it might help you as well.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
