A new thread with\n  <code>\n   DbgBreakPoint\n  </code>\n  call is injected by the OS to ensure that the process gets stopped, since it could be in unknown state otherwise, and this thread is what you see.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What you can do is inspect the thread list, switch to the main one (usually first in the list), set some breakpoints up in the call stack and resume the process - the debugbreak thread will exit and your process should stop on the breakpoint so you can debug it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can also try\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/3988/60\">\n   this approach\n  </a>\n  by blabb.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
