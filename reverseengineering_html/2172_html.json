Second, if you look closely at the code you'll notice that this function identifies the CPU - by dissecting the return values of the\n  <code>\n   cpuid\n  </code>\n  instruction (\n  <code>\n   4187d6\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   4187f7\n  </code>\n  ) - (more accurately the micro architecture and other features such as cache size, ...) you're running your\n  <code>\n   ELF\n  </code>\n  binary on, and then decides which implementation suites that configuration best. This way, the\n  <code>\n   strcpy\n  </code>\n  function called in the above C code will always be the fastest possible, whatever architecture you're on (Intel: Nehalem, Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell, ...; AMD: Phenom, Opteron, ...; ...). Keep in mind that those fast implementations have been hand optimized and fine tuned for each of the possible target architectures.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So that's what the\n  <code>\n   PLT\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   GOT\n  </code>\n  sections are used for in your static\n  <code>\n   ELF\n  </code>\n  binary file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, if you want to investigate this yourself, you should compile the\n  <code>\n   C\n  </code>\n  code above with GCC version 4.9 (which is the one I used) using the\n  <code>\n   -static\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   -g3\n  </code>\n  (debug symbols) flags. Then, disassemble the binary file using\n  <code>\n   objdump\n  </code>\n  and the\n  <code>\n   -D\n  </code>\n  switch in order to have all the\n  <code>\n   ELF\n  </code>\n  sections. You can then go through all the sections and explore the assembly code. You can also run the binary file using\n  <code>\n   gdb\n  </code>\n  and set breakpoints at key locations and run the program step by step.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
