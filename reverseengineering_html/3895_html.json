    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm running a 64-bit MS Windows 7 with all updates installed. About 1 or 2 weeks ago I've noticed that whenever I restart the OS, the virtual memory pages (of whatever process), corresponding to system libraries like\n  <code>\n   ntdll.dll\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   kernel32.dll\n  </code>\n  are slightly different.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm not talking about the base address of the loaded modules, because I know that changes due to ASLR. I'm talking about the actual contents of the loaded modules, which as far as I know was not affected by ASLR implementations on Windows.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To illustrate what I mean, let me show you the following screenshot that compares 2 binary instances of\n  <code>\n   ntdll.dll\n  </code>\n  captured before (top-half) and after (bottom-halt) one OS restart:\n  <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xHpGR.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The picture shows just a small part of\n  <code>\n   ntdll.dll\n  </code>\n  and therefore just a few differences. However, there are more. The size of these DLLs don't change, only some bytes at particular locations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I obtained the 2 binary instances which are compared in the previous picture using Process Hacker like so:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Right-click a process and select\n   <strong>\n    Properties\n   </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Go to the\n   <strong>\n    Memory\n   </strong>\n   tab and scroll-down until you find several entries having the name:\n   <em>\n    ntdll.dll: Image (Commit)\n   </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Double-click one of these entries (I chose the one that had 856kB)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Press the\n   <strong>\n    Save...\n   </strong>\n   button to store the contents to a binary file on the HDD.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Question 1:\n  </strong>\n  What is causing these bytes to change?\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <strong>\n    Sub-question 1.1:\n   </strong>\n   Is is some sort of protection mechanism?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <strong>\n    Sub-question 1.2:\n   </strong>\n   Was it recently introduced?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <strong>\n    Sub-question 1.3:\n   </strong>\n   Can it be disabled?\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Question 2:\n  </strong>\n  What do these changing bytes represent in the code of the DLLs?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Anything that's not relative to the base (be it global variables or calls or whatever) needs to be adjusted if the image base changes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  PE files can have a relocation table for that. Can, as in standard .exe files usually don't have it, as it was not necessary until ASLR (random base addresses for modules) came along.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For DLLs the base address is likely to change as it depends on what other files are already loaded so they almost always have a base relocation table that says \"If the base address differs from XYZ, add the delta to the following locations\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you are curios how that base relocation table looks like, I'll recommend checking out the following:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    See the following code implementing a\n    <a href=\"http://secureimplugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/CryptoPP/dllloader.cpp\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n     custom PE file loader\n    </a>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Search for\n    <code>\n     IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BASERELOC\n    </code>\n    to see code handling the relocation directory.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
