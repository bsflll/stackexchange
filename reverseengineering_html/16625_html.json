What I've learned:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   I found no way to label locals in the debugger window.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   There's\n   <code>\n    Locals\n   </code>\n   tab in the bottom panel. I can give names to locals there, but they don't propagate to the main window.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   I can rename variables in the decompiler window, but again, they don't sync with the debugger window.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  If x64dbg lacks this functionality, is there any plugin that achieves this?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
