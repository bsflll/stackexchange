Once such applications are compiled, the logic is contained in one dll. After opening this dll into IDA, it appears pretty clear that the file contains a .NET part (located in the section\n  <code>\n   .rdata\n  </code>\n  ) and generic stub as native code in the\n  <code>\n   .text\n  </code>\n  section.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Did anyone already succeed to extract the .NET code in the\n  <code>\n   .rdata\n  </code>\n  section and open it in a standard decompiler?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cheers!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
