    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I was looking for a spcific string in IDA, but there were no hits in the \"string view\". Now after browsing the disassembly for a while I realize that not only does the string exist, IDA did in fact find this string. It was referenced by assembly code, IDA prints it as a comment next to the assembly, even the location of the string is named with the first characters of the string!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Very annoying! How come it is not listed in the string view, then? How would I go about finding referenced text strings by string?\n </p>\n <p>\n  edit: an example:\n </p>\n <pre><code>and     [rsp+18h+var_10], 0\nlea     rax, aSettextfromsrc ; \"settextfromsrc\"\nmov     [rsp+18h+var_18], rax\nmov     r9, [rsp+18h+var_1A]\n...\n text \"UTF-16LE\", 'settextfromsrc',0\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  maybe bc of the UTF-16LE?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
