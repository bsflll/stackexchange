There is a check applied by verifier (\n  <strong>\n   \\IDAFolder\\plugins\\hexrays_sdk\\verifier\\cverify.cpp\n  </strong>\n  ) in\n  <strong>\n   cfunc_t::verify_insn\n  </strong>\n  function:\n </p>\n <pre><code>case cit_if:\n  if ( maturity < CMAT_TRANS1 || maturity >= CMAT_CASTED )\n  {\n    ea_t jea = i->cif->expr.calc_jmp_cnd_ea();\n    if ( jea != BADADDR && i->ea != jea )\n      // ctree: mismatch in if-statement and its expression addresses\n      CFAIL_QASSERT(50683, i);\n  }\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  There are also many other INTERRs for decompilation in case anyone is looking. So, the correct code in my case had to have something like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>new_item = idaapi.cexpr_t(item.cif.expr.x)\nnew_item.ea = item.cif.expr.ea\n# or just new_item.ea = idaapi.BADADDR it works too\nitem.cif.expr.swap(new_item)\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
