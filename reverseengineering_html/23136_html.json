But when I NOP it, the game just crash because it corrupt the function. So, I don't know what to do for block the JMP with a byte-patch.\nThere is a screen of the address below.\nThanks in advance !\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/diT4T.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Address ASM\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/diT4T.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It's looks like the JMP where the actual code gets executed so maybe the whole function call is not needed? But that's difficult to tell from such limited view of the code.

Try to look for what happens in\n  <code>\n   7FFCAE2A0F13\n  </code>\n  , and maybe to patch inside.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

One, as macr0controller notes, is that the jump might be to essential code that runs before the routine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The second is that the jump might not be a fixed address, meaning that there's a relocation item that points to it, so any NOPs that you write will be replaced with what becomes garbage instructions if you replace the 0xE9 instruction with a NOP as well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Instead, you could change the 0xE9 (JMP) to an instruction of equivalent length such as 0x3D (CMP EAX, imm32) which alters no registers and will not be affected by the following values.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
