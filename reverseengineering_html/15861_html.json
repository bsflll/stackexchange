    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm using BinDiff to perform diff operation between two 32-bit Binaries (one of them is a DLL and the other one an EXE).\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I perform the Diff Operation, I get the error message:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Adding new Diff to workspace failed. Diff binary does not exist.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  I am using IDA Pro version 6.9.160222 and BinDiff version 4.2.0\n </p>\n <p>\n  I opened each of the binaries with IDA Pro and saved the IDB file.\nBinDiff was launched using bindiff.cmd (which in turn launches the bindiff.jar)\n </p>\n <p>\n  From the GUI, I created a New Work Space and then from the menu, Diffs -> New Diff\n </p>\n <p>\n  For the Primary and Secondary source, I selected the IDB files corresponding to each of the binaries. Now, when I press Diff, it gives the error message: \"Adding new Diff to workspace failed. Diff binary does not exist.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Why is it not able to locate the Diff Binary?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Both differ.exe and differ64.exe are present in the same directory as bindiff.jar\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another option I tried was in IDA Pro, instead of saving the IDA, I used the BinExport plugin to save the BinExport Files. Even when BinDiff uses the BinExport files saved from IDA Pro, I get the same error message.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My OS Version is: Win 7 64-bit.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
