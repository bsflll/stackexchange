    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  The Radare2 command line (I believe it's called \"interactive mode\"?) allows bringing back history and editing it with the arrow keys. However, I prefer to use vi/vim keybindings for this. How do I configure this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I do have a\n  <code>\n   $HOME/.inputrc\n  </code>\n  file which contains\n  <code>\n   set editing-mode vi\n  </code>\n  , and this works for many programs (presumably all that use GNU Readline or a compatible library).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Alternatively, is there an option available to build Radare2 with Readline?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

However, this is\n  <em>\n   very\n  </em>\n  limited; it's even missing basic movement commands such as\n  <kbd>\n   f\n  </kbd>\n  and\n  <kbd>\n   t\n  </kbd>\n  , and some commands such as\n  <kbd>\n   cw\n  </kbd>\n  do not appear to work properly. Searching with vi keybindings is unavailable; you must still use the Emacs\n  <kbd>\n   Ctrl-R\n  </kbd>\n  syntax to search backwards in your history. And a special warning:\n  <kbd>\n   Enter\n  </kbd>\n  in command mode will do nothing; you must enter insert mode and press\n  <kbd>\n   Enter\n  </kbd>\n  to enter the command you've just brought up or edited.\n </p>\n <p>\n  (I found the setting by searching the configuration variables using\n  <code>\n   e scr. ~vi\n  </code>\n  ; thanks to @blabb for mentioning this to me.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Radare2 uses its own command line editing code, in\n  <code>\n   libr/cons/dietline.c\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
