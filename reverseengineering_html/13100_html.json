    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to write some scripts that do some string searching through the disassembly in IDA. Currently, I loop through all the disassembly, MinEA() to MaxEA() and use idc.FindText() to see if a potential string is in the disassembly. Although this works, its very time consuming. I was wondering if there was a way I could just use an API method to get all the strings in IDAs string window. For example, I was able to get all the imports used in the import window by using idaapi.get_import_module_qty() and idaapi.enum_import_names(i, import_call_back). That's very fast and I can easily just check if something has been imported. Is there something similar that will allow me to get all the strings from the strings window? If not, is there a less time-consuming method of string searching that is possible? Thanks for any input.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
