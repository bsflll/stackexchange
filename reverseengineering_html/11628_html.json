(Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 in this case) How would I approach this? Would I need to find the console's memory address and write memory to that or is that the wrong approach?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Another trick try running your own game server this usually gives you access to developer's console for modding the server configurations i'd debug it here to find out what makes it open and close.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
