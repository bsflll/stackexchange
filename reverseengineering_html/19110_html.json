What you can do is in  your exception handler check which address generated the fault, and if it's not the variable you want to \"protect\", restore permissions to the original value, single-step to allow the write be performed, then disable writes again. This is complicated and pretty slow so should be used only when necessary.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
