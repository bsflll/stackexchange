The lack of tools means you need to write your own obfuscator, but that's not too difficult.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Basically, think of anything you would do to reverse engineer a program and transform it to make that harder.\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Make your invariants complex. Transform program invariants into stuff like `(x ** y) % p == 457' or \"this data structure represents an achordal graph\". Such invariants are highly unlikely to be guessed by a static or dynamic analysis tool and will take ages for humans to figure out.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Mix together logic of different methods. Take every good design practice and do the opposite. Randomly inline portions of methods into other methods, and then rearrange the code. Duplicate portions of the CFG and randomly insert jumps between corresponding points in the two versions, then mutate them so they're not obviously duplicates.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Add a packer. Bonus pointers if you only decrypt portions of the code when you actually need to execute them, and make the results depend on program state so it's difficult to determine the keys in advance. Try to make sure the original program never appears in memory at once.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  The main challenges to obfuscation are that it requires understanding of the program and usually hurts performance. The more extreme obfuscations are only applicable in cases where performance doesn't matter and withstanding intense scrutiny is important (i.e. malware).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
