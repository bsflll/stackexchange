    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I need to analyse a sample which creates a child process. I want to analyze the child process, too, but I have the following problem. Therefore, I take the command line plugin for my olldbg v1.10 and type the following command:\n </p>\n <pre><code>childdbg 1\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  (that is also described at\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21695192/can-ollydbg-trace-a-launched-exe\">\n   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21695192/can-ollydbg-trace-a-launched-exe\n  </a>\n  by blabb )\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the plugin says:\n </p>\n <pre><code> Unrecognized command: CHILDDBG\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Why this appears? How can I fix it ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  PS:\nBefore somebody recommend me to use ollydbg v2.01 (because it has a built-in option to debug a child process), I can say that I can not open the sample with ollydb v2.01 but this is a topic which I asked here:\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/8614/getting-a-debug-message-after-opening-a-sample-with-ollydbg-2-01?noredirect=1#comment12249_8614\">\n   \"Debugged application has modified the debugging registers\" with ollydbg 2.01\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  best regards,\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
