This can contain code or data and is governed by\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/mm-bad-pointer#paged_code\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   the PAGED_CODE macro\n  </a>\n  , among others, at source code level.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That is, whatever gets stored in that section cannot be accessed at arbitrary IRQLs. Quote:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   If the IRQL > APC_LEVEL, the PAGED_CODE macro causes the system to ASSERT.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Also see\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/overview-of-windows-memory-space\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   this\n  </a>\n  for an entry point into the overall topic.
