I applied the patch by using the patch menu, which modifies the DATABASE representation of the executable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I go to run the executable via\n  <em>\n   Debugger -> Run\n  </em>\n  , it warns me that the database has been patched and there may be inconsistencies. However, when it finally runs it runs the original executable without patched code!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way to tell IDA to run the patched code? Or, since it's only patched in the database, my only choice is to export a\n  <em>\n   DIF\n  </em>\n  file and patch it manually to confirm it works?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Hence, you'll have to do this the old way. I'll expand my answer and will go over things you already know so others (e.g coming from search engines) can benefit from a whole complete answer.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Edit the configuration file\n </h2>\n <p>\n  The first thing you have to do is to modify an IDA GUI configuration file named\n  <em>\n   idagui.cfg\n  </em>\n  . You should be able to find the file at\n  <em>\n   \"IDA Free\\cfg\\idagui.cfg\"\n  </em>\n  . Locate the file and change\n  <em>\n   \"DISPLAY_PATCH_SUBMENU\"\n  </em>\n  form\n  <em>\n   \"NO\"\n  </em>\n  to\n  <em>\n   \"YES\"\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  After that, start IDA Free and you'll see a fresh new sub-menu called\n  <em>\n   \"Patch program\"\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Patching\n </h2>\n <p>\n  You should be able to use this sub-menu to edit the program. It's pretty intuitive, just put your cursor wherever you want to make a change, and choose the appropriate option from the sub-menu.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   <em>\n    Notice\n   </em>\n  </strong>\n  that every patch you do is only affected on the IDB, the IDA Database. Thus, the binary on disk won't be affected and when you'll try to debug/execute it you will not see your patches.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Exporting a .DIF file\n </h2>\n <p>\n  When you finish with all your patches, it's time to apply them to the binary on disk. To do this, you'll first have to produce a\n  <em>\n   .DIF\n  </em>\n  file that will contain a list of the changes you've made.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To produce this file go to\n  <em>\n   File -> Produce File -> Create DIF file...\"\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Applying the changes to the binary\n </h2>\n <p>\n  You can use\n  <a href=\"https://stalkr.net/files/ida/idadif.py\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   this\n  </a>\n  <em>\n   Python\n  </em>\n  script by\n  <em>\n   stalker\n  </em>\n  to apply the changes. Use it like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ idadif.py <original_binary> <IDA_DIF_file.dif> [revert]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Alternatives:\n  </strong>\n  \n\n  <em>\n   Note that I didn't test these alternatives and I'm pretty sure that some of them will not work with IDA Free\n  </em>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"http://www.idabook.com/chapter14/ida_patcher.c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    ida_patcher.c\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://github.com/nihilus/IDA-IDC-Scripts/blob/master/PE-scripts/pe_write.idc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    pe_write.idc\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://github.com/iphelix/ida-patcher\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    IDA Patcher plugin\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://github.com/grepwood/ida-dif-patch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    IDA DIF Patch\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
