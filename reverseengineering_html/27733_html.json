(CGI files in www folder)\n \n\n When I connect to the web page of my router, I can see links include CGI file names.\n \n\n But after unpacking, I can see only html files, I can't see CGI files.\n \n\n I think only some files are unpacked with binwalk tools.\n \n\n How do you think what's the problem?\n \n\n Thank you\n</div>\n</body></html>",
