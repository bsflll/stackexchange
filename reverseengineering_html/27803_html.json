    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  While RE an embedded device I ran into a problem - I need to patch a check in the kernel which has no sources available. Unpacking the kernel and binary-patching went smoothly. However I cannot get over\n  <strong>\n   repacking the vmlinux into zImage/bzImage\n  </strong>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I extracted the kernel using\n  <code>\n   extract-vmlinux\n  </code>\n  (modified to show offset here):\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ ../../extract-vmlinux zImage > vmlinux\nFound valid magic - decompressed using unlzma (tail -c+15967 \"zImage\" | unlzma)\nHeader at: head -c15966\nCompressed at: tail -c+15967\n\n$ binwalk zImage\n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n15966         0x3E5E          LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 67108864 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Next, without any modifications, I wanted to recompress it back and keep the header, as to my knowledge it has the decompression code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ cat <(head -c15966 zImage) <(lzma -z < vmlinux) > zImage-repacked\n$ ls -l\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 3032080 Jun  5 22:32 zImage\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 3024065 Jun  6 00:04 zImage-repacked\n\n$ binwalk zImage-repacked\n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n15966         0x3E5E          LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The image came ~8k short, which didn't worry me (as my compression might have been more aggressive). However the image is now broken:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ ../../extract-vmlinux zImage-repacked > /dev/null\nextract-vmlinux: Cannot find vmlinux.\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I also found that the\n  <code>\n   extract-linux\n  </code>\n  script pipes everything after the offset to\n  <code>\n   unlzma\n  </code>\n  but there's 9441 bytes of\n  <em>\n   something\n  </em>\n  which\n  <code>\n   unlzma\n  </code>\n  ignores. When removed I'm getting a pure archive which matches the size saved just after it:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ tail -c+15967 zImage | head -c-9441 | unlzma > /dev/null ; echo $?\n0\n$ tail -c+15967 zImage | head -c-9441 | unlzma | wc --bytes\n13871216\n$ tail -c+15967 zImage | head -c-9437 | tail -c4 | od -i --endian=little\n0000000    13871216\n0000004\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I know the classical wisdom is \"you have to recompile\" but we're on RE - this is not possible ;)\n  \n\n  How can I approach\n  <strong>\n   re-packing of the modified vmlinux back to LZMA-zImage\n  </strong>\n  ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
