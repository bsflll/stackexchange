But every time I hit a breakpoint the virtual machine CPU usage skyrockets and the CPU registers do not show up in WinDBG. Am I doing something wrong?\n </p>\n <p>\n  What I have done:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   In\n   <code>\n    boot.ini\n   </code>\n   I set\n   <code>\n    /debugport=COM1 /baudrate=115200\n   </code>\n   ;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   In VirtualBox I forwarded\n   <code>\n    COM1\n   </code>\n   to a named pipe\n   <code>\n    \\\\.\\pipe\\debug\n   </code>\n   ;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   In WinDBG File >\n   <code>\n    Kernel Debug...\n   </code>\n   >\n   <code>\n    COM\n   </code>\n   tab: Ticked the \"Pipe\" check box, and for the\n   <code>\n    Port = \\\\\\\\.\\pipe\\debug\n   </code>\n   ;\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  In WinDBG the debug session is found, and I can hit breakpoints, I can step through code, I can see the disassembled code in the \"Disassembly window\", and I can view memory locations in the \"Memory window\". But nothing shows up in WinDBG \"Registers window\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Host OS is Windows 10 and for the Virtual Guest OS i tried both Windows XP and Windows 7 both have the same issue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am really not sure where to look for answers to this issue, could anyone point me in the right direction ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  For anyone else having this issue or trying to learn kernel debugging i used parts from the following tutorials to get to where I am so far:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Windows_Kernel_Debugging\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Windows Kernel Debugging Tips\n   </a>\n   (Virtualbox documentation);\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/03/27/configure-windbg-kernel-debugging/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    How to configure WinDbg for kernel debugging\n   </a>\n   (blogpost).\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
