Those columns are boolean and the column character stands for \"True\" while the dot stands for \"False\".\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   R stands for \"Returns\" and is True (has an \"R\" in the column's value instead of a dot) if the function returns. Functions may not return and this requires special handling by IDA and the reverse engineer.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   F stands for \"Far\" and is true for functions that are far functions, or false otherwise.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   L stands for \"Library\" function, and is true for functions IDA recognised as library functions (usually using\n   <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/tech/flirt/in_depth.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    FLIRT\n   </a>\n   ).\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   S stands for \"Static\" function.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   B stands for a E/R/BP stack frame based function. As part of IDA's analysis functions that use the xBP register for easier stack access are marked so.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   T stands for Type and indicates whether a function has type information assigned. Either manually or automatically by IDA using FLIRT.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   the equal sign (=) indicates the frame pointer is equal to the initial stack pointer.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  All of those values can be manually accessible using the \"Edit function\" dialog (\n  <kbd>\n   alt+p\n  </kbd>\n  ), like seen here:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yNEtX.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"IDA edit function dialog\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yNEtX.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is also documented and can be found at\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/586.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Hex-Rays website\n  </a>\n  , with a shorter explanation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Additionally, according to\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/18454/what-is-the-meaning-of-single-letters-in-idas-functions-window#comment29115_18455\">\n   Arnaud Diederen\n  </a>\n  :\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   since 7.1, IDA also provides tooltips for those arguably cryptic single-letter columns.
