Instead of explaining it all, I'm going to give you some resources to read through.\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Read all about\n    <a href=\"http://faydoc.tripod.com/cpu/stos.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     STOS*\n    </a>\n    and\n    <a href=\"http://faydoc.tripod.com/cpu/rep.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     REP\n    </a>\n    . Read them carefully and process what you're reading! Those two resources explain everything to you insofar as how those instructions work.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Read about the\n    <a href=\"http://faydoc.tripod.com/cpu/lea.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     LEA instruction\n    </a>\n    . Since there are no offsets being referenced with edx, the way that instruction is written is effectively the same as\n    <code>\n     mov edi,edx\n    </code>\n    . Knowing that, now what do you think is in edi?\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Take some time to really wrap your head around the difference between stack and heap. You may have to read/watch content from multiple sources, but\n    <a href=\"https://www.gribblelab.org/CBootCamp/7_Memory_Stack_vs_Heap.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     here is a great place to start\n    </a>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    (and 5): Use what you learn from the aforementioned points to address your questions about heap/stack. I HIGHLY recommending using something like\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/zerosum0x0/WinREPL\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     WinREPL\n    </a>\n    and/or an\n    <a href=\"http://carlosrafaelgn.com.br/asm86/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     assembly emulator\n    </a>\n    to view register states and step through cycles as instructions run. If you want to do this with your code, consider running\n    <code>\n     mov edx,0x4b0000\n    </code>\n    first so the lea instruction will properly operate with an address that's observable for a command like\n    <code>\n     .read addr size\n    </code>\n    in WinREPL.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
