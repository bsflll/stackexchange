    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  We are trying to examine a firmware download for a product we have running on our local network.  Using the command\n </p>\n <pre><code>binwalk -Me filename\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  we generated a folder that contains the following content:\n </p>\n <pre><code>184A46C.cramfs\n276466C.cramfs\n6C.cramfs\nC2426C.cramfs\ncramfs-root/\ncramfs-root-0/\ncramfs-root-1/\ncramfs-root-2/\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Binwalk appears to have opened the CramFS just fine.  So navigating into cramfs-root and running the file command, we see the following:\n </p>\n <pre><code>app.tar.lzma:    data\ncopy_logo:       data\ncramfs.img:      empty\ndvrCmd.tar.gz:   data\nhicore.tar.lzma: data\nhisi.tar.lzma:   data\nlogo.tar.lzma:   data\nmisc.tar.lzma:   data\nnew_10.bin:      data\nplayer.bin:      PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows, UPX compressed\nstart.sh:        data\nuImage:          u-boot legacy uImage, Linux-3.0.8, Linux/ARM, OS Kernel     Image (Not compressed), 2854980 bytes, Tue Apr 14 10:16:02 2015, Load Address: 0x80008000, Entry Point: 0x80008000, Header CRC: 0x6C502F38, Data     CRC: 0xE9307D6E\nversion:         ASCII text\nwebs.tar.lzma:   data\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Other than the uImage file, which apparently contains a linux kernel, most of the files here are apparently .tar.lzma files.  Attempting to open one of them as a normal .tar.lzma is not working for us.\n </p>\n <pre><code>tar --lzma -xvf logo.tar.lzma\nxz: (stdin): File format not recognized\ntar: Child returned status 1\ntar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Trying something else:\n </p>\n <pre><code>unlzma logo.tar.lzma\nunlzma: Decoder error\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  lzmainfo seems to think it is valid, however, but it is calculating it as a laughably large, multi-petabyte file.  I am quite sure it is not.\n </p>\n <pre><code>lzmainfo logo.tar.lzma\n\nlogo.tar.lzma\nUncompressed size:             8351652399384 MB (8757342266336797407 bytes)\nDictionary size:               525 MB (2^29 bytes)\nLiteral context bits (lc):     0\nLiteral pos bits (lp):         2\nNumber of pos bits (pb):       4\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I've uploaded the file\n  <a href=\"http://ge.tt/18asCBf2\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  if you care to look at it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Wouldn't it be possible to run the linux kernel in an emulator, and use the emulator to read the file system?  I opened the chassis, looked at the board, and googled the part numbers for chips I saw.  I didn't see any crypto devices on the board, so I'm going to assume that the decryption is implemented in the firmware image itself, in the plaintext portion.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
