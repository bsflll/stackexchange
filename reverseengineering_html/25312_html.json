I deleted\n  <code>\n   C:\\Program Files\\VMware\n  </code>\n  folder and those drivers, killed\n  <code>\n   VGAuthService.exe\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   vmtoolsd.exe\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   vm3dservice.exe\n  </code>\n  processes but it's still detected, which means I'm missing something. However, when I uninstall VMware Tools, even without rebooting the machine, it's undetected.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a tool/or way to find which files VMware Tools installation drops on disk, what it modifies, etc.? I remember there was a tool \"Orca\" which was useful for .MSI files, but it's not in this case.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My VM:\n </p>\n <pre><code>VMware® Workstation 15 Pro\n15.5.5 build-16285975\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
