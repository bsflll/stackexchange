Any info you can share to point me on the right direction will be appreciated.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I didn't want to ask the people that will try the code to make their system insecure by disabling ASLR on the whole OS. The answer is using <code>-no-pie</code> on GCC. That will generate an executable without a GOT(Global Offsets Table).  Thanks for your help!</span>",
