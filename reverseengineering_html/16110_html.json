Apparently you can set this flag by using the\n  <code>\n   /dll:system\n  </code>\n  <a href=\"https://www.geoffchappell.com/studies/msvc/link/link/options/dll.htm?tx=37\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   switch of LINK.EXE\n  </a>\n  but I don't know of any file actually using it; however apparently such files won't be loaded in user mode (see comment).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
