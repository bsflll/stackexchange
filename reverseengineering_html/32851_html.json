Maybe there is some plugin to fix this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Xl68H.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"data types\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Xl68H.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XdDkF.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Hex_View in IDA\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XdDkF.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
