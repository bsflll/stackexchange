    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to gather data for a data science project. The target is info on rock climbing routes, and there is a certain site that hosts a ton of crowd-sourced data, however they removed their api after an acquisition last year. However, they still expose this route data on a cdn so that their mobile app can download this data for offline use. I'm trying to read information out of these text files, and they are\n  <em>\n   almost\n  </em>\n  human-readable but certainly not in an easy-to-parse format. Here is an example of the first bit (screenshot from a tool to show null characters):\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MB98Rwop.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"screenshot of a tool showing a lot of null characters in the text\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MB98Rwop.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  As you can see there are bits of well-formatted JSON surrounded by a bunch of null characters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've tried to open this file with several tools that I thought would make sense to use to transfer bulk data between a server and a mobile app - I've tried opening it as a serialized Java Object OutputStream, a Realm database file (I believe they use realm & kotlin) and BSON, but no dice. Has anyone worked with a file formatted like this before or have any suggestions as to what other tools I should try?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is an example file:\n  <a href=\"https://cdn2.apstatic.com/mobile/climb/V2-105905173.txt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://cdn2.apstatic.com/mobile/climb/V2-105905173.txt\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
