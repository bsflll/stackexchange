Any good compression or encryption will result in entropy in the region of 95% or higher.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For this firmware,\n  <code>\n   binwalk -E\n  </code>\n  shows large areas with entropy in the 70-85% range (probably code), with other much lower (likely data) and only small areas with higher (the surrounding data suggests this is certificates.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  To identify the architecture,\n  <code>\n   binwalk -A\n  </code>\n  can sometimes help.  However, in this case, it doesn't find anything it can identify.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, looking through the data I found, at offset\n  <code>\n   0x1F4134\n  </code>\n  , a list of opcodes. Googling for some of the more unusual looking ones (FLUSHDA, MULXUU, CALLR) returns a list of results all mentioning the\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nios_II\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Nios II\n  </a>\n  architecture.  This architecture is for Altera FPGAs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Similarly, googling for an decent quality image of a CIM 500 shows a chip with what looks very much like an Altera FPGA's markings (albeit mostly covered with a sticker.)\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Edit:\n  </strong>\n  I've done a further check to confirm the architecture.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nios II encodes the\n  <code>\n   ret\n  </code>\n  (return) instruction as\n  <code>\n   F800283A\n  </code>\n  .\nThe appears many times through the firmware file (in little-endian byte order.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first occurrence is at offset\n  <code>\n   0009D3B8\n  </code>\n  , with offset\n  <code>\n   0009D100\n  </code>\n  being a plausible start for the code.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
