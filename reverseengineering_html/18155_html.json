When disassembling we already have the assembled file as an opcodes so what the disassembler do is reverse it to a readable form e.g\n <code>\n  83EC1C => sub esp, 0x1c\n </code>\n , the disassembler doesn't actually change anything in the file it just shows you the translation which is the assembly language instructions.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
