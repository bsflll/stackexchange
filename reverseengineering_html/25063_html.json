Is there a way to integrate them into one dex or jar file then decompile so there would be one source code in the end?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Then unzip each file to the same directory, enter the directory and then zip them all up into a single, massive, jar (zip file).\n </p>\n <p>\n  After this you can open this as a single jar with\n  <code>\n   jadx\n  </code>\n  or whatever tool you'd like.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
