    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am having some troubles with my learning of Assembly and reverse engineering. Specifically, I am learning about Global vs Local variables. For Global variables I have managed to get insights in assembly that they are stored in memory address. For Local variables I expect them to be stored on stack (theory), but my simple C code below, when being disassembled in Ghidra, does not show anything in main function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  C CODE:\n </p>\n <pre><code>void main()\n{\n    int x = 1;\n    int y = 2;\n    x = x + y;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  GHIDRA OUTPUT:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DcGBz.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DcGBz.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Why can't I see anything in my Ghidra? It looks like an empty function to me, but clearly there should be some local variable declaration and then addition performed afterwards.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I really apologize for opening threads here often, but this is the only source where I can get help for such things. On Reddit they do not allow posting questions and referred me here.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   EDIT - 25.09.2019:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  As per suggestion I have added some code to my existing C Code to see if it will show up now in Assembly:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    int x = 1;\n    int y = 2;\n\n    x = x + y;\n\n    printf(\"Rezultat = %d\n\", x);\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  For this I had to set entry point back to CRT initialize, otherwise I could not use stdio Library. This is now the result of main function in Ghidra:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uOCeM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uOCeM.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now I am able to see the PUSH instruction and the value 0x03. This is probably the resulting value of addition 1 + 2, but I again can't nowhere see where are the local variables initialized nor where the arithmetic operation is performed.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
