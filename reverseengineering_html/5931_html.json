    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I overcame recent issues with a redefinition and finished my Plugin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In short this plugin uses Hex-Rays Decompiler to decompile a given file, analyzes properties of the pseudocode and then appends the results to a\n  <code>\n   .csv\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now I tried to use this in batch mode, but was stumped as the following happened:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cmd input to call IDA:\n </p>\n <pre><code>idaw -A -c -Srecompile.idc input_file\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The\n  <code>\n   recompile.idc\n  </code>\n  file:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <idc.idc>\nstatic main() {\nWait();\nMessage(\"Hello world from IDC!\n\");\nRunPlugin(\"REcompile vs Hexrays\",0); \n//Exit(0);\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I obviously need to\n  <code>\n   Wait()\n  </code>\n  for Auto-Analysis.\n  <code>\n   Exit()\n  </code>\n  is commented since it's for use when this is all fixed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now i do get the following output on execution:\n </p>\n <pre><code>The initial autoanalysis has been finished.\nHello world from IDC!\n\nLoadLibrary(C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA\\plugins\\REcompile vs Hexrays.plw) error: Das angegebene Modul wurde nicht gefunden.\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA\\plugins\\REcompile vs Hexrays.plw: can't load file\nHex-Rays Decompiler plugin has been loaded (v1.6.0.111005)\nHex-rays version 1.6.0.111005 has been detected, REcompile vs Hexrays ready to use\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  As you can see the script is executed before the plugins are loaded. I assume this is the reason why I get the\n  <code>\n   LoadLibrary\n  </code>\n  Error.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you have any other input or experience with plugin batch execution i'd be happy to hear from you.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Greetings, \nViktor\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
