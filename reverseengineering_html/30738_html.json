    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am digging with disassembler inside old game (release year 2002) and something is bugging me, I noticed it has a bunch of... questionable instructions. One of the things it does is calling imported functions indirectly through register, which seems totally unnecessary, example:\n </p>\n <pre><code>push someStringPointer\nmov esi, dword ptr [->KERNEL32.DLL::OutputDebugStringA] ;pointer inside import table\ncall esi\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This could be done without register, since you can just use the absolute address right away. Does using the register serve any purpose? Maybe it's a thing old compilers did? Or some kind of cheap measure against static reversing? I saw it occasionally uses the stored pointer to call something more than once, but it's rare, and doesn't sound like it would improve performance ( more often it wastes up to 3 different registers like that).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm using Ghidra to do the reverse engineering and it suggests that this game was compiled with MSVC compiler (it recognised a lot of standard functions from it).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Loading the pointer into a register saves a few bytes of code space and saves a memory deference when compared to just calling into the IAT twice.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
