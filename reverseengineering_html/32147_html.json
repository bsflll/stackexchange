As shown in the following figure.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/f2L81.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/f2L81.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

That option will show you \"-3\" for the constant you have selected. None of them will show you \"3\", because all of the numbers are negative. You are mistaken about the contents of the source code.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
