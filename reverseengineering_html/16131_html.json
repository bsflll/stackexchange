Any clue why?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The obfuscation software is Dotfuscator. de4dot runs just fine, apparently.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I debug into de4dot, looks ok. Though apparently it's not, I guess I need to learn more.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

If de4dot succeeded, what then? The internets say, just open DotPeek and voil√†...!\n</span>\n</body></html>",
