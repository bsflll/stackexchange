    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have an ARM based Huawei router and Im trying to do injection vulnerability on page under diagnostics where's \"ping\" feature is. So first I tried this command\n  <code>\n   -c 1 127.0.0.1\n  </code>\n  and it worked\n </p>\n <pre><code>--- DNS Statistics ---\nServer Response = Non-Existent Domain\nWanIP = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nName = -c 1 127.0.0.1\nAddress = -\nAliases = -\nTime = 15ms\n--- Ping Statistics ---\nOperation failed.\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  then I tried this command\n  <code>\n   127.0.0.1; echo -c 4\n  </code>\n  but I get\n </p>\n <pre><code>Test failed.\n--- Ping Statistics ---\nOperation failed.\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and after some more google-ing I found this command\n  <code>\n   ping -c 5 \"$(id)\" and when I click on\n  </code>\n  start ping` it seams that's get stuck in some loop\nI suspect that maybe shell is open, here is how it looks\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5xywJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5xywJ.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I want to recreate sending that command with curl, I created mine curl like this\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DePbs.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DePbs.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I think\n  <code>\n   maintenancend.cgi\n  </code>\n  is resposable for ping requests. In\n  <a href=\"https://mega.nz/file/IdBTDIiC#PB6zyLxzUNzEQzvTx6lUW01JEmJX315ZF4LvyEh9JQA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   zip\n  </a>\n  you will find\n  <code>\n   Diagnose Ping Configuration.html\n  </code>\n  and ARM\n  <code>\n   web\n  </code>\n  utility which is responsible for\n.cgi web requests\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit:\nSo I made request directly to my web ping page and it look's like this\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xIVCd.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xIVCd.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  first button should be\n  <code>\n   start\n  </code>\n  and second\n  <code>\n   stop\n  </code>\n  but they are in java so I need a way to refer to them by name. Also I found example of POST method on web end here it is\n </p>\n <pre><code>curl -X POST -F 'name=linuxize' -F 'email=linuxize@example.com' https://example.com/contact.php\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  but I need names of buttons/fields to supply and there is non in that \"java button's\".\n  <a href=\"https://www.tazkranet.com/Esalny/HUAWEI-GPON/Route.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Here\n  </a>\n  you can find emulated web UI\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
