After doing this, you can type a gdb command line, or just hit\n  <code>\n   [Enter]\n  </code>\n  to accept its default. From there, you just type \"start\" in the gdb window with any parameters you want to pass to the program you are debugging.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After that, you are pretty much golden, but with only one view. The menus along the top of the screen under \"GUD\" will let you open other relevant views for whatever you are trying to debug. (Frames are separate windows, and \"Windows\" are in-frame windows)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Usually by default, a breakpoint is set on program start, and you can then either navigate your code using the buttons at the top of the window or if you have no code, you can customize your view to let you step through a disassembly of the binary you are looking at.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The buttons along the top of the window surrounded with \"{}\" are for code-level stepping, and the buttons with \"<>\" in their icon are for instruction-level debugging. So you will probably want to focus on the left if you are doing normal code debugging and focus more on the right if you are getting into the real nitty-gritty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, if you ever get lost, this icon:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GxNUS.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"GUD info\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GxNUS.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is an entire book that can likely answer your questions. The only time it won't exist in Emacs is if you are on Debian (Ubuntu is fine) and installed Emacs from its repos. In this case you will need to install \"\n  <code>\n   emacs<version>-common-non-dfsg\n  </code>\n  \" to get the manuals. (With \"\n  <code>\n   <version>\n  </code>\n  \" being the non-decimal digits returned by\n  <code>\n   M-x version\n  </code>\n  in Emacs)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I started out learning more advanced use of GDB by reading\n  <a href=\"https://nostarch.com/debugging.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Art of Debugging\n  </a>\n  some years ago. It describes GDB and DDD as well as Eclipse as frontends to GDB. I still recommend the book even in 2023 to learn the basics; despite its age. Of course there is also\n  <a href=\"https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/documentation/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   the GDB manual\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Admittedly most of the time I am using Vim as my IDE on the terminal and\n  <code>\n   tmux\n  </code>\n  (earlier\n  <code>\n   screen\n  </code>\n  with\n  <code>\n   byobu\n  </code>\n  ). Therefore I am switching between panes in my terminal multiplexer to switch quickly between code and debugger. The GDB prompt - after some weeks of trying the TUI (start with\n  <code>\n   gdb -tui\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   gdbtui\n  </code>\n  or at the prompt\n  <kbd>\n   layout next\n  </kbd>\n  ) - has indeed everything I ever desired and you should keep in mind that you can attach multiple times to the same process (thereby having a look at memory the way you describe it).\n </p>\n <p>\n  It seems that all frontends are lagging behind a little - no surprise - and it makes more sense to come to terms with the GDB prompt and its niceties and oddities. Keep in mind that on a bare-metal setup it may be the only thing you have. Thus it makes sense to learn it even if you find a \"decent\" GUI by your own standards.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Newer versions of GDB will also support Python scripting and through that provide a very powerful set of tools to debug, even just from the command line.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you absolutely insist on using a GUI frontend, I would also recommend IDA Pro for the simple reason that it gives you a single frontend for a variety of debuggers and you have to learn (or customize) its shortcuts only once. Disadvantages: price and flexibility when you don't have a license on a particular machine or no way to tunnel to a GDB server etc ...\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Additional options to make your debugging experience slicker would be:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://hugsy.github.io/gef/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    gef: GDB Enhanced Features\n   </a>\n   as recommended\n   <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/27118\">\n    in this answer\n   </a>\n   , which is particularly conducive to reverse engineering endeavours\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    GDB dashboard\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  I'm not aware of any frontend of GDB that accepts WinDbg commands. And I can only emphasize again: you will reap the fruit of the time invested in learning vanilla GDB anyway. Don't shy away from the effort. There are plenty of things in WinDbg which are specific to the way Windows works, the Windows kernel works and so on. GDB is much more generic.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
