In your particular case, it constructs (assuming a stripped binary):\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   typedef unsigned long    undefined8;\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  But, note that these types are just estimates and could be different than the original source code (in case of user defined functions).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
