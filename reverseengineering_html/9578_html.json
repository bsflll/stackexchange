    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've been analyzing some SPI EEPROM memory, and tried to find out which Checksum algorithm has been used;\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example I've got data: 14567D9h and checksum 187h. Assuming it's normal 16 bit check sum I've got 86h - no match, but after adding 101h it magically changes to 391h\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another Example: 8ADh and check sum B5h with this one is normal - 16 bit checksum results with exact number: B5h (perfect match)\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've checked it with 28 samples i was able to intercept. For some values i have to add 101h to checksum and for some it is only needed to sum it up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Parity check doesn't fit - if you want I can share some more data - all gathered in one excel file, and calculated. After few days of brainstorm with my friend we haven't come up with anything :/\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maybe there is some additional part in the Algorithm, which i haven't found out yet? CRC and tonnes of other algorithms were checked - only 16 bit checksum was giving any promising results Thanks for help in advance!\n </p>\n <p>\n  copy of my spreadsheet:\n  <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2FO0-Y1n-ySMUZ2VTVkME9tdm8/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Spreadsheet\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  some data I've grabbed (more in spreadsheet):\n </p>\n <pre><code>F401 84290145h\nB500 08AD0000h\nD400 5D310145h\n4000 79810145h\nB500 08AD0000h\nC100 0AB70000h\nC100 0AB70000h\n3401 F08500BEh\nE901 FE2C00BEh\nA400 01E400BFh\n2A01 0D5D00BFh\n7E00 208304D7h\nC100 0AB70000h\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  You can read it this way:\nchecksum: 01F4  (lways 2 bytes)\nvalue: 01458429 (always 4 bytes)\n </p>\n <p>\n  as you can see you have to switch positions of the bytes to read data properly\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
