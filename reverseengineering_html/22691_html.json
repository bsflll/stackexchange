For instance if I want to inject it in a specific parameter, how do I do it?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   As I understood, if I put all test cases in the input directory it knows to build randomly injections based on that input, yes?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   I saw a video shows that if for instance there are two inputs in the code, so in the test case each line is for each input. Is that correct? Since I want put a full message (for example HTTP request) into one variable, so how do I do it ?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   I have compiled everything correctly but for some reason it does not find any new paths. In addition, if I do not put the\n   <code>\n    -m none\n   </code>\n   I get the following error : \"Fork server crashed with signal 6\".\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   I don't understand when to put\n   <code>\n    @@\n   </code>\n   .\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

As far as I understand AFL, it mutates whatever input is provided and is able to\n <i>\n  generate\n </i>\n input which triggers faulty behavior. The way it does that is by exploiting the fact that\n <code>\n  fork()\n </code>\n keeps the full state of the program prior to the\n <code>\n  fork()\n </code>\n and so it's relatively cheap to follow different execution paths simply by mutating the input as it goes. The author of AFL even provides a corpus of image files\n <i>\n  generated\n </i>\n by AFL \"from thin air\" simply by fuzzing some image processing tool and generating/mutating input for it.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
