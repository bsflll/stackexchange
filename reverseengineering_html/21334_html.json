What I want to achieve is full execution trace, from driver entry to end point. Driver is heavily virtualized and contains multiple anti-debugging checks so using WinDbg isn't an option. I have tried VMWare gdb stub connected with IDA but tracing seems to doesn't work, it hangs and even few hours aren't enough. Have you any ideas how to do it in the simplest way?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Icebox appears to build on the same principle and is completely FLOSS, whereas the original CXPInspector by Willems and Hund never was (to the best of my knowledge). Their initial work was commercialized into something known as VMRay today.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It's not exactly tracing you will get with this, but the authors of the seminal work remarked at the conference how they often managed to pin down a particular page access to a particular function call, so this approach provides more introspection than one would think at first glance.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
