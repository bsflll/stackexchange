Obviously it's packed. I was told by PeID that there is only UPX inside. Ok, but\n  <code>\n   upx -d\n  </code>\n  simple crashed that's why I've concluded that this UPX may be scrambled somehow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"IDA warning\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XEm04.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Binary didn't run properly in debugger(windbg) for unpacking it so I've dumped exe from working process and tried to fix imports. Maybe I should have tried Olly with plugins? However IDA still warns me that some imports might be destroyed(see picture). My question is: did I unpacked it correctly? If no what else should I do to unpack it?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://mega.co.nz/#!OU4X1a4Y!00wN9c72-4nRtNgF5t7ZdGLxDzjYE9G6CNakblHBUOs\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   Unpacked\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
