Even though I write over the pointers used by the heap manager, which are located at the end of each buffer, no exception is raised when the buffers are HeapFree()d.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Why is that so? Shouldn't an exception be raised? How can I check on this further on?\n </p>\n <p>\n  thank you\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I don't have the source code as I'm supposed to exploit the program. No idea which compile was used (can't tell from the strings).  I'm using ollydbg for debugging - can this possibly be the reason no exception is being thrown? on the other hand, olly doesn't catch anything either.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
