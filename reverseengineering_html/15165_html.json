I have found a memory mapped (via mmap2) region which contains the file I'm interested in. I've created a memory snapshot and I'd like to copy this specific area into a file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sadly I haven't been able to find good instructions on how to do this, any help would be most appreciated.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I'm only suggesting this because IDA's not that good at exporting EXEs. You may also want to try ollydbg with a dumping plugin.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
