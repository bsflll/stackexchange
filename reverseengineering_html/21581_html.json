However, when I load up the exe in IDA, the addresses are smaller and start from\n  <code>\n   0x00401000\n  </code>\n  . I read up somewhere that this was called virtual memory addresses. But, after looking, I couldn't figure out how to plug the dynamic addresses in Cheat Engine and make them show up.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

But Cheat Engine unfortunately does not provide a mapping of the whole binary (unless I miss something). In that regard, how to know what the lines of the memory correspond to in the binary ? I guess I could trying making a search of binary values near by copying the bytes in CE where there is the function I want to modify.. :/</span>",
