The Bytes are generated by hardware (card writer) The only way I can manipulate the Bytes in  Block 3 is to rewrite the Bytes to the RFID card using another card writer, which I can readily do. Please note that a change to any of the Bytes in Blocks 1-4 requires a corresponding change to Block 5  Bytes as well.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
