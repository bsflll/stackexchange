As far as debugging goes, I've looked DEBUG and DEBUGX from the creators of FreeDOS, as well as the default DEBUG command that comes with Windows. Sure, I can probably work with them and eventually figure out what I'm doing, but I feel like the process would end up being longer than necessary. Is there a better tool I can use?\n </p>\n <p>\n  If there are no \"better\" tools than DEBUG or DEBUGX, then what can I use to work with output from these two tools? My main goal is to create something that mimics the .COM program, but in a more manageable format (as far as code goes).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
