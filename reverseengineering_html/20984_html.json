    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm taking a reverse engineering course and the class has just been given a big project where we have to analyze a packed malware binary. I am using a Windows 10 VM. I am a little confused on where to begin. The professor has mentioned that the best place to start is by taking a snapshot of your initial system setup, running the malware, and then \"figuring out what has changed\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  My strategy is as follows:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Take a memory backup of my initial VM state.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Set up my VM so that a network connection is available, but doesn't actually connect to the internet.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Run the malware (in a debugger? outside of a debugger?).\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   ???\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  This is where I get a little iffy. I am not sure what \"checking for changes on the system\" entails. Does this mean I need to take a memory dump of the OS state after the malware has run? What should I be looking for within the memory dump? Is there some tool that identifies meaningful changes between my starting state and the state after the malware runs? Do I need to audit the registry keys to see what has been changed? If I know the malware uses the network, should I be running Wireshark?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ultimately, I am not sure what the most efficient approach is. It is a pretty powerful piece of malware with a lot of functionality and I want to make sure I collect all necessary information upfront so I don't waste time later in the project.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In order to do this effectively you will need to determine how it’s packed. You don’t seem to have much experience with analysis and the scope of the question is quite broad, so my advice would be to study malware analysis write ups shared by professionals online to get an insight into their methodology and workflow, as well as looking through a few intro level tutorials. The web is awash with “how to get started with malware analysis”-type material. I’m sure your professor has provided you with a lot of material as well.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

For example, malware is usually looking to achieve some kind of persistency. This is usually done by the following methods:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Registry run keys\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Startup folder\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Scheduled tasks\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Service registrations\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  A much more comprehensive list is available by MITRE ATT&CK\n  <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  In addition, malware usually has some sort of intention, for example stealing\n  <a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/07/smoking-guns-smoke-loader-learned-new.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   cookies\n  </a>\n  , hooking to a\n  <a href=\"https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/brief-look-zeuszbot-20\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   web browsers\n  </a>\n  or maybe just wait for a\n  <a href=\"https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-201A\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   secondary\n  </a>\n  payload or update. If we ignore\n  <a href=\"https://zeltser.com/fileless-malware-beyond-buzzword/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   \"Fileless\" or \"Memory Injections\"\n  </a>\n  attacks for the simplicity of this short guide, malware has to leave some file traces on the system. We need to look for files (executable or not) written to the file system.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Getting our hands dirty:\n </h2>\n <p>\n  In order to monitor the system changes mentioned above, we can use Sysinternal tools initially developed by Mark Russinovich and now owned by Microsoft.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tip: it's recommended to read Mark's\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/learn/windows-internals\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   Windows Internals book\n  </a>\n  for anyone starting with malware analysis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Being more specific, the tools of the Sysinternals suite you should learn how to use are:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    Autoruns\n   </a>\n   - execute and note your initial system values.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    Process Monitor\n   </a>\n   - After you read the manual, create a filter to only follow the malware you are executing. Note any file and registry changes, this will be a really good starting point.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    Autoruns\n   </a>\n   - execute and note any changes to your system and what new autoruns have been registered.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  The guide above should get you to a good starting point for your project.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  If you want to cheat\n </h2>\n <p>\n  You can skip all this stages and use one of the publicly available malware detonation sandboxes. However,  in order to become a reverse engineer or malware analyst you should only use these tools once you have learned the basics and understand what you are actually doing.\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"http://hybrid-analysis.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    Hybrid-Analysis\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://app.sndbox.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    Sndbox\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://app.any.run/#register\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    Anyrun\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

RegShot is straightforward.  You take a snapshot before running a process, a second one after, and then to compare them.  If you select \"Scan dir\" and enter \"C:\\\" in the box, it will also tell you file changes.  These are snapshots at the time the buttons are pressed, so may miss files that are dropped and deleted.  Use Process Monitor or Sysmon for that info and more.</span>",
