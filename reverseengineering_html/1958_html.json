While stepping through the instructions, the instruction just after a\n  <code>\n   int 0x80\n  </code>\n  gets skipped\n  <em>\n   i.e.\n  </em>\n  gets executed without me stepping through this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Example:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <pre><code> int 0x80\n inc eax ; <--- this gets skipped\n inc ecx ; <--- stepping resumes here\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Why does this happen? Have you encountered something similar to this?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

When an interrupt occurs, the state of the\n  <code>\n   T\n  </code>\n  flag is placed on the stack, and used when the\n  <code>\n   iret\n  </code>\n  instruction is executed by the handler.  However, the\n  <code>\n   iret\n  </code>\n  instruction is one of a few instructions that causes a one-instruction delay in the triggering of the\n  <code>\n   T\n  </code>\n  flag, due to legacy issues relating to the initialization of the stack.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So the skipped instruction is executing but you can't step into it (but if you set a breakpoint at that location and run to that point instead, then you will get a break).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
