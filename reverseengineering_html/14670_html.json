Pat file from ida.\nI can generate Sig file from .pat files But i can not use them . when i load a file in ida pro with my new CPU module and try to load the signiture the signiture is empty (I guess that ida is filtring signutures with cpu type )\n </p>\n <p>\n  How to tell Sigmake about the CPU type . the sigmake tool has - p option that normally sets the cpu type but i am not able to use it correctly . ida has the same command line switch - p that can be used like this - pmipsel (cpu is mipsel ) . But in sigmake it gives \" ill processor id \" error. \ni tried using my cpu id defined in the cpu module but ida dose not show the sig file\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

There are a few things that can help:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   All menu actions can be linked to IDC funtion via the IDA configuration files found in the cfg directory inside the IDA installation path (3 files starting with ida)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Read inside the source files. They're fairly well documented.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Read the IDA Pro book second edition\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Apart from that you might even be able to do it without the IDA GUI:\n  <a href=\"http://www.hexblog.com/?p=128\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   http://www.hexblog.com/?p=128\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
