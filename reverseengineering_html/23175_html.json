    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Are there any community tools that are aimed specifically at extracting or replacing AGESA code in a UEFI?  In AMI UEFIs, AGESA is said to be scattered among multiple modules.  I have read that in AWARD BIOSes it's contained within a single module.  Are there any modern AWARD AMD UEFIs?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you for any guidance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit: Removed the long intro, straight to business.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
