In this case you should see explicit syscalls (SVC instructions) in the code. Depending on the age of the system the will be using either Old ABI (with syscall number encoded as the operand of the SVC instruction) or the new ABI(EABI) with syscall number in R7. You can look up syscall numbers e.g.\n    <a href=\"https://w3challs.com/syscalls/?arch=arm_strong\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     here\n    </a>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Libc in a shared library. I have never seen it myself but it seems uCLinux does support shared libraries loaded at fixed addresses. So you may see calls to apparently unmapped addresses where the libc is supposed to be loaded. In this case you may need to disassemble the libc binary as well to label the functions using syscalls and then match against the calls in the binary.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  In either case I would suggest you installing or building an uCLinux toolchain and compiling a few helloworld binaries with it. The nice thing about it is that the bFLT is produced from an ELF as the final step so you can compare the ELF with all symbols against the bFLT which should give you some clues how to handle your target.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
