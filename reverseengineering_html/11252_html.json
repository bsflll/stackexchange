And that OllyDbg figured out that value to be an ascii string containing \"\\xDA\\x9Fb\". Is that right?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can someone maybe explain to me what this Ascii string is supposed to represent, and how it fits in this code example?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Edit\n  </strong>\n  : Since the information above seems not sufficient to give an answer, I'll try to add some instructions that might (or might not) shed some light.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shortly after the instruction above, there are multiple CMPs that each look like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>CMP DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+(different hex)],0\nJE SHORT (position a few lines below)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This CMP exits with true which is not the desired condition. The left side should have another value than 0.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I could not figure out what the\n  <em>\n   the string\n  </em>\n  means but it is being used as one of multiple arguments in many internal (private) functions of the disassembly while the other arguments would contain column names of a database.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am planning to do a lot more digging but I was just curious if this seemed familiar to anybody.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The very beginning of your message agrees that \\x starts a hex escape sequence, but you misinterpret the string because you think the \\x is followed by <b>ONE</b> hex character, while it is in fact followed by <b>TWO</b>. The string does not start with <code>0x0D</code>, it starts with <code>0xDA</code>, and it does not contain <code>0x09</code>, it contains <code>0x9F</code>.</span>",
