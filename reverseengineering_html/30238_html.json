    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to learn how Ghidra works by using it to analyze a very simple ELF file written in Assembly, compiled on a raspberry pi 4 (ARM64)\n </p>\n <p>\n  My Assembly code looks like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>.global _start\n\n_start:\n    mov x0, #0x1\n    ldr x1, =helloworld\n    mov x2, #0xb\n    mov x8, #0x40\n    svc 0\n\n    mov x0, #0x0\n    mov x8, #93\n    svc 0\n\n.data\nhelloworld: .ascii \"Hello World\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I am compiling it like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ as -o hello.o hello.s\n$ ld -o hello hello.o\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  It is producing this executable:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ file hello\nhello: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  It runs just fine:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ ./hello\nHello World\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now I am taking this ELF file and throwing it in to Ghidra and analyzing it and I'm getting an error. As shown below, there is nothing in the decompiled window, and in the bookmark window it shows:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Bad Instruction: Unable to resolve constructor at ..\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LDrGF.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LDrGF.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was hoping someone could spot what I'm doing wrong because this seems like it would be very straightforward.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

(such as a ret instruction) so it complain about bad instruction. that give you the red x on the left, the \"bad instruction\" on the bottom right, and \"halt_baddata\" in the decompiler.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It might be possible via a Ghidra extension. Many disassemblers can handle syscalls and traps etc. ReSource for the Amiga could do it 30 years ago.</span>",
