    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am statically reversing some software compiled for an Atheros AR7161 using radare2. This processor implements MIPS, and I do recall that MIPS has a branch delay slot. This is indeed noticeable in the disassembly because I can see instructions that should logically execute before branches being placed right after them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, while analyzing some piece of code, I came across a beqz instruction for which assuming that the instruction after it should execute first does not make sense in the context of the program. I must admit that my analysis could be wrong, which is not unlikely; however, I have some doubts that I'd also like to clear:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Do all branch/jump instructions always use the branch delay slot such that the instruction right after should logically execute first? If not, in which cases would it not?\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Is there some way to make radare2 show the logical execution order rather than the one encoded in the binary?\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Edit\n  </strong>\n  : concretely, I am dealing with the following sequence:\n </p>\n <pre><code>beqz v0, <some address>\nlb v0, 0x40(sp)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I have a very diffuse picture in my head about these instruction going into the pipeline. I can picture the second instruction being fetched while the first one is being decoded; hence, execution of the branch delay slot should actually start. However, the branch instruction depends on the same register being modified by the instruction in the branch delay slot, so what will happen? Will the branch instruction evaluate the condition using the old register value, or the new one updated by lb?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
