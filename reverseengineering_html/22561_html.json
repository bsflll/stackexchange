Note that the stack trace usually includes the kernel part; youâ€™ll need to skip it and look at the user-mode calls (skip the system libraries too except the one called directly by the process).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

True it may not be syscalls (which are tricky to wield correctly because their numbers vary across patch levels), but it could conceivably be use IOCTLs to talk to <code>\\Device\\Afd</code> (or similar) and achieve similar functionality as through the usual UM APIs. However, my guess here would be that another module is making the actual call, if the breakpoint on the module itself doesn't trigger. Of course chances are the program behaves differently under a debugger and this being the cause for the bpx not triggering.</span>",
