    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  For learning (\n  <em>\n   and fun\n  </em>\n  ) I have been analyzing a text editor application using IDA Pro. While looking at the disassembly, I notice many function calls are made by explicitly calling the name of the function. For example, I notice IDA translates most function calls into the following two formats.\n </p>\n <pre><code>call cs:CoCreateInstance\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Or\n </p>\n <pre><code>call WinSqmAddToStream\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But sometimes the format does not use a function name. The following example includes the code leading up to the line in question. The third line of code seem to be \"missing\" the function name. (The comments are my own.)\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov rcx, [rsp+128h+var_D8]    // reg CX gets the address at stack pointer+128h+var_D8 bytes \nmov r8, [rcx]                 // the address at reg CX is stored to reg r8\ncall qword ptr [r8 + 18h]     // at address rax+18h, call function defined by qword bytes \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  My questions are as follows:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    How do I make the connection between\n    <code>\n     call qword ptr <address>\n    </code>\n    and a function in the disassembly?\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    I understand that IDA cannot use a function name here since it does not know the value stored at the register R8... so what causes this? Was there a certain syntax or convention used by the developer? In other words, did the developer call the function\n    <code>\n     WinSqmAddToStream\n    </code>\n    in a different manner than the function at\n    <code>\n     [r8+18h]\n    </code>\n    ?\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you use scripting, don't forget to add the\n    <code>\n     XREF_USER\n    </code>\n    flag so IDA does not delete it on reanalysis.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Use the \"callee\" plugin (Edit→Plugins→Change the callee address, or\n    <kbd>\n     Alt\n    </kbd>\n    +\n    <kbd>\n     F11\n    </kbd>\n    ). This will automatically add a cross-reference and also a comment next to the call.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  As for why the explicit call is not present in the binary there can be many explanations. The snippet you're showing looks like a virtual function call, and they are usually done only in this manner to account for possibility of the method being overridden in a derived class.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
