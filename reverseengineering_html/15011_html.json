But when I plug it in it is as if it isn't even there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So how can I get access to the data?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Secondly, I understand that they can affect the baseband portion of the cellphone, including frequency of operation and whatever codes are necessary to identify itself (IMEI) and to access a particular network (T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizen).  Again, it is clearly more than just flash memory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So my question is, how exactly do they work, and how can I read the data from my phone's card?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The IMSI is an\n  important part of the lookup process and determines the network to\n  which a mobile device connects.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Along with the IMSI, a 128-bit value authentication key (Ki) is sent\n  to verify your SIM with the GSM cellular network. The Ki is assigned\n  by the operator and stored in a database on their network.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A SIM card is also capable of storing SMS messages and the names and\n  phone numbers of up to 500 contacts, depending on the memory size of\n  the SIM card you have. If you have to change phones for whatever\n  reason, you’re able to transfer your contacts via the SIM card\n  painlessly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Most SIM cards contain between 64-128 KB of storage.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    > How Does A SIM Work?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Essentially, a SIM card serves as your phone’s credentials to access\n  the carrier network. Because the SIM holds this information, you’re\n  able to pop it into any phone with the same carrier, or an unlocked\n  phone, to access the network.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Here’s how it works:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   When you boot up your device, it obtains the IMSI from the SIM, and\n  then relays the IMSI to the network in order to request access.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The operator network searches the database for your IMSI and the\n  associated Ki.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Assuming your IMSI and Ki are verified, the operator\n  then generates a random number, signs it with your Ki using the GSM\n  cryptography algorithm for computing SRES_2, and creates a new unique\n  number.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The network then sends that unique number back to the device,\n  which then passes it to the SIM to use in the same algorithm, creating\n  a third number.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   This number is then relayed back to the network.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   If both numbers match, the SIM card is deemed legitimate and is granted\n  access to the network.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    So if you break the screen on your phone, while\n  it’s getting fixed you can take your SIM out and put it in a\n  replacement phone and still access phone calls, texts, and data from\n  your network.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
