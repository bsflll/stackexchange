It's just a library loaded dynamically by something else.  What you probably need to do, is to load the game/application that USES that\n  <code>\n   .SO\n  </code>\n  , and set a breakpoint at the location where it calls the function(s) that you're interested in, and then just single step into the\n  <code>\n   .SO\n  </code>\n  to see what's going on.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
