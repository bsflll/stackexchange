I have begun to take an interest in jailbreaking and iOS vulnerabilities. I understand the memory aspects and iOS security architecture, but how do I debug a non-jailbroken device? You can run\n  <code>\n   GDB\n  </code>\n  on a jailbroken device but not normal iOS device. I have read the iOS Hackers Handbook but most of the tools and tricks are outdated now. Also, I know you used to be able to wire a Pod-Gizmo board to get Serial output from an iOS device, is that possible any more? Thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
