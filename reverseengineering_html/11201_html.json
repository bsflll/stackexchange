Anyone have any ideas, in order to try extract the kernel config. Hisense is no help when asking for GPL source.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I ran metasploit against it and had no luck, it did find some open ports for upnp and something called twonkymedia but I was not able to get anywhere with that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have a Hisense LTDN50K220GWUS (Hisense 50H5GB) Smart TV that is running what appears to be a customized version of \"Opera TV OS\"\nRunning on \"Linux-3.0.13\" and is using uboot, I tried connecting a usb keyboard to the ports and pounding escape and other buttons\nbut that didn't get me anywhere.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Using Binwalk I was able to extract so info from a rom firmware image:\n  <a href=\"http://dl-1.va.us.xda-developers.com/3/3/9/0/9/9/1/binwalk.txt?key=tYzIcmGKTrH3OtBCCkWz6w&ts=1446066314\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   binwalk output\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
