    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  On my keyboard, there's a button that opens Windows 7 calculator when pressed. How would you capture what's calling/opening it?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Because it's a Logitech keyboard, common sense would say it's via SetPoint software/service, so I would normally start by observing those in Process Monitor. But because I'm doing this as a hands-on reversing exercise rather than merely reprogramming a keyboard button, I'd like to approach it as if I didn't have background knowledge of SetPoint or third-party keyboard software.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way I could trace/capture the behind-the-scenes activity from keypress to calc.exe opening?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
