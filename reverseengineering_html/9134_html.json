What you collected here is the lowest level of information that you can get out of Pin, but you can ask for more by using the proper Pintool (or writing one by yourself).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Look in the directory\n  <code>\n   source/tools\n  </code>\n  , you will find various plugins that you can use with Pin and extract usefull information. For example, you may want to know: the address of each instruction (you already have that), the decoded instruction that is executed and the opcode of the instruction. All this can be asked to Pin and collected as a trace.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the directory\n  <code>\n   source/tools/SimpleExamples\n  </code>\n  , you will find simple examples to start with and to understand how to use Pin. Try to look also to a few tutorial that you may find on Internet.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
