Those values can be very important to find reliable references to memory structures when the memory locations are not static.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I would like to get the Thread Local Storage of another process.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The TLS should be at\n  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win32_Thread_Information_Block\">\n   [FS:0x2C] in the Thread Information Block (TIB)\n  </a>\n  . Though I quite don't understand how the FS register works. I guess I have to find the TIB Base address first? I think I can find it in the Thread Context I can get with\n  <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms679362%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\">\n   WINAPI GetThreadContext\n  </a>\n  , but I am a little bit overwhelmed.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
