Reverse Engineering Stack Exchange is not a forum but, it is most helpful community I have ever seen. Also, just a few active forums discuss reverse engineering topics and they expect you know some basics about this field. Most people don't want to help step by step reverse engineering to somebody. For resources I can recommend you\n  <a href=\"http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0764574817.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"https://beginners.re\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Reverse Engineering for Beginners\n  </a>\n  to start. It discuss theoretical basics and practical examples of reverse engineering.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
