The main reason is that the ELF binary here is a\n  <a href=\"https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/11/03/position-independent-code-pic-in-shared-libraries/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <em>\n    position-independent executable (PIE)\n   </em>\n  </a>\n  and therefore the absolute memory addresses cannot be known until after the program has been loaded, since the program can be loaded anywhere in memory (position independence). Since the absolute memory addresses are not known until runtime, if\n  <code>\n   gdb\n  </code>\n  is used to disassemble\n  <em>\n   position independent code (PIC)\n  </em>\n  prior to the\n  <code>\n   run\n  </code>\n  command being executed, the file offsets will be printed instead.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  So how do we know that the code is indeed position independent? We can tell just by looking at the the disassembly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first way we can tell is by looking at the leftmost column, where normally we would expect to see memory addresses near\n  <code>\n   0x8048000\n  </code>\n  , the canonical entry point in x86 binaries compiled by GCC. However, the values we see here are near\n  <code>\n   0x0000118d\n  </code>\n  , and so are more likely to be file offsets rather than memory addresses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  More compellingly, in position-independent code, instruction pointer-relative addressing is used instead of absolute addresses. This is what we see in the disassembly in your post:\n </p>\n <pre><code> <snip>\n 0x0000119f <+18>:    call   0x1090 <__x86.get_pc_thunk.bx>  <- get address of next instruction\n 0x000011a4 <+23>:    add    ebx,0x2e5c                      <- store location of GOT in ebx\n 0x000011aa <+29>:    mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0xc],0x0         <- move 0 to GOT entry\n 0x000011b1 <+36>:    jmp    0x11c9 <main+60>                 \n 0x000011b3 <+38>:    sub    esp,0xc\n 0x000011b6 <+41>:    lea    eax,[ebx-0x1ff8]                <- load data relative to GOT location stored in ebx\n 0x000011bc <+47>:    push   eax\n 0x000011bd <+48>:    call   0x1030 <puts@plt>               <- function from DLL, address in PLT at runtime\n </snip>\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  All addressing here is relative. The call to\n  <code>\n   __x86.get_pc_thunk.bx\n  </code>\n  is necessary, because the address of the next instruction will be used to calculate relative offsets to the instruction pointer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  More info:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/11/03/position-independent-code-pic-in-shared-libraries/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Position Independent Code (PIC) in shared libraries\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1992/what-is-plt-got\">\n   What is PLT/GOT?\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
