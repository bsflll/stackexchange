All the encrypted filenames are hexadecimal strings with the same length e.g.\n  <code>\n   1790C6E445C7E38EFCD5B3042F9B4443\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've figured out that a few of the files are unencrypted OGG files, and I've used the\n  <code>\n   strings\n  </code>\n  command to find a list of the\n  <code>\n   .ogg\n  </code>\n  strings contained within the game binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now I'm wondering, is there any way to find out how the file name was created, given the original?\n </p>\n <p>\n  And would it be possible to recreate the directory structure somehow (right now it's all flat, but according to the strings I've found, there should be directories).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Or, it might be one of the sha* variants, cut after 32 characters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you have access to a linux system, you could try something like\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ echo -n 'introduction.ogg' | md5sum\ndc8f2a080281b924622580a8d662874c\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and if that doesn't match, try\n  <code>\n   sha1sum\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   sha224sum\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   sha256sum\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   sha384sum\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   sha512sum\n  </code>\n  instead. These all result in longer results, so your filename might be at the start, the end, or somewhere in the middle of the result.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or, just paste your file name into this\n  <a href=\"https://defuse.ca/checksums.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   online tool\n  </a>\n  which has those and many more algorithms.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The bad news is, you won't be able to guess the original filename from the hash. All these hashes are (intended to be) one-way functions - it's easy to get the hash from the original data, but there's no way back. This is why hashes like these are used for password storage - you can verify a password by encrypting it, but you can't get at the password from the hash.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
