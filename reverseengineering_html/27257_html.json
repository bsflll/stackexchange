    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm working on decompiling a DOS .exe that was written in Pascal or Delphi. When looking at the decompiled code, there appears to be many strings that are are padded with\n  <code>\n   00\n  </code>\n  . Example:\n </p>\n <pre><code>06 53 54 52 49 4E 47 00 00 00 STRING\n07 41 4E 4F 54 48 45 52 00 00 ANOTHER\n08 4C 41 53 54 7F 4F 4E 45 00 LAST ONE\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The leading number is the length of string, using Pascal conventions. If I were to run the .exe, these strings appear in a list. Because of this, I assume that the organization of the strings is supposed to be a list of some sort.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My questions are these:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Is there a way in Ghidra to puts these string into an Array, with one string per element? When I hit\n    <code>\n     [\n    </code>\n    it tries to build the array only off the length of the string and the characters of the first string and ignores the\n    <code>\n     00\n    </code>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Why was the code compiled this way. It would appear to increase the size of the file with addition padding byte(s), and I see these type of lists all over the decompiled file.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The only solution I have found is manually editing the raw hex to place the terminated strings sequentially, then placing the removed padding bytes after the last string to keep everything aligned. Very hacky, I know.... but it works so far.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

If the strings are all 9 bytes like your example, you could do this:\n </p>\n <pre class=\"lang-c prettyprint-override\"><code>struct pstring {\n  byte len;\n  char[9] str;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And then make an array of\n  <code>\n   pstring\n  </code>\n  instances.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
