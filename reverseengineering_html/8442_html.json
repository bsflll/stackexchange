    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm debugging this process which has a lot of anti debugging techniques in it, and I faced something new which I don't know how to bypass yet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Changing the code dynamically causes exceptions to occur and the process to crash.\nSo setting\n  <code>\n   INT 3\n  </code>\n  breakpoints is not an option. The way I'm debugging the process is only with\n  <code>\n   Hardware Breakpoints\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now I have found the function (at least one of themâ€¦) which reads portions of the memory and using some CheckSum function over that memory, and then it checks if the memory CheckSum is as it expected. If I changed one byte in the memory, the CheckSum would not be as expected, thus the process would crash. This is actually very simple and done like this in the code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>CMP EAX,EDX                  ; Compare CheckSum\nJE __GoodCode                  ; jmp must be taken\nCALL <CrashProgram>\n__GoodCode: \nXOR EAX,EAX\n...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The hex value of\n  <code>\n   JE short\n  </code>\n  is\n  <code>\n   0x74 0x0B\n  </code>\n  and I want to change it to\n  <code>\n   JMP short\n  </code>\n  which is\n  <code>\n   0xEB 0x0B\n  </code>\n  . When I do that, the program would crash.\nI found out where the program is crashing using\n  <code>\n   Memory breakpoints\n  </code>\n  at different places of the code and then I found the function doing the CheckSum (it reads all the memory). But now I figured out there is another existing function which probably does something similar! causing the program to crash.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But this time when I put a\n  <code>\n   Memory breakpoint\n  </code>\n  on my 'changed' JE to JMP it never stops on the breakpoint.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So this is my first problem, another problem I had is that I had a function I suspected had something to do with the crashing when changing the code, but when I set a\n  <code>\n   Hardware breakpoint\n  </code>\n  on it, it didn't break. I know for sure that this function is being called and the code definitely runs. So I thought to myself there is probably something making sure my\n  <code>\n   Memory & Hardware breakpoints\n  </code>\n  won't work, some sort of anti-debugging mechanism.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I read a little bit about it and found out about\n  <code>\n   GetThreadContext\n  </code>\n  , in my case it calls\n  <code>\n   Wow64GetThreadContext\n  </code>\n  . It receives a Context structure which holds most registers. Here is how the Context structure looks like:\n </p>\n <pre><code>CONTEXT _X86_\n\ntypedef struct _CONTEXT {\nDWORD ContextFlags;\n/* ContextFlags contians CONTEXT_DEBUG_REGISTERS. */\nDWORD Dr0;\nDWORD Dr1;\nDWORD Dr2;\nDWORD Dr3;\nDWORD Dr6;\nDWORD Dr7;\n/* ContextFlags contians CONTEXT_FLOATING_POINT. */\nFLOATING_SAVE_AREA FloatSave;\n/* ContextFlags contians CONTEXT_SEGMENTS. */\nDWORD SegGs;\nDWORD SegFs;\nDWORD SegEs;\nDWORD SegDs;\n/* ContextFlags contians CONTEXT_INTEGER.*/\nDWORD Edi;\nDWORD Esi;\nDWORD Ebx;\nDWORD Edx;\nDWORD Ecx;\nDWORD Eax;\n/* ContextFlags contians CONTEXT_CONTROL */\nDWORD Ebp;\nDWORD Eip;\nDWORD SegCs; // MUST BE SANITIZED\nDWORD EFlags; // MUST BE SANITIZED\nDWORD Esp;\nDWORD SegSs;\n/* ContextFlags word contains CONTEXT_EXTENDED_REGISTERS */\nBYTE ExtendedRegisters[MAXIMUM_SUPPORTED_EXTENSION];\n} CONTEXT;\n</code></pre>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms679284(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms679284(v=vs.85).aspx\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  The first parameters are my\n  <code>\n   Hardware breakpoints\n  </code>\n  and I can see them clearly, but it doesn't seem like it does something with their values. So I don't think it's this function which is causing the crash. Whenever it is called, it seems more like a debug code. Also, this function is never called regularly - only after the program is crashing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now there is also\n  <code>\n   ReadProcessMemory\n  </code>\n  which I read it might bypass my\n  <code>\n   Memory breakpoints\n  </code>\n  for some reason. I set logging breakpoints on that function and it never seemed like it reads a\n  <code>\n   Page\n  </code>\n  (size 0x1000) close to the function I changed, and yes I checked the size it was reading as well.\nAlthough this function is called regularly it still doesn't seem like this is it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have also heard about\n  <code>\n   ZwProtectVirtualMemory\n  </code>\n  functions to change the attributes of memory regions so that the\n  <code>\n   Memory breakpoint\n  </code>\n  'exceptions' won't occur, and the debugger won't receive them. This function is being called out, but I'm not sure what is the usage, or what parameters are relevant to me in the memory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there anything else I might be missing?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The article I was reading which was helping me quite a lot, but did not help me find out what was causing the crash:\n  <a href=\"http://waleedassar.blogspot.in/2012/11/defeating-memory-breakpoints.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   http://waleedassar.blogspot.in/2012/11/defeating-memory-breakpoints.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  I have changed my wording of this question. I hope it's clearer now.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
