It has a ton of them that I would like to export all of them to a text file or even a CSV file if possible but I can't find any way to do so.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Am I missing a command or a button somewhere or is this something I would need to try and write a script to accomplish?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
