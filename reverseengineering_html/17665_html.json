    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm reverse engineering an ARM binary written in Go, and the following code sequence occurs fairly often (from\n  <em>\n   runtime.cgoIsGoPointer\n  </em>\n  ):\n </p>\n <pre><code>BL  runtime.panicindex\nDCD 0xF7FABCFD\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  or, from\n  <em>\n   runtime.panicmem\n  </em>\n  :\n </p>\n <pre><code>BL  runtime.gopanic\nDCD 0xF7FABCFD\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  0xF7FABCFD is an undefined instruction, so I'm curious what it's purpose is.  I think the answer may be related to\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11140136/whats-the-purpose-of-the-ud2-opcode-in-the-linux-kernel\">\n   this question\n  </a>\n  , because compiling for x86 produces the following sequence of instructions in the corresponding functions:\n </p>\n <pre><code>callq runtime.panicindex\nud2\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and\n </p>\n <pre><code>callq runtime.gopanic\nud2\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  It looks like the linux kernel uses different instructions for this purpose.  From\n  <a href=\"https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.14.26/source/arch/arm/include/asm/bug.h#L9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   arch/arm/include/asm/bug.h\n  </a>\n  :\n </p>\n <pre><code>/*\n * Use a suitable undefined instruction to use for ARM/Thumb2 bug handling.\n * We need to be careful not to conflict with those used by other modules and\n * the register_undef_hook() system.\n */\n#ifdef CONFIG_THUMB2_KERNEL\n#define BUG_INSTR_VALUE 0xde02\n#define BUG_INSTR(__value) __inst_thumb16(__value)\n#else\n#define BUG_INSTR_VALUE 0xe7f001f2\n#define BUG_INSTR(__value) __inst_arm(__value)\n#endif\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But there is reference to 0xf7fabcfd in some of the Go internals.  From\n  <a href=\"https://golang.org/src/cmd/internal/obj/arm/asm5.go#L2744\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   cmd/internal/obj/arm/asm5.go\n  </a>\n  :\n </p>\n <pre><code>// This is supposed to be something that stops execution.\n// It's not supposed to be reached, ever, but if it is, we'd\n// like to be able to tell how we got there. Assemble as\n// 0xf7fabcfd which is guaranteed to raise undefined instruction\n// exception.\ncase 96: /* UNDEF */\n        o1 = 0xf7fabcfd\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Anyway, can anyone confirm this suspicion and/or shed more light into why this is done?  Also, why not just use 0xe7f001f2 like the linux kernel does?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
