However, I am having a difficult time (sorry D:) locating Linux-specific malware from those sites as mostly are samples for Windows (I think). Where can I find and download these Linux samples that I seek?\n </p>\n <p>\n  BTW, this is for learning to create ClamAV and YARA signatures.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
