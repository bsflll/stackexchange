    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am searching for a way to replace certain frames on a LIN bus network. My aim is to be able to intercept a frame in transmission, and change certain bits. Naturally, that involves recalculating the checksum.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The problem I encounter is that after a bit is overwritten on the bus, the transmitting device stops sending data, as it senses the discrepancy on the bus and assumes there's a collision. Is there a way to overcome that behavior?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
