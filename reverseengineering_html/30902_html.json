    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  So I just got Zyxel nas326 and I looked from internet how to protect nas from bruteforce attack and I found that fail2ban can protect my nas.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then I found that I can't download any programs to nas326. So now I ask how I can Install fail2ban to Zyxel nas326.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know in theory I can use wget to download it from my own ftp server and run it, because that nas have python by default, but command\n  <code>\n   pip\n  </code>\n  doesn't work\" (\n  <code>\n   python\n  </code>\n  work). Commands like\n  <code>\n   sudo\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   apt-\n  </code>\n  dont work\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyone have done this before? Any other suggestions for bruteforce protection?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Try placing the files where required manually... you don't really need the docs, so you could ditch those.
