    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've recently tried to decompile a .exe to .py source code. It partly went well as the majority of the .pyc got translated into python code but partly also failed. Like the following part:\n </p>\n <pre><code>--- This code section failed: ---\n\n L. 128       0_2  SETUP_LOOP        13710  'to 13710'\n              4_0  COME_FROM         13706  '13706'\n                4  LOAD_FAST                'self'\n                6  LOAD_ATTR                _Worker__abort\n                8  LOAD_CONST               True\n               10  COMPARE_OP               !=\n            12_14  POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE 13708  'to 13708'\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now my questions are:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   What can cause such a decompiling error? The .exe is working.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   What can I do to translate the rest of the failed decompiled byte-code to get the full source code?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Is there a place where I can find the construction of such byte-code to source code? Even though it would take a lot of time I could try to manually convert it.\nAny tips or ideas?\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Thanks for reading\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
