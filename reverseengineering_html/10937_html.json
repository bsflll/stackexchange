However, you could instead use a technique called record & replay to log the nondeterministic inputs to the system. The overhead of this is reasonable and still allows programs to run normally. Then you can replay and do heavyweight logging.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The general approach is described in the paper\n  <a href=\"http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jchow/papers/decoupled-usenix2008.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Decoupling dynamic program analysis from execution in virtual environments\n  </a>\n  . This is the approach that\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/moyix/panda\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   PANDA\n  </a>\n  is built around. If you want a large set of traces to work off of, we have a\n  <a href=\"http://moyix.blogspot.com/2015/08/one-weird-trick-to-shrink-your-panda.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   database of around 24,000 malware traces\n  </a>\n  , and it is fairly simple to write a PANDA plugin to collect the memory and register traces you want.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
