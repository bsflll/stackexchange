    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am investigating a format string vulnerability on arm64 (linked against musl libc), and am encountering some odd behavior while debugging the output.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From the decompilation, the program has a classic format string vulnerability that boils down to:\n </p>\n <pre><code>fprintf(stdout, user_controlled_data);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Using repetitive format specifiers (e.g.\n  <code>\n   %p%p%p%p\n  </code>\n  ), I can dump massive swaths of memory by including thousands of these characters. That works as expected.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The problem arises when I try direct parameter access. For some reason,\n  <code>\n   %1$p\n  </code>\n  works but not\n  <code>\n   %2$p\n  </code>\n  , but 3 up to about 12 works, and everything I've tried after that fails. By \"fails\", I mean no values are printed, except the newline automatically added to my string earlier in code is eaten somehow. In the debugger,\n  <code>\n   fprintf\n  </code>\n  returns -1, and\n  <code>\n   errno\n  </code>\n  is set to 0x16, which I believe is EINVAL.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For this particular scenario, I need the ability to read/write a particular stack offset in the thousands. But I cannot print it to confirm since direct parameter access does not work. I\n  <em>\n   can\n  </em>\n  see the target parameter by using repeated characters, but I need direct parameters to work going forward due to other constraints.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, I understand this is in \"undefined behavior\" territory, but I compiled a vulnerable test binary (statically linked against Glibc, I should probably try against musl) on the system that works as expected with no issues (e.g.\n  <code>\n   %9000$p\n  </code>\n  prints something).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there something that would cause this behavior, or something I am missing? I can provide further information if needed.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

            "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  After posting the question, I started to think about the difference in the libc I was using. I compiled the basic test binary again but with musl, and also saw the unexpected behavior there. This seems to be due to the\n  <code>\n   printf\n  </code>\n  implementation in\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/bminor/musl/blob/master/src/stdio/vfprintf.c#L464\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   musl\n  </a>\n  :\n </p>\n <pre><code>        if (isdigit(s[1]) && s[2]=='$') {\n            l10n=1;\n            argpos = s[1]-'0';\n            s+=3;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  It only uses direct parameters if there is exactly one digit following the\n  <code>\n   %\n  </code>\n  , followed by a\n  <code>\n   $\n  </code>\n  . This explains why I was unable to print any larger stack offsets.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Edit:\n  </strong>\n  This seems\n  <a href=\"https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fprintf.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   standard\n  </a>\n  -compliant:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   \"%n$\", where n is a decimal integer in the range [1,{NL_ARGMAX}], giving the\n  position of the argument in the argument list.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Then, looking at\n  <a href=\"https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/limits.h.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   the definition\n  </a>\n  of NL_ARGMAX:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   NL_ARGMAX\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Maximum value of digit in calls to the printf() and scanf()\n  functions. Minimum Acceptable Value: 9\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  So it appears that the implementation is indeed following the standard by allowing the minimum value of 9, which is certainly inconvenient for writing compact format string exploits.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
