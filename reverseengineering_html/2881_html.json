It includes beginner malware training videos.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Not familiar with malware myself, I do often see the following books recommended in answers:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0470613033\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     Malware Analyst's Cookbook\n    </a>\n   </p>\n   <blockquote>\n    <p>\n     Security professionals will find plenty of solutions in this book to the problems posed by viruses, Trojan horses, worms, spyware, rootkits, adware, and other invasive software.
