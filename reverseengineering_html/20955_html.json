First off let me explain what Iexpect to see:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Address hexDumb Command comments EAX ECX etc...\n0042AD43 BLAH JNZ 00112345 somecomment 01010101 10101010... etc....\n0042AD48 FLAH XOR EAX, ECX anothercomment 01010101 10101010... etc...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Essentially each line from the CPU window, all of the data that you see for each line.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I step into each command by hand in ollydbg then I get to see each command of the thousands that are executed. However when I use the run trace I get a hand ful of commands, somewhere in the range of 50 commands.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
