Possibly the original project on sourceforge provided precompiled binaries but they don’t seem to be present on the GitHub mirror.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

With active maintenance you could simply request a renewal (even if it means staying on the same version). Having that SDK will then enable you - with the help of any of the supported debuggers - to build the plugin for IDA versions supported by said SDK. If you're using the freeware IDA version you'll be out of luck, though, since that doesn't support extensions (not without jumping through some hoops).</span>",
