    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a USB device from a vendor (TRENDnet) that has the exact same chipset as a QNAP device with an available firmware patching tool.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It's my belief that this firmware patching tool should work perfectly fine with my TRENDnet device.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, when I run the firmware patching tool, it reports that it cannot find a suitable device and exits.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I believe the firmware patching tool is looking for specific USB\n  <code>\n   VIDs\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   PIDs\n  </code>\n  to detect\n  <strong>\n   valid\n  </strong>\n  USB devices. I've extracted from the drivers that these are the valid\n  <code>\n   VID/PID\n  </code>\n  combinations.\n </p>\n <pre><code>VID_2ECA - PID_C101\nVID_2ECA - PID_C102\nVID_0B95 - PID_2790\nVID_0B95 - PID_2791\nVID_1C04 - PID_0015\nVID_1C04 - PID_0016\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I would like to see if it's possible to inject additional\n  <code>\n   PID/VID\n  </code>\n  values into the tool to allow my device to be detected and have the firmware upgraded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've tried searching for the various\n  <code>\n   VID/PID\n  </code>\n  combos in a hex editor to no avail, and have also tried to decompile the app using IDA Free with no success (mainly because I have no idea what I am doing).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can someone either look at the file or offer some advice of what to do look for/try next?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The firmware patching tool can be downloaded from this\n  <a href=\"https://www.qnap.com/en-us/download?model=qna-uc5g1t&category=firmware\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   link\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The tool is named\n  <code>\n   aqusbupdate.exe\n  </code>\n  and it reads in\n  <code>\n   QNAP_QNA-UC5G1T_FW_3.1.6.bin\n  </code>\n  when passed in as an argument.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
