    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I would like to decompile a 32-bit Linux executable to C, modify some parts of it, and then compile it back. I do not care if the C code is not pretty and really hard to maintain. The only thing I care is to be able to compile it back to a 32-bit executable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The program was written in C++ around 2006, but the source code was lost since then. It is not a small program, and it uses some dynamically linked libraries as well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried\n  <a href=\"http://boomerang.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Boomerang\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/avast/retdec\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Avast RetDec\n  </a>\n  . None of them is able to provide a compilable result, but the one RetDec provides, is sometimes surprisingly readable. Unfortunately, I can not use this output to rewrite the project, because the code is really long. That is why I am looking for a way to produce compilable C code in the first place.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

All decompilers have to guess the missing information and just one wrong answer is enough to spoil the result. Second, re-compilability is often not the goal.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
