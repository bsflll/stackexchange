However, I'd make 2 observations -\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    It appears that your patch is trying to increase the upper bound of a loop from 10 to 16.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    The function in which the access violation occurs appears to be a C++ class member function where the faulting instruction is trying to read a member variable. (esi here is loaded from ecx where ecx is the\n    <code>\n     this\n    </code>\n    pointer.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  The combination makes me suspect that the increase in loop limit results in an out-of-bounds array access.  e.g. something like this -\n </p>\n <pre><code>std::array<some_class*,10> widgets;         // or std::vector or C-array etc\n\n.. elsewhere ..\n\nfor( size_t i = 0; i < 10; ++i ) {          // the patch changes 10 to 15\n    widgets[i]->faulting_function( ... );\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  To confirm this hypothesis and resolve it you are going to have work backwards from the faulting function to see where ecx comes from and then increase the size of the container.  If however, this is static and in the data section of the exefile then it might not be trivial to do so.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So it's an anti-tamper measure. I'm new to x32dbg and I need to run a trace from entrypoint till execution with the original file and patched file. Do you know how?</span>",

The\n  <code>\n   cmp\n  </code>\n  you are patching is breaking, likely because the what it's returning isn't met for the\n  <code>\n   jb\n  </code>\n  instruction to occur, hence the\n  <code>\n   EIP\n  </code>\n  is throwing an access violation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How is the\n  <code>\n   cmp\n  </code>\n  working exactly?
