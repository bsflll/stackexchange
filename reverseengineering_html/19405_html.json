The code is protected as it calls to encodepointer and some modules are hidden. I'm using ollydbg 2.01 with olly ext1.8 every option activated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can find the license on the memory map but now how can I find it on the code, or where it compares to that license value?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm kinda new to ollydbg\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

That means, you can break at the instruction which accesses this certain memory address or the region you specified.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can set, that the breakpoint triggers at read, write and/or execute.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To set a memory breakpoint, select the area in the memory dump/map, right-click and choose Breakpoint > Memory, on Access (or what you want, probably that).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Run the program and now it should stop at the instruction where this memory is accessed.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
