But even this edit action caused the warning to pop up. The same happens when editing individual members of the struct, e.g. by going through the data carousel with\n  <kbd>\n   D\n  </kbd>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Obviously I can simply check the checkbox and be oblivious of any future instances of the warning, but since it is a\n  <em>\n   warning\n  </em>\n  I'd like to know:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   what does the warning mean and how serious of an issue is it?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   how can I fix it without merely hiding it?\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So far I've been lucky and it hasn't caused any kinds of mess in the parent structs so I kinda \"learned\" to ignore this warning...\n</span>\n</body></html>",
