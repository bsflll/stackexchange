    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Looking at DWARFs of bzip2_base I see different offsets between members of a structure type although they are of the same type. Check _IO_FILE structure at the offset 0x9c\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/ryantanwk/VaTy/blob/master/benchmark/sample_binaries/bzip2_base.gcc54-64bit.DIE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  . All the way until the 7th member at 0xF0 (_IO_write_end) all members have 12 Byte offset from the previous member, but the 8th member (@ 0xFD) onward the difference in the DIE offset gets 13 Bytes. Can anyone help me understand why? any good text that explains?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You do not calculate these offsets, you parse the layout of structure from the first member to the last member. You can't skip single members or \"jump\" to a specific member easily.</span>",
