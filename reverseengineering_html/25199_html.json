How do I analyze the exception and the behavior? How do I exploit it?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have so many questions. Please help. The memory dump is too big, so it is impossible to identify anything. What steps should I follow? Sometimes shows\n  <code>\n   unexpected HRESULT\n  </code>\n  on R8 register as well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DLuR0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DLuR0.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
