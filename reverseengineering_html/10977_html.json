    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm having trouble debugging a win32 executable file under Windows 7. I've tried using ollyDbg and\n  <a href=\"http://x64dbg.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   x64dbg\n  </a>\n  : the former simply does nothing, while the latter complains with an \"\n  <strong>\n   Error starting process (invalid pe?)!\n  </strong>\n  \" message.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I\n  <em>\n   think\n  </em>\n  this might have to do with the fact that said executable is digitally signed. I did some quick research and\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/341168/can-i-remove-a-digital-signature-from-a-dll\">\n   this SO question\n  </a>\n  came up, where I learned that digital signatures in windows executables are referenced in the file's PE header, which I\n  <em>\n   think\n  </em>\n  might be what x64dbg was complaining about.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The executable I'm talking about is the Mumble windows client version 1.2.10.\nIt is the only executable signed with\n  <strong>\n   two\n  </strong>\n  different digital signatures, which further reinforces my hypothesis.\nSadly, even after stripping the digital signatures using the delcert.exe linked in the SO question above, the problem remains which brings me to a dead end.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is it possible digital signatures are messing these debuggers up? Is it possible that the signature stripping tool doesn't produce a valid pe file for the debuggers I tried? What else could I be doing wrong?\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  As a footnote: I know mumble is free software and I could just compile my own version, but this is Reverse Engineering, right?\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Update: Following Jason comment, I'm posting the ollydbg log, which doesn't really say anything, unfortunately:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Log data\nAddress    Message\nOllyDbg v1.10\nBookmarks sample plugin v1.06 (plugin demo)\n  Copyright (C) 2001, 2002 Oleh Yuschuk\nCommand line plugin v1.10\n  Written by Oleh Yuschuk\nFile 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mumble\\mumble.exe'\n</code></pre>\n <hr/>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
