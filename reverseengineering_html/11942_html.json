I have tried this redirecting the output to a file:\n  <code>\n   r2 -c 'pi $s' binary > dump.txt\n  </code>\n  . The dump is created but radare2 gets unresponsive. Is this a bug, or am I doing something wrong?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

But if you hit\n  <code>\n   q\n  </code>\n  (as in\n  <code>\n   q\n  </code>\n  uit) and\n  <em>\n   Enter\n  </em>\n  , radare2 will exit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is the command that you should use:\n  <code>\n   r2 -q -c 'pi $s' ./a.out > out.txt\n  </code>\n  if you want radare2 to dump the entire binary, then exit.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Kali linux has this combo pre-installed in its toolbox. It works fine in many platforms (ubuntu, open-suse, etc).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
