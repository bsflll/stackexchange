    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have the following disassembly which looks like a buffer being populated with zeros in a loop, however, I'm confused at why the alignment is needed here (if a jump will always be 4-bytes, why does aligning to a 4-byte boundary matter?)\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm also confused at what and'ing ecx (which presumably contains the size of the buffer plus how many bytes it was misaligned by) with 0xFFFFFFFC does, it's not an address so why is the same and used to 4-byte align something being used on something that is being used as a count for a loop etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Could someone give a good walkthrough of what this code is doing and why? Is it really a compiler optimization or handwritten code? Is the intention speed etc?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hjLPj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Disassembly\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hjLPj.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

My guess would be that since it is using indirect addressing, you are not guaranteed to have a 4-byte aligned pointer so the compiler aligns it before performing reads/writes to such an address. One interesting thing is the\n <code>\n  mov ebx, 0\n </code>\n instruction. I thought that most compilers would output an\n <code>\n  xor ebx, ebx\n </code>\n instruction. This could either mean a non-standard compiler was used or maybe it is handwritten.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

What's obvious is that this is 'crappy' compiler generated code used to align local variables to a 4-bytes boundary. Most optimizing compilers avoid using the stack and use registers when optimization flags are set (i.e. gcc -O2, ...).\n </p>\n <pre><code>    lea     eax, [esp+12h]\n    mov     ecx, 1Ah\n    mov     ebx, 0\n    mov     [eax], ebx\n    mov     [eax+ecx-4], ebx\n    lea     edx, [eax+4]\n    and     edx, 0FFFFFFFCh\n    sub     eax, edx\n    add     ecx, eax\n    and     ecx, 0FFFFFFFCh\n    and     ecx, 0FFFFFFFCh\n    mov     eax, 0\n\n    loc_401500:\n    mov     [edx+eax], ebx\n    add     eax, 4\n    cmp     eax, ecx\n    jb      short loc_401500\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  0xFFFFFFC ==> 11111111111111111111111111111100 in binary.
