I've looked in\n  <em>\n   The IDAPro Book\n  </em>\n  and there's nothing on the topic (if there is I can't find it). Perhaps it's not possible with IDAPro. Also if it's helpful I'm debugging an elf executable remotely from a windows machine. Thanks in advance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  some basic documentation\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/index.shtml\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/index.shtml\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I assume you're using remote GDB through IDA. The debugger will attach itself to a specific process, and that process only. Fortunately, GDB has an option to follow child processes, using the debugging option:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   set follow-fork-mode child\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Type that in the GDB prompt at the bottom of the Output Window in IDA, and the debugger should follow the path of execution of the forked child process.\n </p>\n <p>\n  See\n  <a href=\"http://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Forks.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   this page\n  </a>\n  for more info on debugging forks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
