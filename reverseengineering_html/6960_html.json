That way the info shows up in the crossrefs listing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This can also be scripted but that involves walking the instructions before each call and emulating the instructions in a limited fashion. Once you reach the call instruction you can access your simulated mini stack and emulated registers to see if they have constant (known) values or not, and generate above-mentioned comment accordingly.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Consider this test program:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <stdio.h>\n\nint a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j;\n\nvoid func(int a1, int a2, int a3, int a4, int a5) {\n        printf(\"%d %d %d %d %d\n\", a1, a2, a3, a4, a5);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n        int x, y;\n\n        x=g+c;\n        y=d*e+i;\n\n        func(1, a, b+c, 7, j);\n        printf(\"blarfl\n\");\n        func(e, j*c, 3, x, y);\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  After compiling it (with -O0 and without symbols) and loading it in IDA, the main functions looks like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>push    rbp\nmov     rbp, rsp\nsub     rsp, 10h\nmov     edx, cs:g\nmov     eax, cs:c\nadd     eax, edx\nmov     [rbp+var_8], eax\nmov     edx, cs:d\nmov     eax, cs:e\nimul    edx, eax\nmov     eax, cs:i\nadd     eax, edx\nmov     [rbp+var_4], eax\nmov     ecx, cs:j\nmov     edx, cs:b\nmov     eax, cs:c\nadd     edx, eax\nmov     eax, cs:a\nmov     r8d, ecx\nmov     ecx, 7\nmov     esi, eax\nmov     edi, 1\ncall    func\nmov     edi, offset s   ; \"blarfl\"\ncall    _puts\nmov     edx, cs:j\nmov     eax, cs:c\nmov     esi, edx\nimul    esi, eax\nmov     eax, cs:e\nmov     ecx, [rbp+var_4]\nmov     edx, [rbp+var_8]\nmov     r8d, ecx\nmov     ecx, edx\nmov     edx, 3\nmov     edi, eax\ncall    func\nleave\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Once you define your function\n </p>\n <pre><code>; __int64 __cdecl func(int XYZ1, int XYZ2, int XYZ3, int XYZ4, int XYZ5)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  the disassembly of\n  <code>\n   main\n  </code>\n  turns into\n </p>\n <pre><code>push    rbp\nmov     rbp, rsp\nsub     rsp, 10h\nmov     edx, cs:g\nmov     eax, cs:c\nadd     eax, edx\nmov     [rbp+XYZ4], eax\nmov     edx, cs:d\nmov     eax, cs:e\nimul    edx, eax\nmov     eax, cs:i\nadd     eax, edx\nmov     [rbp+XYZ5], eax\nmov     ecx, cs:j\nmov     edx, cs:b\nmov     eax, cs:c\nadd     edx, eax        ; XYZ3\nmov     eax, cs:a\nmov     r8d, ecx        ; XYZ5\nmov     ecx, 7          ; XYZ4\nmov     esi, eax        ; XYZ2\nmov     edi, 1          ; XYZ1\ncall    func\nmov     edi, offset s   ; \"blarfl\"\ncall    _puts\nmov     edx, cs:j\nmov     eax, cs:c\nmov     esi, edx\nimul    esi, eax        ; XYZ2\nmov     eax, cs:e\nmov     ecx, [rbp+XYZ5]\nmov     edx, [rbp+XYZ4]\nmov     r8d, ecx        ; XYZ5\nmov     ecx, edx        ; XYZ4\nmov     edx, 3          ; XYZ3\nmov     edi, eax        ; XYZ1\ncall    func\nleave\nretn\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  so you see ida auto-generates comments where the parameters are assigned.

If you make your parameter names sufficiently unique, this should identify the instructions quite well (that's why i used XYZ1 instead of a1).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Of course,\n </p>\n <pre><code>imul    esi, eax        ; XYZ2\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  won't really help you that much.

But how do you want to display this in your list of parameter-annotated xrefs anyway, unless you're trying to re-implement the Hex Rays Decompiler? Spending the time to process the 5% edge cases manually is probably much more efficient than trying to get everything handled in your helper program, especially if that program is intended for one specific task.</span>",

The premise is that a wrong answer can be worse than no answer at all <i>sometimes</i>.
