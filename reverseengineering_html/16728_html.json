    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  A bit of background; I'm trying to inject my own code into the old game SimTower with the ultimate goal of reverse engineering it in the same way that OpenRCT2 was created.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since SimTower is distributed as a 16-bit NE executable I'm having a bit of trouble with injecting my own DLL and changing the main method to my own (as in this article\n  <a href=\"https://bwrsandman.wordpress.com/2014/12/27/first-steps-to-reverse-engineering-an-executable/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   https://bwrsandman.wordpress.com/2014/12/27/first-steps-to-reverse-engineering-an-executable/\n  </a>\n  ), but I think I've found another way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of the first things that SimTower does is to run\n  <code>\n   WAVEMIXINIT\n  </code>\n  from\n  <code>\n   WAVMIX16.DLL\n  </code>\n  . As far as I can tell, if the return value is\n  <code>\n   0\n  </code>\n  it shows a dialog box and disables the sound.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img height=\"227\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/189580/32468638-0a936be4-c347-11e7-8989-580a8a0c6b44.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  My plan now is to simply create a faux wavmix16 dll that will (for now) always return 0 from that function. That should allow me to get an entry point to run my own code, and get the game started.\n </p>\n <pre><code>typedef void *HANDLE;\n\nHANDLE __far __pascal WAVEMIXINIT() {\n  // while (1) {;};\n  return 0;\n}\n\nvoid __far __pascal STUB4() {}\nvoid __far __pascal STUB5() {}\nvoid __far __pascal STUB6() {}\nvoid __far __pascal STUB7() {}\nvoid __far __pascal STUB9() {}\nvoid __far __pascal STUB10() {}\nvoid __far __pascal STUB11() {}\nvoid __far __pascal STUB12() {}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Compiling this into a dll and naming it\n  <code>\n   wavmix16.dll\n  </code>\n  seems to work, and I can see that the call is coming in to my function, since if I uncomment the while loop the program will be stuck inside it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For some reason though, the program crashes as soon as I get to my return statement.\n </p>\n <p>\n  (wine)\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Unhandled page fault on read access to 0x0000fa30 at address 0x148f:0x0000000c (thread 002b)\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  (Windows XP)\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img height=\"146\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/189580/32468826-d353bb42-c347-11e7-8da3-78fa0329333f.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is the assembly of my DDL function that gets called. I'm a little bit unsure of why there is more stuff than just a\n  <code>\n   mov\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   retf\n  </code>\n  (like the\n  <code>\n   nop\n  </code>\n  ?), but I'm new to all this so maybe that's normal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img height=\"225\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/189580/32468875-020fbe18-c348-11e7-90a5-80cab00910da.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is the assembly of the original DLL function:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img height=\"506\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/189580/32481676-5587abde-c38c-11e7-8690-457b13517490.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Really appreciate any help, thank you!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
