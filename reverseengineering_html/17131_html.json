At first glance this looks like a Kevo Hub for smart locks with a Power plug, a Ethernet port and an antenna mount. You'll be most likely dealing with an ARM SoC given the size of what I see.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Find a 3.3v source and then check for I/O from the pins/points, which may appear as garbage. From there, determine the baud rate in use so you aren't getting garbage. Hopefully it isn't encrypted or otherwise disabled. A good serial shell may allow you to dump the FLASH or otherwise interact with the OS in easier ways. Case in point, look where I found serial on this little router years ago:\n <a href=\"https://bitsum.com/openwiking/owbase/WL530G/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  bitsum.com/openwiking/owbase/WL530G\n </a>\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Also you can measure pin volts looking for 3.3v and place Rx and Tx rs232 for get console.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Else if you dont have JTAG access you should start to think about desolder flash chip (in case it exists) but in this case the code seems to be written into flash area of the MCU.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So finally successful depends on IC security...Maybe some some glitch at the right place and moment could help as well..\n </p>\n <p>\n  Good luck\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
