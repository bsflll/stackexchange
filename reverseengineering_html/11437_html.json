    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm new to the science of reverse engineering. I recently downloaded\n  <strong>\n   <em>\n    immunity debugger 1.85 32bit Assembler-Level Debugger\n   </em>\n  </strong>\n  . My host machine is\n  <strong>\n   <em>\n    Windows 7 64 bit\n   </em>\n  </strong>\n  . I have\n  <strong>\n   <em>\n    python 2.7 installed as 32 bit image\n   </em>\n  </strong>\n  and\n  <strong>\n   <em>\n    MSVCR90.dll\n   </em>\n  </strong>\n  in pythons install directory. Whenever I execute the pycommands I get a MSCVR90.dll runtime error R6034. Does this debugger work on 64 bit host? If so what can I do to correct this runtime error?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Your advice is really appreciated...\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
