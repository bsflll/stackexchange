There is something here related to\n <code>\n  strace\n </code>\n equivalentes on windows (\n <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/864839/monitoring-certain-system-calls-done-by-a-process-in-windows\" title=\"monitoring certain system calls done by a process in windows\">\n  stackoverflow.com/questions/864839/â€¦\n </a>\n ).

Guess I didn't think deeply enough about the \"boot loader\" part of the message. Not an easy route, but you could emulate the system in Qemu (\n <a href=\"https://qemu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/gdb.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  qemu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/gdb.html\n </a>\n ), halt it early in the boot with the monitor, attach GDB and do some forensics.  More complex would be using Panda (\n <a href=\"https://github.com/panda-re/panda\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  github.com/panda-re/panda\n </a>\n ).\n</span>\n</body></html>",
