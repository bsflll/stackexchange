Neither do I recognise the manufacturer.\nThe IC is actually very small, so I cannot take a better photo of it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What I already found out:\nThe IC is connected to six touch keys, the upper five pins and the first pin on the lower left are connected to the touch pads. Then there are 3 data lines connected to an ST32. May be I2C.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks for any hint!\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qcGl8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"unknown IC\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qcGl8.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
