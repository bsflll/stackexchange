I have a set of\n  <code>\n   .idb\n  </code>\n  files which will not be opened by IDA 7.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What I have tried so far:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Opening the file directly in IDA as recommended\n   <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/238.shtml\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    in the manual\n   </a>\n   . It's not listed as an option in the open menu, and when forced, it says it can't disassemble the file.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Rename the\n   <code>\n    .idb\n   </code>\n   file to\n   <code>\n    .id0\n   </code>\n   . It first reports that the file is not closed, asking to repair it. If I say Yes, it reports\n   <code>\n    bTree error: bad B-tree header\n   </code>\n   .\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Rename the\n   <code>\n    .idb\n   </code>\n   file to\n   <code>\n    .i64\n   </code>\n   . It shows\n   <code>\n    Please use 32-bit version of IDA to open <file>\n   </code>\n   . There is no 32-bit version of IDA 7 Freeware.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It's also listed in the manual (\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/444.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/444.shtml\n  </a>\n  ). Basically:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Export from IDA old to\n   <code>\n    .idc\n   </code>\n   (this will generate an IDC file)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Run new IDA with switch\n   <code>\n    -x\n   </code>\n   with your old IDB database (From my experience, this just opens IDA and autoanalyzes everything again, I'm not sure if that's the expected behavior)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Execute the IDC file with IDA new (This is supposed to apply all manual work you've done in your old IDB database and apply it to the new database).\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  That said, I haven't had any luck getting this to work, but it's supposed to, so maybe you'll have better luck than me, please report back if you have any :).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
