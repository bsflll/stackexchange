(a series of challanges/ books/ any outher working way - i want to be able to look at a program in ida and  feel that i know exactly what to do even in state of the art anty debug protection).\n </p>\n <p>\n  (I did the guides of LENA, KIGA and read the books:\nReverse Engineering for Beginners\nPractical malware analysis\nReversing: The Hacker's Guide to Reverse Engineering)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

From my personal experience reverse engineering is mostly learned by doing things: By actually trying to solve a real problem. Usually for me once the problem is solved, I lose interest in the code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My advice for you is to find a project of larger scale that you want to work on, something that interests you personally, and slowly get going through it.\nKeep a journal of what you are trying to do. A text file will do. Sometimes reverse engineering projects can take more than a few months to complete.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you feel that you can still not handle something of this scale, you can check out\n  <strong>\n   ReversingHero\n  </strong>\n  : It's a program I use to teach beginners about reverse engineering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  ReversingHero contains 15 levels of increasing difficulty, and it seems to be interesting even for experienced reversers. It works on Linux x64, but if you use Windows > 10 you can use WSL to run it. Grab yourself a disassembler, a debugger and start solving the challenges in this file. You can find it here:\n  <a href=\"https://www.reversinghero.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   ReversingHero\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note that ReversingHero has accompanying video course which is paid (not free), but given that you already have some reverse engineering experience I don't think you should be watching the videos.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
