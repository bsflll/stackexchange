Despite the author's confusion, he is asking a more fundamental question I believe, one that does belong on crypto.stackexchange.com. That is: Can a symmetric key be derived if the plaintext is known? The answer is generally that it makes it possible, if not easy, depending on the encryption algorithm. In some cases, simply knowing a few bytes of plaintext can yield the key, or substantially reduce the range of possible keys.</span>",

AES and DES certainly don’t make it easy given a few bytes.</span>",

There are other, similarly less advanced, algorithms that can clearly be broken if part of the plaintext is known. This is especially true when the algorithm is known and if the known plaintext is longer than the key. For block chaining encryption algorithms, it is particularly helpful to know the first few bytes. Even sophisticated symmetric encryption algos can be broken, or weakened, by knowing the plaintext. The simple math reality of: A+B=C so A=C-B makes this true. Cryptanalyists often use this mechanism.</span>",

Whether they can be weakened though, I don't know for sure. Depends on the algorithm, but this is hard to avoid entirely (though maybe the good ones do, I'm not sure on that).</span>",
