It sounds like weird stuff is happening as a result of the way you loaded the binary into IDA. I've had similar weird issues before when dealing with segments and loading addresses. Hopefully getting the segmentation working properly will resolve the issues with references/ability to define code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There are a couple of similar, yet different methods you can use, most of them on the\n  <code>\n   Edit->Segments\n  </code>\n  submenu. The first thing I'd try would be loading the program at base address\n  <code>\n   0x0\n  </code>\n  like you did originally, then trying\n  <code>\n   Edit->Segments->Rebase Program\n  </code>\n  . If that didn't work, I'd try\n  <code>\n   Edit->Segments->Move Current Segment\n  </code>\n  , or\n  <code>\n   Edit->Segments->Edit Segment\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
