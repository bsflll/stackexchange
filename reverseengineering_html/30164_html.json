I can't quite figure out what was getting called instead.\nA Binaryninja line where the ADVAPI function appears to be called:\n </p>\n <pre><code>CreateServiceA(&var_20, 0, 0, 0x18, 0xf0000000)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The Import information I got from PEBear:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Call Via: 81D8,\nName: CreateServiceA,\nOrdinal: -,\nOriginal Thunk: 4E908,\nThunk: 8360,\nHint: DAB9\n </p>\n <p>\n  As I understood it the \"Original Thunk\" is the RVA where the \"Hint\" is located? But I don't really understand the rest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   My Question\n  </strong>\n  : What do the Thunks and the Hint mean, what exactly gets called and what was originally being called?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

They used a tool (\n <a href=\"https://github.com/d35ha/CallObfuscator\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  github.com/d35ha/CallObfuscator\n </a>\n ) to obfuscate the IAT of the PE and load in the correct functions at runtime right before the main function. Should I delete my question or attempt to answer it? I don't think anyone cares about the answer.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
