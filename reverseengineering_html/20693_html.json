How can I do that?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know IDA can generate a flow chart (gdl file) and call chart (gdl file). But my question is, how do I convert those file format into pdf so that I could view the pdf on my android and iPad? I have no experience with those file formats before.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
