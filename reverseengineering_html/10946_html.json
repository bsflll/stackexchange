    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I want to get into reverse engineering and eventually be able to read the memory of a specific game during runtime and work with this data. For this purpose I have been doing research on that topic and was considering to start with a simple task to learn about the proper tools and stuff like finding offsets for various information.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I wanted to open an instance of the notepad editor, write some text into it and then access this text from another program after figuring out the right addresses. Although it seems as if OllyDbg is a famous choice I had problems to attach it to my notepad process. (Apparently some problem with the 64-bit Windows 10 would be my first guess here.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyways, I was curious if you can suggest me tools and alternatives for OllyDbg to get into this, especially proving the possibility to search the memory contents with specific patterns, in my sample case the text I entered on screen.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Can't update now, but what you should do is go to the .data section of the process and then right click -> \"Find pattern\", and there you search for your string. I would use Cheat Engine for that, however, as (imo) it has a better UI for this kind of stuff.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
