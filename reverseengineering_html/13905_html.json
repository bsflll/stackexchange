    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to figure out how to copy \"properly\" strings from memory, I see there are very few plugins available for ollydbg2.x.x and the one I've tried, called\n  <a href=\"https://tuts4you.com/request.php?3434\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   BinaryCopyEx\n  </a>\n  didn't work ok, for instance, It was impossible to press the buttons to \"Copy to clipboard\" or \"save to file\" (using 1920x1080 resolution).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, I wouldn't like to come back to ollydbg110 because the packed executables I'm dealing with were having some issues being opened with v110. When I say properly I don't mean using \"Copy as a table\" command, I'd just want to extract the string content (beautified or not).\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, could you please recommend me any OllyDbg v201 plugin suitable for the task? If not, any other proper method to copy large random strings from start to end offsets would be welcome.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

One unrelated question to the current thread, do you know why i can't drag executables with ollydbg v201? I ask you this cos I've seen youtube videos dragging out executables and working out of the box. Maybe is that a plugin or..?</span>",
