My purpose is to run a specific script that receives arguments via my main program against multiple files, but for some reason, it does not work for me. Sometimes it opens IDA without any reason.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am using the following commands:\n </p>\n <p>\n  One command is:\n  <code>\n   'C:\\\\IDA\\\\ida.exe -B %s' % file\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Second command is:\n  <code>\n   cmd = 'C:\\\\IDA\\\\ida.exe -a- -A -S\"script.py \"%s\"\" %s' % (file, file)\n  </code>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You're using the exact same type of quotes (\n <code>\n  \"\n </code>\n ) to denote two different things. You're attempting to quote the overall script+parameters, but you seem to also be quoting the parameter(s) with the same type of quotes. Not sure\n <i>\n  how\n </i>\n you execute this (i.e. which Python module), but\n <code>\n  cmd.exe\n </code>\n is likely going to have an issue telling these apart ... not to mention that file names with blank spaces will garble up the whole thing anyway.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
