From Wikipedia, the .bss section is\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   the portion of an object file, executable, or assembly language code that contains statically-allocated variables that are declared but have not been assigned a value yet.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  IDA is showing you this with the\n  <code>\n   dd\n  </code>\n  opcode. As @blabb point out, this is an\n  <code>\n   uninitialized dword\n  </code>\n  , which mean a dword that was not assigned yet. Exactly what is supposed to be in the .bss section !\n </p>\n <p>\n  Theses variables don't have any hardcoded default values, so they are placed in this section of the binary, waiting to be populated at runtime with dynamic values.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What you can do is to write down the address of the variable that you want to find more about, open up a debugger, let it run a bit (or you can break on a specific function if you know where this variable is being populated), and check the content of this variable by looking at the previously written memory address.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You'll know what type of data is supposed to be inside this variable !\n </p>\n <p>\n  Don't forget to deactivate the ASLR while running the binary (otherwise the address that you saw in IDA would not match naything), or if needed, to rebase your program in IDA.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
