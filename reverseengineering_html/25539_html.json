But I do not have any idea how they do that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some random dude made like a copy of My executable but with more strings (Files Names) on an [x] offset that falls into the\n  <code>\n   .rdata\n  </code>\n  section, which caused the Executable to map more files in the memory ...\n </p>\n <p>\n  How is that even possible ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
