    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  A glyph holds data such as its name and contour points. But how do you determine where the characters of one language end and another begins? Is there a written standard that says language X starts at index Y and ends at index Z?\n </p>\n <p>\n  In case it matters, I'm referring to\n  <code>\n   .ttf\n  </code>\n  &\n  <code>\n   .otf\n  </code>\n  font files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm unsure if my question fits in this community and I'm struggling to find another, so if there's one better suited, please let me know.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any info or documentation on this would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks in advance.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
