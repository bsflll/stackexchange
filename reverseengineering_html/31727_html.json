(If an approximation is good enough then why not use the exact reciprocal square root result as an approximation to the approximate function ?)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Instead, here you know the instruction returns an approximation to a known mathematical calculation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Approximate reciprocal square-root operation were\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   developed\n  </a>\n  some time ago. Initial versions were based on a 'magic' first step followed by 1 or more Newton-Raphson iterations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since them similar instructions have appeared in several hardware architecture. (Intel & AMD x86-64, ARM NEON etc.)\nThe exact implementation of these is not generally documented, presumably because you seldom need to reproduce bit-accurate versions of approximate calculations. (The SX-Aurora document you linked to says that its implementation is system dependent. This, in theory, could mean that different versions or steppings of the same hardware could produce different results.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is however at least one documented hardware implementation as Intel provided C reference implementations of the AVX-512 versions of their approximation instructions in 2015. These can be found\n  <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/code-sample/reference-implementations-for-ia-approximation-instructions-vrcp14-vrsqrt14-vrcp28-vrsqrt28-vexp2.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first thing I'd try would be to implement a couple of the obvious or published implementations and see if they match the results you get from the hardware.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
