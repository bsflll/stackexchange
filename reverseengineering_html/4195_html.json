That may be all you need to provide whatever support you need to do.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To get \"a\" source code in Objective-C or in any higher language you will have to analyse the structure of your working assembly program and translate it into the language of your choice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However it will never be \"the\" original source code, in all its glory.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
