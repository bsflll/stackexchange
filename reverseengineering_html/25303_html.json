You seem to be trying to load the kernel PE file from usermode as if it was any PE file and as if it were suitable to be run inside the Win32 subsystem. Could you please tell us what it is you want to achieve, rather than asking about\n <i>\n  your perceived way\n </i>\n of getting there? Thanks.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
