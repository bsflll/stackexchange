They could try to analyze the bytes to detect if there's code, data or something else but you might also get some false-positives.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In your case, you instruct\n  <code>\n   r2\n  </code>\n  to display those bytes as code (\n  <code>\n   pd - print disassembly\n  </code>\n  ) and it does not recognize any architecture as it has x86 by default. You would get the same when you open no file (\n  <code>\n   r2 -\n  </code>\n  and then\n  <code>\n   e asm.arch\n  </code>\n  )\n </p>\n <p>\n  In Ghidra you selected the architecture manually and to \"force\" the tool to do the same as your\n  <code>\n   pd\n  </code>\n  in radare2 just press\n  <kbd>\n   D\n  </kbd>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
