I see this having 2 possible meanings:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   You want to return to where the function was called from. You may be able to do this by patching that instruction with a\n   <code>\n    ret\n   </code>\n   or\n   <code>\n    jmp\n   </code>\n   , making sure things line up.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   You want the program to execute the next instruction immediately following the\n   <code>\n    call exit\n   </code>\n   . In this case, you want that instruction to have no effect, so \"no-operation\". Thus,\n   <code>\n    nop\n   </code>\n   .\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Make it just not call\n  <code>\n   exit()\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  You could do that by simply replacing the\n  <code>\n   call _exit\n  </code>\n  instruction with multiple\n  <code>\n   nop\n  </code>\n  opcodes. In IDA, you'll need to use the patch program feature Under the\n  <code>\n   edit-> patch bytes\n  </code>\n  sub-menu (Notice that in older versions of IDA you had to manually turn it on before it was available, this is no longer the case, though).\n </p>\n <p>\n  You could either\n  <code>\n   nop\n  </code>\n  the\n  <code>\n   call\n  </code>\n  instruction, the entire function (both\n  <code>\n   call\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   xor\n  </code>\n  ) or even completely remove the\n  <code>\n   call loc_BA060\n  </code>\n  that leads to the function at\n  <code>\n   0xBA060\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  your mileage may vary, however, depending on the surrounding code. It may be the case the prior to the call (and the following\n  <code>\n   exit()\n  </code>\n  ), eax contained a meaningful value that is used further down the code execution line. If that's the case and you leave the\n  <code>\n   xor eax, eax\n  </code>\n  instruction intact, you'll only avoid the\n  <code>\n   exit()\n  </code>\n  to hit a crash. It's therefore important to review the code surrounding the instruction you wish to remove.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Additionally, in this specific case,\n  <code>\n   exit()\n  </code>\n  is a no-return-function. This means the compiler is not required to make sure code following the\n  <code>\n   exit()\n  </code>\n  call will function properly because it is never expected to execute and\n  <code>\n   _exit\n  </code>\n  is not expected to return. You may wish to make sure you modify the code in a way that handles that well, although that behavior depends on the compiler and optimizations used.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
