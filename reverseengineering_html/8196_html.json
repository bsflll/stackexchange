However, I noticed that this new section does not be loaded to the memory, after some debugging!\n </p>\n <p>\n  I use\n  <code>\n   readelf\n  </code>\n  and figure out that there is no \"execution\" privilege of this new section:\n </p>\n <pre><code>[15] .trampoline       PROGBITS        080483d0 004020 000117 00      0   0 16\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Then I did this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>objcopy --set-section-flags .trampoline=alloc,code a.out\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However, I got this warning:\n </p>\n <pre><code>BFD: stQWykoH: warning: allocated section `.trampoline' not in segment\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now I realize that I didn't explicitly assign a\n  <code>\n   segment\n  </code>\n  information to my new section!!\n </p>\n <p>\n  So here is my question:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    How to assign a\n    <code>\n     segment\n    </code>\n    information to a new code section I defined?
