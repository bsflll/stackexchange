I don't remember the exact details but opening .dmp files directly with WinDbg required setting up the shell extension registry key somewhat differently. Can you open a .dmp file by double clicking it? If not, you could research that and that might also solve your issue.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

It only happens if you try to double click a dump file without having the correct permissions. I know it's pretty basic, but always run IDA Pro or WinDBG as administrator and that message should not appear.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
