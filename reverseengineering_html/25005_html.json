    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm building a fan website for a japanese mobile game. I'd like to have access to game data like character stats and ability names. I'll start by saying that this is the first time I have done something like this and could use any help.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is what I have done so far.\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   There is a folder containing custom .pack files, which I think are binary files of unknown format.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Within this folder there is also a .dat file with the names of the .pack files followed by a string of numbers (e.g.\n   <code>\n    master_attribute.pack  8CDF54ED0AE78C4FF663C3F639F28B7F\n   </code>\n   ). I do not know if this is related.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Each .pack file starts with the hex signature\n   <code>\n    C9\n   </code>\n   , which according to this\n   <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    wiki\n   </a>\n   , is a .com file, which i think is an outdated executable file?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Most of the .pack files, when read as utf-8, contain snippets of the information I'm looking for but it is riddled with out-of-place continuation bytes (this is likely irrelevant because I am naively assuming that these files are utf-8 text files).\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Here is an example of one of the smaller files, the japanese text are relevant and are not random.\n  </strong>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/e5H1V.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/e5H1V.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  As I said in the start, this is my first exposure to such things. I am stuck and welcome any help on what I can do next.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For reference,\n  <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DeV-YwxK3uHIX-8xM66hurKx8mO5ROHJ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  are some of the files\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Japanese has had strong resistance to UTF-8 Unicode because their older text encoding standards, of which there are several, take up less space for Japanese text. A lot of those Japanese characters just look like random gibberish. But then again I can see\n <code>\n  シメリア\n </code>\n that looks like proper Japanese and indeed turns out to be some character from World of Warcraft. As UTF-8 is a multibyte encoding, which byte offset you start interpreting can make a difference, though the bit patterns of UTF-8 make it pretty much self-synchronizing.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
