I have found a function which I want to be able to analyze. I see the name of the function and the entry point (at the end).\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gFVCR.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gFVCR.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  How do I actually set a breakpoint at this position? Do I figure out where the exe is in memory and then where the DLL has been loaded and then the entry point is the offset from the beginning of this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is it also possible to invoke these functions via these tools or can I just debug then when the breakpoints are hit?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

After you click that dll you can select all functions you like (for example\n  <code>\n   t3dSetActorInvisible\n  </code>\n  ) and press F2 to set software breakpoint there.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
