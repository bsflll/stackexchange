The same goes for .text, .bss, and even functions listed by objdump, such as 'main'.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How would I reproduce this if I were to write a disassembly tool + executable analyser myself?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If there was no section header for this section or if there was no section header table present in the binary,\n  <code>\n   objdump\n  </code>\n  would not be able to output this information.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is no need for heuristics unless the section header table is not present in the binary. This is unusual, but has been observed to be the case in certain Linux ELF binaries (viruses) in order to thwart analysis since\n  <code>\n   gdb\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   objdump\n  </code>\n  , and other\n  <a href=\"ftp://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/bfd-2.9.1/html_mono/bfd.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Binary File Descriptor-based utilities\n  </a>\n  (thank you Igor Skochinsky for the correction) rely on information in the section header table to parse the binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Relevant documentation can be found in the\n  <a href=\"https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/gabi41.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   System V ABI (generic)\n  </a>\n  beginning in chapter 4 \"Object Files\" (page 44), as well as the\n  <a href=\"http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/elf.5.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   manual page for ELF\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   A\n   <em>\n    section header table\n   </em>\n   contains information describing the file’s sections. Every section has an entry in the table; each\n  entry gives information such as the section name, the section size, and so on.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  More specifically:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   An object file’s section header table lets one locate all the file’s sections. The section header table is an array of\n   <code>\n    Elf32_Shdr\n   </code>\n   or\n   <code>\n    Elf64_Shdr\n   </code>\n   structures. A section header table index is a subscript into this array. The ELF header’s\n   <code>\n    e_shoff\n   </code>\n   member gives the byte offset from the beginning of the file to the section header table;\n   <code>\n    e_shnum\n   </code>\n   tells how many entries the section header table contains;\n   <code>\n    e_shentsize\n   </code>\n   gives the size in bytes of each entry.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Additionally,\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Sections contain all information in an object file, except the ELF header, the program header table, and the section header table. Moreover, object files’ sections satisfy several conditions.\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    <p>\n     Every section in an object file has exactly one section header describing it. Section headers may exist that do not have a section.\n    </p>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    <p>\n     Each section occupies one contiguous (possibly empty) sequence of bytes within a file.\n    </p>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    <p>\n     Sections in a file may not overlap. No byte in a file resides in more than one section.\n    </p>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    <p>\n     An object file may have inactive space. The various headers and the sections might not ‘‘cover’’ every byte in an object file. The contents of the inactive data are unspecified.\n    </p>\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Here is a high-level overview of what is involved in locating information contained in an ELF binary's individual section headers.
