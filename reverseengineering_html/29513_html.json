When I load my .EXE file, IDA does not load correspond PDB file and return message: PDB total 0 symbol loaded. What is the matter? I need load PDB file. But if I compile my project with Visual Studio 2005 that PDB file is success loaded.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Most likely there was a file format change of PDB files during that long period.\n <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_database\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  There are multiple PDB versions known\n </a>\n .\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Before in VS LINKER command line was set to /DEBUG:FASTLINK (not complete debug information). And now PDB file fine loads in IDA. Sorry for the confusion \"PDB/PDF\".\n</span>\n</body></html>",
