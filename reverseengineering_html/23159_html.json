    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am reversing a BIOS and its code extensively uses SP register for 16-bit return addresses (and also things like \"bswap ESP\" to obtain a \"two-level-deep\" stack, and rarely \"mov mm7, esp\" to obtain a \"4-level-deep\" stack etc).\n </p>\n <p>\n  It seems IDA does not track SP-related statements, even simple sequence of \"mov SP, F123h\" (inside the \"caller\" subroutine) followed by \"jmp sp\" (inside the \"callee\" subroutine) is not recognized. Therefore IDA can't show me a proper proximity view and I have to track the SP value and the whole control flow by hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way to automate this process?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've read that I can add XREFs manually using ALT+F11. When I press ALT+F11 the callee dialog appears, but after I enter the address and click OK nothing happens. At least nothing visible.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Why? Is it supposed to work only for \"call\" instructions, but not for \"jmp\"s? If not, where does the cursor have to be placed before pressing ALT+F11?\n </p>\n <p>\n  P.S. I'm using IDA Pro 6.8.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
