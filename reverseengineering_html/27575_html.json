Since mspaint is a GUI program, it does not have a console to which print output could go. You have the following options:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Change mspaint.exe subsystem to console so that a console window is allocated on startup.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Call\n   <code>\n    AllocConsole()\n   </code>\n   in your pintool and set up stdout/stderr to go there (not sure about the details here).\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Use an explicitly opened log file for output instead of stderr.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
