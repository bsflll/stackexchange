I noticed that when I rename functions with \"n\" in the\n  <em>\n   disassembly\n  </em>\n  view, that same function is not being renamed in the\n  <em>\n   decompilation\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have never noticed this before. Is this normal operating behavior? If so, how can you automatically transfer the names from the disassembly view to the decompilation view?\n </p>\n <p>\n  (I have notice this also happens when I rename functions with a script).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
