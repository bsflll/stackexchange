I don't have sample code at hand, but\n  <a href=\"https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/11/03/position-independent-code-pic-in-shared-libraries/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   this aricle\n  </a>\n  is good for background.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you want to intercept all\n  <em>\n   syscalls\n  </em>\n  (including those in the binary itself, e.g. if it's linked statically), you can use\n  <code>\n   ptrace (PTRACE_SYSCALL)\n  </code>\n  to be notified of all syscalls happening in the process. There are\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9759598/ptracing-syscalls\">\n   some examples\n  </a>\n  on StackOverflow but they usually assume you're tracing another process. If you want to trace the same process you're in, you can use the\n  <code>\n   ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME)\n  </code>\n  call.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
