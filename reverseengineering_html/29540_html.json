How can I do that?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know that, as per\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50709406/ltrace-and-gdb-attach-to-same-process\">\n   ltrace and gdb attach to same process\n  </a>\n  , you can't actually attach ltrace and gdb to the same process.  But, once a process is under gdb, it should be fairly straightforward to catch each lib call and print out its args and return vals, just like ltrace does.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In fact, it would be possible, and valuable, to go a step further: run gdb or gdb-peda, and print out\n  <em>\n   every\n  </em>\n  call (not just lib calls, with params and return val.  How can I do this?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
