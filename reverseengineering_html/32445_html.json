Sorry not sure if my terminology is correct but I have a reference in my file \"fp\" that is the memory offset and is shown like\n </p>\n <pre><code>ld24    fp, #0x808000\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  all of the references in the file show something like,\n </p>\n <pre><code>lduh    R0, @(-0x2700, fp)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  which make it difficult to link the memory addresses. If I press Ctrl-R I can correct these offsets in the file line by line but I would like a script that can do the whole file in one go if possible.\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yjDR7.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yjDR7.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  this gives me what I am looking for\n </p>\n <pre><code>lduh    R0, @((unk_805900 - unk_808000), fp)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Any help would be appreciated, thanks\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
