    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am learning IDA and currently working with the debugger. In particular, I want to automate the interaction with my remote binary (from Windows Subsystem Linux - Ubuntu 22.04 instance), like what I can did with\n  <code>\n   pwntools\n  </code>\n  . These interactions cover readline, sendline, etc. that can automate my interaction with the binary, and sometimes sending non-ASCII characters. Are there anyways that I can work on this? At current time, I already setup the remote debugging with\n  <code>\n   Remote Linux debugger\n  </code>\n  from IDA.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Probably there is no way to do this automation directly from IDA...\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
