APIs like Dyninst is very powerful in this area.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Using gcc-plugin: you can write your own gcc-plugin to add additional pass to gcc compiler. gcc-plugin is very powerful to do such works. However, you should read the internal architecture of gcc compiler and gcc-plugin API (headers file) to write a plugin.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Ptrace\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
