It looks like a LZ77 or LZSS compression but I just can't figure out how the length/offsets are calculated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example on the 3rd line you have \"me2a\" which should be decompressed to \"media\" but there is only a single byte used (0x32) that should contain both the marker bit(s), offset and length. I presume it's referring to the \"di\" from \"disks\" in the line above, but as stated, I just can't figure it out (yet).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The first C3 in the compressed part belongs to the clear text. The bytes seem to be the appr. last third of a fat32 master boot record. You may see the whole thing e.g.\n <a href=\"http://vsprog.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/vsf/tool/fakefat32/fakefat32.c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  here\n </a>\n or\n <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/fatftp/source/browse/FB.c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  here\n </a>\n . Maybe you have the compressed first part as well which may give further hints on the compression algo.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
