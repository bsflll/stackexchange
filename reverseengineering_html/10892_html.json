    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have encountered a quite obscure 32-bit ELF file (that is a crackme) and I still cannot figure out how can it execute. First, beside some \"understandable\" property that it has not any section:\n </p>\n <pre><code># readelf --sections SimpleVM\n\nThere are no sections in this file.\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Considering the segments:\n </p>\n <pre><code># readelf --segments SimpleVM\n\nElf file type is EXEC (Executable file)\nEntry point 0xc023dc\nThere are 2 program headers, starting at offset 52\n\nProgram Headers:\n  Type           Offset   VirtAddr   PhysAddr   FileSiz MemSiz  Flg Align\n  LOAD           0x000000 0x00c01000 0x00c01000 0x013c7 0x013c7 RWE 0x1000\n  LOAD           0x00019c 0x0804b19c 0x0804b19c 0x00000 0x00000 RW  0x1000\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I observe that the first segments\n  <code>\n   LOAD\n  </code>\n  has size\n  <code>\n   0x13c7\n  </code>\n  bytes, and mapped into memory at\n  <code>\n   0xc01000\n  </code>\n  ; the second one is not important because its size is zero. But, the entry point of the ELF file is at\n  <code>\n   0xc023dc\n  </code>\n  , that means outside any segment\n  <code>\n   LOAD\n  </code>\n  !!!\n </p>\n <p>\n  I use also IDA 6.8 (evaluation ver.) to load this file, and IDA says that the entry point is illegal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since the program has no\n  <code>\n   INTERP\n  </code>\n  segment, the first executed instruction must be at\n  <code>\n   0xc023dc\n  </code>\n  . But this address is outside any \"reliably\" mapped data, we cannot sure which instruction will be executed. I think that this ELF should have some random behaviors (e.g. it should be crashed usually), but it is not, it executes normally, without any crash.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So my question is: how can this happen?\n </p>\n <p>\n  NB1. In case of someone wants to look at this file, I give the link\n  <a href=\"https://app.box.com/s/xbyc5r7ladg8uvvr4plwcczkdiubqn3g/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"here\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  , but please do not give directly the solution. I want to handle it myself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  NB2. Using a Pintool to trace out what happens, I find the\n  <code>\n   OEP\n  </code>\n  of the program is at\n  <code>\n   0xc01dfa\n  </code>\n  since its trace is:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0xc023dc  mov dword ptr [0xc01bf0], 0x252e8 <=== modify address 0xc01bf0\n0xc023e6  jmp 0xc01bf0\n0xc01bf0  call 0xc01e47                     <=== modified instruction\n0xc01e47  pop ebp                           <=== OEP\n0xc01e48  call 0xc01dfa\n0xc01dfa  pop esi\n0xc01dfb  lea eax, ptr [ebp-0x9]\n0xc01dfe  mov edi, dword ptr [eax]\n0xc01e00  sub eax, edi\n0xc01e02  mov edx, eax\n0xc01e04  add eax, dword ptr [eax+0x48]\n0xc01e07  add eax, 0xfff\n0xc01e0c  and eax, 0xfffff000\n0xc01e11  push 0x1\n0xc01e13  push eax\n....\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But I still cannot understand why the instruction at\n  <code>\n   0xc023dc\n  </code>\n  is always\n  <code>\n   mov dword ptr [0xc01bf0], 0x252e8\n  </code>\n  (so the binary is somehow \"self-modified\")\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This won't be in the raw file.
