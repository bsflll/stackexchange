You can use a compilation switch such as\n  <code>\n   /Zi\n  </code>\n  to generate a PDB file with debugging information which can then be used by IDA to label your functions and variables in the disassembly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note that some information is lost anyway: comments, preprocess or definitions, or any code or data which has been optimized out and removed.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
