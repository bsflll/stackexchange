It lets you execute what they call \"ruleset\" and \"retrohunt\" searches which are basically running yara rules on every sample processed through virustotal and every sample from the last 3 months. This is a paid service but it's definitely worth it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's an image that shows the retro-hunt and yara search web UI:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/M2GGu.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"yara ruleset search example\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/M2GGu.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
