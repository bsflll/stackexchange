    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Last night I was extending functionality of HexRaysCodeXplorer - implemented feature to automatically rename duplicating variables. It needs some fixes to work well, but the problem I cannot cope with is - how to preserve lvar names?\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is how it works:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Before:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qZJUo.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     <img alt=\"Before\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qZJUo.png\"/>\n    </a>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    After:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BLaeM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     <img alt=\"After\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BLaeM.png\"/>\n    </a>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  These names do exist only till end of current Ida session.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have read about Ida's netnodes, but I don't think it's rational to store lvar names in this container and do renaming at the start of every session. I suspect there is some native way to preserve essential information (like in this case), but I cannot find it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Because I had to analyse c-tree, I used HexRays classes like:\n  <code>\n   ctree_visitor_t\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   cfuncptr_t\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   lvar_t\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

As I'm guessing your lvar name generation algorithm is not very computationally expensive, you can just regenerate them every time a function is decompiled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  (This is the approach used by my\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/contests/2013/#detox\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   CrowdDetox Hex-Rays plugin\n  </a>\n  .)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
