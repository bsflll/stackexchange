I rebased my program to 0x0, and did pretty much everything to set me up. However, when I call virtualprotect it doesn't work. I still get access violations when I inject the DLL. All helps appreciated!\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4NNCt.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"comprintf\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4NNCt.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Above, I have the address for the value. Heres how I'm calling virtualprotect:\n </p>\n <pre><code>typedef void(__cdecl* Com_printf)(const char* msg, ...);\n\nnamespace QLIVESDK \n{\n    void Com_Printf(const char* a1, ...)\n    {\n        DWORD old;\n        VirtualProtect((PVOID)(GetModuleHandle(\"quakelive_steam.exe\") + 0x000C9860), sizeof(a1), PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &old);\n        Com_printf com_print = (Com_printf)0x000C9860;\n        return com_print(a1);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena/blob/dbe4ddb10315479fc00086f08e25d968b4b43c49/code/qcommon/common.c#L143\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena/blob/dbe4ddb10315479fc00086f08e25d968b4b43c49/code/qcommon/common.c#L143\n  </a>\n  Heres the function I'm trying to reverse. And heres how I'm calling it:\n </p>\n <pre><code>void Init()\n{\n    QLIVESDK::Com_Printf(\"hello, world!\n\"); //test this shit\n}\n\nBOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpReserved)\n{\n    switch (fdwReason)\n    {\n    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:\n        CreateThread(0, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)Init, 0, 0, 0);\n        break;\n    }\n    return 1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  As you can see, its not working. I still get access violations. Thanks! All helps appreciated! :)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You're VirtualProtect-ing quakelive_steam.exe+0x000C9860 but then using just 0x000C9860 for the function pointer that you call. I would assume VirtualProtect worked to make the code writable and then the access violation is because address 0xc9860 isn't executable. Additionally in general you should check the return value and GetLastError codes for functions you think aren't working.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

So you used VirtualProtect on offset 0x000C9860 into quakelive_steam.exe but your com_print variable is JUST address 0x000C9860, which isn't what you VirtualProtect'd and probably not code (if it's there at all)\n</span>\n</body></html>",
