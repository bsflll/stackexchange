Yet, chances are that that pattern boils down to being a random OTP string of who-knows-what length. Personally, I can't\n  <em>\n   “feel”\n  </em>\n  any patterns by just looking at it… but you could check the obvious ones: keyed Vignere over a 256 byte base, etc.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
