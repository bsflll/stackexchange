However I can't seem to solve it, despite double checking everything and investing multiple hours.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My task is to reverse engineer the following functions to high-level C-code and determine the return value of\n  <code>\n   f(1,2,3)\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Given Task:\n  </strong>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Aunk6.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Task image\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Aunk6.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   This is my approach:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2P3uy.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"My approach image\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2P3uy.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   The problem:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   f(1,2,3)\n  </code>\n  can not be determined, because line 6 in\n  <code>\n   function f\n  </code>\n  results in a jump to\n  <code>\n   loc_56C\n  </code>\n  , where\n  <code>\n   g(2,3)\n  </code>\n  is called. In line 14\n  <code>\n   push dword ptr [ebp+0Ch]\n  </code>\n  is used, however only 2 parameter are supplied for\n  <code>\n   function g\n  </code>\n  at line 16 (8 Byte), meaning we do not know what lies on that memory location (12 Byte above base pointer). As a result, the return value can not be determined.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is it true, that\n  <code>\n   f(1,2,3)\n  </code>\n  can not be determined?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
