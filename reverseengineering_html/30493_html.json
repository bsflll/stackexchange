I have two rooted devices\n  <code>\n   Arm64\n  </code>\n  host device with Debian rootfs and the device to be debugged which contains the lldb-server binary\n  <code>\n   armv7\n  </code>\n  . I am trying to remote debug my android device using LLDB. I pulled the\n  <code>\n   lldb-server\n  </code>\n  binary from android ndk24 and put it in\n  <code>\n   /data/local/tmp\n  </code>\n  . Installed Debian sid on\n  <code>\n   another term\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   apt\n  </code>\n  installed\n  <code>\n   lldb\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I connected client device via wifi-hotspot (one with\n  <code>\n   lldb-server\n  </code>\n  ) using the host with the linux rootfs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The commands I ran on server device\n </p>\n <pre><code>./data/local/tmp/lldb-server platform --listen \"*:2000\"Â  --server\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Checked using\n  <code>\n   netstat\n  </code>\n  and the lldb-server had bound to all addresses(\n  <code>\n   0.0.0.0:2000\n  </code>\n  )\n </p>\n <p>\n  On host(client\n  <code>\n   lldb\n  </code>\n  ) device in\n  <code>\n   debian sid\n  </code>\n  terminal I ran:\n </p>\n <pre><code>apt install lldb\nlldb\nplatform select remote-android\nplatform connect connect://192.168.201.132:2000\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Then I got\n  <code>\n   error failed connect port\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, using\n  <code>\n   GDB\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   gdbserver\n  </code>\n  everything worked perfectly. I have tried installing\n  <code>\n   lldb\n  </code>\n  on\n  <code>\n   debian buster\n  </code>\n  but same result and even ran the\n  <code>\n   lldb-server\n  </code>\n  binary on the host(device with\n  <code>\n   debian sid\n  </code>\n  ) but same result. Right now I'm stuck here. How do I solve this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Edit\n  </strong>\n  Here is output of\n  <code>\n   telnet\n  </code>\n </p>\n <pre><code>root@localhost:~# telnet 192.168.43.1 2000\nTrying 192.168.43.1...\nConnected to 192.168.43.1.\nEscape character is '^]'.\nConnection closed by foreign host.\nroot@localhost:~# telnet 192.168.43.1 5555\nTrying 192.168.43.1...\nConnected to 192.168.43.1.\nEscape character is '^]'.\nKilled\nroot@localhost:~#\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And heres same network output from lldb.\n </p>\n <pre><code>lldb) platform select remote-android\n  Platform: remote-android\n Connected: no\n(lldb) platform connect connect;//192.168.43.1:2000\nerror: Invalid URL: connect;//192.168.43.1:2000\n(lldb) platform connect connect://192.168.43.1:2000\nerror: Failed to connect port\n(lldb)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And now I dont really know the problem. Should i try installing on a different rootfs? Let me do that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Edit 2\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Installed ubuntu focal and still got same results on lldb 10.0.0.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Especially Android Studio is known to be \"greedy\" establishing connections automatically in background and thus blocking other programs. Have you checked on the Android device if there is already a network connection?\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Just to be sure what happens if you try to connect to port 2000 using telnet instead of lldb?
