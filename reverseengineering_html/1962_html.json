    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Our team recently had to look at\n  <a href=\"http://www.sparc.com/standards/V8.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   SPARC assembly specifications\n  </a>\n  , the problem is that I do not have a SPARC processor to try things on it (I should set up a simulator or get one of these old Sparc station on my desk... I know).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Somehow, the\n  <code>\n   ba\n  </code>\n  (branch always) instruction puzzled me because it is a\n  <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPARC_Assembly/SPARC_Details#Delayed_Branch\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   delayed branch execution\n  </a>\n  instruction. This mean that the instruction located just\n  <strong>\n   after\n  </strong>\n  the\n  <code>\n   ba\n  </code>\n  get executed before the jump occurs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of my colleague raised a very interesting question, what does occur in this case:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0x804b38 ba 0x805a10\n0x804b3c ba 0x806844\n...\n0x805a10 add %r3, %r2, %r5\n...\n0x806844 sub %r3, %r5, %r2\n...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Our guess, following the specifications, is that the run should behave like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0x805a10 add %r3, %r2, %r5\n0x806844 sub %r3, %r5, %r2\n0x806848 ...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Which means that you can probably jump and pick up one instruction inside a block of others and run to the next\n  <code>\n   ba\n  </code>\n  ... I wonder what the CFG would look like.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Whatever, it was the \"\n  <em>\n   simple\n  </em>\n  \" case, what if we have dynamic jumps (the\n  <code>\n   jmp\n  </code>\n  instruction is like a\n  <code>\n   ba\n  </code>\n  but based on the address stored in the given register):\n </p>\n <pre><code>0x804b38 jmp %r3\n0x804b3c jmp %r0\n...\n(%r3)    change %r0\n...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Would it be a good way to mislead a static-analyzer ? Or, is there a way to have an easy computation to guess what it is doing ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

code\n </h2>\n <p>\n  First, I felt compelled to \"optimize\" the instructions in\n  <code>\n   LL6\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   LL9\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   LL5\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   LL8\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   LL11\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   LL1\n  </code>\n  like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>.LL6:\n        mov     3, %i0\n        b       .LL1\n         nop\n.LL9:\n

   mov     4, %i0\n.LL1:\n        ret\n        restore\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  It should be clear that if your colleague is right, we should be able to substitute the\n  <code>\n   nop\n  </code>\n  instructions for a\n  <code>\n   mov ..., %i0\n  </code>\n  to see something other than the expected value.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I called my modified assembly file\n  <code>\n   modified.s\n  </code>\n  so as to not confuse myself ;)\n </p>\n <h3>\n  Verifying my \"optimizations\"\n </h3>\n <p>\n  First test is with my \"optimizations only\". I wrote a little test script:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash\nfor i in optimized test; do\n        echo -n \"$i: \"; ./$i\n        echo -n \"$i: \"; ./$i a1\n        echo -n \"$i: \"; ./$i a1 a2\n        echo -n \"$i: \"; ./$i a1 a2 a3\ndone\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The binaries are called\n  <code>\n   optimized\n  </code>\n  (my \"optimizations\" from above) and\n  <code>\n   test\n  </code>\n  (plain assembly created by GCC from C code).\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Results:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ ./runtest\noptimized: Hello world: 1\noptimized: Hello world: 3\noptimized: Hello world: 4\noptimized: Hello world: 2\ntest: Hello world: 1\ntest: Hello world: 3\ntest: Hello world: 4\ntest: Hello world: 2\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So my \"optimizations\" seem to be just fine. Now let's tinker a little.\n </p>\n <h3>\n  Tinkering with the instructions which modify the program counter\n </h3>\n <p>\n  The claim is that anything past a\n  <code>\n   jmp\n  </code>\n  (i.e.\n  <code>\n   b\n  </code>\n  ) will get executed\n  <em>\n   before\n  </em>\n  the jump itself. We have several labels with jumps, so let's replace the\n  <code>\n   nop\n  </code>\n  in each with something that changes the value inside\n  <code>\n   %i0\n  </code>\n  and thus the return value of\n  <code>\n   foo()\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   The changes:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <pre><code>.LL6:\n        mov     3, %i0\n        b       .LL1\n        mov     30, %i0\n.LL9:\n        mov     -1, %i0\n        b       .LL1\n        mov     42, %i0\n.LL5:\n        mov     1, %i0\n        b       .LL1\n        mov     10, %i0\n.LL8:\n        mov     2, %i0\n        b       .LL1\n        mov     20, %i0\n.LL11:\n        mov     4, %i0\n.LL1:\n        ret\n        restore\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So except for return code\n  <code>\n   -1\n  </code>\n  (which becomes\n  <code>\n   42\n  </code>\n  ) and\n  <code>\n   4\n  </code>\n  (which stays the same) everything should now return the original value times ten.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Let's see the results (I added\n  <code>\n   modified\n  </code>\n  to the list of items in my\n  <code>\n   for\n  </code>\n  loop):\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ ./runtest\noptimized: Hello world: 1\noptimized: Hello world: 3\noptimized: Hello world: 4\noptimized: Hello world: 2\ntest: Hello world: 1\ntest: Hello world: 3\ntest: Hello world: 4\ntest: Hello world: 2\nmodified: Hello world: 10\nmodified: Hello world: 30\nmodified: Hello world: 4\nmodified: Hello world: 20\n</code></pre>\n <h1>\n  A change that is as close to your example as I can get it\n </h1>\n <pre><code>        mov     39, %i0\n        jmp     %g1\n        b       .LL11\n        b       .LL1\n.LL6:\n        mov     37, %i0\n        b       .LL1\n        mov     30, %i0\n[...]\n.LL11:\n        mov     4, %i0\n.LL1:\n        ret\n        restore\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Amending the test script, here's the output:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ ./runtest\noptimized: Hello world: 1\noptimized: Hello world: 3\noptimized: Hello world: 4\noptimized: Hello world: 2\ntest: Hello world: 1\ntest: Hello world: 3\ntest: Hello world: 4\ntest: Hello world: 2\nmodified: Hello world: 10\nmodified: Hello world: 30\nmodified: Hello world: 4\nmodified: Hello world: 20\nquestion: Hello world: 4\nquestion: Hello world: 4\nquestion: Hello world: 4\nquestion: Hello world: 4\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Baffling!\n </p>\n <h1>\n  Result\n </h1>\n <p>\n  You can play tricks on the reverse engineer's mind with this - no doubt.

It's basically an opaque predicate. I.e. the outcome is clear at compile time, but it looks like it's dynamic.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It's difficult to see how good different disassemblers cope, given that I only have IDA Pro and\n  <code>\n   objdump\n  </code>\n  available here. My educated guess would be that they cope the same as with other\n  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_predicate\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   opaque predicates\n  </a>\n  , i.e. sometimes they'll get fooled, sometimes they'll be surprisingly smart.
