    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I updated a device over a firmware update software and sniffed the whole traffic with wireshark. There is a TCP Stream with ~30MB which I exported as raw data. The resulting file is\n  <code>\n   Zip archived data\n  </code>\n  but it has a CRC error when I try to extract it with binwalk/7zip.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I also tried to export as hex dump and make\n  <code>\n   xxd -r -p dump outfile\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the pcap file are many\n  <code>\n   TCP DUP ACK\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   TCP Out-Of-Order\n  </code>\n  packets. \nI wonder if the exported binary takes over these dupes or out-of-order stuff.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I also tried\n  <code>\n   chaosreader -r dump.pcap\n  </code>\n  still corrupt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Extracting the .exe with 7zip failed also with checksum error.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any of you have any idea what I'm doing wrong?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
