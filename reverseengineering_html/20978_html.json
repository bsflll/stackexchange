Depending on the design of the owner of the binary you can find this types of techniques on them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example instead of do this\n </p>\n <pre><code>const char *msg = \"Good morning\";\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  You can do\n </p>\n <pre><code>const char *msg = \"R29vZCBtb3JtaW5nCg==\"; /* base64 of 'Good morning' */\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and on every use of msg you just call a base64 decode function and that's how works in a very basic environment. You can use RC4, Xor or any other encryption algorithm for hide the strings, but bear in mind that somebody with experience will find the way to decode the string\n </p>\n <pre><code>printf(\"My message is %s\n\", decode64(msg));\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
