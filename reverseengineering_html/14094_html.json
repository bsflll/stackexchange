    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am trying to become familiar with IDA by reversing a .bin file that I have compiled myself. The code is written in cpp and the open source code can be found here:\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/openxc/vi-firmware\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/openxc/vi-firmware\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Taking a look at the Makefile and linker files (in vi-firmware/src and vi-firmware/src/platform/lpc17xx/), you can see the Flash and RAM locations are called out in the comments. The microcontroller uses an LPC17xx (\n  <a href=\"http://vi.openxcplatform.com/electrical/design/microcontroller.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   http://vi.openxcplatform.com/electrical/design/microcontroller.html\n  </a>\n  ) with and ARM 7 architecture.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Therefore, when I load IDA, I select Binary file and set the Processor to ARM and Processor Options to ARM 7.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the next menu I configure the RAM and ROM according to the comments in vi-firmware/src/platform/lpc17xx/LPC17xx-bootloader.ld and then, after pressing OK, get  the dialogue box telling me to \"Please move to what you think is an entry point\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  I move 64KB (0x10000) into Flash (ROM) and hit 'C' to try to auto-analyse. Only a few lines translate to assembly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there anything else I can do here? I've combed the datasheet for the uC but haven't been able to find anything of use.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

As for the size: IDA <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/W58bu8j.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">barfs at you</a> when you specify a wrong (default?) size, so I just tried the same value as the RAM and it worked. As for the graph - I really only did what you see in the GIF. Define unknown bytes with <code>C</code>, make a function with <code>P</code>, press <code>Space</code>, done. e.g.: <code>0x132E0</code></span>",
