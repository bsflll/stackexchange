Being LocalSystem doesn't mean access everywhere, because that's still governed by the ACEs. However, being LocalSystem means you can forcibly take ownership of objects and basically replace whole ACLs. Other possibilities include some kind of SSDT hooking from a driver. Nebbett describesd how the ToolHelp32 APIs work and so by looking at the underlying native APIs you will get a feeling which ones could be hooked to prevent access.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
