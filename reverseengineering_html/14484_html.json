    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm having a rather difficult time determining what memory security settings need to be adjusted on a fresh install of Fedora 25 in order to perform basic buffer overflows in the C language. As a newbie, this has been the toughest to figure out. I have several books and have watched several tutorials but every single one either provides a CD of a specific Linux install, or a asks to set up a VM. Unfortunately, I've had a very tough time setting up a VM on Windows (many different errors, terrible performance, etc...) and my Linux box is old, probably far too old to have enough memory to VM.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That said,\n  <strong>\n   are there any OS settings that would by default prevent a buffer overflow from happening on a fresh Fedora 25 install?\n  </strong>\n  If so, which settings and how could I disable them? I've tried to perform an attack on my own program and the memory addresses are the same in gdb every time I run the program. Also,\n  <em>\n   I am able to cause a segmentation fault by overflowing the buffer properly (canaries are disabled in the file)\n  </em>\n  , however, when I try to execute a function by using nm [myfile] on the command line, and entering the address into the overflow, the function does not execute, instead, I get a seg fault at best. I am working with 64 bit programs here.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
