    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a small exe program that runs in a system32/cmd window, and when it is finished  running its small script it prompts the user to press enter to close.\n I want to simply have the application close once the process is finished wihtout having to enter a keystroke.  How can I edit .exe file to do this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there some line in HEX i can edit? What am I looking for?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In the later case, you can just try to patch a return-statement instead of the input-waiting-function or insert a jump.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/U9Cgr.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/U9Cgr.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  NOP-ing out the highlighted call did the trick.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   edit\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Special regards to w s for in-chat guidance!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
