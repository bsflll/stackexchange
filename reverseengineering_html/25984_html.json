If you want to find a function that edits your player health (and possibly find a static address of for example player class) you can just simply right click the address of health you found, then click\n  <code>\n   Find out what writes to this address\n  </code>\n  . All addresses (in the middle of some function) that written to your health will be listed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Xymoh.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Cheat Engine\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Xymoh.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can then copy the address that belongs to some function and inspect the function in for example Ghidra.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
