    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm disassembling a simple Z80 program and can't for the life of me work out how to - successfully - specify a user-defined offset.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have a line of code as:\n </p>\n <pre><code>ld de, #0x6058\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and FTR, this address lies outside the address range of defined segments, however my 'suspiciousness' range is set to $0000-$FFFF.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now I want to display this as the offset from an address label, ie.\n </p>\n <pre><code>ld de, #screen2-15424\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  where, FWIW, screen2 is the named address 0x9C98.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I try to change the operand to a user-defined offset, TYPE=OFF16, BASE=screen2 and DELTA=0 (target automatically calculated). However the result is the same (original) line but with 0x6058 in RED.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nothing I try seems to produce what I want, other than a MANUAL operand type which works but is prone to human error because there is no automatic check. What am I missing here? I would think that this is basic functionality that most people would want? The only examples I can find are complex C-code decompilations on Intel/ARM architecture.\n </p>\n <p>\n  TIA\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
