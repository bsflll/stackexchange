In the first type, all API function addresses are resolved before the main routine of the program begins. In the second, API function addresses are resolved individually at call-time. \nYou can read more about it from this\n  <a href=\"https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/a_museum_of_api_obfuscation_on_win32.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   paper\n  </a>\n  by Symantec.\nIf you want to \"see the code\" you would have to unpack it first.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For your second question there is a good discussion about it over\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16463498/how-do-you-register-unregister-an-exe-as-a-com-object-from-c\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

But since you already said you are working with ollydbg, step slowly into the code, look for functions which neither write file to disk or can be used to inject code to other process. For example writeprocessmemory than try to dump the PE with OllyDumpEx . But again, its a very long shot.   If you really want to learn how to deal with malware than I recommend the following book: <a href=\"https://www.nostarch.com/malware\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">nostarch.com/malware</a></span>",
