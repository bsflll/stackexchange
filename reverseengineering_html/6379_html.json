    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm currently reverse engineering a JSP applet running through JBoss. Decompiling the code it looks like there are a bunch of Logger.debug() calls in the code that aren't guarded. A quick read through the API and I didn't see where this output actually goes or if it's even accessible, but since I'm pretty new at REing Java stuff I figured being able to see the log messages being printed as the application is running would go a long way to figuring out code flow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there an easy way to read debug output from the running application? I saw JavaSnoop referenced in another Stack Exchange post and I'm probably going to explore that but I didn't know if there was an easier way. All I want to do for now is try to get a handle on how to interact with the parts of the application.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or if there's a better way to go about it that would be appreciated as well. What I'm looking at is a Java SE binary so tracing that to the servlets is the end goal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

For example, if the once-popular\n <code>\n  log4j\n </code>\n is being used, creating an XML file might be all that's neccesary. (\n <a href=\"http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html\n </a>\n ). Tracing JBoss with\n <code>\n  ProcMon\n </code>\n (on Windows) or\n <code>\n  strace -efile\n </code>\n (on Linux) or\n <code>\n  truss\n </code>\n (on Solaris) might even give you the name of a logger configuration file it's trying to access when starting.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
