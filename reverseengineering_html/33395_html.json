The first 4 bytes of that footer always seem to be zero, and are probably superfluous, while the remaining 64 bytes appear to be totally random.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've played around with\n  <code>\n   openssl dgst -sign -sha256\n  </code>\n  and other OpenSSL CLIs, but can't get anything that matches even the format of the expected output. Can anyone suggest any signature schemes that would take an EC key and generate a 64- or 68-byte signature, that I should investigate?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
