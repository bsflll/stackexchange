And if you want to see what is writes you will have to have where the pointers are stored for the function in question.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This has a lot to do with calling conventions,\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6511096/cdecl-or-stdcall-on-windows\">\n   cdecl and stdcall\n  </a>\n  and knowing about them is important for this..\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am going to try to explain using the writeFile function.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  How does WriteFile Work\n </h2>\n <p>\n  First we look at the WriteFile declaration (taken from\n  <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365747(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   MSDN\n  </a>\n  )\n </p>\n <pre><code>BOOL WINAPI WriteFile(\n  _In_         HANDLE hFile,\n  _In_         LPCVOID lpBuffer,\n  _In_         DWORD nNumberOfBytesToWrite,\n  _Out_opt_    LPDWORD lpNumberOfBytesWritten,\n  _Inout_opt_  LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped\n);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now when we assume that Windows has stdcall (win32api has). We can figure out where we can find the variables. (for more about the stdcall see\n  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#stdcall\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Wikipedia\n  </a>\n  ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Due to our wikipedia article we a few things:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The parameters are pushed onto the stack in right-to-left order\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Registers EAX, ECX, and EDX are designated for use within the function.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Return values are stored in the EAX register.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   stdcall is the standard calling convention for the Microsoft Win32 API.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <h2>\n  This is great\n </h2>\n <p>\n  Now we have everything we need to figure out where we can find the location of the information you need.\nWhen a breakpoint is placed on the function call you'll know that all the variables are stored on the stsck. LPCVOID is a Pointer, all that is left is to follow it and read the data.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
