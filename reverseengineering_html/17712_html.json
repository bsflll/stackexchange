If you change part of the program, the compiler may change different parts of the program that you did not modify. The two most accessible examples are functions called by the function you modified, and functions that call the modified function. In both cases, your changes to one function might result in the compiler manufacturing a different calling convention for any of the functions just mentioned, or the compiler may perform something along the lines of interprocedural common subexpression elimination. Then there are other optimizations like profile-guided ones that might drastically change the binary, although you'll know if you're using profile-guided optimizations, which it seems very strongly like you aren't.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
