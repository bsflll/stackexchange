    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Well another weekend has gone by and my tinkering has caused another device to (potentially) bite the dust. I've been playing around with a couple of Slingboxes, an M1 and a 500. Today was the M1. I had taken it apart (quite easily!) and poked around with my continuity and voltage probes with results as below for a few locations (see image).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gnd means continuity existed between the tested part & the metal shield. The voltage in yellow is the voltage while it was plugged in. The spot in the upper left has a voltage that fluctuates somewhat erratically esp earlier on in the booting process.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"front panel with labels\" src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23091/m1/front.jpg\"/>\n  <em>\n   full size image at\n   <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23091/m1/front.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23091/m1/front.jpg\n   </a>\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I hooked up a serial to usb and ran minicom on the \"chatty\" one noted towards the top left.. and got a bunch of garbled garbage. Ran\n  <a href=\"https://code.google.com/archive/p/baudrate/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   baud rate\n  </a>\n  and it cycled thru various baud settings but didn't find anything that made sense.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"baud rate\" src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23091/m1/baudrate.png\"/>\n  and so on. Tried the other ports as labeled, and nothing else had any \"chatter\" on minicom.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any thoughts?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Update\n  </strong>\n  Well I started touching the read probe on various other points on the board. One chip on the right generated a few (but not lots) of random looking data. And as I was touching a the prongs of the chip on the left above the smaller shield, the LEDs on the board turned off and it stopped generating any output. Sad. It won't turn back on or do anything at this point. Can that happen just from touching two pins on a chip?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any ideas how to repair this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pretending I didn't fry the board, any ideas on what I could've done differently with minicom?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

However, there are ways to fry a board:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    static electricity. Every instruction to insert a PCI card in your computer comes with a warning about that, and there is a reason. However, i found computers quite resilient; probably it's cheaper for manufacturers to build some ESD protection into their mainboards than to handle the complaints and returns of 16 year old kids who fried their hardware. But it's reasonable to expect hardware that's not intended to be opened to be more prone to this kind of vulnerability.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    reversed polarity - some chips are very sensitive to having a pin connected to a voltage lower than their ground level, and some circuits use positive and negative voltages resp. ground. I wouldn't expect these in the digital parts of a device though.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    short-circuits - it's very easy to slip and have your probe connect two neighboring pins together. Short-circuting an output pin with Gnd (or Vcc) has a good chance to fry the chip when it temporarily generates too much heat.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  So, yes, this can happen, and short of identifying replacing the broken chip, there's no way to repair this. (Well, if you're lucky, you could just blow a fuse, but your board doesn't look like it has any fuses).  And in 99% of the cases replacing the board will be cheaper than the labour involved in repairing it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To test if a signal is really a serial signal, I typically use a scope. They don't cost you an arm and a leg these days; the one I currently use is\n  <a href=\"http://www.sainsmart.com/sainsmart-dds-140-40m-200m-s-virtual-oscilloscope-signal-generator.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   this\n  </a>\n  . (I have no affiliation with them except being a satisfied customer). To qualify as a serial signal, your signal should have sharp, straight vertical edges, and the time between two raising edges will be very constant. From this time, you can determine the baud rate (for example, ~100 Âµs between edges => ~1 ms per 10-bit-byte (8 bits + start bit + stop bit) => 1000 bytes per second => probably 9600 baud).\n </p>\n <p>\n  My answer to\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/12523/routers-serial-port-only-outputs-garbage/12525#12525\">\n   this\n  </a>\n  question shows what is most probably\n  <em>\n   not\n  </em>\n  a serial signal; this is what a serial signal looks like (\n  <a href=\"http://www.interworldna.com/pico/usb3_scope_logic_analyser.php#tabs-4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   source\n  </a>\n  ):\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/S2VCx.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/S2VCx.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

With nowadays chips some pins runs on very specific voltage ranges and even a high impedance probes can blow them up if connected to wrong voltage. This is usually concerning ADC and semi analog pins of modern\n    <strong>\n     MCU\n    </strong>\n    's. They should be protected by transils and or diodes but often the costs are reduced and protection omitted.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Also always be careful even with\n    <strong>\n     GND\n    </strong>\n    to\n    <strong>\n     GND\n    </strong>\n    connections even between galvanicaly \"sealed\" devices (sometimes you forgot shield and then the fun starts).\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     Ground connection\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Many of the nowadays chips have their pins short-circuited to the\n    <strong>\n     GND\n    </strong>\n    to protect them during power off or inactive state so measuring to\n    <strong>\n     GND\n    </strong>\n    resistance is usually not enough. Much safer is to follow the\n    <strong>\n     PCB\n    </strong>\n    paths if visible.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     Poking around\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If I need to \"Poke around\" the first thing I do is get all the significant or known\n    <strong>\n     IC\n    </strong>\n    numbers and find their datasheet or at least pinout (for those I can). Then find where the power pins are (\n    <strong>\n     Shield,GND,Vcc,Vddio,...\n    </strong>\n    ) and locate the\n    <strong>\n     PCB\n    </strong>\n    power paths so I know where to avoid short-circuit by miss placing probe (as I am clumsy).\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Only then I will locate pins I need. For example you want serial port then find the\n    <strong>\n     IC\n    </strong>\n    capable of serial transmition and check the pins capable of them only. Oscilloscope is the way because you will see directly if it is digital or analog signal what is the baudrate etc instead of guessing... But I know not everyone has a decent oscillosope (like me 15 years ago) But usually some friend has one or in work/school usually you need just to ask... Anyway I was not that lucky at that time so I do SW oscilloscope using soundcard instead link to the win32 apps and description can be found here:\n   </p>\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/21658139/2521214\">\n      plotting real time Data on (qwt )Oscillocope\n     </a>\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n   <p>\n    Anyway you would need to make some sort of probe\n    <strong>\n     HW\n    </strong>\n    (voltage divider and or amplifier and may be some protection) to make it work with your soundcard safely.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    If you want something really simple and stupid instead use 2 anti-parallel connected\n    <strong>\n     LED\n    </strong>\n    s to see if you got alternating signal (they should both glowing in such case).\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     serial communication\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    There are many protocols and even voltage encoding for serial communication these days and simple\n    <strong>\n     RS232\n    </strong>\n    listener can be used only if:\n   </p>\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     voltage levels are in\n     <strong>\n      RS232\n     </strong>\n     range\n     <code>\n      (+/-15V)\n     </code>\n     usually works on\n     <code>\n      (+/-5V)\n     </code>\n     for some\n     <strong>\n      IC\n     </strong>\n     s but it is not guaranteed.
