    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I made a mistake when trying to import some additional binary data into one of my long-time IDA databases. I unintentionally overwrote some empty RAM space, so I tried reverting it back to \"space\" by undefining or converting the imported code to data. But no such luck - the regions are now filled with thousands of \".byte 0\" lines instead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The database has a ton of comments and renamed variables/functions and I would rather not start over from scratch just to fix this, so is there any other way I can undo this silly mistake? I'm still pretty new to IDA so I hope a potentially dumb question is forgiven here.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I use IDA 6.1 if that changes anything.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
