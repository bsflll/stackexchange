If that's the case, then simply zeroing those two bytes should result in a successful decompression using the standard tool.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    The other is that it's a (proprietary) modification to the normal LZ77 decompression, in which case, it's likely to be a minor enhancement rather than a completely new scheme.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  All of the samples of that camera's firmware that I was easily able to locate on the internet use the standard\n  <code>\n   00 00 00 09\n  </code>\n  tag, which may indicate that the first possibility is the more likely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After checking with the binary you mentioned, it became clear that there was simply an error in the\n  <code>\n   bfc.c\n  </code>\n  file.  Specifically, around line 192 of\n  <code>\n   bfc.c\n  </code>\n  it says:\n </p>\n <pre><code>if( command == 'd' )\n{\n    /* Read header */\n    algo = ReadWord32( f );  /* Dummy */\n    algo = ReadWord32( f );\n    outsize = ReadWord32( f );\n    insize -= 12;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However, this is incorrect because it fails to read the\n  <code>\n   infile\n  </code>\n  size as written in the header.  To quickly fix this, just change those lines to these and recompile:\n </p>\n <pre><code>if( command == 'd' )\n{\n    /* Read header */\n    algo = ReadWord32( f );  /* Dummy */\n    algo = ReadWord32( f );\n    outsize = ReadWord32( f );\n    ReadWord32( f );\n    insize -= 16;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  When I do that, there is no problem decompressing the code.  To make the corresponding change to the output file (that is, compressing), change the code around line 364 of\n  <code>\n   bfc.c\n  </code>\n  from this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>/* Write output file */\nWriteWord32( outsize, f );\nfwrite( out, outsize, 1, f );\nfclose( f );\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  to this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>/* Write output file */\nfwrite( out, outsize, 1, f );\nfclose( f );\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I should probably mention the likely reason this change was done.  In the original program, the file size can be used to determine the size, but in an undifferentiated array of bytes (i.e. no file system) as is often the case in ROM, it is useful to encode both input and output files sizes within the header.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
