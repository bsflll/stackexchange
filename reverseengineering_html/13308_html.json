    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm working on a reverse engineering project with fat executables on OS X. So far I have established the structure of the\n  <code>\n   fat_header\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   fat_arch\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   macho_header\n  </code>\n  , but am having trouble finding documentation about the ordering of the\n  <code>\n   fat_arch\n  </code>\n  sections. Right now my project works by assuming that\n  <code>\n   fat_arch\n  </code>\n  sections appear in order of ascending offset fields. Is this assumption correct, or can the\n  <code>\n   fat_arch\n  </code>\n  sections appear in any order?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The question is why would you expect a fixed order of\n  <code>\n   fat_arch\n  </code>\n  sections?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The kernel simply loads the Universal Binary at execution time, parses the\n  <code>\n   fat_arch\n  </code>\n  structure(s) and selects a matching architecture type. So in my understanding there is no need for a fixed (or expectable) order of the\n  <code>\n   fat_arch\n  </code>\n  sections.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
