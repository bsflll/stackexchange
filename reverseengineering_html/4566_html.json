Something like 001B5355 from which i know that it is an address. \nHow would I represent it then? Maybe use something like a pointer which would point to 001B5355 ?\n </p>\n <pre><code>  UnknownType *immediatePointer = &001B5355;\n\n  UnknownType *pointerEAX = *immediatePointer;\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I need help because the whole assembly code of the .exe consists of that kind of lines and I do not know how to represent it to imagine how it could implement it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
