In Windows 10 the flashing task bar buttons appear in all desktops, and it's just maddening when focusing on a work on another virtual desktop. Not a feature I want. The above messages are sent to Task switcher in explorer.exe, if I can prevent them being handled I can beat this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've wealth of knowledge about the WndProc which I want to see, and modify from Spy++, following windows are Property Inspector of Spy++ (64 bit version):\n </p>\n <p>\n  (Note: the 32bit version of Spy++ does not show Window Proc at all, just\n  <code>\n   (Unavailable)(Unicode)\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/k5L8n.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Window Proc address?\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/k5L8n.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OiDsN.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Thread ID\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OiDsN.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  And in x64dbg I have the thread open:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DZN8w.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"x64dbg open on the same thread\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DZN8w.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  But I just can't figure out how can I find the Window Proc in x64dbg?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
