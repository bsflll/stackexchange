    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to debug an application that reads the Parent Process Id(PPID), to check if the application is being debugged. It expects the PPID to be the PID of explorer.exe, if it isn't, it quits.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To bypass this, I wrote a pycommand script. This script breaks at the end of (and before the pops and ret) Process32NextW and Process32FirstW. Below is the hook I'm using:\n </p>\n <pre><code>class Process32NextWHook(LogBpHook):\n\ndef __init__(self):\n    LogBpHook.__init__(self)\n    return\n\ndef run(self, regs):\n    imm = immlib.Debugger()\n\n    # Get the Out_ LPPROCESSENTRY32 lppe\n    PROCESSENTRY32 = regs[\"EBP\"] + 16\n\n    # Get the DWORD th32ParentProcessID\n    target_ppid = PROCESSENTRY32 + 24\n\n    # Get the DWORD th32ProcessID\n    target_pid = imm.readMemory(PROCESSENTRY32 + 12, 4)\n\n    # Get the debugged process id\n    self_pid = imm.getDebuggedPid()\n\n    # If the target pid matches our pid\n    if int(target_pid.encode(\"HEX\"), 16) == self_pid:\n        # Set our ppid to the pid of explorer.exe\n        imm.writeMemory(target_ppid, explorer_pid)\n        imm.log(\"[*] patch_ppid patched ppid!!\")\n\n    return\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However the\n </p>\n <pre><code>if int(target_pid.encode(\"HEX\"), 16) == self_pid:\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Is never true.\nMy guess is that I use the wrong offsets, but I don't know what the right offsets would be. I could simply patch out the anti-debug measure, but that wouldn't be much of a learning experience.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
