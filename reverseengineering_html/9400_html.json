And as he said, they're internal functions and thus not publicly documented. However, that doesn't mean we can't find the code behind these functions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can download the Intel Fortran Compiler from\n  <a href=\"https://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers/try-buy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers/try-buy\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can then extract the\n  <code>\n   .obj\n  </code>\n  files from the\n  <code>\n   IFCORE\n  </code>\n  library to find the code behind the functions you listed above. For example, the code for\n  <code>\n   for__key_desc_test_item()\n  </code>\n  is in\n  <code>\n   for_desc_item.obj\n  </code>\n  in\n  <code>\n   libifcore.lib\n  </code>\n  :\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"libifcore.lib\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wWcfY.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Decompiling with\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/decompiler/index.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Hex-Rays\n  </a>\n  yields:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"for__desc_test_item\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZO0mW.png\"/>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
