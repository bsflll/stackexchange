    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Suppose you've never done reverse engineering before (apart from taking apart already-broken tape recorders). Also suppose you had a machine as pictured below, with a serial-looking and another multi-pin connector on the back. Thirdly, suppose you wanted to use this console as a computer input, hoping to gain control of more than just the keyboard part (it's got a trackball, a hefty jog/cue wheel, rotary dials, blinkenlights, and a two-line character VFD display).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lastly, suppose you\n  <em>\n   don't\n  </em>\n  have access to any technical specifications! No user manual, no installation guide, no service manual, not even a crappy nth-generation photocopy of the pin-outs. The company no longer exists, and the archive of their web site is of no help. Pretty much all I have is that this console runs on \"90-264V\" and draws \"<42W\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the plus side, I (used to) know the operation of this console very well. For instance, I can tell you it's got no real brains --\n  <em>\n   that\n  </em>\n  is in a separate computer,\n  <em>\n   this\n  </em>\n  is merely the controller for it. The main computer costs thousands, and anyway is purpose-built and not useful as a general computing device (I don't think this runs a regular operating system \"behind the scenes\", at least I could recognize no tell-tale signs from the boot sequence, file system naming, or something like that).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am confident that I could surely figure out the main power pins based on the red and black wires going to that Molex connector ... but the rest of those pins? All that functionality? I don't even know where to start.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am a programmer by trade, I'm pretty good with my hands, including competency with a soldering iron and a multimeter. I don't have (access to) an oscilloscope, signal analyzer, or any such fanciness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A few hints for me? Is this even doable?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lyrtm.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Accom Axial editing console\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lyrtm.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2YCqc.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"connectors on the back\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2YCqc.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/84v0t.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"back side off mode\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/84v0t.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   EDIT:\n  </strong>\n  By the way, these are the chassis: The Display chassis on top of the Comms chassis (neither of which I have, or plan to acquire).\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wGj6N.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Display and Comms chassis\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wGj6N.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You'll have to\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/devttys0/baudrate/blob/master/baudrate.py\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   figure out some of the serial port parameters such as rate, parity, etc,\n  </a>\n  but this should get you going.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fsZow.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fsZow.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
