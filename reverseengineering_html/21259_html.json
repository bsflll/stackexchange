    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am getting started with Ghidra, and am decompiling a simple program of mine. The platform is Linux (ELF) on ARM. I found in the decompiled code things like:\n </p>\n <pre><code>gTime._0_4_ = (undefined4)(time1 >> 0x20);\ngTime._4_4_ = (undefined4)time1;\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Here,\n  <code>\n   gTime\n  </code>\n  is a global and\n  <code>\n   time1\n  </code>\n  a local. Both should be 64 bit integers (\n  <code>\n   uint64_t\n  </code>\n  ). I've alreads set the types accordingly. This code is setting the high bits of\n  <code>\n   gTime\n  </code>\n  to the high bits of\n  <code>\n   time1\n  </code>\n  and the same for the low bits. Is there any way I could transform this to:\n </p>\n <pre><code>gTime = time1\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Or is there e.g. an endianness issue here? At some places, it also has the similarly redundant:\n </p>\n <pre><code>uVar1 = CONCAT44(gTime, gTime._4_4)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I was expecting to be able to select the code and \"refactor\" it to an equivalent form. The only thing that I could find was the \"retype\" function, with works great, but not here. Any ideas how to clean up this code a bit?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
