BTW,\n  <kbd>\n   Alt-Left\n  </kbd>\n  and\n  <kbd>\n   Alt-Right\n  </kbd>\n  are handy keyboard shortcuts to jump back and forth through visited locations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a even simpler navigation double-click on\n  <code>\n   XREF[4]\n  </code>\n  to open a window that lists all references. By (single-)clicking on an entry of this list, the CodeBrowser will jump to that location.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
