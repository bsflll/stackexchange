That being said from my research every last name matching will have the exact same code here. For example, the last name of Smith will always be 778 (or S5778 if you include L & X). If you have access to a number of DL #'s and can pick out a large number of Last name's with their designated codes, you will over time be able to properly track the full driver's license combination.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     FFF is a numeric encoding of the first name.\n    </strong>\n    It follows a similar coding to the first name 3 digits, however, is a totally separate string of numbers. From my research I have found that these 3 numbers will also always be the same on a driver's license of someone matching the same first name. If you have access to collect a large number of first names you will be able to connect those with the collected last name code in order to guess the full proper driver's license # values.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     M is a numeric encoding of the middle name (See Chart 2 below)\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     YY is the last 2 digits of year of birth\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     MM is the month of birth, ranges 01-12 for males, 51-62 for females (add 50 to the month for females)\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     DD is the day of birth\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     Chart 1\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     0 - A\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     1 - B,C,D\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     2 - E\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     3 - F,G,H\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     4 - I,J,K\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     5 - L,M,N\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     6 - 0\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     7 - P,Q,R\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     8 - S,T\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     9 - U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     Chart 2\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     1 - A\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     2 - C,D\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     3 - E,F,\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     4 - G,H,\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     5 - J,K,\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     6 - L,M,N\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     7 - P,Q,R\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     8 - S,T,\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     9 - W\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     0 - Y,Z,\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   I still have not found where B,I,O,U,V, or X falls on this chart.

Also, I will mention that if a license has no middle name, the 9th digit is always a 0.\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I guess at this point I am looking for some additional direction on how digits 3-8 are calculated using an actual formula instead of tracking all possible outcomes as I come across them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On a side note if anyone needs some explanation on how to decode Quebec License #'s I have some additional information available.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
