I've managed to use it for a router that uses the same encryption key (ZXHN H267A V1.0) and the re-encrypted file seems byte-perfect.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It's not instantly obvious (at least with this particular key), but the answer is quite simple: RouterPassView gives you the key's hex representation, whereas zcu wants it in plain text. If you\n  <a href=\"http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/hexadecimal/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   convert\n  </a>\n  the key you wrote into text you get:\n  <code>\n   402c38de39bed665\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Btw, since I saw people ask for the config.bin, before you share it, keep in mind that the file probably contains a bunch of sensitive info (passwords used by the router and potentially your phone number if it supports VoIP).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Good luck, have fun!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
