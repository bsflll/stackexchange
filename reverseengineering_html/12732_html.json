    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have an interesting application that seems to crash whenever a particular region of memory is read using\n  <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680553(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   ReadProcessMemory\n  </a>\n  . I know it's not doing anything special with RPM because:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Injecting a DLL to read that region of memory directly also causes a crash.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Scanning regions with applications like\n   <a href=\"http://www.cheatengine.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    CheatEngine\n   </a>\n   also causes a crash.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  It's also not a guard region or a region with special protection flags. It's just a private R+W region.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At first I thought they were installing hardware data breakpoints like those described\n  <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/28071/Toggle-hardware-data-read-execute-breakpoints-prog\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  , but after checking the debug registers of all threads and seeing that they were all zero made me conclude that another technique is used.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I suspect that they are somehow raising an exception whenever that piece of memory is read. I'm looking to understand what they're doing and how to detect it, or at the very least, make RPM not crash the application.\n </p>\n <p>\n  P.S. I cannot attach a debugger to this application, and the executable is encrypted, but I do know that various TLS callbacks are used along with VEH exception handlers.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

And it's a lot simpler than I thought, and actually pretty cool.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Basically, they allocate some pages with no physical backing until the page is accessed. This means that any access whatsoever (even in kernel mode) will validate the page, thus allowing the application to see that the page has been validated and promptly crash the game.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To avoid this, you can use\n  <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684949(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   QueryWorkingSetEx\n  </a>\n  or\n  <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn957452(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   NtQueryVirtualMemory\n  </a>\n  and if the \"valid\" property of the returned structure is zero, then you probably shouldn't be reading that page.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can't say for certain that this is the correct answer, but it fits my analysis. If anybody has more information on this technique, specifically how to implement it with something like\n  <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366887(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   VirtualAlloc\n  </a>\n  , I would love to learn more.\n </p>\n <p>\n  P.S. The application doesn't appear to have any kernel mode access whatsoever, it's just a regular user mode application.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   EDIT:\n  </strong>\n  Sample C++ implementation can be found\n  <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/dkrutsko/d6118638b0ef711b30bfcfe5b083d067\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Maybe there's an inline hook that stops you.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Using ARK tools like PCHunter can search hooks in your system easily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And I don't think that the application can detect RPM in user mode. In fact, to detect RPM, either hooking NtReadVirtualMemory or hooking the system page fault handler is need. What's more, even if the page is protected with PAGE_NO_ACCESS, the application shouldn't crash.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I suspect that there is kernel mode hooking.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
