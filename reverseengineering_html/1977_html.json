    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm interested in debugging and monitoring a Windows Phone 8 application for which I do not have the source code. Android and iOS can both be rooted/jailbroken, which allows me to use tools like GDB (and others) to debug and monitor a running application, but I'm not aware of anything similar for Windows Phone 8.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Additionaly I want to monitor filesystem activity while running the application (I use\n  <a href=\"http://www.newosxbook.com/src.jl?tree=listings&file=3-filemon.c\">\n   Filemon for iOS\n  </a>\n  for this task on iOS). Or is it easier to simply run the application in the Windows Phone 8 simulator and attempt to monitor the app that way?\n </p>\n <p>\n  How do you debug a Windows Phone 8 application without source code?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You might be able to somehow get the keys out of the operating system but that would be difficult as well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is a set of slides on the topic:\n  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/AndreyChasovskikh/inspection-of-windows-phone-applications\">\n   Inspection of Windows Phone Applciations\n  </a>\n  that goes into some detail about tangerine.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
