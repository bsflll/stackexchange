    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I want to export the symbol addresses from all loaded modules in x64dbg. I know I can do this DLL-by-DLL from the Symbols tab (click on one module > right click in table > Copy > Export Table), but I want to do all of them at once. It doesn't matter if they're exported it one big file, or one file per module.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can't find any command that does this. Have I missed one?\n  <code>\n   labellist\n  </code>\n  only shows labels I've defined myself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried exporting the database, which is easily parseable JSON, but I don't see labels from system DLLs there, only labels in the main EXE module. This seemed promising but is missing the key info I want.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
