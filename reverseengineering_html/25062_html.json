Is there a way to efficiently do this in one go in IDA ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  So far I found out that I can do it by setting a default segment register value, but that apparently works only for segments that do not have any set T value (and IDA seems to set a value by default).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I also found out that I can modify the T register for a specific section through the Segment Register Value window (alt+G to open it), which indeed has the effect that I want, but it going to take months to do it one by one to all sections.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you have many wrong intermediate changepoints from previous analysis, you can delete them en masse from the \"Jump to segment register...\" dialog (\n  <kbd>\n   Ctrl-G\n  </kbd>\n  ).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
