One of the problems is that the transformation of source code to the binaries which run on the platform is rarely without information loss. This means that it's usually impossible to reconstruct the source code from the binaries. Also you can't really redistribute your changed OS due to copyright which is what\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   free software\n  </a>\n  is all about. What is normally done is that people reverse engineer the internals of closed source operating systems and then document how these systems work internally. Someone else then takes this specification and creates a re-implementation of the described system. This is called the\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean-room_reverse_engineering#Reverse_engineering\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Chinese wall\n  </a>\n  or\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   clean room\n  </a>\n  implementation. This is done due to copyright issues so that the person who has seen the code doesn't deliberately or accidentally create code with large similarities to the original code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A good example of this process is\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReactOS\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   ReactOS\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_(software)\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Wine\n  </a>\n  . Both projects collaborate quite extensively and aim to create a free compatible implementation of the inner workings of Windows.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some systems are deliberately protected from being modified by use of cryptographic signatures. The iPhone and iOS is one such platform. The way the software is usually protected is by establishing a secure boot chain with a ROM which validates the integrity of the next boot step and each subsequent step then validates the signatures of each following step. This creates a chain of software which can't be changed in ways the manufacturer doesn't intend. It's a common way of fighting piracy on closed platforms. In fact it's a common way of making use of free software while avoiding the problem of having people able to run arbitrary code on their hardware. This is generally referred to as\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoization\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Tivoization\n  </a>\n  after the locked down TiVo system which makes extensive use of GPL software yet can't run user created code without bypassing the security mechanisms of the system.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
