    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I want to find all peripherals used by firmware dumped from embedded device. I loaded SVD file to add registers into memory map. Now I can find a peripheral in the memory region and check if there are any references to that peripheral.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there any way to find all references for given memory region at once to find all peripherals that are used? Preferably to multiple memory regions, since svd-loader script for ghidra groups peripherals into multiple memory regions.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
