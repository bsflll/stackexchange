I've been piecing together details on how to achieve this but I'm missing some key points.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Following instructions from devttys0 and their great blog, used binwalk to unpack the firmware.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Following some details picked up from this previous question [\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/4480/emulate-tp-link-wr740n-with-qemu]\">\n   Emulate TP-LINK WR740N with QEMU\n  </a>\n  I've attempted to bot using the Malta debian kernel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The issue I've had with the previous question was that there was never a final example of the arguments supplied to Qemu.\n </p>\n <pre><code>qemu-system-mips -M malta -kernel '/media/sf__share/vmlinux-2.6.32-5-4kc-malta' -nographic -append \"init=/sbin/init root=/dev/sda console=ttyS0,115200\" -hda 'myFileSystem.img'\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  as well as (init=/bin/sh):\n </p>\n <pre><code>qemu-system-mips -M malta -kernel '/media/sf__share/vmlinux-2.6.32-5-4kc-malta' -nographic -append \"init=/bin/sh root=/dev/sda console=ttyS0,115200\" -hda 'myFileSystem.img'\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  In almost all cases I get:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Warning: unable to open an initial console.\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I'm happy to accept some pointers on what I might be missing?\n </p>\n <p>\n  My objective is to create an emulated MIPS Linux instance with the rootfs extracted from the firmware image.
