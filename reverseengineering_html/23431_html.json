    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm new to Ghidra so go easy on me. Running it on Windows.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After successfully extracting a Bluetooth door lock's firmware from a nRF51, I proceeded to decompile it using Ghidra. My aim is to able to read some of its original source code, even though I understand it won't be as clean as the original.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But, after analyzing the bin file, I get tons of error. Architecture used/tried to solve this issue was both the ARM Cortex LE 32 bit and the ARM v6 LE 32 bit. Looked for solutions on the internet and I did not find anyone with the same issue. All of the errors are\n  <code>\n   Bad Instruction\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's pictures of two different analyze:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Without ARM Aggressive Instruction Finder (Prototype)\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5Ipa2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5Ipa2.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  With ARM Aggressive Instruction Finder (Prototype)\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n6tM7.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n6tM7.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The reason I posted two pictures of my code browser because those two different analysis gave me different amount of bookmark. I know it's because of the Instruction Finder but who knows this might help you to help me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have also tried adding a line into my\n  <code>\n   ia.sinc\n  </code>\n  file as suggested by a user named\n  <em>\n   nsadeveloper789\n  </em>\n  on a\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues/22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   GitHub issue\n  </a>\n  but it did not solve my issue. I have also tried the\n  <code>\n   No Return\n  </code>\n  method from a\n  <a href=\"https://initrd.net/stuff/ghidra/GhidraDocs/GhidraClass/Advanced/improvingDisassemblyAndDecompilation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   PDF lesson\n  </a>\n  (page 11) and no luck as well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Did used SVD-Loader as well but still doesn't solve the issue as the SVD-Loader's script itself might have an issue and I've commented on this issue on GitHub (currently no specific solution). You can have a look at this issue\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/leveldown-security/SVD-Loader-Ghidra/issues/1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does anyone knows how to solve this issue? I've been trying for a week or two now and even asked this in the unofficial Ghidra's Discord group but no answer yet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Looking forward for your answers. Thanks in advance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's a link to download the bin file:\n  <a href=\"https://filebin.net/5abhimciwdfr5gfi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://filebin.net/5abhimciwdfr5gfi\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
