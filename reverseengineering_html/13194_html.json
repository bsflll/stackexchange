    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I had some fun using IDA Pro Dalvik Debugger in the past using AVD emulator. \nHowever I stumbled upon a APK that somehow does not run well inside AVD. APK runs fine on a real device so I am trying to use IDA Pro dalvik debugger to debug the APK on a real device.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The problem is, when using AVD all I had to setup was packagename and activity name in the\n  <code>\n   Debugger Setup -> Set specific options\n  </code>\n  and debugger worked well but trying on a real device keep fails with message like\n  <code>\n   ADB error: listener 'tcp:239166' not found\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   IDA started the application but unable to connect ..\n  </code>\n  message.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried\n  <code>\n   adb forward\n  </code>\n  on a port Dalvik debugger is using but no progress :(\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can anyone provide help? Thanks in advance.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
