    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am looking at some code using x64dbg and found the assembly code that writes to a certain block of memory:\n  <code>\n   dword ptr [rdx + 0x18]\n  </code>\n  . And changing this space in the dump has an output that I am looking for.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But, just out of curiosity, is it possible to find what initially writes to this memory space? It seems to be dynamically allocated as comparing the dumps of the memory space is not identical, and the offset from the start of the block changes each time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have tried to put a breakpoint on the memory space, but as it has already been written, I can't back track to see what wrote to it (or can I?).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or am I completely off track?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
