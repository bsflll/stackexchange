The addon seems to be not much more than a couple of IR LEDs plus a few sensors, so I suspect most of the algorithms are in the software running on the phone. At a guess, some information is encoded into the IR emission patterns and the software decodes them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maybe I'm mistaken but it's pretty difficult to say more without at least a teardown and access to the software.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
