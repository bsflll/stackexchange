    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am trying to learn reverse engeneering, so I wrote a little hackme (Very basic console application, asks for a password, and outputs 'right' or 'wrong'). The first thing I wanted to do was finding the address of the '_' function, which basically outputs the given string in the console. After some searching, I found my function, but when placing a breakpoint and debugging or restarting the application, sometimes the function address changes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My questions:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Why is the address changing\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   How could I dynamically find the function if I can't prevent it from changing?\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FF91l.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Ida screenshot\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FF91l.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
