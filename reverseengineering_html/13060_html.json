This is the first time i am using lldb and i am familiar with gdb. while i am trying to disassemble the unix executable file its not working any commands i should use . Or i should try other , if so can you provide me a list of disassembler,decompiler and debugger for unix and windows 64bit processors which supports scripting too. I have searched for them but could't find. can you suggest me list of good disassemblers.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Here are some disassemble commands for use within LLDB:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   disassemble --frame\n  </code>\n  : Disassemble the currently running function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   disassemble -a 0x1234\n  </code>\n  : Disassemble the function containing the address\n  <code>\n   0x1234\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   disassemble -n _foo\n  </code>\n  : Disassemble the function called \"\n  <code>\n   _foo\n  </code>\n  \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Try\n  <code>\n   help disassemble\n  </code>\n  to learn more.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As for a list of good disassemblers on various platforms, it depends whether you have a lot of disposable income or not. IDA Pro is the best but it costs around $1000. If that's prohibitive, Google can help you find lists of free and cheap tools.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It has a very good Python binding, so you can write your script as LLDB plugin or GDB plugin.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
