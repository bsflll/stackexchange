The argument is a dword and the function's base stack offset is 4.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Because the offset is positive IDA identified the stack address as an argument. Negative offsets will be recognized as variables and will have the\n  <code>\n   var_\n  </code>\n  prefix instead.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
