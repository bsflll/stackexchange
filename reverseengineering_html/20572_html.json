This set up does some reverse engineering on iOS applications(.ipa files). I'm migrating the setup from Mac to a linux machine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Currently on Mac, I'm using OTOOL on ipa binary files and using the following commands:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   otool -L /iOS/binary/path\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   otool -lv /iOS/binary/path\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   otool -hv /iOS/binary/path\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Now, I've to do the same operation, i.e reverse engineer the iOS applications, but now on the linux machine. AFAIK, OTOOL is not available for linux machine.\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   I've come across JTOOL which I think is most relevant till now. I can                 use it on linux, and it does something similar to OTOOL, but not exactly same. E.g. while using the -L command on JTOOL, I also need to specify architecture. However, OTOOL gives the shared libraries for all the available architectures.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   I tried ldd, but I'm getting the error - \"not a dynamic executable\".\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   I tried objdump, but it asks for the object file.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  I'm not sure which tool can I use. I to figure out the alternate tool which can do same as OTOOL. Or, if not same, then what changes do i need to make to use the alternate tool.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
