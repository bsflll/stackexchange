I tested it by having a test process sleep at the start for about 20 seconds, then crash by jumping to 0x41414141. As it sleeps I attach procdump.exe to the process and then monitor the exceptions in procmon.exe. Is there a way I can do this without the sleep? I tried running it from OllyDbg and then attaching procdump.exe but the message would say that the process is already being debugged.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any advice on how I could proceed?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
