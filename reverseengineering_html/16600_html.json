So, I placed a breakpoint on\n  <code>\n   .text\n  </code>\n  section on write operation and then continued. I found out that it zeroes out the\n  <code>\n   .text\n  </code>\n  section and then writes the decrypted code to that section and then makes a call to the decrypted OEP. I used Scylla to correct the OEP and dump the\n  <code>\n   .exe\n  </code>\n  file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/prlmd.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Scylla_output\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/prlmd.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  When i get the imports it shows that the program only imports\n  <code>\n   kernel32.dll\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/zDYzc.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"PEBear_output\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/zDYzc.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is the assembly of the dumped\n  <code>\n   .exe\n  </code>\n  file in the\n  <code>\n   PEBear\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rMf0h.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"ImmunityDBG_output\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rMf0h.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is what I get when i try to open the dumped file in\n  <code>\n   ImmunityDbg\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The imports i get are also very different from what\n  <code>\n   Scylla\n  </code>\n  gave me + The dumped program does not run it crashes right away.

You will see that the program resolves its own imports dynamically, probably by searching within kernel32.dll for LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By tracing through the top layer, you will also find when the decryption is complete and the transfer of control occurs to the decrypted code.  If you dump the file at that moment, and then disassemble the result, you might be able to see the cause of the crash - it is likely to be anti-debugging mechanisms, of which there are too many possibilities to list here (but see\n  <a href=\"http://pferrie.host22.com/papers/antidebug.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   http://pferrie.host22.com/papers/antidebug.pdf\n  </a>\n  for a selection of commonly-used ones).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
