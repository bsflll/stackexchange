    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Recently I received a Digital Photo Frame (Sony C-1000) and since I'll never use it as it is, I thought of playing with it and reprogram it. Anything like managing to print out to screen \"Hello world\" would be a win.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm trying to understand which CPU is used; next step would be how to access it. Any hint would be great, because I'm not experienced with hardware.\nI opened the device thinking I'd see the CPU, with its model written on top. I think I identified the processor, but the code written on its top did not help me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks for any pointers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On top of what it looks like the CPU reads:\n  <code>\n   G+ SPMF2892A M0023520 1124\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  A piece that I could identify is the RAM:\n  <code>\n   EtronTech EM639165TS-6G\nN48AG05AGB640.12ZQ\n  </code>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

A couple of them expect files with names like\n  <code>\n   ISP.vup\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   VISP.vup\n  </code>\n  . You could try putting such files on a card and seeing if you can trigger the\n  <a href=\"http://www.sony.co.uk/support/en/product/DPF-D80/downloads/DPF_D80_fw\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   firmware update mode\n  </a>\n  (but don't update it!). If this works, you can investigate the firmware update and try to write some simple code that would run instead.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
