There are a number of 1:1 matches, but there are some portions that, while apparently analogous, are not quite correct. One would assume this to be due to changes made by the company, but I can't be sure on this matter.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The reasons are:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Bootloaders are quite small and simple code requiring only small amount of external calls (even system calls are few).\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    This is ARM assembly code, which means that this is aligned-instructions. There is no way to confuse the disassembler by shifting one byte ahead the code.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    There is no real obfuscation in these programs, except for small compiler tricks or a few optimization.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  So, even if there will probably be some extra work afterward, most of the code should be recovered nicely with a simple linear sweep.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
