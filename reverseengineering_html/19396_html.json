If you don't have an Export table (but you do have other directories), then the\n  <code>\n   Size\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   VirtualAddress\n  </code>\n  fields will be zero.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Note that the number of directories is not fixed. Before looking for a specific directory, check the NumberOfRvaAndSizes field in the optional header.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  So if the\n  <code>\n   NumberOfRvaAndSizes\n  </code>\n  member is 2, then you can look at the Export table and the Import table, but nothing else.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Parsers are built against the specification, so if they encounter a PE file with a\n  <code>\n   NumberOfRvaAndSizes\n  </code>\n  value greater than what they know about, then they don't know what the data is or how to interpret it (and no way to find out by inspecting the PE file). Same goes for any Directory that is reserved or otherwise undocumented.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
