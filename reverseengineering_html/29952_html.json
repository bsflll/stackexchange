Machine-code decompilers generally produce a C-like pseudocode, which, in general, cannot be immediately recompiled to C code. A better question would be \"to what extent can the C-like pseudocode produced by decompilers represent features of C++ that are not in C\", to which the answer depends on the specific decompiler in question.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you're asking whether it's possible to manually decompile a C++ program into a C program, the answer is yes. Just as you can take a program written in C++ and manually translate it into C, you can manually decompile a binary into any language you want. There's going to be a lot of manual work regardless of which language you choose to decompile the program into. Although C and C++ are not the same language, the first C++ compilers worked by translating C++ code into C code, and using a regular C compiler on the result (see: CFront\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cfront\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cfront\n  </a>\n  ). You can simulate most C++ constructs in C, although it's going to be a lot more work than simply taking advantage of the features introduced by C++.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
