This is what I've done and the result is that the application started via \"am start -n \" loads shared library on mostly two different addresses:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   set the ASLR to disabled state using one of the methods,\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   kill the \"/system/bin/servicemanager\" process (kill -9 PID) - this should bring down the zygote and complete UI, too,\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   wait for the servicemanager, zygote and UI to restart - init.rc handles this,\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   try to start/kill/start my application\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  After 20 + start & kill sequences my application always loads shared library on one or another memory address. How come? Have no idea!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nevertheless this should help debugging the shared library greatly since the shared library is usually loaded on one address several time in a row and then on another address next couple of times and bask to first address..\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
