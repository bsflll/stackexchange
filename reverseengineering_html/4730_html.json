For example, the\n  <code>\n   .code\n  </code>\n  memory region is scanned by this check and then changes can be detected and the program will return with an event that will exit the application. If anyone has a source of how something like this would work it'd be much appreciated to study off of.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
