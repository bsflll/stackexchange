There seems to be very little in the way of example or linear progression in to non-trivial examples.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It's possible my google-fu is weak, but I can't seem to locate decent tutorials on using binary instrumentation frameworks (Pin, DynamoRIO, other).\n </p>\n <p>\n  What resources could someone who is interested use beyond stumbling around until they get it working?\n </p>\n <p>\n  After some of the answers, I thought I should tack on that dynamorio.org is sometimes non-responsive.  The project is on googlecode\n  <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/dynamorio/downloads/list\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
