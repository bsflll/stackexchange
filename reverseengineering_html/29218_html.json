(as I found the activated program on internet, they only changes the .exe file, not dll's)\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    Note:\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  The activated version of the software available on internet for free. The question is only for further study and research.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
