I would like to do the same thing under angr.  I don't need\n  <em>\n   any\n  </em>\n  symbolic execution, I don't need\n  <em>\n   any\n  </em>\n  Symbion: Just simply use angr as an emulator (which it's more than capable of).  How can I tell angr to run everything concretely, but still continue to hook the libs and replace them with angr's sims?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Surprisingly, this turns out to not be simple.  What I found so far:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://github.com/angr/angr/issues/200\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    https://github.com/angr/angr/issues/200\n   </a>\n   - A discussion from  6 years ago how to do this\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://angr.io/blog/angr_symbion/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    https://angr.io/blog/angr_symbion/\n   </a>\n   Symbion, which does something similar, but much more complex: It runs the concrete side externally, interfaces to it via gdb, and syncs periodically with angr\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
