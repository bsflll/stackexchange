    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I was given two DLL files\n  <a href=\"https://mega.nz/#!w0RnhJTQ!_j3sImHX2Heo0Zb35rZw6uKYLFz8FTqoSmnE-zZDrVs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   (link)\n  </a>\n  . The task is to get the flag from them. First what I've done - opened the first file (called\n  <code>\n   original\n  </code>\n  ) in IDA and found the function called\n  <code>\n   _GetFlag\n  </code>\n  .\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nur45.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nur45.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  As I understood, I need to call that function from the DLL library somehow (that's the first question - I don't have any info about the function except its name, so I'd like to know how exactly I can call it).\nHowever, as wee see, even if I knew how to call it, we can't get the flag from\n  <code>\n   original\n  </code>\n  DLL, it says\n  <code>\n   Sry, flag is in the patched version\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ok, I opened\n  <code>\n   patched\n  </code>\n  DLL in IDA. First what we see that the file can be opened only as a binary:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yCFF3.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yCFF3.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  As always, I opened the Strings window and we see the string\n  <code>\n   \"0day is bring your own header day! Flag is: %s\"\n  </code>\n  . It looks like a key for solution.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/izwnv.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/izwnv.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, I don't exactly know what to do after that. I'd really appreciate if somebody would explain me how to solve this.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Indeed, after I patched file signatures to MZ and PE it looks like a valid DLL. I see a functions like genFlag and getFlag - this is exactly what I need to call. What's the proper way to do that if we have only DLL file, in your opinion?\n</span>\n</body></html>",
