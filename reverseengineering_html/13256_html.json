The only useful resource which I could found so far was a dataset provided on\n  <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   kaggle\n  </a>\n  . However, the only note how the\n  <code>\n   ASM\n  </code>\n  files have been generated is:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   This was generated using the IDA disassembler tool.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   My problem:\n  </strong>\n  There are no details about the specifice process of disassembling: I could not find any additional information if or how the disassembler considers special obfuscation mechanisms and if it could be ensured, that the files contain meaningful assembler instructions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   To recall the question:\n  </strong>\n  I'm looking for malware samples (windows) with the corresponding disassembly to download in bulk, which have been ideally counterchecked for meaningful instructions (e.g. constant code of the malware).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The closest I can think of is labs files from \"Practical Malware Analysis\", at\n  <a href=\"https://practicalmalwareanalysis.com/labs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   https://practicalmalwareanalysis.com/labs/\n  </a>\n  . Each of the files is described and analysed in the \"Answers\" section of the book, including IIRC obfuscated samples, but actual disassembling is left as an exercise for the reader :)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another way to achieve your goal is to look for summary articles on topics that interest you, such as\n  <a href=\"https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2014/07/obfuscation-android-malware-and-how-fight-back\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2014/07/obfuscation-android-malware-and-how-fight-back\n  </a>\n  (Android in this case), take hashes listed in them and download (bulk or not, up to you) samples from VirusTotal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A rather dated Windows malware analysis set of tutorials with emphasis on reversing -\n  <a href=\"https://fumalwareanalysis.blogspot.com.au/p/malware-analysis-tutorials-reverse.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   https://fumalwareanalysis.blogspot.com.au/p/malware-analysis-tutorials-reverse.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
