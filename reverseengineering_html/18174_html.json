Where would I need to begin in order to start retrieving data from one of these files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've read multiple posts that mention hex editor, but I'll admit that I am a little lost as I have never really attempted this before.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Usually you would need some kind of information about the file you need to unpack at a fixed file position. Like the start, or the end.\nTry to indentify obvious breaks in the file, and correlate those with numbers found at the start or end of file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But,  maybe the file is compressed without any header, or encrypted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sometimes it helps to find the binary which does the decoding, and try to identify the relevant code in it. Maybe you will find a string hinting at a specific compression algorithm, or a decryption key.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Try googling for the value of the first few bytes of the file, maybe someone else posted about it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
