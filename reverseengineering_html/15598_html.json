I understand that the buffer is not the size that the program initially set it as, for example if we deployed a buffer like this\n  <code>\n   char buffer [100]\n  </code>\n  , when compiled the buffer size will end up being greater than 100. What data does the compiler add to the initial 100 bytes of data?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
