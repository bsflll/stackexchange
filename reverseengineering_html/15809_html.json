After doing so, string is rendered properly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm wondering, whether there are some scripts here, since I've googled too much, and changed any possible settings and defaults to Unicode, but still no results.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

And then used them in existing project: take an address range, undefine it, define as data (with UNICODE), define a string.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Worked like a charm.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
