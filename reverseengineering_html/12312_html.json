Use PostMessageA instead of CallWindowProc\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   PostMessageA(hWnd, WM_COMMAND, 40003, 0)\n  </code>\n  does the heavy lifting and calls the WindowProc on the desired window.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   2. Make sure that the Window is Top-Level\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had ignored this before because the application window was visible and I thought it was top-level.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, since I am executing\n  <code>\n   EnumWindows\n  </code>\n  on the\n  <code>\n   Init\n  </code>\n  procedure of my injected dll, my launcher process was still running and the window was child of my launcher.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had to wait for the launcher to quit, and then called\n  <code>\n   EnumWindows\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   PostMessage\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The RIT automatically receives the mouse and keyboard messages and sends them to that window which is at the top of the Z order.   Having done a lot of this stuff in the distant past, if you ever need to take total control, a trick that can be done is to implement a top most window (z order) window which covers the whole screen, RIT will give it all messages, and you do what you want with them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Back when I was doing this there was little to no documentation on  RIT but now you can find lots of documentation.  I found this on\n  <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms645543(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   MSDN Raw Input\n  </a>\n  , but it looks like they are making it more complicated than it really needs to be.  MSFT has done things over the years where they hide a topic, then clarify, then put the topic back into hiding.  duckduckgo shows numerous\n  <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22raw%20input%20thread%22&t=hk&ia=web\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   hits\n  </a>\n  and yielded a nice\n  <a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140213-00/?p=1773/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   gem\n  </a>\n  google didn't find on its first page.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
