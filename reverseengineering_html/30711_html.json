I opened the elf with HxD and I saw entry point is 0x1E9 (and no results on file for 01E8)...\n </p>\n <p>\n  If I run on Kali terminal:\n </p>\n <pre><code>readelf --symbols CrackMe\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I don't get any result. If I run:\n </p>\n <pre><code>readelf --sections Crackme\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I get over 20 sections.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If I try to execute the binary on Kali terminal:\n </p>\n <pre><code>./CrackMe\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I get\n </p>\n <pre><code>zsh: exec format error.\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I changed manually the byte of entry point that is different with HxD, E9 --> E8, but I don't get any different results when I execute all again using the edited file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any ideas? Thank you.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
