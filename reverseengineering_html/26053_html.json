I have obtained the password, but now I need use the program to read & print a restricted file to which the executable has access.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can see from the executable's main function through radare2 that there is a \"login\" section that asks for a password and this then proceeds to execute a system command that prints the restricted file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, it seems the program flow skips past this section and terminates the program.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Given an address or a string reference, how can I use radare2 to execute the program from a certain point so that I can avoid skipping it?\n </p>\n <p>\n  From this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>entry point 0x00000\n|\n|  desired section 0x000c8 \"enter password: \"\nv\ntermination 0x000f9 \"no entry\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  To this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>entry point\n|\n|_-> desired section 0x000c8 \"enter password: \" -> 0x000ca \"cat /root/file.txt\" -\n                                                                                 |\ntermination 0x000f9 <-___________________________________________________________|\n\n\n\n \n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
