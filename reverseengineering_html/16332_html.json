I got a Tely 200 which is an IP camera that's used for online conferences and presentations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unfortunately it appears that the camera needs to phone home to Tely's servers in order to be operated but the servers were shut down along with Telylabs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It seems like such a waste of good hardware so I was hoping someone here might be able to help me unlock it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cheers.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Good luck.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
