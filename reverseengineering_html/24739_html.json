    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  1980s arcade video games generally had multiple ROM chips.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I suppose these often mapped into a single address space and often may have been bank switched in and out of sections of a single address space, and often a mix of the two.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Conceptually either should be possible in Ghidra's Memory Map window, using \"Overlay\" with \"File Bytes\". Even though I can import a second file into a window that already has a file open, going into the Memory Map, even though there's a dropdown menu for \"File Bytes\", it's only populated with one file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there some way I haven't been able to find that lets me load two ROMs into a single address space? It's certainly useful for many other scenarios than just old arcade games.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
