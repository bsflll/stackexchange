Possibly some of them are routed to the unlabeled 7-pin pad at the top. To dump the firmware you can probably just use the\n  <a href=\"https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Dump_002fRestore-Files.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <code>\n    dump\n   </code>\n   command\n  </a>\n  (see the datasheet for memory ranges)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
