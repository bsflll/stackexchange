How can I achieve this?

In general terms, read up on how to pack a squashfs (don't forget that the permissions need to come out right).  As for a checksum, you could try without and see what happens.  Hopefully you've done a flash dump before starting.  Sometimes physically replacing the chip is worth the few minutes it takes.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
