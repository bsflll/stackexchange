The virtual address\n  <code>\n   0xbfc00000\n  </code>\n  (in\n  <code>\n   kseg1\n  </code>\n  ) corresponds to the physical address\n  <code>\n   0x1fc00000\n  </code>\n  and is likely in ROM. I suspect that the range 0x80401000 - 0x80528800  is in RAM (\n  <code>\n   kseg0\n  </code>\n  ), so it's natural the addresses don't match. To know more you will probably need to read the processor's datasheet and/or board schematics to figure out where exactly and how much ROM and RAM are present.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
