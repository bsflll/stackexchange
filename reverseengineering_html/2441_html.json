You should be able to set breakpoints on certain views, for example\n  <code>\n   IDA View\n  </code>\n  . Other views do not offer breakpoints and automatically disable them. Such views include, but not limited to\n  <code>\n   Hex View\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   Structures\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   Enums\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   Imports\n  </code>\n  , and\n  <code>\n   Exports\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is how the process of setting breakpoints is described in\n  <a href=\"http://nostarch.com/idapro.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   IDA-Pro Book\n  </a>\n  :\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Breakpoints are set in IDA\n   <strong>\n    by navigating to the location\n   </strong>\n   at which you want execution to pause and using the F2 hotkey (or right-clicking and selecting Add Breakpoint). Addresses at which breakpoints have been set are highlighted with a red (by default) band across the entire disassembly line. A breakpoint may be removed by pressing F2 a second time to toggle the breakpoint off. A complete list of breakpoints currently set within a program may be viewed via Debugger->Breakpoints->Breakpoint List.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
