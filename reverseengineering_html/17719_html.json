    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm writing a plugin which is available at all times (\n  <code>\n   PLUGIN_FIX\n  </code>\n  flag).\nHowever, I also need to be notified when a database is created or opened, as if I would handle the moment when\n  <code>\n   init()\n  </code>\n  is called on plugins without the\n  <code>\n   PLUGIN_FIX\n  </code>\n  flag.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked into the IDA 7.0 SDK, but I only found\n  <code>\n   idb_event::closebase\n  </code>\n  , and I need the exact opposite.\n  <code>\n   idb_event::savebase\n  </code>\n  also doesn't really match.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I logged all events in the SDK ever raised by IDA (causing IDA to run slower than my grandma â˜º), and only dug out\n  <code>\n   idb_event::kernel_config_loaded\n  </code>\n  which happens\n  <em>\n   around\n  </em>\n  the moment I want to catch. However, it also triggers at other times (like when simply clicking the \"Open\" button), so it's not a match too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Am I missing something here? Such an event seems quite important to me, so I'm a bit surprised there's nothing \"obvious\" for it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
