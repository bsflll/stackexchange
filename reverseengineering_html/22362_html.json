It makes sense now, because in most cases I generate function (with P hotkey) when I stop in the middle of unprocessed asm code(and new generated function also have sub_ prefix). Everything that wasn't processed at first doesn't belong to processed module :) Thanks for help\n</span>\n</body></html>",
