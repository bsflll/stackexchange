(this would probably involve changing the permissions so the code can be executed without access violations)\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    instead of static patching, inject a DLL and put a JMP to your code contained in the DLL.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  In both cases, you'd need to preserve the program state\n   (probably a PUSHAD then POPAD when you're done), then JMP back\n   and resume execution.\n </p>\n <p>\n  An example (second approach, assuming MSVC):\n </p>\n <pre><code>void __declspec(naked) MyCode()\n{\n    __asm PUSHAD\n    //your code here\n    __asm POPAD\n    __asm PUSH returnAddress\n    __asm RETN\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and to patch it:\n </p>\n <pre><code>DWORD AddrToPatch = 0xC0DE;\n\nDWORD RelAddr = (DWORD)(MyCode - (DWORD)AddrToPatch) - 5;\n*AddrToPatch = 0xE9;\n*((DWORD *)(AddrToPatch + 0x1)) = RelAddr;  \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  \n\n  Honestly, I think you're better off doing it like that - the first method is a lot more hassle, and injecting a DLL is fairly easy, you can automate that by playing around with the IAT or TLS callbacks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
