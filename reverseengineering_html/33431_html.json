    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a software that is protected with Enigma Protector and I am trying to analyze it and bypass the activation process. I have the following:\n </p>\n <p>\n  A valid HWID and activation key that worked previously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The registry files that were created during the activation of the program.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A copy of the program that was working previously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I would like to understand how the protection mechanism works, especially how the activation and HWID checks are done, and what steps I can take to bypass or disable the protection.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have already tried to analyze it using tools like x64dbg, but I am having trouble identifying the protection routines.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any help or guidance on where to focus my efforts or any tools that might be helpful for this type of analysis would be greatly appreciated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
