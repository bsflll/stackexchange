The other is with GetProcAddress in which case you need to know the number of arguments and types beforehand and finally, this is the most interesting of them all.  Using fs:[0x30] to get the address of the PEB and accessing it's Ldr member which is structure of type PEB_LDR_DATA which contains lists to all loaded modules, and then you can manually parse the module in question and checking the exports by name and fetching the address of the function.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
