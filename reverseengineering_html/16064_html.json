    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Most apk files, when disassembled, produces 2 dex files instead of one. However since IDA Pro only allows the loading of one dex file at a time,it may result in missing information as a result of the other dex file not being loaded. Are there any way to combine these 2 dex files into one so that I can load the complete dex file into IDA Pro? I tried disassembling both dex files to smali files and then using smali.jar to combine these smali files again into one single dex file but I am facing the following error:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Exception in thread \"main\" org.jf.util.ExceptionWithContext: Exception occurred\nwhile writing code_item for method Ladyen/com/adyencse/pojo/Card;->serialize(Lja\nva/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;\n        at org.jf.dexlib2.writer.DexWriter.writeDebugAndCodeItems(DexWriter.java\n:824)\n        at org.jf.dexlib2.writer.DexWriter.writeTo(DexWriter.java:267)\n        at org.jf.dexlib2.writer.DexWriter.writeTo(DexWriter.java:245)\n        at org.jf.smali.Smali.assemble(Smali.java:130)\n        at org.jf.smali.AssembleCommand.run(AssembleCommand.java:96)\n        at org.jf.smali.Main.main(Main.java:99)\nCaused by: org.jf.util.ExceptionWithContext: Error while writing instruction at\ncode offset 0x2\n        at org.jf.dexlib2.writer.DexWriter.writeCodeItem(DexWriter.java:1091)\n        at org.jf.dexlib2.writer.DexWriter.writeDebugAndCodeItems(DexWriter.java\n:820)\n        ... 5 more\nCaused by: org.jf.util.ExceptionWithContext: Unsigned short value out of range:\n70784\n        at org.jf.dexlib2.writer.DexDataWriter.writeUshort(DexDataWriter.java:11\n6)\n        at org.jf.dexlib2.writer.InstructionWriter.write(InstructionWriter.java:\n348)\n        at org.jf.dexlib2.writer.DexWriter.writeCodeItem(DexWriter.java:1051)\n        ... 6 more\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You can not have more than 64k of methods, member variables or types used within one dex file. That's exactly the reason why multidex was introduced (that is, more than one dex file in a single APK file). Whatever you do to merge the two files, it will fail, because the app is too big to fit into a single dex file. It will work, though, if you cut unnecessary pieces before running the smali assembler (did someone say Google Play Serviced Client Library?)\n</span>\n</body></html>",
