Usually after decompilation you will have to fix a lot of code manually to work and be compilable. I did this before manually and it worked. For automation, maybe you could take a look at dnLib to create such a project.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

For example, checking if an argument for function A depends on the return value of function B, or tracking user-entered data (taint analysis).\n</span>\n</body></html>",
