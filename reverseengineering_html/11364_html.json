    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am reading Eldad Eilam's book titled Reversing. In Chapter 11: Breaking Protections, there is a crackme called Defender, which creates a dedicated thread, which repeats the following steps:\n </p>\n <pre><code>1. Invokes `rdtsc` and saves the time-stamp counter (`t1`)\n2. Relinquishes the CPU\n3. Invokes `rdtsc` again, from the result (`t2`) subtracts the previous value: `dt=t2-t1`\n4. If `dt` is greater than some hardcoded value, terminates; otherwise goes to 1.\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The goal is to detect if the process is stopped in a debugger. Is the idea behind this method the fact that after hitting a breakpoint all threads will be stopped? Because as far as I know this can be prevented in\n  <code>\n   gdb\n  </code>\n  by issuing\n  <code>\n   set pagination off\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   set non-stop on\n  </code>\n  . Or is there something I am missing?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
