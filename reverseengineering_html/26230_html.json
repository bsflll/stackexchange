    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a script written to work with Ghidra. I am doing some analysis in the script and save the results in a file. Right now, I am passing the name when a prompt ask the file name to save upon running the script. Though this is ok for one, I need to run this script in more than 100 objects at once(using the headless analyzer) and I want the file name to automatically taken from the object name. How could I do this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, let's say I have an object file called\n  <code>\n   mqtt.o\n  </code>\n  . I need to take this name (\n  <code>\n   mqtt\n  </code>\n  ) while saving the file which contains the results. I looked through the API, but still could not find a way to get the name of the object of analysis. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If so,\n  <a href=\"https://ghidra.re/ghidra_docs/api/ghidra/program/flatapi/FlatProgramAPI.html#getProgramFile()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <code>\n    getProgramFile()\n   </code>\n  </a>\n  is probably the easiest way to grab it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
