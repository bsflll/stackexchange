    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm currently analyzing a malware that mimics a legitimate social network application. The malware phishes users to log into their real accounts, and then it stores their real cookies somewhere.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm specifically trying to investigate the login mechanism. To do this, I deleted the entire /data/data/app.package.name/* directory and restarted the application. However, after restarting, the app still recognized the previously logged-in account.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Initially, I suspected that the device ID might be exposed, but this only seems to apply when I delete the data directory and restart the app. When I completely reinstall the app, the login state is cleared, and the app no longer recognizes the previous account.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Could someone provide insights into why the app behaves this way, and how it manages to retain the login state even after deleting its data directory? Any hints or explanations would be greatly appreciated!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
