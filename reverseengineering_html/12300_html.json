So i'm coding some programs and try to understand their assembly.\nI stumbled upon a curious case and i think i can't solve it alone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's the c code:\n </p>\n <pre><code> #include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(){\n\nchar *texto = \"O numero e %d\n\";\nint i = 10;\n\nwhile(i){\n    printf(texto, i--);\n}\n\nreturn 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The assembly produced by IDA is the following:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov     eax, [esp+28]\nlea     edx, [eax-1] ; The part i don't understand\nmov     [esp+28], edx\nmov     [esp+4], eax\nmov     eax, [esp+18h]\nmov     [esp], eax      ; char *\ncall    _printf\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  What i could understand is that it stores the old value in eax and pushes to stack(I purposedly didn't turn on optimizations) and then it pushes the format.\nWhile that happens in the middle it does the\n  <code>\n   i--\n  </code>\n  , but i can't understand how it's working. So it get's the address of\n  <code>\n   eax-1\n  </code>\n  and stores in\n  <code>\n   edx\n  </code>\n  and then stores it in\n  <code>\n   i\n  </code>\n  , but\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  doesn't hold an address but a value.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks in advance.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

(Or 64 bit, if you're using newer architecture, but as your register names start with\n  <code>\n   e\n  </code>\n  , you're using 32 bit).\n </p>\n <p>\n  The\n  <code>\n   lea\n  </code>\n  instruction loads the address of its operand, instead of the operand itself. In C terms, you could look at [eax-1] as *(eax-1), and\n  <code>\n   lea\n  </code>\n  adds a\n  <code>\n   &\n  </code>\n  operator to that, so\n  <code>\n   lea edx, [eax-1]\n  </code>\n  is like\n  <code>\n   edx = &(*(eax-1))\n  </code>\n  . Which is the same as\n  <code>\n   eax-1\n  </code>\n  of course.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The compiler could have done exactly the same using the instruction sequence\n  <code>\n   mov edx, eax; sub edx, 1\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   mov edx, eax; dec edx\n  </code>\n  . So, why did it use the\n  <code>\n   lea\n  </code>\n  instruction?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The answer is that, historically, resolving addresses in\n  <code>\n   lea\n  </code>\n  was done using dedicated address bus hardware and bypassed the ALU. Also, pipelining had its issues when the same register was used twice in subsequent operations. Which means, on\n  <strong>\n   older\n  </strong>\n  processors, using\n  <code>\n   lea\n  </code>\n  was a few cycles faster than the alternatives, and it's not hard to implement in the compiler, so this is what compilers traditionally did.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On new processors, the distinction \"\n  <code>\n   lea\n  </code>\n  uses separate hardware\" isn't (neccesarily) made any more, and pipelining is a lot more intelligent than it used to be, so i doubt it's make any difference these days. But it's still in the compilers, and won't get removed from them because there's just no good reason to.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Also, CPUs have so many ALUs nowadays that hardly anyone will notice that <code>lea</code> doesn't use any.  However, <code>lea</code> leaves the flags alone, it can reduce register pressure (always an issue in x86 mode!), and it can shorten dependency chains. What's not to like? ;-)</span>",
