Is there any possibility to convert my dictionaries to Stardict/Goldendict format so I can use them on my Android devices ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I’ve looked into\n  <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/stardictproject/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   stardict-tools\n  </a>\n  but can’t convert.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Android app is totally unusable and so are another great sources of dictionaries for many languages Millennium and Lingea. The way I see it, trying various tools blindly won't help.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
