I can successfully view the values of Local variables in the Locals window but I cannot view the values of static fields.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, per this github discussion:\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy/issues/334\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy/issues/334\n  </a>\n  for dnSpy, this feature was already added in version 4.0\n </p>\n <p>\n  Please refer the image below. The locals windows doesn't show the value of Static Fields.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MoeG0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MoeG0.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way to view them? How can I use the C# Interactive feature of dnSpy to view these values?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
