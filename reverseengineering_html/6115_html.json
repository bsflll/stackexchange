For example, Armadillo and ASProtect are both packers. You may want to focus on that. I don't know what technique is used in FlexNet, so I can't tell for this one.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

About packers, a starter document could be this\n <a href=\"https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-07/Yason/Whitepaper/bh-usa-07-yason-WP.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  PDF document\n </a>\n .
