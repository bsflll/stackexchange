Since it is pretty old binary (2008) I managed to run it in IDA and it unpacked in memory. When I do tracing + take memory snapshot and reanalyze it, the view of functions I get does not make any sense.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Qcv43.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Qcv43.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  How is it possible that instructions are skipped? Am I doing something wrong here?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
