Since the password/encryption key is embedded inside the executable, this encryption serves the purpose of obfuscation for the archived files and not for actual confidentiality.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How can I find that password? Since the installer is local and doesn't need an internet connection, the password must be in the .exe file and somehow passed as an argument to the ZIP decryption module.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here are some similar examples of self-extracting without the user having to input the password themselves; my goal is to extract that password:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/archive-sidestepping-self-unlocking-password-protected-rar/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Archive Sidestepping: Self-Unlocking Password-Protected RAR\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3677448/attackers-switch-to-self-extracting-password-protected-archives-to-distribute-email-malware.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Attackers switch to self-extracting password-protected archives to distribute email malware\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  For reference and continuity:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/270825/how-can-i-extract-the-password-from-an-installer-self-extracting-archive\">\n     How can I extract the password from an installer/self-extracting archive?\n    </a>\n    : Deleted\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <a href=\"https://superuser.com/questions/1789637/how-can-i-extract-the-password-from-an-installer-self-extracting-archive\">\n     How can I extract the password from an installer/self-extracting archive?

Static analysis is a good place to start. You may find the password stored as a string in the installer or the logic of the password through static analysis. Otherwise, you will need to perform dynamic analysis and try to capture the password by debugging specific regions of memory as the installer operates as the installer passes the password to the encrypted file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is a very general answer because you provided no context to the type of installer you are working with.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
