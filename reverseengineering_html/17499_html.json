    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am looking for a good \"disassembler\" for JavaScript, like IDA Pro but for JS. I am looking at a chrome extension, but the JavaScript is heavily obfuscated. After deobfuscating, I am left with variable and function names like \"_0xa893x5\". This is using jsbeautifier.org; other deobfuscators give error. This unintuitive syntax makes it more than a little different to follow the program; is there a tool like IDA for Javascript where I can graphically trace the flow of the program from function to function?\nThanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
