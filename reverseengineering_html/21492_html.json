And if not, what would be my best bet of achieving this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some additional information:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The namespace is written in Visual C++ or C++.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The application is running on windows, and so is Ghidra.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  If any more information or clarification is needed, please tell me.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
