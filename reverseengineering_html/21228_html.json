It was community-made to satisfy a certain niche, unfortunately I cannot get into contact with the original creator/programmer and I have no way to re-compile the .tga images to the original container. Basically I want to reverse the procedure.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm not overly familiar with SE, if this post is considered low-effort or anything, please let me know and I will edit accordingly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Google Drive:\n  <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_mdCW5w3GS7fXgSuISOlUDumLXeKJ9TE?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_mdCW5w3GS7fXgSuISOlUDumLXeKJ9TE?usp=sharing\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the provided link the included files are\n1) the extractor\n2) one of the .mda containers\n3) a .bat file that is used to make the extractor run. Will be edited later on to batch extract all the containers.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Basically, there is an .mda container containing 8-12 .tga images that form an animation that is used on a certain graphical engine. I have the original extractor to extract said images, but I have no way to arrange them in an .mda container that is readable by said engine. On the last paragraph you will find the link to the Google Drive with the extractor and an example .mda file. I have also included a .bat file which is used in-conjunction with the extractor to make it run.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Do you need help with the problem or someone to do the whole thing? If it's the latter this SO is the wrong place I'm afraid.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
