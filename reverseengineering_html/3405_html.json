            "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Go to the memory window in Ollydbg. Find the code section (usually .text) of the module you want to break on return to. Right click the memory section and set break-on-access or hit\n  <kbd>\n   F2\n  </kbd>\n  . You'll break once execution reaches that memory. You can also change the memory access to read only and you'll get an exception when execution hits that memory segment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can also use a trace and set a conditional stop when EIP is within a certain range, to do this simply set the condition by going to Debug, Set Condition (\n  <kbd>\n   Ctrl\n  </kbd>\n  +\n  <kbd>\n   T\n  </kbd>\n  ). Then start the trace with Debug, Trace Into (\n  <kbd>\n   Ctrl\n  </kbd>\n  +\n  <kbd>\n   F11\n  </kbd>\n  )or Debug, Trace Over (\n  <kbd>\n   Ctrl\n  </kbd>\n  +\n  <kbd>\n   F12\n  </kbd>\n  ). This will enable you to see where you came from, even if the call is indirect.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It's not guaranteed to be on return but if you're in a different module it's fairly likely that the return is when the first execution happens. You could also be triggering on calls through imports, through object vtables or some other mechanism. You'd need to study the state you're in when the break hits.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

That way you would get a sort of memory region breakpoints. I'm not sure how OllyDbg implements it.</span>",
