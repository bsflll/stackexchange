UART should give you console access to manufacturing/diagnostic commands, and JTAG should allow you to the debug the code (firmware) running on the controller CPU.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As for J3, at a guess, ROM/FW allows you to switch from the firmware stored in the flash to the built-in CPU boot ROM (e.g. in case flash is corrupted and firmware can't boot properly).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
