Where did you get that information.\n <a href=\"http://dubeyko.com/development/FileSystems/NTFS/ntfsdoc.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  Here\n </a>\n ? For starters attributes (and the file name is an attribute in NTFS terms, IIRC), can be resident (inside the record) or non-resident (elsewhere). So your assumption that the file name ought to be at offset 0x52 is already wrong. But what you describe here looks more like an\n <code>\n  ATTRIBUTE_RECORD_HEADER\n </code>\n ? I think you need to give more information.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
