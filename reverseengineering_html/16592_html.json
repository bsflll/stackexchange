            "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Most assemblers require numeric constants to begin with a digit, this is so they can distinguish between them and labels.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can see it in\n  <a href=\"https://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=fasmg_manual#1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <em>\n    FASM Fundamental syntax rules\n   </em>\n  </a>\n  :\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Numbers are distinguished from names by the fact that they either\n  begin with a decimal digit, or with the \"$\" character followed by any\n  hexadecimal digit. This means that a token can be considered numeric\n  even when it is not a valid number. To be a correct one it must be one\n  of the following: a decimal number (optionally with the letter \"d\"\n  attached at the end), a binary number followed by the letter \"b\", an\n  octal number followed by the letter \"o\" or \"q\", or a hexadecimal\n  number either prepended with \"$\" or \"0x\", or followed by the character\n  \"h\". Because the first digit of a hexadecimal number can be a letter,\n  it may be needed to prepend it with the digit zero in order to make it\n  recognizable as a number. For example, \"0Ah\" is a valid number, while\n  \"Ah\" is just a name.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  and in\n  <a href=\"http://people.sju.edu/~ggrevera/arch/references/MASM61PROGUIDE.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   MASM Manual\n  </a>\n  as well:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Hexadecimal numbers must always start with a decimal digit (0â€“9). If\n  necessary, add a leading zero to distinguish between symbols and\n  hexadecimal numbers that start with a letter.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Looking at\n  <code>\n   0ffffffffh\n  </code>\n  you can see 8 significant hex digits, exactly as you'd expect. This is not unique to\n  <code>\n   0ffffffffh\n  </code>\n  , another numeric literals should be written with a leading zero as well --\n  <code>\n   0d1h\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   0aah\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   0b0h\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  These days it is common for assemblers to support the\n  <code>\n   0xffffffff\n  </code>\n  syntax. If yours is not (FLAT supports it), make sure to pay attention to the leading zero, otherwise the hexadecimal value would be interpreted as a label or another symbol name.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
