For instance in the symbols for\n <code>\n  ntdll.dll\n </code>\n for Windows 10 now, there's a lot of debugging strings that give the following folder as the location of their source files:\n <code>\n  \"minkernel\ntdll\\*****\"\n </code>\n</span>\n</body></html>",

However, it could be a fake to make something appear more legit. You're tagging the question as\n  <a class=\"post-tag\" href=\"/questions/tagged/malware\" rel=\"tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'malware'\">\n   malware\n  </a>\n  but I don't quite see the connection.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Given the path it would not be inconceivable to think that this is some code that uses an older version of\n  <code>\n   ntdll.dll\n  </code>\n  loaded by another name. Stranger things have happened, such as loading a second\n  <code>\n   ntoskrnl.exe\n  </code>\n  to dodge a possibly patched\n  <em>\n   running\n  </em>\n  kernel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyway the RTM in\n  <code>\n   w7rtm\n  </code>\n  means release to manufacturer and refers to the very first release version of a Windows. And given that this refers to Windows 7, this is\n  <em>\n   several\n  </em>\n  years old by now.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
