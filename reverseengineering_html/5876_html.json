I have configured Visual Studio debugging and WinDBG, as well as other tools.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What's the best way to save a backup of the victim machine to quickly recover from damage caused by malware? Should I make a .zip of the entire Virtualbox folder and store it elsewhere?\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Additional question: is it safe to run malware on a virtual machine with bridged adapter network settings for VS remote debugging?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

At any later time, you can revert to that state, even\n  though you may have changed the VM considerably since then. A snapshot\n  of a virtual machine is thus similar to a machine in \"saved\" state, as\n  described above, but there can be many of them, and these saved states\n  are preserved.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"VirtualBox Snapshots\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/k2Y4g.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Please create a separate Stack Exchange question for your second question.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
