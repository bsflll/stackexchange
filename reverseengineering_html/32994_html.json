Where is it located? Please help.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is a question about reversing, not about other programs to use instead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Update:\n  </strong>\n  \n\n  With suggested in the answer, I found the check after which a forced line break is made (it is\n  <code>\n   COMCTL32.dll+C6E44\n  </code>\n  ), increased the limit using code injection, but the text goes out of the field and the scrollbar doesn't work for it. Please help.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
