Either patching OllyDbg to use an alternative ZwXX/NtXX function which accepts some flags or patching the kernel. The initial break is done by the operating system so that the debugger can gather information about the process it is being attached to.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I haven't verified but my guess is that OllyDbg is calling\n  <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms679295%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   DebugActiveProcess\n  </a>\n  in order to attach to it. The documentation for it states:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   After the system checks the process identifier and determines that a valid debugging attachment is being made, the function returns TRUE. Then the debugger is expected to wait for debugging events by using the WaitForDebugEvent function. The system suspends all threads in the process, and sends the debugger events that represents the current state of the process.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  And later on\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   After all of this is done, the system resumes all threads in the process. When the first thread in the process resumes, it executes a breakpoint instruction that causes an EXCEPTION_DEBUG_EVENT debugging event to be sent to the debugger. All future debugging events are sent to the debugger by using the normal mechanism and rules.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
