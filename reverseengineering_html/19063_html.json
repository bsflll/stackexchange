The COM dll's have a typelib resource included that I can extract and/or generate an .idl file (I'm using\n  <a href=\"http://www.benf.org/other/olewoo/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   OleWoo tool\n  </a>\n  ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way to load the typelib or an .idl file into Ida Pro so that Ida will recognize the COM interface and show the methods rather than offset such as in this sample:\n </p>\n <pre><code>*(void (__stdcall **)(LPVOID))(*(_DWORD *)ppv + 8))(ppv);\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
