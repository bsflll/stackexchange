    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to update/port this\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/blue-devil/nios2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   NIOS2 Processor Module\n  </a>\n  for IDA Pro v9.0.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I load an elf binary, I got this warning:\n  <strong>\n   Undefined or unknown machine type 113\n  </strong>\n  . But when I move on, processor module works and I can disassemble binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I want to get rid of that warning. Apparently IDA Pro parses ELF file and finds\n  <code>\n   e_machine\n  </code>\n  is equal to\n  <code>\n   113\n  </code>\n  which is actually\n  <code>\n   Altera Nios II soft-core processor\n  </code>\n  . But also it is undefined for IDA Pro 9.0.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have tried\n  <code>\n   set_processor_type()\n  </code>\n  , but it is something else.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have searched google and there is a deprecated IDAPython function which is\n  <code>\n   loader_elf_machine\n  </code>\n  ; so, this is not working for me either.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So my question is rather obvious. I know the machine; I know what\n  <code>\n   113\n  </code>\n  refers to. Is it possible to get rid of this warning by using\n  <strong>\n   IDA Python\n  </strong>\n  ? Can I define this number as a machine while loading processor module?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
