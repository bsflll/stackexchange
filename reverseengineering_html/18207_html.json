    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am learning to analyze binaries using radare2 and have been confused about what occurs within imported functions. In the binary below, titled Lab2B, I statically disassembled the binary and then disassembled one of the imported library functions, sym.imp.printf. As you can see below it merely lists one instruction:\n  <code>\n   jmp dword [reloc.printf]\n  </code>\n  . When I seek to the location\n  <code>\n   [reloc.printf]\n  </code>\n  and I print the disassembled functions contained at it, the command line prints \"Cannot find function at 0x0804a00c\". I have noticed the same behavior with all of the other imported functions. They often have a single instruction that points to an address that doesn't contain any instructions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Why are there no instructions contained at the address that the instruction tells the compiler to jump to?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LDuoZ.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LDuoZ.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

To understand that better you need to get familiar with two terms, PLT and GOT. Anyway, even if you are debugging the file, these are not functiona but a table with pointers. So\n  <code>\n   pdf\n  </code>\n  isn't what you should try. Give a shot to\n  <code>\n   pd\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Dynamic Linking\n </h2>\n <p>\n  The Procedure Linkage Table is a memory structure that contains a code stub for external functions that their addresses are unknown at the time of linking.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Whenever we see a\n  <code>\n   CALL\n  </code>\n  instruction to a function in the\n  <code>\n   .text\n  </code>\n  segment it doesnâ€™t call the function directly. Instead, it calls the stub code at the\n  <code>\n   PLT\n  </code>\n  , say\n  <code>\n   func_name@plt\n  </code>\n  . The stub then jumps to the address listed for this function in the Global Offset Table (\n  <code>\n   GOT\n  </code>\n  ). If it is the first\n  <code>\n   CALL\n  </code>\n  to this function, the\n  <code>\n   GOT\n  </code>\n  entry will point back to the\n  <code>\n   PLT\n  </code>\n  which in turn would call a dynamic linker that will resolve the real address of the desired function. The next time that\n  <code>\n   func_name@plt\n  </code>\n  is called, the stub directly obtains the function address from the\n  <code>\n   GOT\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  To read more about the linking process, I highly recommend\n  <a href=\"https://www.airs.com/blog/archives/38\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   this series of articles\n  </a>\n  about linkers by\n  <em>\n   Ian Lance Taylor\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Radare2 is detecting the addresses of the PLT and GOT. Where you see\n  <code>\n   sym.imp.printf\n  </code>\n  it is actually the reserved address for\n  <code>\n   printf()\n  </code>\n  int the PLT. When you see\n  <code>\n   reloc.printf\n  </code>\n  is the address reserved for it in the GOT.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By using\n  <code>\n   iS\n  </code>\n  you can list the sections of\n  <code>\n   PLT\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   GOT\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
