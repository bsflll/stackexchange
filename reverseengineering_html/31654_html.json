    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm developing a python script for IDA Pro that analyzes 32 bit PE files containing an anti-disassembly technique, the problem is that the function that contains the technique isn't being listed in the list of functions using\n  <code>\n   idautils.Functions()\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  To solve the problem I tried to add the function to the list with:\n </p>\n <pre><code>segm = idaapi.get_segm_by_name(\".text\")\n    start = segm.start_ea\n    end = segm.end_ea\n    while start < end:\n        start = idaapi.find_not_func(start, 1)\n        ida_funcs.add_func(start)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  When the\n  <code>\n   start\n  </code>\n  value is the address of the beginning of the function the\n  <code>\n   ida_funcs.add_func\n  </code>\n  method returns false, meaning that the address can't be added as a function, despite that in the GUI of IDA the function becomes listed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is the screenshot of the function containing the technique in the IDA GUI:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/neXXA.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/neXXA.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Do you know what can I do in order to have the script working? Thank you in advance.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
