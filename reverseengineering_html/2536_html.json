Later versions of Windows may prevent this depending on loader options AFAIK.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A handy tool to edit PE files is the freely available\n  <a href=\"http://www.ntcore.com/exsuite.php\">\n   CFF Explorer\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Removing the relocation table won't do it, if the file opted into ASLR.  Windows will still move it around, it just won't relocate any of the data.\nAs far as I know, you can't turn off ASLR globally.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This setting is controlled via\n  <code>\n   HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Memory Management\\MoveImages\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, if the preferred address is unavailable, Windows will load it somewhere else.  If you run into this issue, I recommend modifying the preferred base address manually.  A good hex editor will allow you to do this.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
