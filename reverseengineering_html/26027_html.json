That denotes the (usually random) base address of the executable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In IDA this base address is a fixed value e.g.\n  <code>\n   0x400000\n  </code>\n  . Scroll to the beginning of the IDA View and check the\n  <code>\n   Imagebase\n  </code>\n  value (hexadecimal). This value you have to add to every address shown in the Cheat engine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If debugging a process directly with IDA the database is automatically relocated to the correct address so you don't have to do the math yourself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note: If I interpret the screen shots correctly 0x119EDD (0x519EDD) is the target address of the conditional jump command. Jump commands are used inside a sub, hence you don't leave the current sub and won't find this address in the sub list\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
