    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Our ISP, MWeb, gave us a free router and Wifi extender (WRE2205v2) as part of a new promotion. Neither of them really work at all (the extender works for about a minute then fails for no apparent reason). Acording to reviews, it should be a decent repeater, but it seems Mweb has completely screwed up the firmware.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://simonfredsted.com/996\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   This blog post\n  </a>\n  shows how to get very basic root access (it's running embedded Linux) on the device (the security is... bad). So far I've worked out it's a MIPS device (running\n  <code>\n   file\n  </code>\n  on an executable gives\n  <code>\n   ELF 32-bit MSB  executable, MIPS, MIPS-I version 1 (SYSV)\n  </code>\n  and the file system is squash-fs, so read only. I can also copy files to/from the device using tftp.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I also know that both the branded firmware and the stock firmware use a binary called fw_upgrade to flash a new firmware. I tried decompiling them using\n  <a href=\"http://decompiler.fit.vutbr.cz/decompilation/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://decompiler.fit.vutbr.cz/decompilation/\n  </a>\n  but I haven't had much luck there. The branded one has a bit more code which I assume checks something about the new firmware and prevents the stock firmware from being flashed. Finally I tried copying the stock fw_upgrade to the device and running it but it fails without an error message.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What else can I do to get the stock firmware running?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If I'm reading the code correctly, it searches the first\n  <code>\n   0x800\n  </code>\n  bytes for the four ASCII bytes\n  <code>\n   1213\n  </code>\n  ; if found, the function succeeds, else it fails and the upgrade is terminated.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

After extracting the squash-fs file system from the update file, I managed to copy fw_update to the device using tftp. Running that binary (\n  <code>\n   /etc/fw_update upg fw.bin\n  </code>\n  ) instead of the ISP one worked and flashed the stock firmware. The binary needs to be copied to /etc or /var because the rest is read-only.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
