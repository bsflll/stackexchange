The binary was obfuscated with\n  <code>\n   xenocode\n  </code>\n  obfuscator.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I figured out that I can directly manipulate IL instructions if I just find correct instruction offset, and replace instruction byte(s).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Original bytes and C# code (replaced with letters so it is readable):\n </p>\n <pre><code>a.b().c.d = (int)e.f;\n\n 06 6F A0010006 6F 9302000A\n ^  ^  ^        ^  ^-------- T2\n |  |  |        \\----------- callvirt to set_d\n |  |  \\-------------------- T1\n |  \\----------------------- callvirt to get_f\n \\-------------------------- ldloc.0\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  What I want to achieve and resulting bytes:\n </p>\n <pre><code>a.b().c.d = 6;\n\n 1C 00 00000000 6F 9302000A\n ^  ^           ^  ^-------- T2\n |  |           \\----------- callvirt to set_d\n |  |  \n |  \\----------------------- 5x nop, so the length of file is same\n \\-------------------------- ldc.i4.6\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I am able to decompile changed binary without error, and I can observe my changed instructions, but when binary executes this region, it dies. Any ideas?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
