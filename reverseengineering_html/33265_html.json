If so, the bytes could be changed by IDA (and dos4gw when it loads application) according to fixup table. More info in documention for LE format, like here:\n <a href=\"http://www.edm2.com/index.php/LX_-_Linear_eXecutable_Module_Format_Description\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  edm2.com/index.php/â€¦\n </a>\n</span>\n</body></html>",

As for you second IDA screenshots - did you created new IDA database after editing file in hex-editor? As long as I know IDA will not automatically reflect changes - it creates database and later works only with it, you can even delete source EXE file - no problem for IDA.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
