    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to debug a malware sample that installs to a system as service and then will only start if it starts as a service. Other functions are still available without the service start, like configuring or install under a different name.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm trying to catch the network communications the malware is sending and receiving as soon as it starts as a service. If I attach to a running service/process with Immunity it already has sent the network packets and received, and I've missed what it has done with them. If I try to start it any other way I get the following error:\n  <code>\n   ERROR_FAILED_SERVICE_CONTROLLER_CONNECT\n  </code>\n  (00000427).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there another way to go about this? Or some workaround? I'm fairly new to this so I certainly be missing some obvious.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In which case I am not sure how to debug those. Perhaps you can figure out how to make it revert to being a normal app but then again that may not be possible.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I think this will solve your packet monitoring problem though. It allows you to monitor packets per process unlike\n  <a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">\n   WireShark.\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/smsniff.html\">\n   SmartSniff\n  </a>\n  should also be able to do this job. Not sure but you might have to add the process column as it might not be displayed by default.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4865\">\n   MicroSoft Network Monitor\n  </a>\n  should in theory be the best since it will be most integrated with the OS. And have access to more information a more portable tool like Wireshark would not.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

One piece of insight I would like to contribute is looking into the malware to see if there are any threads that are created that hold the functionality you wish to review.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Oftentimes in my analysis, I've dealt with malware that runs as a service, but rather than go through some of the hoops you need to go through to launch a debugger when the service is invoked, I often have luck looking at the malware for a main thread that is spun off after initial criteria for the service startup is handled. Once I find the 'main', thread (assuming it exists and is standalone) I will just load the DLL/EXE in Olly, set my new origin on the thread start and proceed on with my debugging.\n </p>\n <p>\n  End of day, its really just a different approach, but something to possibly consider if the situation presents itself.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
