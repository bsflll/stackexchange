So, the \"can I assume that\n  <code>\n   dword_4870058\n  </code>\n  gets the value\n  <code>\n   10h\n  </code>\n  \" is completely wrong, the function at that address has NOT been called has it ? So, it cant get the value\n  <code>\n   10h\n  </code>\n  ...\n </p>\n <p>\n  Its simply storing one value (the address of a function) into another memory block.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
