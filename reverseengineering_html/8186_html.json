    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I found an assembler instruction:\n  <code>\n   mov [esi+2F],dl\n  </code>\n  . I think ESI is a reference to a struct or class.\n  <code>\n   0x2F\n  </code>\n  is the offset that references a property of the struct/class. Is it possible to find the value of the ESI register? I think this class or struct is initialized when the game is started.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, I tried to reverse GTA San Andreas. A lot of memory addresses of the GTA SA\n  <a href=\"http://www.gtamodding.com/?title=Memory_Addresses_%28SA%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've found such information in this site: 0xB6F5F0 - Player pointer (CPed).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I think it's address that I finding now. But how I can find it with debugger like cheat-engine without pointer scan? I'd like to find addresses in asm code. It's possible?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried to set a breakpoint to the instruction. But I think it's useless because ESI address is dynamic. As I understand CPed struct/class uses dynamic memory allocation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am sorry for my bad English and thanks in advance.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
