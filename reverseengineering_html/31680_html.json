    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm developing a python script for angr that has to find all the basic blocks present in each function in a binary. I have noticed that angr splits the basic blocks when it finds a\n  <code>\n   REP\n  </code>\n  instruction, I'm wondering if I can tell angr to not split basic blocks when it encounters\n  <code>\n   REP\n  </code>\n  instructions with the API or if I have to do it manually.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is a snippet of my code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>p = angr.Project(sys.argv[1], auto_load_libs=False, main_opts={'base_addr': 0} )\ncfg = p.analyses.CFGFast()\ncfg.normalize()\n\nfor func_node in cfg.functions.values():\n    for block in func_node.blocks:\n        c = block.capstone\n        for i in c.insns:\n            * operations *\n\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This is an example of a basic block that ends with a\n  <code>\n   REP\n  </code>\n  instruction:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pi8Xv.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pi8Xv.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you in advance.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
