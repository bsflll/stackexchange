This returns the length of the disassembled instruction. If this equals 15 you have found the previous instruction. If it is less than 15, then pass 1 byte less (i.e 14 bytes) and so on until the length of the buffer passed to BeaEngine equals the length of the disassembled instruction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This can be represented in pseudo code\n </p>\n <pre><code>eip = 0xDEADCODE\n\nlength = 15\nwhile(length > 0)\n{\n    buffer = ReadProcessMemory(start=eip-length, length)\n    lenDisasm = Disasm(buffer)\n\n    if (lenDisasm == length) \n    {\n        prevIns = eip-length\n        break;\n    }\n    else length--;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Note that the above algorithm is not generic in nature i.e. you cannot use it to find the previously executed instruction given the current\n  <code>\n   eip\n  </code>\n  . This only works when the execution sequence is linear without any jumps in between. In case of hardware breakpoints on access the execution sequence is\n  <strike>\n   guaranteed to be\n  </strike>\n  linear and the above algorithm is applicable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   EDIT:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Even in case of hardware breakpoints on access the execution sequence may not be linear as in the following case\n </p>\n <pre><code>format PE\n\nentry start\n\nsection '.text' code readable executable\n\nstart:\n    nop\n    nop\n    jmp dword [here]\n    mov eax, 1\n    push eax\n    pop eax\n\naddress:\n    xor eax, eax\n    ret     \n\nsection '.data' readable writable\n\nhere:   ; <<<<<<<< HWBP on read\n dd address\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  A hardware breakpoint on read is set on\n  <code>\n   here\n  </code>\n  . In this case the hwbp would hit when\n  <code>\n   EIP\n  </code>\n  is at\n  <code>\n   address\n  </code>\n  . If you use the above algorithm, the previously executed instruction turns out to be\n  <code>\n   pop eax\n  </code>\n  which is incorrect. \nFor such cases you can use instruction tracing or memory breakpoints (\n  <strong>\n   <em>\n    <a href=\"http://www.codereversing.com/blog/archives/79\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     1\n    </a>\n   </em>\n  </strong>\n  ,\n  <strong>\n   <em>\n    <a href=\"http://waleedassar.blogspot.in/2012/11/defeating-memory-breakpoints.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     2\n    </a>\n   </em>\n  </strong>\n  ,\n  <strong>\n   <em>\n    <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3771785/whats-the-principle-of-ollydbgs-memory-breakpoint\">\n     3\n    </a>\n   </em>\n  </strong>\n  ).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
