I put breakpoint, this function is called before the WinMain, and immediately at the beginning of the WinMain. What kind of function could it be if IDA didn't recognize it? Maybe ZeroMemory? But why IDA not recognize it? Thanks in advance.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

And if you know it's effectively a zero-filling then simply rename it. The reason why IDA may not have recognized it is probably because no signature matched. But that's where the I in IDA comes into play ...\n</span>\n</body></html>",

I already have issues with the present level of FLIRT in IDA mis-detecting functions as library functions, but it's worth it for all the times it gets the really complex ones right.  You really wouldn't want it to be any more aggressive.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
