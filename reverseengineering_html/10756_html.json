This undocumented number was a way for the system to differentiate the different types of Windows binaries, something that became a requirement for Windows RT as part of its requirement to prohibit the execution of Windows “desktop” applications.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How this signature level are determined on what basis ? Is that flag passed to CreateProcess or kernel handles this ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

There are no special flags passed to\n  <code>\n   CreateProcess()\n  </code>\n  , but\n  <code>\n   PspCreateProcess()\n  </code>\n  (a kernel function that's executed as a result of\n  <code>\n   CreateProcess()\n  </code>\n  ) extracts and validates the signing level from the executed image's certificate.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
