I could not find the info I need from these fields but when I investigate the token address a little bit I am beginning to see strings like\n  <code>\n   uid\n  </code>\n  . What is the type of structure windbg uses to get all of this information? (Both debugger and debuggee have 32 bit architecture).\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/i2p5s.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"uid_from_address\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/i2p5s.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
