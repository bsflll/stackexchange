The ELF binary seems fine, however section tables (section header size and string table index) seem empty. For those reasons OBJDUMP didn't work on the binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is the output from the readelf.\n </p>\n <pre><code>    $ ./hexagon-readelf -a wierdBin.elf \n    ELF Header:\n      Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 01 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \n      Class:                             ELF32\n      Data:                              2's complement, little endian\n      Version:                           1 (current)\n      OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V\n      ABI Version:                       0\n      Type:                              EXEC (Executable file)\n      Machine:                           Qualcomm Hexagon\n      Version:                           0x1\n      Entry point address:               0x40200000\n      Start of program headers:          52 (bytes into file)\n      Start of section headers:          0 (bytes into file)\n      Flags:                             0x3, V4\n      Size of this header:               52 (bytes)\n      Size of program headers:           32 (bytes)\n      Number of program headers:         31\n      Size of section headers:           40 (bytes)\n      Number of section headers:         0\n      Section header string table index: 0\n\n    There are no sections in this file.\n\n    There are no sections to group in this file.\n\n    Program Headers:\n      Type           Offset   VirtAddr   PhysAddr   FileSiz MemSiz  Flg Align\n      NULL           0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00414 0x00000     0\n      LOAD           0x001000 0x40756000 0x40756000 0x01b94 0x02000     0x1000\n  [..cut for brevity..]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I have never dealt with such type of binary, I guess I have to populate those areas to get OBJDUMP working on it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Could someone help me to get it fixed? If anyone wants to take a look, I'm sharing the ELF binary.\n  <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_1GStFPqbvodDJIc1BIMTI4N00/view\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   weirdBinary.elf\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
