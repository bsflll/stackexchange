That field is described\n   <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    here\n   </a>\n   - look for the IMAGE_SCN_MEM_EXECUTE field in Section Flags.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   For the executable sections, use the raw addresses from the section header to identify where they are located and search these memory ranges for the string you are trying to identify.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  You'll do this in C using a ton of pointer arithmetic. Or, the commonsense shortcut would be to import the Microsoft header files that describe the relevant structs, like they do in\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33182852/read-pe-files-in-c\">\n   this Stack Overflow post.\n  </a>\n  That way you can declare a pointer of the relevant type and access its members by calculating their offsets by hand.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

One would be to read the whole file into a buffer, and then access that buffer at the offset of the pointer to raw data. You could copy the data from there to the end of the section into a new buffer and search only that new buffer for your target string.</span>",
