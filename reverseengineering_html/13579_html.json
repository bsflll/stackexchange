Indeed, it says that the location of driver_app.sys is:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   \\??\\C:\\Windows\\system32\\Drivers\\driver_app.sys\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  My problem is that I would like to reverse such driver, but I do not manage to find a way to get the .sys file (I cannot find it anywhere while the app is running, and when it is closed the service stops and the .sys file disappears from the list displayed by process hacker). I am just asking how to do this since I have seen some people on the Internet analyzing this kind of files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks in advance.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In this case enable \"show hidden files\" option in your file explorer.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The file is created before the use and deleted after it. In this case I'd suggest to use one of 2 options: either try to run a script that always tries to copy this file if it exists, or try to trace the program file accesses with\n   <a href=\"https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/processmonitor\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    Process Monitor\n   </a>\n   utility from sysinternals package - this will probably show you what exactly happens with the file.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
