Is possible something like that? How can I skip this check?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Imagine a global variable that gets set to 1, 2 or 3 respectively by the first checkRootMethod that succeeds. Later, your program runs one of various runAsRootMethods depending on that variable, and since the variable never got initialized, the program crashes.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

That being said, you should eliminate the simplest causes first.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Did you check logcat? Most likely you accidentally screwed up the smali or otherwise messed up the apk. You should be able to see why the app crashed by checking logcat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another thing you should check is whether the app works if you simply resign it with no code changes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyway, if it turns out that the app actually does have anti-tampering checks, you just have to reverse engineer it and disable the checks. There obviously isn't any one size fits all advice here, since anything you do is specific to the particular checks implemented.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
