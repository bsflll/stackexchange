    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm curious if anyone has any insight on how I can manipulate or mod the code for the built-in software of a digital piano (specifically the Kawai ES8 - or really any digital piano with a display screen). Like if I wanted to change the default chord progressions for the backing tracks, etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note that I don't want to connect it to my computer and read the MIDI data (latency issues) - I want to be able to mod the built-in code directly on the digital piano. I'm getting no luck googling so wanted to see if anyone could point me in the right direction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Much appreciated!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This is only a valid instruction in the\n  <code>\n   SH-2A\n  </code>\n  architecture.  (For short sequences, there are online disassemblers that let you easily change architectures so you can see which work.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Given we know that it's SH-2A, this\n  <a href=\"https://www.renesas.com/us/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/superh.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   page\n  </a>\n  seems to indicate that the MCU is likely to be from one of\n  <code>\n   SH72xx\n  </code>\n  families.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To dig further in to the code, it helps to understand more about the MCU in terms of memory maps, embedded peripherals.  In your case, as you have the hardware, opening it up and having a look at the PCB inside will probably give you the ids of the MCU and other key components.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  If you key objective is changing data (e.g. chord progressions) this is, in theory, easier than anything other than trivial modifications to code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You do however need to identify where in the firmware this info is stored. Understanding the code itself can help with this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another challenge you may face is how to persuade the firmware update process to accept your modified firmware.  You will probably have to play with version numbers and may have to reverse engineer some form of integrity check (e.g. checksum)\n </p>\n <p>\n  This may be harder if the relevant validation code is in a bootloader, not in firmware. Again, reading the relevant MCU manuals may help.  In addition, getting hold of the relevant Renesas SDK/Build Tools would help too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You might want to try making a trivial modification to one of the early UI messages in the firmware (e.g. 1 character) and try upload this.  Whether this works or not will give you a good idea of the amount of effort you are getting yourself into.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally, it is possible to badly mess-up firmware updates and 'brick' you device enough that it will need returning to the manufacturer for repair.  Do this at your own risk.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  There are tools that can help with much of this process.  e.g.\n  <code>\n   binwalk\n  </code>\n  will find the RTOS name and\n  <code>\n   binwalk -A\n  </code>\n  fill identify a few sequences of SuperH instructions.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
