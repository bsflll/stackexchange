    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have an IoT system that has a command-line-based interactive shell that can be used to configure the system. While examining the disassembly/decompilation, I realized that there is a lot of functionality/code to the CLI and a lot of possible logical paths in the program. As such, I have not outright identified any memory corruption vulnerabilities, but I suspect that there may be edge cases that could result in a bug. This is where I would normally apply fuzzing to bolster my coverage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, I am having trouble identifying an approach to creating a suitable input corpus to fuzz with. The CLI supports a number of commands, and some of them even spawn their own interactive CLI with many levels of namespaces. It may take several commands to reach certain parts of the program.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have two thoughts on how to go about this:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Create a comprehensive corpus, including a large number of commands and possible paths. Will be tedious to construct; impossible to cover everything.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   No input corpus; use entirely feedback-driven fuzzing (if even possible in this case). Seems like this would be very inefficient, as there would be many paths for the fuzzer to learn.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  I am able to run the binary through the fuzzer and I believe the fuzzer is passing input to it correctly, so that's not an issue. I was planning on using honggfuzz for this, but I don't think that really matters for the question. I don't have source code, so this will be black box and un-instrumented fuzzing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My question is, how should I approach creating an input corpus to fuzz a black-box program that has many possible inputs?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

For this, I would create a dictionary file with the following contents:\n </p>\n <pre><code>\"+\"\n\"-\"\n\"*\"\n\"/\"\n\"^\"\n...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  In addition to a typical set of input cases, this file (or a directory of files with one valid piece of syntax each) would be passed to AFL with the\n  <code>\n   -x\n  </code>\n  option, and AFL will try to create valid syntax to improve fuzzing coverage.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
