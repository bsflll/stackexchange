    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  This sounds like a very simple thing to accomplish but I can't seem to get it working.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd like to run a part of a program in ImmDbg instruction by instruction and keep track of some actions that it performs (which jumps it takes, when registers are modified, etc...). This is of course a tedious process to do by hand and sometimes I need to automate it and add some custom behavior based on the target.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't find tracing facilities in the Python APIs, so I tried to step through the code. The sample code below should simply execute 10 instructions.\n </p>\n <pre><code>import immlib\n\nimm = immlib.Debugger()\n\ndef main(args):\n    for i in range(10):\n        imm.stepIn()\n\n    return \"OK\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However, it appears to be executing sometimes less than 10 instructions and each stepIn() call freezes the program for about a second, rendering the script way too slow to perform anything useful.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
