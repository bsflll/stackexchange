    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am trying to create an instance of a class of an iOS app using Frida.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the past I have successfully done this using a command such as:\n </p>\n <pre><code>var instance = ObjC.chooseSync(ObjC.classes.TestClass)[0];\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However, in this instance, the class that I would like to create an instance of has a\n  <code>\n   .\n  </code>\n  in the name so if I try the same command as above I understandably get an error:\n </p>\n <pre><code>var instance = ObjC.chooseSync(ObjC.classes.Test.Class)[0];\nSyntaxError: expecting field name\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I had identified the class from the output of:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Object.keys(ObjC.classes).filter(function(m){ return m.toLowerCase().includes(\"test\") });\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The output of this lists a number of classes, all of which are either mangled Swift names, or have a\n  <code>\n   .\n  </code>\n  in them so I'm not sure if I simply don't understood a concept here about how Frida handles class names in a Swift and Objective-C app, or there is something I've missed in attempting to create the instance.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
