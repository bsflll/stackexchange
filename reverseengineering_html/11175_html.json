The first format is\n  industry standard DD RAW format with a \".bin\" extension. This process\n  is just a literal zero-to-max_mem_size dump of the physical memory.\n  The second format that is available is known as HPAK. HPAK is an\n  HBGary proprietary format which is capable of several key features,\n  namely the ability to store and archive the RAM and Pagefile in a\n  single archive. HPAK format also supports compression using the gzip\n  format. This is useful during instances where space on the collecting\n  device/system is limited.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  So any tool capable of handling raw physical memory dumps should be able to handle FDPro's .bin files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As for the .hpak files, from\n  <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=5hvSrBGVfIgC\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   https://books.google.com/books?id=5hvSrBGVfIgC\n  </a>\n  :\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   only HBGary's Responder product can be used to analyze an .hpak format\n  memory dump\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
