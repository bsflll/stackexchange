In this case this\n  <code>\n   + 1\n  </code>\n  means that the target of the jump is encoded in THUMB.\n </p>\n <p>\n  See\n  <a href=\"http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0204j/Cihfddaf.html\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  for more information about this mechanism.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   All these instructions cause a branch to label, or to the address\n  contained in Rm. In addition:\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    The BL and BLX instructions copy the address of the next instruction into lr (r14, the link register).\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    The BX and BLX instructions can change the processor state from ARM to Thumb, or from Thumb to ARM. BLX label always changes the state. BX\n  Rm and BLX Rm derive the target state from bit[0] of Rm:\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    if bit[0] of Rm is 0, the processor changes to, or remains in, ARM state\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    if bit[0] of Rm is 1, the processor changes to, or remains in, Thumb state.\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
