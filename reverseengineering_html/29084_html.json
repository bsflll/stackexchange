    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I recently installed Mitsubishi AC with Mitsubishi MAC-577IF2-E\nWi-Fi controller, and as always nowadays these devices communicate with Cloud servers first, then with you, which practically means you need to wait minutes for your changes to take effect.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So after setting this one up with Wireshark I found out (via DNS responses) that it communicates with\n  <a href=\"https://production.receiver.melcloud.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://production.receiver.melcloud.com/\n  </a>\n  as its TLS 1.2 (if connecting with Firefox or Chrome I get\n  <code>\n   ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH\n  </code>\n  , so I guess it's using a different cipher also) I cannot see anything\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the device has  HTTP server on port 80 (not the first setup server where you enter Wi-Fi password, but when it's already connected to Wi-Fi if you go to its IP address it has HTTP server there) and requires HTTP basic auth when trying to communicate with it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So my first step is to fire up binwalk and look at the firmware, but I don't know how to get the firmware, looking in the app is looks like that there is no firmware update option, so I was wondering is there any way to get the firmware somehow (maybe someone has it already) so I can start to play around?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I already found this:\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/ncaunt/meldec\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/ncaunt/meldec\n  </a>\n  but since my AC uses HTTPS, I am out of luck here.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I need to control my mitsubishi from my network without the use of the melcloud app. I have already dump the traffic but it is in https and I can’t read the content.
