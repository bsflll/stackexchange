    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Can anyone on here help me on decrypting the SSL encryption that protects this LUA script linked at the end of this topic ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Basically they are encoded with Base64 then SSL, but I have no idea how to do the SSL portion. They are used with a program called '\n  <em>\n   Bot of Legends\n  </em>\n  ', and someone told me that it is possible to break the encryption by dumping the decryption function of said program and using that to get the SSL key. But, I have no clue where to even start on that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Basically, these scripts work by connecting to an authentication server that is coded into the script, and I have gotten a few on my own by sniffing the traffic to their authentication server from network packets to get their server link and essentially created my own authentication server with Apache, then redirected the network traffic that goes to their server to my own from the script to get the script validated response.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For some scripts that have stronger encryption, its not that easy and I would have to get to the source code to remove the coding that runs the authentication server checks. Up until a few days ago I had no knowledge on how lua coding worked and how to even compute how authentication server checks could be even possible for coding in a simple text file due to lua obfuscation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, bear with me, I would like if someone can chime in and give me an idea on what I can do.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=bG0VqQGW\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   PasteBin to the script in question in raw format\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Base64 section is first with the SSL section at the bottom.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
