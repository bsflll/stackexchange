But dbg fails to execute that memory address.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Exploit executes calc just fine, but by attaching a debugger to the viewer program, it hangs trying to execute 38 4c 5c 36.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried to jump to that address but dbg says it is a unspecified address. I have a few questions about this memory address\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    what kind of data is loaded in memory address near 38 4c 5c 36 ? (looking at the memory map it is between loaded dll files and nothing is loaded it seems)\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    is 38 4c 5c 36 where the exploit is loaded in the memory or am I making a wrong guess?\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    If it is where exploit is loaded, what should I do to further analyze using a debugger?\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Thank you in advance :)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

SEH is overwritten by 38 4c 5c 36 also. If I string search 38 4c 5c 36 inside the malicious img file and change that to 41 41 41 41, image viewer's EIP is hijacked to 41 41 41 41. So I am guessing the exploit writer intended to hijack the control flow to 38 4c 5c 36. This is about everything I found out right now.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

This is not always the case depending on enabled memory protections. (use Mona plugin for Immunity to check this using the command\n  <code>\n   !mona mod\n  </code>\n  , or simply inspect the vulnerable binary characteristics)\n </p>\n <p>\n  If your SE Handler is pointing to\n  <code>\n   0x384c5c36\n  </code>\n  , you should put a break point at that address and hit\n  <kbd>\n   Shift\n  </kbd>\n  +\n  <kbd>\n   F9\n  </kbd>\n  to continue execution up to your breakpoint.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The rest will greatly vary on the nature of the exploit and the kind of limitations it has to bypass.
