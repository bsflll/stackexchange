Also in the latest windows version (e.g. 22h2), it looks like they removed tools that make this job easier like UI0detect and it looks like they made this task impossible.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there any way to work around this problem?\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, maybe a command line argument that runs IDA in a different session?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I suppose one solution could be to set IDA to run a remote debugging, not sure if that would work but I would consider it if nothing else works, since it looks like it's going to be a pain to set up.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
