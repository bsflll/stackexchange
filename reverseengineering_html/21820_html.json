More specifically, I would like to give the tool a program state(PC value + registers + memory content) and have it give me a set of inputs to the program that would result in that state. Can Ghidra do this? Or does anyone know if there are any other tools which can?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You would execute the program from starting state to the goal state while marking the inputs as symbolic. You can add the constraints to the goal state such as the value of this register must be equal to this value.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
