What I am trying to achieve is once an executable has been opened inside a vm which runs on Windows, I would like to extract the runtime traces for that executable, the assembly instructions. Could somebody please help me with this, if it is possible?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, if anybody knows any alternatives for extracting the runtime instructions, I would like to hear them. I tried to use PIN from Intel, PANDA, and other debuggers such as OllyDBG and Immunity Debugger, but unfortunately I did not get them to work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
