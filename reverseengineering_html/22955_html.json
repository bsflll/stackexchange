    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  While trying to decompile an application with Hex-Ray 7.0, I stumbled upon the problem that in nearly all cases, what seems to be a certain inline function will not be recognised, which bloats the code base and makes it really hard to read.\nThe function seems to be strcpy or something similar. Is there a way to have the Decompiler change the mentioned parts to an inline function? Or can I do it manually somehow?\nHere's a screenshot to illustrate my issue:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/D1Hiw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/D1Hiw.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks a lot in advance!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Get used to recognizing them visually, writing a comment if necessary, and moving on.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
