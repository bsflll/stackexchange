    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am very unsure if this is the right place to as or if I need to ask this at another forum, but here it goes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am trying to reverse engineer a .NET program with the use of dnspy. I installed dnspy with\n  <code>\n   choco install dnspy\n  </code>\n  . I was then able to start dnspy in by calling it in pwsh, but when debugging the program I get the following error\n  <code>\n   Could not start the debugger. Use 32-bit dnSpy to debug 32-bit applications\n  </code>\n  . I then\n  <a href=\"https://buildfunthings.com/posts/reversing-tear-or-dear/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   found this link\n  </a>\n  that said to restart the debugger with\n  <code>\n   dnspy-x86\n  </code>\n  . But still the debugger is 64 bit. I also tried to run dnspy by running\n  <code>\n   dnspy -x86\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I see\n  <a href=\"https://chocolatey.org/packages/dnspy#virus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  in chocolatey.org that the 32 bit is checked in virustotal. But I am unsure if the 32-bit version is included. I also cant find any information on flags or parameters dnspy is able to take.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My question is if dnspy 32 bit is installed by using choco or if one has to install the 32-bit manually. And if dnspy 32 bit is installed with choco, how do I start it in 32 bit.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

But, with a little bit of effort, I found that to install 32bit you will need to add either add:\n  <strong>\n   --x86\n  </strong>\n  or\n  <strong>\n   --forcex86\n  </strong>\n  to force x86 (32bit) installation on 64 bit systems.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To download dnspy 32 bit you would run:\n  <code>\n   choco install dnspy --x86\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Alternatively, you can go to\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy/releases\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   dnSpy\n  </a>\n  github and download it from there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   For next time please refer to\n   <a href=\"https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/commands/install\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    choco install\n   </a>\n   docs and read the entire\n   <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/help/asking\">\n    help section\n   </a>\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I hope you learn something new today â˜º\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
