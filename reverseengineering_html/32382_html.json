They also have instructions on how to run them locally, thus the runtime will depend on your resources and neither depend on the browsers memory limitations neither on the server's (depending on whether they run locally or remotely).\n </p>\n <p>\n  P.S. The above mentioned beobfuscators run on the client side, so if running them out of the browser doesn't make a big difference you probably have to increase your resources.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
