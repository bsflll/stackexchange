    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've been trying to learn\n  <a href=\"https://www.nsa.gov/resources/everyone/ghidra/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   Ghidra\n  </a>\n  by attempting to reverse the\n  <code>\n   comctl32.dll\n  </code>\n  system library, which has many of its functions documented. I started the de-compilation analysis in it, and after a while it showed this error message:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   (I don't know how soon it happened. I had to leave it to do its thing as sadly it was taking too long.)\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EI2Qz.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EI2Qz.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then I happened to see that if I go to File -> Download PDB file, then select some folder on my drive and provide Microsoft symbol path\n  <code>\n   https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols\n  </code>\n  and click\n  <code>\n   \"Download from URL\"\n  </code>\n  it seems to download it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It then asks if I want to apply it to the project and if I click\n  <code>\n   Yes\n  </code>\n  it shows this warning:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BwVGO.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BwVGO.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I'm obviously not doing it right.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thus I was curious:\n </p>\n <p>\n  A) Is it possible to provide the symbol server path and have it download needed symbol files automatically?\n </p>\n <p>\n  B) If not, what's the sequence to load symbols for a particular binary? It seems like it wants to have symbols up front, but how would I know which files/imports it may need (besides the obvious binary file that I'm opening)?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

And any US citizen should be able to add such a feature (via Java) and make a pull request to add it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I found what you do is simply add the module to your Ghidra project.\nWhen you click on the module/executable it will ask \"...Would you like to analyze it now?\".\nClick \"No\", load your PDB, and then start the analysis manually via the \"Analysis\" menu option.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
