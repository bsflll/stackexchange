A function that requires a stack frame is called a frame function. A function that does not require a stack frame is called a leaf function.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A frame function is a function that allocates stack space, calls other functions, saves nonvolatile registers, or uses exception handling. It also requires a function table entry. A frame function requires a prolog and an epilog. A frame function can dynamically allocate stack space and can employ a frame pointer. A frame function has the full capabilities of this calling standard at its disposal.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   If a frame function does not call another function then it is not required to align the stack.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  The functions above both call\n  <code>\n   __main\n  </code>\n  , so they would be considered\n  <em>\n   frame functions\n  </em>\n  . Thus, a stack frame is allocated for\n  <code>\n   main\n  </code>\n  in both cases, as we can see from the disassembly above.\n </p>\n <p>\n  According to\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/stack-allocation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Microsoft's documentation on stack allocation\n  </a>\n  ,\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   The stack will always be maintained 16-byte aligned, except within the prolog (for example, after the return address is pushed), and except where indicated in\n   <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/function-types\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Function Types\n   </a>\n   for a certain class of frame functions.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  This brings us to the original question:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Why does this program allocate 48 bytes instead of the 32 bytes from the first program?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  It is not easy to answer this directly. The short answer is stack frame alignment + vagaries of the compiler.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   The compiler is responsible for stack memory allocation\n  </strong>\n  (except when\n  <code>\n   alloca\n  </code>\n  is used at runtime to dynamically allocate memory on the stack, but that does not apply to the disassembly in question). It should be noted that in the disassembly of\n  <code>\n   main()\n  </code>\n  in program 1, nothing is saved in the created stack frame (except\n  <code>\n   %rip\n  </code>\n  , which gets pushed onto the stack 32-byte stack frame when\n  <code>\n   __main\n  </code>\n  is called) but 32 bytes are allocated anyway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In program 2,\n  <code>\n   __main\n  </code>\n  is also called, and in addition 2 4-byte integer values are written to the stack frame created for\n  <code>\n   main()\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  This allocation of \"extra\" memory is commonly done by GCC - stack frames are not allocated as compactly as possible in 64-bit and 32-bit runtime environments. A clue as to why this is the case is provided in the\n  <a href=\"http://chamilo2.grenet.fr/inp/courses/ENSIMAG3MM1LDB/document/doc_abi_ia64.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   System V ABI AMD64 Architecture Processor Supplement Draft Version 0.99.7\n  </a>\n  section 3.2.1 \"Registers and the Stack Frame\":\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BCsgH.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"SYS V AMD64 Stack Frame figure\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BCsgH.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Specifically, the \"clue\" is the \"unspecified\" area in the current stack frame. This area is not discussed further in the AMD64 ABI, but it\n  <em>\n   is\n  </em>\n  discussed in the\n  <a href=\"http://refspecs.linuxbase.org/elf/abi386-4.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   System V ABI, Intel386 Architecture Processor Supplement\n  </a>\n  section 3 \"Low Level System Information\", page 37:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Other areas depend on the compiler and the code being compiled. The standard calling sequence does not define a maximum stack frame size, nor does it restrict how a language system uses the \"unspecified\" area of the standard stack frame.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  If this extends to AMD64 architecture as well, it means that memory can be allocated by the compiler in the area of a function's stack frame between the function stack frame base pointer\n  <code>\n   %rbp\n  </code>\n  and the \"red zone\" in a way determined by the compiler itself, so long as the stack is properly aligned to a 16-byte boundary. In other words, memory allocation for this area is compiler-dependent. MSVC may allocate memory for this area of stack frames differently, for example. More specifically, a different compiler may not allocate 48 bytes for program 2's\n  <code>\n   main()\n  </code>\n  function like GCC did.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Update (thank you to Igor Skochinksy for pointing this out):\n  </em>\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   The MS doc is not totally correct; leaf function is a function which does not call other functions (it's a leaf on the function call graph); it may or may not use a stack frame (in MS ABI it doesn't but that's not necessarily the case\n   <a href=\"http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/09/06/stack-frame-layout-on-x86-64\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    elsewhere\n   </a>\n   ).\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  In addition to this, there are some important differences between the AMD64 ABI and the Windows x64 ABI:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Windows on x64 implements an ABI of its own, which is somewhat different from the AMD64 ABI...These are the main differences:\n  </p>\n  <ol>\n   <li>\n    Only 4 integer/pointer arguments are passed in registers (rcx, rdx, r8, r9).\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    There is no concept of \"red zone\" whatsoever. In fact, the ABI explicitly states that the area beyond rsp is considered volatile and unsafe to use. The OS, debuggers or interrupt handlers may overwrite this area.\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    <strong>\n     Instead, a \"register parameter area\" (also called \"home space\" sometimes) is provided by the caller in each stack frame. When a function is called, the last thing allocated on the stack before the return address is space for at least 4 registers (8 bytes each). This area is available for the callee's use without explicitly allocating it.\n    </strong>\n    It's useful for variable argument functions as well as for debugging (providing known locations for parameters, while registers may be reused for other purposes). Although the area was originally conceived for spilling the 4 arguments passed in registers, these days the compiler uses it for other optimization purposes as well (for example, if the function needs less than 32 bytes of stack space for its local variables, this area may be used without touching rsp).\n   </li>\n  </ol>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  All these points are important, but the reason I have added emphasis to the first sentence of point 3 is that it pertains specifically to our discussion of why space is allocated to stack frames the way they are by the compiler.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   main()\n  </code>\n  in program 1 has no locals or arguments passed to it, but it does indeed have a 32-byte (4 registers * 8 bytes) register parameter area.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   main()\n  </code>\n  in program 2 uses 8 bytes of space for locals, so 16 bytes of space is allocated for its stack frame plus the 32-byte register parameter area. 16 bytes are allocated for the local variables in order to maintain alignment to a 16-byte boundary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This accounts for the size difference between the stack frames created for\n  <code>\n   main()\n  </code>\n  in program 1 and program 2.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
