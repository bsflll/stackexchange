In attempting to follow the on-reset control flow, I'm hitting a few things that confuse me:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oTE6DSjA.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oTE6DSjA.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Flash for these microprocessors is mapped at 0x0800_0000 (mirrored at 0x0000_0000). 0x0000_0004/0x0800_0004 is the primary reset handler:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kNpOV9b8.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kNpOV9b8.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  What I'm stuck on is the fact that all the handlers seem to point at the actual handler function +1 (the names in the listing above are mine).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Looking at the code at 0x0800_05B9:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DaLcR9M4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DaLcR9M4.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ghidra flat out refuses to disassemble starting at 0x05B9, but if you start at 0x05B8 you get a sensible result (\n  <code>\n   cpsid\n  </code>\n  , or disable interrupts).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Basically, the question I have is why do all the interrupt vectors seem to be off by 1? Given ARM thumb mode is 16 bit, how can you even jump to an address that is not even?\n </p>\n <p>\n  What is the proper way to interpret this Interrupt Vector Table?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
