If there are, I would love to know about them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As an alternative (and I am sure you have done this), try searching for examples of MIPS shellcode and crafting exploits that work on your own framework. This is a lot of work, but there are definitely examples of MIPS shellcode and malicious embedded logic described in articles (like\n  <a href=\"http://www.shell-storm.org/shellcode\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   www.shell-storm.org/shellcode\n  </a>\n  ,\n  <a href=\"http://www.metasploit.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   metasploit\n  </a>\n  , etc.) that you could use. They are just not in a unified database. Also, you may need to do some work to craft things that will exploit things in MiBench.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I saw it and now my work is only on shellcode. but I want to extend to Virus like codes for MIPS. because shellcodes dont return to main program but viruses return to program and progrom finishes its work although malicious task done.</span>",
