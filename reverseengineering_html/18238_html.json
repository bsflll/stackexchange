The\n  <code>\n   offb\n  </code>\n  member of each\n  <code>\n   op_t\n  </code>\n  element is supposed to be the offset of the bytes corresponding to the operand in the instruction bytes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note that it may be 0 since itâ€™s not always possible to determine operand location at the byte level, especially on non-x86 architectures.
