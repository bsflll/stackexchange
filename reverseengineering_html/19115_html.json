If it results in zero then we know that the value was equal to it and we jump to the same location. So IDA identifies this as an alternative of two values:\n  <code>\n   4121000\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   4111001\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The following ifs are represented with this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>dec eax\njz loc_6DCXXX\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Remember that after the line\n  <code>\n   6DCC62\n  </code>\n  the value in\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  we compare with is already\n  <code>\n   -4111001\n  </code>\n  , so if we subtract one more time and if we get zero, we know that the initial value was\n  <code>\n   4111002\n  </code>\n  . This is why IDA represents this as:\n </p>\n <pre><code>if (Args == 4111002)\n    goto LABEL_346\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The next branches are the same. So you if want to modify the last one, you would have to modify the line that IDA correctly pointed you to + the one before. So instead of having there the same pattern as for all the other ifs, you need to write:\n </p>\n <pre><code>cmp ecx, 1006\njz 6DCD28\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and assemble such opcodes.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
