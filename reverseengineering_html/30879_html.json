Am I correct to assume that its XOR encryption?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Your best bet as always would be to find the code that does the decryption to work out what the sequence it’s xored with is, but you could also try xoring those fragments against the start of a similar PE file to see if there’s any obvious sequence in the xor stream. If it looks random then it may be a stream cipher you can’t crack and you’ll have to find the decrypt code.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
