The URL must be there some where after all the program knows how to send data to a specific host.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How do I find and change this URL?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If URL really isn't in the file, then you must locate function that is sending informations to the website. The best way is look for functions that are using Windows' network API. Then place some breakpoints to look what function is this one you are looking for. And now trace down the URL variable. Look where it came from, is it loaded from file, or registry, or anything else.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now when you know where is the URL in-file you can change it with hex editor(if it is hardcoded, or change the file/registry).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note that you need a basics of assembler to do it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or the fast(and not too good) way is to change hosts file :)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
