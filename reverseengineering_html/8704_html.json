    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've been given an ELF binary file which self describes as PowerPC 64-bit. The\n  <code>\n   e_entry\n  </code>\n  field of the ELF header points to the beginning of a section called\n  <code>\n   .opd\n  </code>\n  . According to this\n  <a href=\"http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/ELF/ppc64/PPC-elf64abi-1.9.html#ELF-HEAD\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   specification\n  </a>\n  , it is supposed to point to a function descriptor. The same\n  <a href=\"http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/ELF/ppc64/PPC-elf64abi-1.9.html#FUNC-DES\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   specification\n  </a>\n  states that a function descriptor consists of three doublewords (64-bit words).\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, the binary in question (available\n  <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/p/decompiler/feature-requests/11/attachment/21sample.elf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  ) appears to have only two 32-bit words for each function descriptor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So the question is, why are there 32-bit pointers in this 64-bit binary?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
