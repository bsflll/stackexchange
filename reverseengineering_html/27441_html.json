    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm working on a sample that contains packing and anti-analysis measures.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Using ScyllaHide plugin for x64dbg currently with all checks enabled (not sure if this would affect anything, I've tried messing with this a bit) I am able to attach the debugger to the process but I am observing some behavior I haven't encountered before.\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Looking in x64dbgs\n   <code>\n    Memory Map\n   </code>\n   tab, the processes main memory segment is layed out differently to what I've seen in the past. Normally it is of type\n   <code>\n    IMG\n   </code>\n   and contains the usual\n   <code>\n    .text\n   </code>\n   ,\n   <code>\n    .data\n   </code>\n   , etc memory segments. This samples main segment is of type\n   <code>\n    MAP\n   </code>\n   and doesn't contain the normal sections. Is this a technique? What is it called?\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  There are multiple segments in this sample, here is how they look:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Address=00004FF61EC70000\nSize=0000000001EE0000\nPage Information=malware_sample.exe\nAllocation Type=MAP\nCurrent Protection=ER---\nAllocation Protection=ER---\n\nAddress=00004FF620B50000\nSize=0000000000650000\nPage Information=malware_sample.exe\nAllocation Type=MAP\nCurrent Protection=-RW--\nAllocation Protection=-RW--\n\nAddress=00004FF6211A0000\nSize=000000000013B000\nPage Information=malware_sample.exe\nAllocation Type=MAP\nCurrent Protection=-R---\nAllocation Protection=-R---\n</code></pre>\n <ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>\n   When trying to set breakpoints or patch memory x64dbg fails on the first segment I listed. I am able to place breakpoints on the second segment so my guess is the protection is preventing breakpoints/patching (\n   <code>\n    Current Protection=ER---\n   </code>\n   )?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   When trying to alter the protection of the memory segment in x64dbg using\n   <code>\n    Set Page Memory Rights\n   </code>\n   to test if that is the cause of the failure to patch/bps I get an error saying there was a failure to change the memory protection. What can cause this? Is there anti-debugging tricks to prevent changing memory protection?\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
