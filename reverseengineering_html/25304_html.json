(if it's named a \"protocol\")\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Most garage doors use the KeeLoq protocol which is 66 bytes of data, 28 byte serial number, 4 bytes of button information, 2 bytes status, and 32 bytes of actual rolling code.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

You should be through trying every possibility in a minute or two, over the air. So, if you are wondering whether this is a safe system against someone who has an SDR: no, it's not. No further investigation needed. Is that really relevant as a threat model? Probably not. How many robbers are technologically more advanced than a crowbar?\n</span>\n</body></html>",
