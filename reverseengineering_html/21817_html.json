After attempting to decompile I get the error:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Decompilation failure:\n  11E1640: too big function\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  I've increased my max function size for decompilation to 512K (defaults at 64), the main function is approx. 400K. But this is too much processing and IDA froze for at least 5 minutes before I gave up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there an alternative approach to decompiling a large (400K) function using Hex-Rays decompiler? Maybe partial decompilation, or non-default decompiler configuration.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   IDA: Version 7.2.181105\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Hex-Rays Decompiler: v7.0.0.170914\n  </em>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It'd be good if you would state both the IDA and Hex-Rays versions, so there is a chance we can better help. Alternatively you could send an email to the Hex-Rays support. In the past they were generally very helpful whenever I ran into an issue.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

I've heard it can decompile larger functions without much error.\n </p>\n <p>\n  According to them it supports decompiling a whole binary file. So it possibly could decompile this function without much hesitation. Although I can't promise anything.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Good luck! :-)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
