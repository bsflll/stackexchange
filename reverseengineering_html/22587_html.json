I'm hoping somebody here has access to a Strix version of the Vega 56 or 64 on a windows machine? If you do, would you please dump the\n  <code>\n   smbus\n  </code>\n  . This can be done using a demo version of AIDA64. Right click the bottom status bar and select \"debug video -> dump ATI SMBUS\" (or something like that).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have the Polaris line of cards figured out, but Vega and Navi have thrown me a curve ball.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
