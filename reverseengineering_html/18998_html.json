The general term for this is IPC (Interprocess Communications). On Windows, the following\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/ipc/interprocess-communications\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   forms of IPC\n  </a>\n  are commonly used:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   COM\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Window messages (simple messages for small data amounts,\n   <code>\n    WM_COPYDATA\n   </code>\n   for bigger amounts)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   File mapping, or named shared memory\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Shared memory\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Pipes (named or anonymous)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Sockets (e.g. TCP/IP)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   passing info via command-line arguments (though this is not really IPC)\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Less common but still possible:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Clipboard\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Mailslots\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   RPC (remote procedure call)\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Which one is actually used is difficult to say with limited information you provided. Using an API monitor, as suggested by @dsasmblr may give you some hints. You can also just debug or RE the executable which processes user input and see what is being done with the entered information.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
