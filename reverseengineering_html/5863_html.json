    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am currently writing a plugin for the Hex-Ray's Decompiler to be used on IDA 6.2. The basic gist is that it is supposed to get the decompiled functions and run some automated analysis on it, nothing exceptional.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My issue is that apparently IDA redefines the function\n  <code>\n   vsscanf\n  </code>\n  in the\n  <code>\n   pro.h\n  </code>\n  file, which is already defined in\n  <code>\n   stdio.h\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Precisely, the snippet that does this is as follows (lines 426-428 in the\n  <code>\n   pro.h\n  </code>\n  file):\n </p>\n <pre><code>// non standard functions are missing:\n#ifdef _MSC_VER\nAS_SCANF(2, 0) int idaapi vsscanf(const char *input, const char *format, va_list va);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now, I am honestly at loss as to how to resolve this issue and could not find any decent leads searching the web. I tried compiling this with MS Visual Studio 2013 on Win7 x64. But, with no success.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My best lead is that IDA will try this definition when compiling with MSVS.\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70013/how-to-detect-if-im-compiling-code-with-visual-studio-2008\">\n   As seen here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of my considerations is to try and change the\n  <code>\n   pro.h\n  </code>\n  file. But, I am really not sure how that would work out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks for your time in advance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit: I solved this by reverting to MSVS 2010. Apparently IDA 6.2/sdk 6.2 is not compatible with the modern MSVS 2013.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

After some search in the pro.h preprocessors i found that apparently when running in MSVS IDA will include stdio.h on its own, which is very curious to me by setting the USE_DANGEROUS_FUNCTIONS variable. These are my includes:  #include &lt;hexrays.hpp&gt; #include &lt;kernwin.hpp&gt; #include &lt;ida.hpp&gt; #include &lt;idp.hpp&gt; #include &lt;funcs.hpp&gt; #include &lt;gdl.hpp&gt; #include &lt;segment.hpp&gt;</span>",
