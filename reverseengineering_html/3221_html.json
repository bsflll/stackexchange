(The modules are from the InLoadOrder module list)\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is just an excerpt (full list:\n  <a href=\"http://pastie.org/8560797\">\n   http://pastie.org/8560797\n  </a>\n  ):\n </p>\n <pre><code>0x5b860000 netapi32.dll\nFileObject @8a3cb028, Name: \\WINDOWS\\system32\netapi32.dll\n\n0x77f60000 shlwapi.dll\nFileObject @8a3e0df0, Name: \\WINDOWS\\system32\\shlwapi.dll\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  As you can see there is a shlwapi.dll loaded in the process.Thanks to DependencyWalker (looking at the imports of services.exe) I found out how shlwapi.dll is loaded. ( -> means imports )\n </p>\n <p>\n  netapi.dll -> dnsapi.dll -> iphlpapi.dll -> mprapi.dll -> setupapi.dll -> shlapi.dll\n </p>\n <p>\n  But only netapi.dll is loaded. dnsapi.dll is not loaded, there is no entry for it in the InLoadOrder module list, neither is any of the other dlls from the from the above \"dependency chain\" loaded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is not only for shlapi.dll but for many other dll's that are loaded as well. For example: shell32.dll, psapi.dll... Neither does this only happen for services.exe process.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any ideas why these dlls are loaded into the process?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any help is most appreciated, regards!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

However, the shlwapi.dll might hold some handles to objects open for whatever reason, or have a non-zero reference count because of circular loading, and thus remain in memory even after the other DLLs have unloaded.  A request to unload does not guarantee that it will be honored, nor does it prevent the requester from unloading first.  user32.dll is another DLL that usually displays this behavior.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Looking at the dlls loaded by a csrss.exe process (which actually imports only ntdll.dll and csrsrv.dll) I found a bunch of other dlls in the process space, namely: basesrv.dll, winsrv.dll, user32.dll, sxs.dll, kernel32.dll, gdi32.dll, advapi32.dll, rpcrt4.dll. Where do these imports come from? They are neither dependecies of ntdll.dll nor of csrsrv.dll. Thank you!</span>",
