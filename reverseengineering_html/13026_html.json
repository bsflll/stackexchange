So far so good.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Without wasting days trying to find a disassembler, is there anything that could help me glean any further information from this type of executable? I already know about\n  <a href=\"https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/strings.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Sysinternals Strings\n  </a>\n  application. I've also found something that can dump the assembly code (for all the good this does me!).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The best you'll really get is IDA pro for reverse engineering and that is time consuming. The best way is probably write tests for the current exe, and then build your new exe to be compliant with the tests.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Otherwise it is usually much faster to encode the App from scratch mirroring functionality then dive into disassembling and hoping that disassembled stuff will make some sense or even work as should.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
