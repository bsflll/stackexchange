It is particular useful if you want to read shellcode embedded into some file and you know relative position. You will have to\n  <code>\n   open()\n  </code>\n  the file with \"b\" option for it to work. Consult\n  <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/release/2.4.4/lib/bltin-file-objects.html\">\n   Python File Object Library Reference\n  </a>\n  for details.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
