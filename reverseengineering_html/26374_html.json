    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I want to download the\n  <code>\n   .pdb\n  </code>\n  files of Windows binaries (e.g.,\n  <code>\n   notpad.exe\n  </code>\n  ) on machines where the user doesn't have admin rights, nor has any debugger available. I was wondering if it is possible to download the PDB files using Windows built-in functionalities such as cmd/batch, Powershell, or WSH VBScript or JScript?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I think the first step is to find the globally unique identifier (GUID) of the binary, and then probably there are some URL queries one can use to download the specific program database file of the built.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   P.S.1.\n  </strong>\n  Apparently the New Technology Symbolic Debugger (NTSD) used to come built into the Windows OS. I am not aware of the OS includes any debuggers by default anymore.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   P.S.2.\n  </strong>\n  From\n  <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/k103rd/is_it_possible_to_download_program_database_pdb/gdlaew2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   this comment\n  </a>\n  , I was pointed towards the\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/rajkumar-rangaraj/PDB-Downloader/blob/master/SymbolFetch/UrlBuilder.cs#L42\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   right URI\n  </a>\n  to download the exact PDB file, given the GUID of the binary. Now the problem is to know how to extract the GUID from the binary itself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   P.S.3.\n  </strong>\n  I am wondering if the CLSID/GUID/ProgID of all binaries are stored in the registry and one can manually map them to the specific\n  <code>\n   .dll\n  </code>\n  /\n  <code>\n   .exe\n  </code>\n  files.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
