It's practically more or less hacking, you're rerouting a program to do what you want it to do with your own function. Usually by placing the opcode\n  <code>\n   0xE9\n  </code>\n  (known as\n  <code>\n   JMP\n  </code>\n  , also added with some\n  <code>\n   0x90\n  </code>\n  which is\n  <code>\n   NOP\n  </code>\n  , for alignment) inside of the memory address you're detouring, that\n  <code>\n   JMP\n  </code>\n  s to your personal function you wrote.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I recommend reading up on x86 Assembly, along with detouring itself. It's a pretty basic topic once you get it down, but it's definitely a struggle to start learning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Resources to get you started:\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTl3MFVKSUM\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Detour Video by Guide\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Virginia EDU for x86 Assembly\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
