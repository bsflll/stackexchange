    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  In OllyDbg 1.10 it was possible to skip some parts of code when starting run trace(just example):\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lLiXR.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So when there is some heavy code it was possible to skip to trace only some useful information.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I cannot find same \"Run trace -> Skip selection from run trace\" option in OllyDbg 2.01. I cannot find any info on that on the internet too. Does it mean there is no such option in the newer version of the software? How is this possible at all?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I need to exclude some heavy code that is always present in the run trace, but I don't need it, and I cannot interact with the application when it records all those lines.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   update\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is an answer that shows some workaround, but this is not exactly what 1.10 has, because in 1.10 you can select the code and just skip it. So I just want confirmation if this functionality was removed from the new version of OllyDbg, or there is some other (but also comfortable, not manual) way to do it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

My intention is to add the whole module first, then when run trace is run, I see what parts I don't need and just skip them. Manually it takes time to put skipped parts to the range. I am thinking about maybe to write plugin which will do the job.</span>",
