    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I attached Ollydbg to a process, and try to set breakpoint on\n  <code>\n   CreateWindowExW\n  </code>\n  . I typed\n </p>\n <pre><code>bpx CreateWindowExW\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  in command line. Then I checked the Breakpoints window and found it's totally empty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The same thing works smoothly in IDA pro -- I attached IDA pro to the process I'm going to debug, then in \"Modules\" window, I choose\n  <code>\n   user32.dll\n  </code>\n  and right click on\n  <code>\n   CreateWindowExW\n  </code>\n  and choose \"Add breakpoint\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  Actually, I found setting breakpoint on Win32 API in Ollydbg is very very hard to use. Based on all information I got by Google, I only need to run\n  <code>\n   bpx xxxxx\n  </code>\n  to set this kind of breakpoints, but in fact, it's rarely success. Most of time, no breakpoints were set by this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Did I miss something?\n </p>\n <p>\n  BTW: The process I debugged loaded a lot of DLLs dynamically. Is this the problem?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

However, before I ask this question, I tried my best to search and read related materials including this <a href=\"http://www.ollydbg.de/faq.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">FAQ page</a>. In section 3, it described exactly the method I mentioned above but not yours. Could please tell me the difference between these two methods, and where is the help file you mentioned?</span>",

You should disregard that part of the FAQ (<code>Alt</code>+<code>F1</code> doesn't do anything in OllyDbg 2.0, anyway).

I can only use Ollydbg 1.10 because every time i attach Ollydbg 2.0 to the process I'm debugging will hang both Ollydbg and target process(Ollydbg become no responding when analyzing some modules which used by this process, like user32.dll). Also, Ollydbg 1.10 can only be attached to the target process once -- when I restarted the process I'm debugging, I need to restart Ollydbg too or attaching to target process will hang it, although Ollydbg said it's running. Maybe a bug.. :-(</span>",
