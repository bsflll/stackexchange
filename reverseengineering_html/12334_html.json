    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'd like to mark some data as being an enum, and have that automatically propagate to all uses of this piece of data. Both direct accesses to the data (e.g.\n  <code>\n   cmp data_with_enum_type, enum_value\n  </code>\n  ), and future use by any register it is copied into (e.g.\n  <code>\n   mov al, data_with_enum_type | cmp al, enum_value\n  </code>\n  ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is this possible in IDA, or something that could be straightforwardly scripted, or something an existing plugin may handle?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
