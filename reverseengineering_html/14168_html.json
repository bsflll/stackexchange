The file has a very high entropy which indicates that it's probably encrypted and not compressed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The header in the file could be a lot of things, but it doesn't have any known magic bytes at the beginning and doesn't appear to belong to any commonly known file type.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Your best bet with getting anywhere is to reverse engineer the software that reads these files. Try finding the routine that decrypts the file in memory and either try to identify which algorithm it's using or recreate the routine in a higher level language (if that's your goal). You'll also need to figure out what the decryption key is for the file (hell, it could even be the header they put in every file - but don't hold your breath) which you should be able to determine while reverse engineering the software.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Keep in mind that many commercial software packages have an EULA that explicitly forbids you from reverse engineering the software in any way which paves the way for legal recourse if you get caught and the software creators decide to pursue it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Good Luck!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
