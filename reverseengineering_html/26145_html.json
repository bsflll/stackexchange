    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am trying to do some dynamic analysis on a couple of ELF binaries with\n  <code>\n   gdb\n  </code>\n  . However, since those two are directly downloaded (ELF binary file only) with no additional information related to compilation/linking etc., I am not able to set up the proper environment in order to run them within\n  <code>\n   gdb\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  In particular, I am receiving the following errors:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    warning: Error reading shared library list entry at 0x1600\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    warning: Corrupted shared library list: 0x804c7c0 != 0x7c\n   </code>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Do you know how could I possibly resolve those issues or what can I do in order to set my environment properly for dynamic analysis?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you so much in advance for all of your input.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
