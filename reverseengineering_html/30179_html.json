    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm almost definitely being an idiot but I have opened up an .exe file in x64dbg and I can run the file just fine when looking at the assembly but it doesn't open a second window so I can see the program and interact with it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It seems to work with some other programs but not with others, is there any reason for this? Essentially all the programs that don't seem to run via x64dbg are older programs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Example of how it usually works:\n  </strong>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yGubJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yGubJ.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   This is the issue I'm now getting:\n  </strong>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YJfeC.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YJfeC.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Also what it looks like from quick look at the web, PixtopianBook is a GUI app so I would not expect to see a console there.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

But by what you've said I assume the x64dbg will only run a separate window for a console and not a GUI application, is that correct?\n</span>\n</body></html>",
