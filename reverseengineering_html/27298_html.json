    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm writing a compiler from .NET CIL code to some high level language. Process is similar to decompilation. I have done some control flow analysis - detecting loops, ifs, and so on. In terms of data flow analysis i've done simple expression propagation by simulating some instructions involving evaluation stack - I treat evaluation stack as hidden variable, push more complex expressions on it, and whenever there is any assignment instruction to some variable (for example\n  <code>\n   starg\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   stloc\n  </code>\n  ) - I pop and assign propagated expression from stack to this variable and translate this expression into statement in high language code. Of course for now it is so simple that it generates failures. Consider a function written in C#:\n </p>\n <pre><code>int GCD(int n1, int n2)\n{\n    while(n2 != 0)\n    {\n        int c = n1 % n2;\n        n1 = n2;\n        n2 = c;\n    }\n\n    return n1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This function compiles to IL:\n </p>\n <pre><code>.method private hidebysig \n    instance int32 GCD (\n        int32 n1,\n        int32 n2\n    ) cil managed \n{\n    .maxstack 8\n\n    IL_0000: br.s IL_000a\n        IL_0002: ldarg.1    // load n1 on eval stack\n        IL_0003: ldarg.2    // load n2 on eval stack\n        IL_0004: rem        // pop n1 and n2 from stack, compute n1 % n2 and push it on stack\n        IL_0005: ldarg.2    // load n2 on stack\n        IL_0006: starg.s n1 // pop n2 from stack and store it in n1\n        IL_0008: starg.s n2 // pop n1 % n2 from stack and store it in n2\n\n        IL_000a: ldarg.2\n        IL_000b: brtrue.s IL_0002\n\n    IL_000d: ldarg.1\n    IL_000e: ret\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  With this simple propagation we push\n  <code>\n   n1 % n2\n  </code>\n  on stack, then load\n  <code>\n   n2\n  </code>\n  on stack, then we have\n  <code>\n   starg\n  </code>\n  instruction, so we pop expression from stack and translate assignment to statement. Then we pop again, and do the same. Result code looks like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>GCD(n1, n2) {\n    while (n2) { \n        n1 = n2;\n        n2 = (n1 % n2); \n    }\n    return n1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This indicates that I have to do something inverse to dead code elimination, maybe called like \"necessary code introduction\". I searched for some sources about methods to introduce new variables in decompilation, but I did not find any. Do you have any ideas?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
