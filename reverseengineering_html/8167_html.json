I'm effectively interested in running the program and its metadata through strings. I've noticed a simple\n  <code>\n   grep\n  </code>\n  does not return expected results and I suspect its because of compressed/binary plist files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How can I search trough the IPA and dump the key value pairs from a compressed/binary plist?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Just use\n  <a href=\"http://binwalk.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   binwalk\n  </a>\n  to find the offset and the compression algorithm. Then decompress and dump the strings. Keep in mind that you may want to specify the encoding sometimes, eg:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ string -e l input_file\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
