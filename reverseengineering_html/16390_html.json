In order to do that I tried to use QEMU.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sadly, no matter what, I'm getting a system crash.\n  \n\n  I started with:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a9 -hda R8300-V1.0.2.100_1.0.82.chk \nWarning: Orphaned drive without device: id=scsi0-hd0,file=R8300-V1.0.2.100_1.0.82.chk,if=scsi,bus=0,unit=0\nqemu: fatal: Trying to execute code outside RAM or ROM at 0x04000000\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  As far as I can understand QEMU has a driver but he doesn't know what do to with that.\nSo I tried to specify more params manually:\n </p>\n <pre><code>qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a9 \\\n   -drive file=R8300-V1.0.2.100_1.0.82.chk,format=raw \\\n   -device scsi-hd,id=scsi0-hd0\n\nqemu-system-arm: -device scsi-hd,id=scsi0-hd0: No 'SCSI' bus found for device 'scsi-hd'\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I tried to play with some different device type, but it seems that I can't find the correct bus.\n  \n\n  I even tried to split the image into different pieces (kernel and filesystem), but I still got a crash.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm pretty new to reverse engineering, can I have some hints or suggestions on what should I do to boot my firmware image?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   EDIT\n  </strong>\n  . \nPlaying a little with the command I was able to get a different error message:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a9 -cpu cortex-a9 \\\n   -redir tcp:8888::80 -m 512 \\\n   -drive file=R8300V1.0.2.100_1.0.82.chk,format=raw \\\n   -device scsi id=scsi0-hd0,if=ide-hd\n\nqemu-system-arm: -device scsi: drive with bus=0, unit=0 (index=0) exists  \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I tried to specify a different bus, unit and index, but the error is still the same\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Instead, try to run a single target binary with\n  <code>\n   qemu-system-arm -E PATH=\"/bin:/usr/bin\" -E OTHERENVVARS=foo -g 10000 ./myTargetBinary\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  See slides 27+ in my presentation\n  <a href=\"https://files.sans.org/summit/hackfest2015/PDFs/IoT-Devices-Fall-Like-Backward-Capacitors-Or-the-Month-Josh-Was-Forced-to-Wear-Pants-Josh-Wright.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   https://files.sans.org/summit/hackfest2015/PDFs/IoT-Devices-Fall-Like-Backward-Capacitors-Or-the-Month-Josh-Was-Forced-to-Wear-Pants-Josh-Wright.pdf\n  </a>\n  . You may need to setup the appropriate\n  <code>\n   chroot\n  </code>\n  for the necessary libraries in\n  <code>\n   myTargetBinary\n  </code>\n  . Often, errors in running a binary requires more analysis to identify missing conf files, necessary environment variables, specific hardware access, etc., requiring some preliminary static disassembly prior to runtime analysis.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
