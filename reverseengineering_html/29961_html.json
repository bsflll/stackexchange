    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a device which can be connected via USB port. The vendor of this device provides a tool for upgrading firmware of this device via USB port.\n  <code>\n   lsusb\n  </code>\n  command says that this device has following VendorID and ProductID 0483:5748 STMicroelectronics Program Upgrade V1.0. So I assume that this device is STM based. My question is - if there is a tool for uploading firmware to device via USB, is there a way of downloading current firmware of this device via USB back to my PC? And if there is such way, how do I do that? I stumbled across some links on the Internet like this one\n  <a href=\"https://medium.com/techmaker/reverse-engineering-stm32-firmware-578d53e79b3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://medium.com/techmaker/reverse-engineering-stm32-firmware-578d53e79b3\n  </a>\n  it recommends to use\n  <code>\n   openocd\n  </code>\n  tool. But in my case\n  <code>\n   openocd\n  </code>\n  just gives me an error\n </p>\n <pre><code>Open On-Chip Debugger 0.11.0-rc2\nLicensed under GNU GPL v2\nFor bug reports, read\n        http://openocd.org/doc/doxygen/bugs.html\nWARNING: interface/stlink-v2.cfg is deprecated, please switch to interface/stlink.cfg\nInfo : auto-selecting first available session transport \"hla_swd\".
