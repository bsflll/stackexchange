    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am reversing an APK and there is a\n  <strong>\n   signature\n  </strong>\n  that needs to be found.\nThe function from where the signature is generated is present in the\n  <strong>\n   .so\n  </strong>\n  file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I did\n  <strong>\n   small debugging\n  </strong>\n  . While doing it, the debugger shows all other processes, and when it is actually creating a signature, it automatically returns from the\n  <strong>\n   .so\n  </strong>\n  file to the apk and give the result in byte array format which is 92 of length, and after converting it to hex, it returns 192 hash value.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For all the input cases input length is 100 or 1000 the output hash value is 192.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can anyone help me like which encryption gives\n  <strong>\n   192 hash value\n  </strong>\n  ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I got all the information except the actual signature generation part. I can also share the assembly code if someone wants to help me.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
