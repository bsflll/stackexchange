    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a 32-bit ARM Linux kernel module with debug symbols. When it is decompiled, it produces many functions that have a macro called\n  <code>\n   MEMORY\n  </code>\n  in them. Here is an example:\n </p>\n <pre><code>int S_u8init_flag = 0; // Context for function internals\nint aess_adcsensor_release(inode *inode, file *filp) {\n  int result;\n\n  result = 0;\n  MEMORY[0xF0014000] &= 0xFFFDFFFF; // What does this mean?\n  S_u8init_flag = 0;\n  return result;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  What does this\n  <code>\n   MEMORY\n  </code>\n  macro mean? Is there a C99 equivalent to it, or is it an IDA-specific macro?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
