I have a collection of\n  <code>\n   .NET\n  </code>\n  malware that I'm analyzing and would like to see the imported functions and DLLs for these binaries. I've noticed that\n  <code>\n   _CorExeMain\n  </code>\n  is the only thing that I can see in the\n  <code>\n   imports\n  </code>\n  section with tools such as\n  <code>\n   IDA\n  </code>\n  for such binaries. I'm aware that I can decompile the\n  <code>\n   .NET\n  </code>\n  binary in a tool like\n  <code>\n   dnSpy\n  </code>\n  and manually read the function calls but I would like an automated and fast of doing this such as the\n  <code>\n   imports\n  </code>\n  section in\n  <code>\n   IDA\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way to see functions imported from dynamic libraries for\n  <code>\n   .NET\n  </code>\n  binaries?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
