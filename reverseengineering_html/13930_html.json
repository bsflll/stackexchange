I found the microsoft update catalog, where all updates are stored, and I managed to look for some of them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But my problem is now that the actual download link is behind a button, which opens a new window where I can't see the actual URL with the GET parameter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I already tried to intercept GET/POST requests through chrome but it didn't trigger the dev tools of chrome, since it opens a new window.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The button I am talking about is for example here:\n  <a href=\"https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=MS16-141\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=MS16-141\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can anybody help me out on this one and give me a link with the parameter which\n  <a href=\"https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/DownloadDialog.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/DownloadDialog.aspx\n  </a>\n  uses?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
