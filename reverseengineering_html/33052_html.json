    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I wrote a simple virtualization-obfuscated x64 packer. But my problem is I cannot dump and unpack it with Scylla. For who wants to analyze this exe themself, set BP at 00007FF630DB26A1. The call at this address will get you to OEP. When I dump it and fix the imports, the program breaks and EntryPoint looks incorrect. I allocated the memory space by VirtualAlloc. Maybe Scylla cant dump dynamic memory spaces but idk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Packed EXE :\n  <a href=\"https://dosya.co/eciwyncesp7k/packed.exe.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://dosya.co/eciwyncesp7k/packed.exe.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also I recommend analyzing this file with ScyllaHide full options.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
