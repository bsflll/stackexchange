This should help find you the actual method body, at least it's what I have been using.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I don't think it's ideal but also I don't know of a better way either. For bigger APKs this can be quite slow but at least it solves the problem.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

While IDA Pro sort of supports Java decompilation (I guess you're interested in Android stuff), there are much more convenient decompilers for Java pseudocode. JEB is the best for Android, in my opinion. I haven't used it much recently, though.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or even \"decompile\" the whole dex into a text file via and grep.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/search?q=dex+decompiler\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.google.com.au/search?q=dex+decompiler\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you're looking at pure Java - again, tons of \"decompilers\". Even IntelliJ has a plugin :)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Moreover it's a simple <i>search</i> feature in already available data... I'm not asking for the moon!</span>",
