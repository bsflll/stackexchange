It would change the image base when I reopen the binary and start run it, and would not change the image base when I click the restart icon in OllyDbg.

Most modern OSes employ ASLR on user mode processes (Some OSes do that for kernel mode code as well, at least partially) where this is possible.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The major advantage of ASLR is that it increases the difficulty if exploiting memory corruption based exploits (often requires a information leak type of bug to mitigate), and therefore encouraged by the security community.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In order to be ASLRed, an image must be\n  <em>\n   relocatable\n  </em>\n  . That is, it is required to properly function regardless of where in memory it is located. This tends to be complicated because certain instructions (in certain architecture) are position based. For example, on the x86 architecture the\n  <a href=\"http://x86.renejeschke.de/html/file_module_x86_id_26.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <code>\n    CALL\n   </code>\n  </a>\n  instructions can be either\n  <em>\n   relative\n  </em>\n  or\n  <em>\n   absolute\n  </em>\n  , making it impossible to change the addresses at which the image is loaded without risking crashes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  An image can either make sure it only uses\n  <em>\n   relative\n  </em>\n  instructions (which might be difficult at times) or provide a\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_(computing)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <em>\n    relation table\n   </em>\n  </a>\n  as part of the image file. A relation table explicitly lists all absolute addresses used in the image for the loader to fix in case the image is relocated.\n </p>\n <h3>\n  How to avoid ASLR?\n </h3>\n <p>\n  Obviously, disabling ASLR is not encouraged because of the protection it provides. On 64bit windows user mode ASLR is\n  <em>\n   mandatory\n  </em>\n  , so you simply cannot disable it. However, on 32bit windows, you're allowed to and can disable it by disabling the relevant PE flag, by un-checking the marked checkbox in the following image:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/W6QfF.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"disabling ASLR\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/W6QfF.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
