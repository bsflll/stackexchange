Usually I can just use the xrefs in IDA, but in this case it doesn't show me anything. However, if I set a breakpoint at it I can see it being called when I connect. So my question to you is: how can I find out how the program got to the sendmsg?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

As long as no stack frame has been created the return value should be the first thing on the stack above ESP.  Take the image below:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Fxn41.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Assuming\n  <code>\n   sendmsg\n  </code>\n  is where\n  <code>\n   Bar()\n  </code>\n  is located, the return address would be the location in\n  <code>\n   Foo()\n  </code>\n  after\n  <code>\n   sendmsg\n  </code>\n  was called.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm not sure which debugger you're using (would be useful information), but in GDB you can look at the top of the stack (the return value) by using the following command:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   (gdb) x/20xw $esp\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  This technique is useful when following object-oriented code, and xrefs are hard to come by.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Backtrace\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or as suggested by Guntram Blohm you can use a backtrace.  In GDB:\n </p>\n <pre><code>(gdb) bt    ; Prints entire backtrace\n(gdb) bt n  ; Prints 'n' innermost frames\n(gdb) bt -n ; Prints 'n' outermost frames\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
