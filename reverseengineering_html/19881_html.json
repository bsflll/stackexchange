So I am looking for a way to save my analysis progress and if possible retain renamed variables.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It currently doesn't work because if I open it again another time it won't load the renamed variables and I can't do stuff like \"ood\" which is the way to reopen the binary as far as I'm concerned. But there are no errors.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After invoking radare2 with\n  <code>\n   r2 -d calc\n  </code>\n  I run\n  <code>\n   aa\n  </code>\n  and then\n  <code>\n   Ps calc_project\n  </code>\n  . After that I close the terminal and open up a new one. Then I start with\n  <code>\n   r2 -d calc\n  </code>\n  again and follow it with\n  <code>\n   Po calc_project\n  </code>\n  . Now, there are many errors which appear to be the same over and over again:\n </p>\n <pre><code>fcn_recurse failed\nCannot add basic block\", that message 50 times or more.\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Version information:\n </p>\n <pre><code>radare2 version: \nradare2 3.1.0-git 20049 @ linux-x86-64 git.3.0.1-214-g5759f21\ncommit: 5759f217c941478ef265bf9a6ba5e23cd646661a\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
