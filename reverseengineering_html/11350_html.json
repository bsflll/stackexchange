    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Maybe someone could help me with the following problem:\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have an interesting byte sequence that I found within a MIPS ELF binary that exists on the hard drive. This byte sequence may be, for example,\n  <code>\n   9c 6c 3c 04 80 2d 24 84 85\n  </code>\n  . Now I want to find this byte sequence with IDAPython. Therefore, I use the\n  <code>\n   idc.FindBinary()\n  </code>\n  function like so:\n </p>\n <pre><code>address = idc.FindBinary(0, SEARCH_DOWN, byte_sequence)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  which finds the first occurrence of the byte sequence at\n  <code>\n   address\n  </code>\n  . In general I want to achieve two things:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    I want to colorize the effected affected lines in the IDA View\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    I want to get the disassembled instructions\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Currently there are two subproblems I want to solve:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    The byte sequence may start\n    <strong>\n     within\n    </strong>\n    the instruction, for example, in a\n    <code>\n     jal address\n    </code>\n    the byte sequence starts at\n    <code>\n     address\n    </code>\n    instead of at\n    <code>\n     jal\n    </code>\n    .\n    <strong>\n     How can I search backwards to find the beginning of the instruction when the byte sequence started within the instruction?\n    </strong>\n    Colorizing works with:\n   </p>\n   <pre><code>SetColor(address, CIC_ITEM, 0x208020)\n</code></pre>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    If the byte sequence is 9 bytes long (as in the example above),\n    <strong>\n     how can I tell IDAPython to disassemble all 9 bytes\n    </strong>\n    . I would have to know how \"long\" the instructions are that IDAPython disassembles to get to the next instruction. What I know is that I can disassemble at a single addresses with:\n   </p>\n   <pre><code>disasm = idc.GetDisasm(address)\n</code></pre>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
