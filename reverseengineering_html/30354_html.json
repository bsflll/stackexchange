You can, for example,  check the list of modules using Process Explorer or similar and look for it on disk, or catch the load event in the debugger - the file should be available at that point even if itâ€™s deleted afterwards.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In theory it'd also be possible for a DLL to get loaded, do whatever it wants to do and then get unloaded. But Igor's suggestions are probably <i>the</i> way to go for starters.</span>",
