The folder containing the IDAPython script on the host machine is shared with the VM.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first time I run the IDAPython script in IDA it works fine. However, for subsequent runs a cached version of the script seems to be running. I end up having to close and re-start IDA in order for the changes to get loaded up. Is there an easier way? I run scripts as\n  <code>\n   File > Open Script file.\n  </code>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
