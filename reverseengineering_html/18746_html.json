If I try to add something like: \"hello\", OllyDBG will just translate the bytes into commands and edit the assembly commands into the program.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way to just add the ASCII string into the program?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You can use the hex view to check the bytes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can always use a hexeditor to modify data and code. If you want to 'add' the string, you may need to inflate the file and fix segment/section offsets of the file format you are using.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Possibly related question:\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23202472/hexadecimal-editing-with-and-without-ollydbg-weird-issue\">\n   Hexadecimal editing with and without ollydbg weird issue\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
