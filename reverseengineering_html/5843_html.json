Is it possible to open the 3ds up and connect a probe somewhere on the chip and dump the RAM contents? Im looking for data on game mechanics etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Im new to this so I could have wrongly understood the process. If anyone could perhaps explain the process to me for a general system not a 3ds (if that is easier), what equipment I would need and what exactly I would need to do to dump the ram contents.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also if there are any resources for beginners that you recommend can you post them here please?\nI should say that I program in c and I am looking to learn reverse engineering as a hobby.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
