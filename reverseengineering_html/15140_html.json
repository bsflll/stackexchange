Is there idapython call of some sorts? Can plugins be a reason for this? Is there GUI option to check?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Found this, but it didnt help\n  \n\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/sdkdoc/name_8hpp.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/sdkdoc/name_8hpp.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

But if I select the string manually (here:\n  <code>\n   *v3;\n  </code>\n  ) only occurrences of this exact string are highlighted,\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you can provide any additional information, please disclose it. I'm afraid it can not be helped otherwise. Can you maybe come up with a minimal example exhibiting the bug?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
