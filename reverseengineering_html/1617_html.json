That post seems to confirm that we're on the right track, and gives you a place to interpose and a way to extract the query string.\n </p>\n <h1>\n  Methodology\n </h1>\n <p>\n  I felt like this would be most easily tackled using some form of Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI); since we suspect the query string will be processed somewhere in the SQL Server process, we can look at memory reads and writes made by the process, searching for a point that reads or writes the query string. We can then dump the callstack at that point and see what interesting addresses show up, and map them back to symbols (since, as Rolf points out, SQL Server has debug symbols available). It really was basically as simple as that!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Of course, the trick is having something around that lets you easily instrument a process. I solved this using a (hopefully soon-to-be-released) whole-system dynamic analysis framework based on\n  <a href=\"http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   QEMU\n  </a>\n  ; this let me avoid any unpleasantness involved in getting SQL Server to run under, e.g.,\n  <a href=\"http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   PIN\n  </a>\n  . Because the framework includes record and replay support, I also didn't have to worry about slowing down the server process with my instrumentation. Once I had the callstack, I used\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/moyix/pdbparse\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   PDBParse\n  </a>\n  to get the function names.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This would seem to be the easiest, fastest - in short: laziest - method. Besides TCP/IP\n  <em>\n   is\n  </em>\n  the higher level, because you can intercept it even before it reaches the actual SQL server\n  <em>\n   machine\n  </em>\n  if you can hijack the IP/name of the SQL server and put a \"proxy\" in between.

As far as I recall LSPs run within the process space of the application whose traffic they're filtering. You can consider them a makeshift application-level firewall, literally.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Alternatively - and probably the better choice anyway - you could write a proxy based on the existing and free\n  <a href=\"http://www.freetds.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   FreeTDS\n  </a>\n  (licensed under LGPL). The\n  <a href=\"http://freetds.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/freetds/freetds/src/pool/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <code>\n    tdspool\n   </code>\n  </a>\n  program would be a good point to start this endeavor. And yes, this should be suitable for actual\n  <em>\n   interception\n  </em>\n  , not just sniffing forwarded traffic. You can use the library (FreeTDS) to decode and re-encode the queries. That library would also be the one to use inside your LSP, obviously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'll save the time to go into details of the disassembly, although I installed MS SQL Server 2008 and briefly looked at it in IDA Pro.\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/1778/245\">\n   Brendan's answer\n  </a>\n  provides a good overview, even if I disagree with this overly involved method where an easier one is available.

Therefore, despite the fact that the user broadway was down-voted for his answer, it was exactly the same advice I'd give if I wasn't aware of any nice, special solutions specific to the problem.  What you're going to have to do is watch the data come into the process and then follow it as it is copied and manipulated throughout the program.  This task will be easier than the general case owing to the fact that debug symbols are available for SQL Server.  Have you attempted anything along these lines?  Say, setting a breakpoint on network receive-type functions in the context of SQL Server, setting a hardware RW breakpoint on the data that comes in over the network, and then watching how the data moves through the mass of code?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
