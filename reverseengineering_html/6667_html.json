    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have the following lines in IDA PRO:\n </p>\n <pre><code> lea  eax, [ebp+Filename]\n push  offset Filename     ;lpString2\n push  eax                 ;lpString1\n call  ds:lstrcpyA\n ...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So, I know what the function\n  <code>\n   lstrcpy()\n  </code>\n  does. It copies the string at\n  <code>\n   offset Filename\n  </code>\n  into the buffer pointed to by\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  . But when I click on\n  <code>\n   offset Filename\n  </code>\n  to navigate to the string, I see the following :\n </p>\n <pre><code>char Filename[]\nFilename      db 54h dup(0)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Then, I highlight that\n  <code>\n   54h\n  </code>\n  part of the line and click on the button A, but it causes the error message:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Command \"MakeAscii\" failed\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So, what can I also do to find out the string which is copied to the buffer ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
