The kernel has always been encrypted in previous iOS versions, but with iOS 10’s developer preview it wasn’t, sparking surprise from technology researchers and security experts, according to MIT’s Technology Review.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  From\n  <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/ios-10-kernel-not-encrypted/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   iOS 10 kernel is not encrypted, and here's Apple reasoning\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
