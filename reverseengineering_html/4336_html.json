If not, then why there are two\n  <code>\n   FUNC\n  </code>\n  symbols have the same name?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

They're not global functions, which would be constrained to only appear (or be defined) once.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Perhaps defined in several files, statically, so they're only used (or scoped to) in that particular file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I don't see those functions in the output of readelf -s, or objdump on my system's installed 'pr'.  I imagine you've compiled the coreutils yourself?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since you're playing with the source code of 'pr', you could grep for bkm_scale and bkm_scale_by_power to see where they're used and defined.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Keep exploring!  Keep learning!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
