    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have an idea to merge static and dynamic analysis into a visualization through the IDA python scripting interface.  The concept involves automatically setting breakpoints at each function or basic block (configurable), automatically stepping through them while capturing the trace data at each point, and then presenting the program flow through a modified graph view.  Perhaps even capturing diffs when alternate control flow paths are taken.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm not aware of any tools that currently do this but it seems like it could be highly useful in complex or obfuscated programs.  Thoughts, issues, or comments?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I think what I'm thinking about is a time-series view of a program being executed with API calls and function execution (in order) lined up. Previously, I was thinking about using IDA to extract the info from the debugger through scripting, but now I think that leveraging PIN or DynamoRIO would be far better. I'm thinking that the display I'm considering may need to be external to IDA.
