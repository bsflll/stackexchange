Right now I am able to run a function by:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Opening the remote process;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Allocating memory in remote process;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Relocating our image according to the address of allocated memory;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Using\n   <code>\n    CreateRemoteThread()\n   </code>\n   giving it the address of my declared function.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  So, right now I am just executing a\n  <code>\n   _MessageBox_\n  </code>\n  which is surely uninteresting. What I want to do right now is to execute a function which will load a DLL into its own address space and execute it, like how a traditional PE loader works. I took a reference code and tried but I am getting an access violation when I inspect using Olly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Please tell me, is it even possible?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

However, sometimes you need to use a different technique since Anti Virus / Anti Cheat Software (depending on your work area) can block this method easily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A more advanced method is\n  <code>\n   Manual Mapping\n  </code>\n  . Basically you are loading the payload library yourself, without the help of the operating system, and map it into the target process' memory. Instructions for this method can be found\n  <a href=\"http://www.rohitab.com/discuss/topic/40761-manual-dll-injection/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another little\n  <code>\n   trick\n  </code>\n  when working with low level Windows stuff is to take a look at the\n  <code>\n   reactOS\n  </code>\n  documentation.\n  <code>\n   reactOS\n  </code>\n  is a different operating system, but implements the Windows API. It's not garuanteed to be fully compatible but it should give you an idea how the functions are implemented.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, you can find the implementation of\n  <code>\n   LoadLibrary\n  </code>\n  <a href=\"https://doxygen.reactos.org/d7/d55/ldrapi_8c.html#a7671bda932dbb5096570f431ff83474c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  There are more ways to get your code into your target. Let your creativity run free.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By the way, a neat library I like to use for this tasks is\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/DarthTon/Blackbone\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   BlackBone\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
