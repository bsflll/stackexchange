I find sharedassets0.resource file, but not sure what is really is.\n  \n\n  Is it possible to extract this way? Am I missing something?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The APK file is here.\n  <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QRYDN4KEOQq-PtilyooWAEIw6620PuvK/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   APK\n  </a>\n  \n\n  The extracted output from apktool is here.\n  <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QRYDN4KEOQq-PtilyooWAEIw6620PuvK/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Output\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
