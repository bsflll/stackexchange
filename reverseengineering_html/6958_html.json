I've tried several tools that I'm aware of:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Dependency walker - doesn't see the Wow64 layer.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   ProcessExplorer - gave another result and this time the Wow64 layer appears but not all the tree.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  How could I list the exact list of dependency of my program ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In general, during development stage you need to take into account 64 bit target, so that the appropriate APIs and types are used. In addition, there are some peculiarities that must be taken care of when targeting the above OSs. You need to consult MSDN for this. As to the question, you do not need to see the whole tree as wow64 layer is sufficient to understand what APIs are used. Take into account that you will not see APIs that are resolved during runtime.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

It's not offline method, and it doesn't show you any tree, but it has a great advantage that you can see what your application\n <i>\n  really\n </i>\n tries to load and in what order.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
