I actually feel like reversing flutter built apps did not get much reverse writeups on the community. one of the tools for the task\n  <code>\n   reflutter\n  </code>\n  which I used in this case failed because the\n  <code>\n   flutter\n  </code>\n  version built with the\n  <code>\n   apk\n  </code>\n  is not supported by the\n  <code>\n   reflutter\n  </code>\n  . so the author provided\n  <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/ptswarm/reflutter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   docker image\n  </a>\n  in which one allows to implement his own patches there is manual Flutter code change is supported using specially crafted Docker. but the environment variables passed there, included\n  <code>\n   HASH_PATCH=[Snapshot_Hash]\n  </code>\n  <code>\n   COMMIT=[Engine_commit]\n  </code>\n  . in this case if I know the\n  <code>\n   snapshot Hash\n  </code>\n  from the\n  <code>\n   apk\n  </code>\n  how can I get the matching\n  <code>\n   Engine commit\n  </code>\n  for example in this case this is\n  <code>\n   Engine SnapshotHash: adb4292f3ec25074ca70abcd2d5c7251\n  </code>\n  , so how can I retrieve the matching\n  <code>\n   Engine Commit\n  </code>\n  ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
