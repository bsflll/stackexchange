I was looking at IDA Pro and that was 7k euros so that was not an option. I've been trying to use cutter and I'm wondering is it possible to search the address like IDA Pro, goto address.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm also wondering what is the best alternative than IDA Pro?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

And if you want to learn working with a disassembler, you should start out by doing\n <i>\n  that\n </i>\n instead of tainting the process by getting the decompiler plugin from Hex-Rays (which would be the only explanation for the price tag you mention). Most of us have worked with these tools without a decompiler option for many years. So if you want to learn the ropes, then simply go for a disassembler. (And I\n <i>\n  understand\n </i>\n that even 2000 USD are a lot of money!)\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Additionally there are ways to synchronize your findings between several tools. But yes there are clearly differences. But if you are just starting out, you are in a much better place than I was many years ago (I recall only Sourcerer and IDA at the time). There are different free-of-charge solutions out there from which you can pick to learn the basics. And then when you have some momentum you can still purchase a tool. Tools won't magically do your work anyway.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
