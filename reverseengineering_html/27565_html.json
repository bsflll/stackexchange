The reversing it self is not that hard but the de-obfuscation is. Lots of the scripts are obfuscated with things like JScrambler. I see people able to de-obfuscate JScrambler but for me it is very difficult. So I wanted to know if there was any place I could learn about JS de-obfuscation.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
