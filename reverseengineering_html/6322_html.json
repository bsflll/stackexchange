    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I bought a used iPhone from someone, but I accidentally got a lock screen on the phone and can't figure out what the passcode is. Long story short, how does iOS hash the passcodes for entry, what kind of salt/etc. does it use, where would it store it, and is it possible to mount the internal drive (I'm guessing SSD?) where it stores the passcode?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyone familiar with iOS reverse engineering? Coding/development? Can one mount the whole filesystem and copy the files/decrypt/reverse engineer/view them/hex edit them/etc. (the files of the hashed/encrypted passcode)? I am all up for this 100%; just need some people more familiar with iOS to set me in the right direction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Why other alternatives aren't good enough:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Can't factory restore; all\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      very important\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    data will be lost that was not backed up.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    There's no way to bypass the lock-screen on this iOS version. Only way would be to determine where it stores the hashed/cryptographic passcode on the disk and figure out what it is to re-gain entry.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  To be blunt, I'm striving to password crack my own device. On Android this is easy, but I have heard of absolutely no one getting this done with iDevices/iOS.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
