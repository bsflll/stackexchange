I know that getting the original Basic code is probably impossible, but going disassembling the file with nasm I didn't get any useful info either...\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any pointers?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

But I found the combination of DOSBox and IDA quite nice using\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/wjp/idados\">\n   idados\n  </a>\n  . It's an IDA Pro plugin which allows you to control the debugger of a debug-enabled DOSBox build from within IDA similar to how you can control a debuggee running one of the other supported remote debuggers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Given the existing answer by Igor this is of course like using a kitchen knife instead of a scalpel, but I thought I should mention it, as it is a\n  <em>\n   more generic method\n  </em>\n  for reversing DOS programs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   NB:\n  </strong>\n  There used to be an even older, but I think unrelated, plugin of the same name which hasn't been maintained by its original author. I still have a copy of it on my disk (at home), but the website seems to no longer exist.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
