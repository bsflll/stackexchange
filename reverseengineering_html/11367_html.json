Im using\n  <strong>\n   Vmware Workstation 10.0.3\n  </strong>\n  btw..\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know i did setup my XP vm correctly because i can debug it from the host easily - configuring\n  <code>\n   The other end is an application\n  </code>\n  and connecting it with Windbg from my host computer (Win7 x64) and its working properly. So i know there is no problem with my Win-XP setup\n </p>\n <p>\n  But doing the same thing from the other vm, nothing happens. I looked through the internet and i even followed tutorials that explained exactly what i already did.\nI have no idea what i'm missing and i feel pretty helpless so i came asking here.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyone got any ideas what is the problem with my setup?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The difference is (Between what i thought is correct): They put on the Debugged vm\n <code>\n  The other end is an application\n </code>\n when the other side is a VM that is supposed to debug it.   Also on the windbg, the pipe name they use is\n <code>\n  \\\\.\\com1\n </code>\n instead of\n <code>\n  \\\\.\\pipe\\com_1\n </code>\n which is what i did. Nonetheless its still not working even with their setup\n</span>\n</body></html>",
