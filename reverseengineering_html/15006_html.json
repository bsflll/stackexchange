I would argue that before any attempt at reverse engineering firmware is made, at least basic familiarity with the following concepts is required:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     Computer architecture / computer system organization\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     CPU design and function (e.g. registers, the instruction pointer, memory access)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     memory and the memory hierarchy\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     instruction sets, assembly, opcodes, addressing modes, syntax, mnemonics\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     information representation (binary, hex, endianness)\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     Operating system concepts\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     Virtual memory\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     usermode vs kernelmode, the kernel, the kernel interface (system calls)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     process layout in memory - stack, heap, data, instructions\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     executable formats\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     application binary interfaces\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     program entry points\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     source code to object code transformation\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     compilation, assembly, linking\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     C/C++ programming\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Assembly programming\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     source-to-assembly construct correlation (e.g. recognition of loop, switch constructs in assembly)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     disassembly vs decompilation\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  My advice is the following:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   read as much as you can: technical specifications, assembly/disassembly, answers to firmware RE questions, research papers, tutorials, blogs, textbooks, manual pages\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   emulate/copy the methodologies employed and approaches taken by pros\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   gain experience as quickly as possible: look at and experiment with many different types of files (executables, image files, compressed files, firmware, etc.), program in assembly to get a feel for it, disassemble many executables\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <h3>\n  Firmware RE Resources\n </h3>\n <p>\n  \"\n  <a href=\"http://hexblog.com/files/recon%202010%20Skochinsky.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   Intro to Embedded Reverse Engineering \nfor PC reversers\n  </a>\n  \" by Igor Skochinsky provides an overview of what is involved in reversing firmware, and in \"\n  <a href=\"https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Zaddach-Workshop-on-Embedded-Devices-Security-and-Firmware-Reverse-Engineering-Slides.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   Embedded Devices Security: Firmware Reverse Engineering\n  </a>\n  \" Jonas Zaddach and Andrei Costin outline a general methodology for reversing firmware beginning on slide 31.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Look at answers given by pros:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/users/1408/devttys0?tab=answers\">\n    devttys0\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/users/12325/ebux?tab=answers\">\n    ebux\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/users/60/igor-skochinsky?tab=answers\">\n    Igor Skochinsky\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/users/4212/6equj5?tab=answers\">\n    6EQUJ5\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  These may be useful or interesting:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://www.devttys0.com/blog/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   devttys0's blog\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://ea.github.io/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   ea's blog\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://igorsk.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   Igor's blog\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://firmware.re/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   firmware.re\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://blog.ioactive.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   IOActive Labs Research blog\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://sviehb.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   sviehb's blog\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Embedded systems often use MIPS or ARM processors, and by extension MIPS or ARM instruction sets. This means that being familiar with MIPS and ARM assembly will be very helpful when analyzing firmware for these systems.\n </p>\n <h1>\n  Analyzing the binary\n </h1>\n <h2>\n  Part 1: Identification of the target device's architecture\n </h2>\n <p>\n  We cannot rely on hearsay to obtain the information required to analyze the firmware.

Every Thumb instruction could instead be executed via\n  the equivalent 32-bit ARM instruction. However, not all ARM\n  instructions are available in the Thumb subset; for example, there's\n  no way to access status or coprocessor registers. Also, some functions\n  that can be accomplished in a single ARM instruction can only be\n  simulated with a sequence of Thumb instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   At this point, you may ask why have two instruction sets in the same\n  CPU? But really the ARM contains only one instruction set: the 32-bit\n  set. When it's operating in the Thumb state, the processor simply\n  expands the smaller shorthand instructions fetched from memory into\n  their 32-bit equivalents.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The difference between two equivalent instructions lies in how the\n  instructions are fetched and interpreted prior to execution, not in\n  how they function.\n   <strong>\n    Since the expansion from 16-bit to 32-bit\n  instruction is accomplished via dedicated hardware within the chip, it\n  doesn't slow execution even a bit. But the narrower 16-bit\n  instructions do offer memory advantages.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The Thumb instruction set provides most of the functionality required\n  in a typical application. Arithmetic and logical operations,\n  load/store data movements, and conditional and unconditional branches\n  are supported.\n   <strong>\n    Based upon the available instruction set, any code\n  written in C could be executed successfully in Thumb state.\n   </strong>\n   However,\n  device drivers and exception handlers must often be written at least\n  partly in ARM state.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Here is a good explanation from SO:\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28669905/arm-thumb-and-thumb-2-instructions-confusion/28670713#28670713\">\n   ARM, Thumb and Thumb 2 instructions confusion\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  From the\n  <a href=\"https://www.scss.tcd.ie/~waldroj/3d1/arm_arm.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   ARMv6-M Architecture Reference Manual\n  </a>\n  , Chapter A5:The Thumb Instruction Set Encoding, section 1: Thumb instruction set encoding, page 82:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xJOrU.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Thumb instruction set encoding\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xJOrU.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Additionally:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   The NuMicro NUC200 Series only supports little-endian data format.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/H5dKc.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"System memory map\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/H5dKc.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  To summarize: the code in the firmware binary will consist of little-endian 16-bit ARM Thumb instructions plus a few 32-bit Thumb2 instructions to be executed by a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0 processor implementing the ARM 16-bit Thumb instruction set with support for Thumb2.\n </p>\n <h3>\n  4. Identify the device's memory layout\n </h3>\n <p>\n  Access to the technical reference manual allows us to determine what APROM and ISP are. From Chapter 6: Functional Description, section 4.4.1: Flash Memory Organization, page 191:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   The NuMicro NUC200 Series flash memory consists of program memory (APROM), Data Flash, ISP loader program memory (LDROM), and user configuration. Program memory is main memory for  user  applications and called  APROM. User  can write their application to APROM and set system to boot from APROM.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   ISP  loader  program  memory  is  designed  for  a  loader  to  implement In-System-Programming function.  LDROM  is  independent  to  APROM  and system  can  also  be  set  to  boot  from  LDROM. Therefore, user can user LDROM to avoid system boot fail when code of APROM was corrupted.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  And from Chapter 6: Functional Description, section 4.4.5: In-System-Programming (ISP), page 199:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   ISP provides the ability to update system firmware on board. Various peripheral interfaces let ISP loader in LDROM to receive new program code easily. The most common method to perform ISP is  via  UART  along  with  the ISP  loader in  LDROM.  General  speaking,  PC  transfers  the  new APROM  code  through  serial  port.  Then ISP  loader receives  it  and  re-programs  into  APROM through ISP commands.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  According to the information in the\n  <code>\n   config.ini\n  </code>\n  file bundled with the NuMicro ISP Programming Tool, flash memory size of the APROM segment is 128 KB:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ cat config.ini | grep NUC200LE3AN -B2 -A3\n\n[0x00020000]\nNAME_STRING = NUC200LE3AN\nRAM_SIZE = 16\nFLASH_SIZE = 128\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Here is a diagram of the flash memory address map:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/okKY3.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"flash memory address map\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/okKY3.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  We know that the space from 0x0000_0000 to 0x0001_FFFF = 131071 bytes, which is 128 KB, and this is the region to which the binary from the hex file will be flashed to using the upgrade tool. Above that there is a block of memory from 0x0002_0000 to 0x0010_000 which is labeled \"Reserved for Further Used\". The size of this \"Reserved\" space is 0x0010_0000 - 0x0002_0000 = 0xE0000, or 917504 bytes. This is almost 1 megabyte of reserved space. The 128 KB reserved for APROM makes up 12.5% of the address space between 0x0000_0000 and 0x0010_0000, but is represented as being larger than the ~1 MB \"Reserved\" block. This is very strange. There is also no documentation of this reserved block anywhere in the technical reference manual that I could find. If one had physical access to the device, perhaps the contents of flash memory could be dumped and analyzed to find out what lies in this region.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since the firmware binary is written to space in flash memory reserved for user applications, it seems unlikely that the firmware binary contains kernel code, bootloader code or a filesystem. This is different from router firmware, which tends to at the very least contain kernel code.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Part 2: Direct analysis of the binary\n </h2>\n <p>\n  Quick recap of what we know at this point:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The device name - SMOK X Cube II\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The processor - A NuMicro NUC220LE3AN processor, based on an ARM Cortex-M0 Core processor\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The instruction set architecture - little-endian ARM-v6 M 16-bit Thumb\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The location in flash memory to which the firmware will be written - the 128KB APROM region for user applications (in other words, not the kernel)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   NuMicro is a Taiwan-based company. We will see why this is potentially relevant shortly.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The entropy plot generated by\n   <code>\n    binwalk\n   </code>\n   included in the question reveals that there are no encrypted or compressed regions in the firmware\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Based on information included in the question, there exist ASCII strings embedded in the file that appear to be related to the functionality of the device\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Potential complications:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   firmware binaries do not have a standard format like executable binaries do\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Data may be intermingled with code/instructions within the binary. If this is the case, it is possible that data such as strings will be disassembled as instructions, resulting in an incorrect representation of the firmware's code\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <h3>\n  Preliminary analysis\n </h3>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   1.\n   <code>\n    strings\n   </code>\n   and\n   <code>\n    hexdump\n   </code>\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The output of strings can be used to quick heuristic in determining if the firmware is encrypted/compressed. If there are no strings in the output, it is a good indicator that the entire file is obfuscated somehow.\n  <code>\n   hexdump\n  </code>\n  with the -C argument can be used to provide some context for the strings i.e. where in the binary they are relative to code and relative to each other. In other words, are the strings packed together in a single block, or are they scattered throughout the binary? The answer can provide clues about the layout of the firmware.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Using\n  <code>\n   hexump\n  </code>\n  , we see that the ASCII strings are intermingled with what might be code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>00002ed0  01 21 1b 20 fd f7 6e fe  21 46 38 6a 09 f0 16 fd  |.!. ..n.!F8j....|\n00002ee0  64 21 09 f0 13 fd 08 46  0a 21 09 f0 0f fd 10 30  |d!.....F.!.....0|\n00002ef0  14 21 48 43 42 19 01 21  25 20 fd f7 5b fe 73 e0  |.!HCB..!% ..[.s.|\n00002f00  68 e2 88 e0 57 41 54 54  0a 00 00 00 4d 4f 44 45  |h...WATT....MODE|\n00002f10  0a 00 00 00 7c db 00 00  88 db 00 00 54 45 4d 50  |....|.......TEMP|\n00002f20  0a 00 00 00 4d 45 4d 4f  52 59 0a 00 20 4d 4f 44  |....MEMORY..

Thumb2 contains 2 byte and 4 byte instruction lengths. Thumb was only\n  2.

A good starting point appears to be the\n  <a href=\"https://azeria-labs.com/writing-arm-assembly-part-1/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   Azeria Labs series of tutorials\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <h3>\n  Additional Considerations\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The ISP upgrade tool is a MS Windows PE32 executable binary. This can be reverse engineered to determine how the flashing process takes place.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Physical access to the microcontroller could be useful. The entire contents of flash memory could be dumped and analyzed. This would also enable one to see exactly how everything is laid out in flash memory\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   if known good blocks of code can be isolated, it my be possible to decompile it\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <h1>\n  Conclusion\n </h1>\n <p>\n  Hopefully the approach used here proves useful for your future firmware RE endeavors. Analyzing firmware poses its own set of challenges because of the close relationship between it and it the hardware it is designed to be embedded in. Since the design and architecture of the device determines the layout and content of firmware, firmware sometimes cannot be reversed without access to the device, or at the very least knowing the instruction set architecture of the device.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
