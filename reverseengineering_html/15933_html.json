I have had to do this very thing before for a client regarding non-copyrighted abandonware. Your results may vary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As for your specific question, yes, it's possible, but probably not the most optimal (or easiest) solution for what you want to achieve. Regardless, consider the following, bearing in mind that these are just potential solutions:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   1.\n  </strong>\n  Read into\n  <a href=\"https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20240/The-Beginners-Guide-to-Codecaves\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   codecaves\n  </a>\n  . This very common technique avails you the memory and functionality to craft, inject, redirect, and execute custom code you write.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   2.\n  </strong>\n  Trace the execution of that routine. Note any values of interest to you that are residing in registers and/or on the stack, especially return values from\n  <code>\n   call\n  </code>\n  instructions. Depending on what you find, you can create an injection that only modifies existing bytes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For instance, perhaps the bytes from\n  <code>\n   1009A467\n  </code>\n  -\n  <code>\n   1009A474\n  </code>\n  are enough to create a custom\n  <code>\n   mov\n  </code>\n  instruction that puts a value you want into\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  prior to the\n  <code>\n   mov\n  </code>\n  instruction at\n  <code>\n   1009A477\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or, if you've studied that bit of code enough, perhaps there's something in another register that you can specify at\n  <code>\n   1009A477\n  </code>\n  , i.e.\n  <code>\n   mov [ebp+var_4], ebx\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   mov [ebp+var_4], edx\n  </code>\n  , etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   3.\n  </strong>\n  What happens if you\n  <code>\n   nop\n  </code>\n  the two\n  <code>\n   jz\n  </code>\n  instructions? See how they both jump to that segment of code at\n  <code>\n   loc_1009A467\n  </code>\n  ? Note that there may be unintended results like instantly triggering the end of a trial period or corrupting data. This is when it can help to monitor the footprint of an application when installing it so you can identify how it maintains persistence with functionality like activation. Maybe it's a temp file, a registry key, or something else.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally, the two\n  <code>\n   and\n  </code>\n  instructions you're pointing to at\n  <code>\n   1009A442\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   1009A446\n  </code>\n  are zeroing the memory addresses being referenced at\n  <code>\n   [ebp+offsets]\n  </code>\n  , respectively. This is just setting them up for use somewhere afterward. Anything you\n  <code>\n   and\n  </code>\n  with 0 will equal 0. It's a common method in Assembly for clearing a register, as is when you\n  <code>\n   xor\n  </code>\n  a register with itself, i.e.\n  <code>\n   xor eax, eax\n  </code>\n  . You can read more about the binary operation\n  <code>\n   and\n  </code>\n  <a href=\"http://www.xcprod.com/titan/XCSB-DOC/binary_and.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
