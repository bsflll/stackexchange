The _off name might have its origin in the segmented addressing introduced by Intel many years ago in their 16-bit times (segment:offset), today being rather obsolete because of the flat memory model also being used in the Intel world. BTW, just discovered that your question is a duplicate of this one <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50908226/what-do-prefixes-like-byte-or-off-mean-before-a-hex-value\" title=\"what do prefixes like byte or off mean before a hex value\">stackoverflow.com/questions/50908226/â€¦</a>, offering a more detailed explanation.</span>",
