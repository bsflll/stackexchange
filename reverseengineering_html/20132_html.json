For a more detailed information i would always suggest visiting the sourcecode as a lot of\n  <code>\n   aa\n  </code>\n  commands are combinations of different steps. A good starting point is at\n  <code>\n   libr/core/cmd_anal.c\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   aab\n  </code>\n  instead is a total different approach and can create a lot of false positives.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You could also give\n  <code>\n   aaa\n  </code>\n  a try but i assume that will take some time to finish.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
