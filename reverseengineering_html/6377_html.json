    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  In an application I'm analyzing, there's a global variable whose purpose/role in the program is known to me. I'd like to rename it, but for some reason I cannot.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The assembly code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>.text:00537E90                 mov     edx, ds:1C968D8h\n.text:00537E96                 mov     [eax], edx\n.text:00537E98                 mov     ds:1C968D8h, eax\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  If I position the cursor on the address (\n  <code>\n   ds:1C968D8h\n  </code>\n  ) and try to jump (using Enter), IDA will complain\n  <code>\n   Command \"JumpEnter\" failed\n  </code>\n  . Attempting to rename it with the N hotkey will cause IDA to place a label at that address rather than rename the variable as intended.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While I'm doing this for educational purposes, this is a proprietary application, so I don't have the source code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've checked Chris Eagle's \"The IDA Pro Book\", but there seems to be nothing on the subject in there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Help is greatly appreciated.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Place cursor on it, press left button, press o on the keyboard to say to IDA that it is address.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
