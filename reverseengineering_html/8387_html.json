I added the offset of each struct's member to distinguish the differences between the two.\n </p>\n <pre><code>.text:00401000 start:\n.text:00401000                 mov     eax, 0\n.text:00401005                 mov     ebx, 1\n.text:0040100A                 mov     ecx, 5\n.text:0040100F                 mov     eax, 0\n.text:00401014                 mov     ebx, 1\n.text:00401019                 mov     ecx, 5\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I've surfed the net but didn't find any documentation describing the use of structs well, so I decided to try it by myself.\nThe disassembled code seems,it holds the size of each struct's member.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The main question is how to use the members of the struct within the code?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I think you've misunderstood the\n  <code>\n   Initializedstructure\n  </code>\n  to an instruction or other directives.You can name it what you want and use the initialized\n  <code>\n   struct\n  </code>\n  in the rest by its name.For instance, in the .data section you would use:\n </p>\n <pre><code>AAAA struct1 <4,10,60>\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So in the rest of code in the .code section using following statement will work,\n  <code>\n   mov eax , AAAA.second\n  </code>\n  and give you (in this case) 10 and the\n  <code>\n   mov eax, offset AAAA.second\n  </code>\n  give the offset of second member in run-time.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
