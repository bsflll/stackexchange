And if you look closely it there is a pattern how much off they are from the original.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, at offset\n  <code>\n   0x58\n  </code>\n  , there's supposed to be\n  <code>\n   push edx\n  </code>\n  so the byte should be\n  <code>\n   0x52\n  </code>\n  , but you have\n  <code>\n   push esp\n  </code>\n  which is\n  <code>\n   0x54\n  </code>\n  . Since the article mentions that this part is encrypted with a xor (with a single digit key), let's see how those values are off\n </p>\n <pre><code>In [7]: 0x52 ^ 0x54\nOut[7]: 6\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So this is exactly the key mentioned in the article. If we compare the rest of those off instruction we will notice that they are off by the same value.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Conclusion - this part of code shown in Ghidra was not decrypted and should be preprocessed before analysis.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
