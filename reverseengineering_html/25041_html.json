The device has a NAND chip, and has a cripled version of BusyBox v1.14.1.\n  <code>\n   nanddump\n  </code>\n  command exists but with intresting parameters, as I wasn't able to find any info on Google. Also\n  <code>\n   nandwrite\n  </code>\n  command doesn't exist, instead they wrote a different tool called\n  <code>\n   psi\n  </code>\n  to write to the chip. Here are the outputs of their usage with compare to the original counterparts.\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ nanddump\nUsage: nanddump mtdX [noswap || swap] [nospare || spare] sector_count\n        sector_count can be provided as \"0\" which means the whole partition\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So, what are these swap and spare options for? When I try to dump with\n  <code>\n   swap\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   noswap\n  </code>\n  I got the same file when I use the command\n  <code>\n   cat /dev/mtd* > mtd*.bin\n  </code>\n  . However using\n  <code>\n   spare\n  </code>\n  parameter gives a slightly bigger file. Here is what I got from full fledged busybox\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ nanddump\nBusyBox v1.21.1 (2013-07-08 10:56:01 CDT) multi-call binary.\n\nUsage: nanddump [-o] [-b] [-s ADDR] [-f FILE] MTD_DEVICE\n\nDump the specified MTD device\n\n        -o      Dump oob data\n        -b      Omit bad block from the dump\n        -s ADDR Start address\n        -l LEN  Length\n        -f FILE Dump to file ('-' for stdout)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And for the other tool,\n  <code>\n   psi\n  </code>\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ psi\nusage: psi -o <command> -t <configtype> -f <filename|env.var.name> -s <flashsize> -r <rebootflag>\nsupported commands: <read> <write> <erase>\nsupported config types: <asd> <cfg> <env> <flash> <firmware>\nsupported reboot flags: <yes> <no>\nNote: -s parameter is for flash dump/undump only\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  It seems like this tool reads and writes at the same time. Well this is hard to figure out as I wasn't able to use it to read mtd partitions, and it doesn't let firmware partition to be read. It only writes to that partition. Here is the\n  <code>\n   nandwrite\n  </code>\n  command from busybox.\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ nandwrite\nBusyBox v1.21.1 (2013-07-08 10:56:01 CDT) multi-call binary.\n\nUsage: nandwrite [-p] [-s ADDR] MTD_DEVICE [FILE]\n\nWrite to the specified MTD device\n\n        -p      Pad to page size\n        -s ADDR Start address\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So I believe\n  <code>\n   flashsize\n  </code>\n  from\n  <code>\n   psi\n  </code>\n  command has something to do with these two parameters. \nAlso here is the list of\n  <code>\n   mtd\n  </code>\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ cat /proc/mtd\ndev:    size   erasesize  name\nmtd0: 01000000 00004000 \"RootFS\"\nmtd1: 08000000 00020000 \"FlashAll\"\nmtd2: 00020000 00020000 \"Bootloader\"\nmtd3: 00220000 00020000 \"BootloaderConfig\"\nmtd4: 00220000 00020000 \"Config\"\nmtd5: 00220000 00020000 \"ASD\"\nmtd6: 02200000 00020000 \"Kernel\"\nmtd7: 02200000 00020000 \"KernelBackup\"\nmtd8: 02e60000 00020000 \"disk\"\nmtd9: 00220000 00020000 \"edr\"\nmtd10: 00500000 00020000 \"bbt\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Custom\n  <code>\n   nanddump\n  </code>\n  throws an error while reading\n  <code>\n   RootFS\n  </code>\n  . These are all I got for now.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Also i have realized that swap changes endiannes of the dumps. I have bootloader dump which has \"cfe\" written in normal one and when swapped it becomes \"efc\". I also was able to dump using <code>psi</code> command. It's dumping as multiples of 64KB data. I believe that is page size, but I am not sure. <code>psi</code> command has no ecc option</span>",
