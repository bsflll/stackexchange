Although, when I try to use that assembly generated code in a TASM, it doesn't build, and throw errors.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In contrast, I tried also to use IDA, and it does not seem to get the same assembly result as\n  <a href=\"https://onlinedisassembler.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   1\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  My questions are:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Is there any other way that I'm missing in transforming hexdump into an executable COM file?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://onlinedisassembler.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    The site\n   </a>\n   gives me expressions like:\n   <code>\n    mov    $0x400,%di\n   </code>\n   , but TASM only recognize\n   <code>\n    mov di,400\n   </code>\n   . Is that a better way to translate the hexdumps into instructions that TASM will recognize?\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  BTW - The context is that I'm trying to solve an RE riddle, which I cannot post online (and I'm a pretty newbie in RE and assembly).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Anyway, the difference is that AT&T syntax is somewhat more verbose and the source operand comes left of the comma as opposed to right of the comma with Intel's syntax.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

To force 16-bit disassembly, select i8086 in the Mode combo box.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
