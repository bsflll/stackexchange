So, the management of the binary format is done through\n  <code>\n   libbfd.so\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Usually, MacOS X binutils comes with the Mach-O management, but it might be that you are using a buggy package. Or, you may also try to open a Mach-O on another system than MacOS X, and on other systems the Mach-O support is extremely rarely added to the default package.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The best way to get the Mach-O support (and all possible formats and architectures in GNU binutils) is to compile the package with the option\n  <code>\n   --enable-targets=all\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Personally, I am using a Debian unstable. and I am used to recompile the whole package taken from sources.
