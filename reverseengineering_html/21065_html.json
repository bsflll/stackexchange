Since the JVM (mostly) doesn't care what your methods are called, the code will still work fine, but it is harder to understand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unfortunately, there is no way to recover the original identifiers, because the information simply doesn't exist anymore. However, you can rename them to things you find more helpful as part of the reverse engineering process.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
