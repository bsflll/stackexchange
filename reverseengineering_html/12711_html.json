I hit a snag when the firmware that it downloads is encrypted. I managed to find some pictures of the circuit board (but haven't opened up my device\n  <em>\n   yet\n  </em>\n  ) and I have been reading up on communicating over the on-board serial port. I have zero experience with this, other than what I've read on\n  <a href=\"http://devttys0.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://devttys0.com\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"http://jcjc-dev.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://jcjc-dev.com/\n  </a>\n  and various other sites.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So my question is this - Since I'm such a newbie at this, is anyone willing to look at these pictures and help me figure out where a serial port might be hidden?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pictures @\n  <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qzd2jpjlv1ieehu/0Am6ttruYe\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qzd2jpjlv1ieehu/0Am6ttruYe\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any thoughts? Thanks for your time!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

At a glance I can't find a port in the photos. You should try to get some really high resolution top and bottom pictures.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
