That way you will get the logic behind of why it was one way or another as well? Otherwise, you might as well start reading about masm and nasm in general.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

For exe/dll files this depends on whether it is a native x86 32bit or x86 64bit binary or if it is a .Net binary, the output can be completely different. And of course every tool may show a slightly different representation.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
