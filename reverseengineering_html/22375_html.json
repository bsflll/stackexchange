    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've come across an SQLite database (gmm_storage.db) used by Google Maps on Android, and I'm unsure as to how the data it contains is serialised. For example:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IVFtq.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Blob extracted from Google Maps Android database\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IVFtq.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm saying serialised, as from the header 0xACED it appears to be a Java serialised object.  However, as I have no idea what the serialised class actually looks like, I've been unable to deserialise it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm also not entirely sure it's standard Java serialisation, as I've tried a number of different tools, and Java itself,  and all of them report that the stream is corrupt.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can see some references to standard Java classes, such as java/util/Set, but also a lot of smaller references to things like 'fic', or 'vot'.  I'm guessing these are either obfuscated class names, or they are part of some kind of lookup/offset table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My other guess is that as it's a Google product, it's probably using a Google serialisation library, like GSON or protobuf, but the data doesn't look like either of those.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyone come across this before, or can shine some light on it?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
