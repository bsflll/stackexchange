They then override the boot block by a special dumper firmware. Why it seems to work:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Microchip PIC microcontrollers internal memory is an EEPROM which means that data are stored and erase by pages (which hold a predefined amount of data).\n  The \"key\" point is that , whenever memory is copy protected, individual blocks can be erased resetting the copy protection bits only for these blocks.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
