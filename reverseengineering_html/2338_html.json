They are quite limited compared to FPGAs and implement a sea of gates design rather than more general LUTS found in FPGAs. Although that probably isn't always the case some CPLDs may be nothing more than a tiny FPGA with a built in ROM.\n </p>\n <p>\n  CPLDs usually have a built in ROM making them harder or near impossible to RE. Since there is no external configuration.\n </p>\n <p>\n  FPGAs are often equivalent to a million+ gates. Whereas CPLDs are at most in the tens of thousands of gates. They might be more accurately called Simple Programmable Logic Devices!\n </p>\n <p>\n  If there is no identification on the package you are going to have a hard time doing anything with it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Though, sometimes its sufficient to see what is connected to the IO pins of the CPLD to tell what it is used for.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
