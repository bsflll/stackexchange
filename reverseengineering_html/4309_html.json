They are so slow and have many problems with loops and rep-prefixed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As I mentioned in my comment the driver initializing tracing wast 30 min (I want to draw each IOCtl graph).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Again as I mentioned in my comment I use Virtual-KD and VMWare (Is it any faster configuration ?).\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   1.I'm not in user mode.\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   2.problem is slow speed.\n  </strong>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
