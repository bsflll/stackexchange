Be sure you understand the function's side-effects, use of global variables, etc. since it may not be thread-safe to call it from your DLL.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Better use 'GetModuleHandle' to get process image base and call your functions using RVA plus the value returned.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The above will be true if the target functions aren't in the EAT of the host image. If this is the case you can just declare their names and use those functions in your source if you have the proper host image libraries.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is the best I can say because your question is a bit unclear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  EDIT: The code you have written in OP, can be re-written as follows:\n </p>\n <pre><code>const wchar_t* (__fastcall *get_string)(const char*, int, const char*, int) = (decltype(get_string))0x6f9ec0;\n\nint& g_cx = *(int*)0x8523e0;\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  If your compiler supports C++11 or above because of the 'decltype' keyword.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
