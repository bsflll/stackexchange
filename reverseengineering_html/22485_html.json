After googling, I try with\n  <code>\n   LD_PRELOAD\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n  </code>\n  but no luck. I'm using LUbuntu 18.04.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So can you guys help me with this case?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Or do you mean another ELF file? Because on a system for which GLIBC was built, you can execute it as a standalone binary and it will output version and copyright information and some other stuff.
