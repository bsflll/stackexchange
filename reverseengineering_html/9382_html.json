That function validates that the virtual addresses of the bytes to be patched are within a section's memory space at run-time (based on the section's virtual address and the section's virtual size). Since the bytes you're patching are after the end of the section's virtual size,\n  <code>\n   ConvertVAtoFileOffsetEx()\n  </code>\n  returns\n  <code>\n   0\n  </code>\n  and the patches are never applied.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As a workaround, I'd recommend patching the virtual size of the section to which you're appending those new bytes. Whatever the current virtual size is, make it\n  <code>\n   14\n  </code>\n  bytes bigger in the PE section's header.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can use a tool like\n  <a href=\"http://www.ntcore.com/exsuite.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Explorer Suite\n  </a>\n  to make this change by navigating to the file's\n  <em>\n   Section Headers\n  </em>\n  and increasing the value in the target section's\n  <em>\n   Virtual Size\n  </em>\n  field:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"Explorer Suite\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/59oUX.jpg\"/>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
