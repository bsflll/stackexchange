    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a malware sample that wraps\n  <code>\n   LoadLibrary\n  </code>\n  &\n  <code>\n   GetProcAddress\n  </code>\n  duo to dynamically resolve functions. After this wrapper is called the value stored in\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  (which is the function name)immediately gets called. The strings are encrypted and it's too difficult for me to reverse the encryption algorithm. Instead I wrote a python script which sets breakpoints where a\n  <code>\n   call eax\n  </code>\n  instruction is mentioned. Everyting's fine, I get the addresses of the functions from\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  that are dynamically imported. The problem is I need them to be readable. I know how to resolve the address to a function name in widbg by calling\n  <code>\n   ln address\n  </code>\n  . But I don't want to sit all day and copy all of the 649 imports one by one to the\n  <code>\n   windbg\n  </code>\n  console. I looked up the\n  <code>\n   windbg\n  </code>\n  's scripting capabilities but I could not write anything that would do the job.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
