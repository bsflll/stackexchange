There could be a service to do this, but then the need is probably to small that no one could run a business of it.\nYou could try posting a request for one of the many freelancing sites.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But like the \"feed a man a fish\" proverb, you are better off learning how to do this stuff your self then, then you can do it your self.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A lot of the better packers these days leave less of a signature and thus are harder to detect with old/outdated packer detectors.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Go to the forums on:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://tuts4you.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   https://tuts4you.com/\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  It's pretty much THE site to go to for unpacking info, and if you do your\nhomework (read up and study first) people will probably help you there.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
