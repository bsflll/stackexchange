My purpose is to disassemble, add a sample code and re-assemble to obtain a runnable iOS app again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have read a lot about IDA, IDA pro, HEX-Rays, and o'tool to disassemble an ipa file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since i'm working with a macbook pro, i think that using otool to disassemble an '.ipa' file is the best and faster way. I have tried it with a non-signed\n  <code>\n   .ipa\n  </code>\n  and I have obtained the assembly code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, I have difficulties. I have tried to create a new Xcode project, import this assembly code and try to compile it to generate a new app, without inserting new code just to simplify the process.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But when i tried to compile, Xcode fails in every single code line.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I think that my problem is, that the process described:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Disassemble with otool\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Import the code in XCode\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Compile and build\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Obtain the new app\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Is not correct.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
