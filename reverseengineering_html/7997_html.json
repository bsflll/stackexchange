    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  during an analysis, I have found the following :\n </p>\n <pre><code>  ...\n  call program.00401535\n  ...\n  (a few lines later)\n  ...\n  ...\n  call program.00401535\n  ...\n  ...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So, it call the same function. When I step over that first call, nothing happens. But later, when I step over the second call, suddenly I get the message \"000004C0 terminated, exit code 0\" and ollydbg is running, running...and running.\nSo, I have decided to look into that function and I see the following:\n </p>\n <pre><code>                    PUSH EBP\n                    MOV EBP, ESP\n 00401538           PUSH 1000\n     |              CALL DWORD PTR DS:[40241C]    ; which is kernel32.Sleep\n     -------------- JMP  SHORT program.00401538\n                    LEAVE \n                    RETN\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So, it is simple what it is doing here. Since we have unconditional jump, it always lets the program sleep for a while. In other words, that function should never return.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   But my question would be:\n  </strong>\n  Why it was possible for me to step over the first call, and not over the second ?\nI googled for Sleep() as anti-debugging trick but I did not find anything about that. \nCan somebody tell me what can I do in such a case?\n </p>\n <p>\n  best regards,\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Here the anti-debugging check is run in a dedicated thread. When the main thread calls\n  <code>\n   Sleep\n  </code>\n  , it means that it is giving up cpu-time so that the other thread have higher chances to execute.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To debug such an application in Ollydbg, look in the threads Window.
