As an example, if a C program contains an integer variable\n  <code>\n   var\n  </code>\n  in function\n  <code>\n   main\n  </code>\n  , is there any means to associate its address on stack, say\n  <code>\n   [rbp-0x18]\n  </code>\n  to the source variable itself?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Binary files contain multiple sections used for a plethora of purposes. The section of interest in your case is the\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.bss#BSS_in_C\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <em>\n    .bss\n   </em>\n  </a>\n  . In this sections, you're supposed to find a reference to the local variables used by your program.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, regarding the variable name, the only way to associate it to a relative address is through the compiler's debug information (\n  <a href=\"http://eagercon.com/dwarf/dwarf-2.0.0.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   DWARF2\n  </a>\n  /\n  <a href=\"http://dwarfstd.org/doc/Dwarf3.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   DWARF3\n  </a>\n  format for ELF binaries), if you use\n  <strong>\n   GCC\n  </strong>\n  with the\n  <strong>\n   -g3\n  </strong>\n  option. You can use\n  <strong>\n   GDB\n  </strong>\n  to extract the information, it parses the dwarf information to associate assembly code lines with source code lines, and memory locations to variable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You have to know that a variable name is only an abstraction of a memory location which is only known to the compiler at compile time, and after optimizations. Keep in mind that if you push the compiler to optimize (\n  <strong>\n   -Ox\n  </strong>\n  with\n  <strong>\n   GCC\n  </strong>\n  , x = [1, 2, 3, s, fast]), it'll minimize its stack references and use registers instead. Therefore, all references to your local variables will vanish into a temporary use of registers (the registers will be released and used elsewhere).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note : If you analyze an optimized code using\n  <strong>\n   GDB\n  </strong>\n  you'll notice that some function parameters or variables are shown as\n  <em>\n   \"optimized out\"\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Let me know if you need more details.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
