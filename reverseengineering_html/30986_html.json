    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a set of equations in string format as given below. Need to assign some value to the left-hand side variable (In the below example: rsp, esp). Then have to calculate and store the results on the right-hand side variable (i.e., rax, esp, rsp).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Example:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   rax = rsp\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   esp = esp - 0x4\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   rsp = rsp - 0x30\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Though I have used the\n  <code>\n   eval\n  </code>\n  function in python, it is throwing me an error message as it won't support\n  <code>\n   =\n  </code>\n  . Could someone please help me to find the answer?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
