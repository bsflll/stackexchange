    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Bit of a noob question, I'm working through some examples on crackmes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In Ollydbg and x64dbg, in the stack, disassembler and registry windows, there are texts to show values of memory locations, for instance:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/v7jhC.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Ollydbg descriptions\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/v7jhC.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I would have thought IDA would have had this information readily available in the debugger, however it seems the user has to hover over addresses to view it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kAlBD.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kAlBD.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way to display this available in IDA? It is much more useful in Olly/x64 to have the text, rather than\n  <code>\n   debug070:7EFDE000\n  </code>\n  etc\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
