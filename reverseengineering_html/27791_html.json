Just go to\n  <code>\n   Costura.AssemblyLoader\n  </code>\n  to check how it is done. below is a extract from a simple example using\n  <code>\n   Costura.Fody\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <pre><code>Assembly executingAssembly = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();\nif (fullName.EndsWith(\".compressed\"))\n{\n    using (Stream manifestResourceStream = executingAssembly.GetManifestResourceStream(fullName))\n    {\n        using (DeflateStream deflateStream = new DeflateStream(manifestResourceStream, CompressionMode.Decompress))\n        {\n            MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream();\n            AssemblyLoader.CopyTo(deflateStream, memoryStream);\n            memoryStream.Position = 0L;\n            return memoryStream;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  You could modify this code to save decompressed assemblies to disk by adding a line\n  <code>\n   File.WriteAllBytes(fullName.Replace(\".compressed\", \"\"), memoryStream.ToArray());\n  </code>\n  or just extract dlls resources and decompress externally via python or anything else that can do deflate.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
