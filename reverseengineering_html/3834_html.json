I needed to remplace only this class file in the jar to run my app. When decompiling it there is no difference! When decompiling in bytecode there are two little difference! (out of the context of my error) ... I tried to run diff unix command with no really success. Can I send you the bad and the good class files please ?\n</span>\n</body></html>",
