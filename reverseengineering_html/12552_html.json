When I use\n </p>\n <pre><code>objdump -sj .text filename.exe\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  the output consists of the offset, in hexadecimal format, on the far left, followed by the content, in hexadecimal format, in the middle and a mixture of dots and ASCII characters on the right.  I don't know if the dots represent unprintable characters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way to adjust the format of the output?  Ideally, I am hoping to get the printable strings without the hexadecimal numbers.  I have looked through the objdump man page but could not see a way to do this.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

With most versions of\n  <code>\n   strings\n  </code>\n  , you don't need the\n  <code>\n   -a\n  </code>\n  , and you can select the character encoding with\n  <code>\n   -e\n  </code>\n  , 16 bit little endian in this case. See the manual page for other encodings.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can use some of the Linux text utilities to further postprocess the output, but as @JasonGeffner said, superuser.com is a better place to ask about them.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
