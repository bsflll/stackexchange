The old way is the else part, and it assumes the checksum is at bytes 240-255 of the file. The generator sets them to 0, generates the MD5sum of the file, then stores the MD5sum into those bytes. The validator extracts them, sets them to 0, computes the MD5sum, and checks if they match. But all this is only done if sig_verify doesn't exists, or isn't executable.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

This will execute the sig_verify binary, which does something similar, but it will also use asymmetric encryption on the checksum. To replicate this, you'd need the private key, but you only have the public one from the disassembly. Getting that private key is about as feasible as getting the secret from an ssh or a https server - there's no real way to do this.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Even if the file isn't available the firmware should be verified and return a positive value, but it isn't. I mean, with the adaptation code I made if I pass the firmware it returns a verification check error (\n <code>\n  \"Error: wrong validation token ($token, $hash)\"\n </code>\n )  There should be a way of flashing a custom firmware without actually JTAG the router no?

Both\n  <code>\n   generate_hash\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   verify_key\n  </code>\n  use various functions of the\n  <a href=\"https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gcrypt/Function-and-Data-Index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   gcrypt\n  </a>\n  library (which it links dynamically).\n  <code>\n   main\n  </code>\n  opens a file from\n  <code>\n   argv\n  </code>\n  , uses\n  <code>\n   generate_hash\n  </code>\n  to calculate a checksum over the file, then calls\n  <code>\n   verify_key\n  </code>\n  .\n  <code>\n   verify_key\n  </code>\n  uses, among some other stuff,\n  <code>\n   gcry_pk_verify\n  </code>\n  , which verifies a public key. If\n  <code>\n   verify_key\n  </code>\n  succeeds,\n  <code>\n   main\n  </code>\n  truncates the last few bytes from the file (which, i assume, contain the key to verify against).\n </p>\n <p>\n  It seems to me that the vendor uses some private key to sign the firmware file, and has the flash process check the file against the corresponding public key, which would make it very hard to create a valid replacement firmware. HOWEVER, i only looked at the function names and strings and didn't try to understand every byte of the functions, so i might be wrong.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I don't know if my IDA license allows me to make the disassembly public, but i'll check this and, if you're interested and it's ok with the license, upload the disassembly somewhere so you can investigate further.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
