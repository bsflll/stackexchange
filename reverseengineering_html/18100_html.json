    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've just started to dip into Assembly for CTF reversing challenges, and am having a great time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A loop structure in the current challenge I'm working on has me stumped, however - hoping someone can help with a few basic Assembly questions - or point me to good resources.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I ran the binary provided for the challenge through Binary Ninja and identified the key function - tracing the logic within a loop is giving me problems.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For the program to return the flag, we need this check function - which looks at a user-entered string - to return 1. For the check function to return a 1, we need this loop to set EAX to 0x1.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The loop starts off fairly simply:\n </p>\n <pre><code>080486d5  sub     dword [ebp-0x10 {var_14_1} {var_14}], 0x1 \n080486d9  mov     dword [ebp-0xc {var_10_1}], 0x0\n080486e0  jmp     0x804870b\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  var_14 is the string length of the user input. By this point in the function, we know that the string length has to be at least 20\n </p>\n <p>\n  So this seems to simply set var_14_1 to var_14-1 and var_10_1 to 0.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then we enter the loop.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first block of the loop reads:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0804870b  mov     eax, dword [ebp-0xc {var_10_1}]\n0804870e  cmp     eax, dword [ebp-0x10 {var_14_1}]\n08048711  jbe     0x80486e2\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Which seems to say that if var_10_1 is less than var_14_1 continue with the loop.\nThis next block of the loop is where I think I'm not reading the code correctly:\n </p>\n <pre><code>080486e2  mov     edx, dword [ebp+0x8 {arg1}]\n080486e5  mov     eax, dword [ebp-0xc {var_10_1}]\n080486e8  add     eax, edx                  \n080486ea  movzx   edx, byte [eax]               \n080486ed  mov     ecx, dword [ebp+0x8 {arg1}]\n080486f0  mov     eax, dword [ebp-0x10 {var_14_1}]\n080486f3  add     eax, ecx\n080486f5  movzx   eax, byte [eax]\n080486f8  cmp     dl, al                    \n080486fa  je      0x8048703\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  arg1 is the user input - at this point all the know is that it has to be at least 20 characters long, and the first 4 characters are \"auqa\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  We need this cmp to succeed (dl == al) for the loop to continue. Otherwise, the code exits the loop and returns EAX to 0x0 (failure). Having said that - if we know that var_10_1 is 0 and var_14_1 is at least 19 at this first pass in the loop, and we add each to arg1 - then how can DL and AL be equal? Am I misunderstanding how\n  <code>\n   add eax, edx\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   add eax, ecx\n  </code>\n  work?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm not sure where my understanding of the code is incorrect - very much appreciate any tips or pointers. Apologize if this covers basic knowledge - I'm working through these on my own.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I see my mistake - that I didn't recognize that this code was actually setting up pointers to specific characters in the input string. I should have recognized it, given that a similar operation happens earlier in the code. Basic question - how did you recognize that the loop was dealing with a pointer to a specific character in the string, specifically the line <code>add eax, edx</code> - instances like that are hard for me to recognize coming from higher level languages with more defined data types.

Thus, eax must be an address. The fact that the code deals with characters can be guessed from the fact that dl and al are compared.
