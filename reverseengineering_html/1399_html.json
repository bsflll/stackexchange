For example, Some editors assume the resource section name must always be\n  <code>\n   .rsrc\n  </code>\n  . Examples:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <a href=\"http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/\">\n     Resource Hacker\n    </a>\n   </p>\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     <p>\n      Inserting a special resource to cause Resource Hacker to go into an infinite loop.

The only variation in behaviors was back when the win9x kernel was in use, and it varied from the NT kernel. Microsoft is well aware that linkers of all types generate such differing interpretations of the PE file format, that I'm sure they know not to touch anything. In fact, the PE file format is so surprisingly varied, the only constant is compatibility with Window's code. Of course, test well after making mods like these.</span>",
