I do not know much about cryptography but it looked like a CBC encryption. Here's the pseudocode I got from IDA:\n  <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/UGYpbthr\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   http://pastebin.com/UGYpbthr\n  </a>\n  and here is a part from the original subroutine:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EBlQa.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://i.sstatic.net/EBlQa.png\n  </a>\n  also here's a part from where the subroutine is called:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2S9Nc.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://i.sstatic.net/2S9Nc.png\n  </a>\n  . Is it possible to translate this pseudocode to C code without further reverse engineering ? If so how should I do it ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

W.S. is right in that the function doesn't access global variables; however, the three parameters (typed\n <code>\n  int\n </code>\n by IDA) are in fact pointers, if you check their usage, so you need the data fields they point to anyway.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

If i were you, i'd run the original program until your function, note the data, step over the function, note the data again, then plug that into the blowfish source and check if it does the same stuff. You'll have to call\n <code>\n  mbedtls_blowfish_setkey\n </code>\n first, and i'd guess might find this function in your original code as well if you look for it.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

You'll probably need to add some typedefs for basic types.\nPlease note that this code should be compiled as 32 bit code (or any other where sizeof int is equal to sizeof of pointer for your specific system) to avoid problems with pointer sizes.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
