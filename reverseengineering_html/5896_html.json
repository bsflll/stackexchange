However there is not enough documentation on it. The help for immdbg says this :\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   PyPlugins are python scripts located at PyPlugins\\ directory,\n  PyPlugins are called when F4 or the PyPlugin icon located at the main\n  toolbar are pressed. Both (F4 or the PyPlugin icon) will popup a file\n  browse dialog, where the starting folder is the PyPlugin Directory.\n  When a pyplugin is executed, its main() gets called. Please note a\n  pyplugin can not receive any arguments and will not return any value\n  other than inscreen errors.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  In reality when the\n  <kbd>\n   F4\n  </kbd>\n  key is pressed, nothing special happens.\n  <kbd>\n   F4\n  </kbd>\n  is actually the shortcut to\n  <em>\n   Run to selection\n  </em>\n  . Further there is no\n  <em>\n   PyPlugin\n  </em>\n  icon located at the main toolbar. The\n  <em>\n   PyPlugins\n  </em>\n  directory under Immunity Debugger directory is also empty, so no examples to look.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My question is what is a\n  <em>\n   PyPlugin\n  </em>\n  ? Are there any ready made\n  <em>\n   PyPlugins\n  </em>\n  to refer as an example ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <sub>\n   <strong>\n    Note\n   </strong>\n   : I am only talking about\n   <strong>\n    PyPlugins\n   </strong>\n   , not\n   <strong>\n    PyCommands\n   </strong>\n  </sub>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
