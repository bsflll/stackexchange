However, IDA 7.0.171130 (x86_64) is not behaving as expected.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As an example, I have selected the address\n  <code>\n   0x8000328\n  </code>\n  in the IDA view (the cursor is not visible in the screenshot) which is a\n  <code>\n   mov\n  </code>\n  instruction. However, the HEX-view shows\n  <code>\n   E8 D9 04 00 00\n  </code>\n  highlighted with the cursor on it; which is a\n  <code>\n   call\n  </code>\n  instruction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IjAig.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IjAig.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uts7n.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uts7n.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
