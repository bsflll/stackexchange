Both of those section contain executable code. Whereas,\n  <code>\n   .data\n  </code>\n  section contains non-executable data.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   .bss\n  </code>\n  segment is usually added due to optimization. The size of\n  <code>\n   .bss\n  </code>\n  is usually really small since it is designated to hold uninitialized data. In comparison,\n  <code>\n   .data\n  </code>\n  segment is designated to hold global/static variables and data structures.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Second code segment was most likely added manually.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, it is impossible to answer why the binary has two sections of code just by looking at the names. I think it is obviously unusual. I can state one thing for sure, you have two sections for a reason. However, you gonna have to fig in to figure out what the reason is.\n </p>\n <p>\n  First thing I would do is try to confirm segment permissions and CLASS. True code segment will have\n  <code>\n   Read\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   Execute\n  </code>\n  permissions. You can use lots of different tools to verify it. For instance, if you were to use IDA, it is done with\n  <code>\n   Segments Subview\n  </code>\n  , which could be accessed with\n  <kbd>\n   Shift\n  </kbd>\n  +\n  <kbd>\n   F7\n  </kbd>\n  . You might get lucky and spot the fake right from the get go.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So the only real way of knowing the section's real properties is by checking\n  <code>\n   IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER\n  </code>\n  's\n  <code>\n   Characteristics\n  </code>\n  field. Use a PE dumping utility like dumpbin and check to see if the section is marked as executable.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
