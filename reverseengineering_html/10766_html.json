    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Basically i'm debugging a closed source binary on Android and i want to execute some of my code in between which is large enough not to fit in codecave. So is it possible to compile library with my code separately & then calling it from target binary?\nIf yes then how?\n </p>\n <p>\n  My friend suggested me to modify binary header & extend data segment to inject my code. Is it convenient?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have another one suggestion.\nI know interface to that closed source binary, then is it possible to write a wrapper binary?\nFor ex, suppose closed source binary is libfoo.so. Then is it possible to write a binary libbar.so which actually loads libfoo.so & sends function calls to libfoo.so\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm asking this because i've seen some warez programs bundled with some extra dlls & often some wrapper executable.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Essentially you write a small application, either Java/Application based or C/Native based. An example of doing this is here;\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/rednaga/native-shim\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   https://github.com/rednaga/native-shim\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  This allows you to call any method you would like with slight modifications.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

However you can use\n  <a href=\"http://frida.re\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Frida\n  </a>\n  during debugging session to intercept specific calls, automate this task and run your own code written in (surprise!)
