    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  My goal is far from nefarious. After several polite attempts to try and get Lenovo to implement a proper keyboard backlight control, I've had no response.\nThey do have a Windows Store app which adds that control, however, it's not tied to keyboard or mouse input (idle user time). I can implement that, with AutoHotKey, if I manage to call their methods.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Screenshots for reference:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pGBre.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://i.sstatic.net/pGBre.jpg\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Using JetBrains I can see a quite readable code, written in .NET (I assume), my main interest is in Keyboard_Core.dll. There I can see the methods for getting and setting the keyboard backlight, but I don't understand how they work.\n </p>\n <pre><code>public unsafe uint SetKeyboardBackLightStatus(int nStatus)\n{\n  CKeyboardLight* ckeyboardLightPtr1 = (CKeyboardLight*) <Module>.@new(4U);\n  CKeyboardLight* ckeyboardLightPtr2;\n  // ISSUE: fault handler\n  try\n  {\n    ckeyboardLightPtr2 = (IntPtr) ckeyboardLightPtr1 == IntPtr.Zero ? (CKeyboardLight*) 0 : <Module>.ThinkPad.CKeyboardLight.{ctor}(ckeyboardLightPtr1);\n  }\n  __fault\n  {\n    <Module>.delete((void*) ckeyboardLightPtr1);\n  }\n  <Module>.ThinkPad.CKeyboardLight.SetStatus(ckeyboardLightPtr2, (KBDLIGHT_STATUS) nStatus);\n  if ((IntPtr) ckeyboardLightPtr2 != IntPtr.Zero)\n  {\n    CKeyboardLight* ckeyboardLightPtr3 = ckeyboardLightPtr2;\n    int num = 1;\n    // ISSUE: cast to a function pointer type\n    // ISSUE: function pointer call\n    void* voidPtr = __calli((__FnPtr<void* (IntPtr, uint)>) *(int*) *(int*) ckeyboardLightPtr2)((uint) ckeyboardLightPtr3, (IntPtr) num);\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I don't understand where @new(4U) points to. In the decompiled declaration it says it's\n  <code>\n   [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential, Size = 4)]\n  </code>\n  - so I can probably work with that without any structure description. Is it later pointed to some real memory address?\nI cannot figure that out, it seems that both\n  <code>\n   ckeyboardLightPtr1\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   ckeyboardLightPtr2\n  </code>\n  are new objects until the end of the function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I don't know how to call a random address (function) with some prepared parameters (stack) - should I stick to AHK (then it would be a different question), try Python (another layer), PowerShell (never used it) or create a small C program?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Either way, it looks that I have to set 4 bytes somewhere in memory. Perhaps I'm chasing the wrong end and these functions just set a temporary/proxy object that is later handled by a monitor thread.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/vyfiTTcr\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://pastebin.com/vyfiTTcr\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ollydbg doesn't let me do anything with the DLL.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
