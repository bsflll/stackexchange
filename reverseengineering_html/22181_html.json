Just installed IDA (free) v.7.0 on a brand-new installation of Windows 10 (x64) in a VM:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1Wjh6.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1Wjh6.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then loaded a test PE file and started debugging it (using\n  <code>\n   Local Windows Debugger\n  </code>\n  ):\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yPvzz.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yPvzz.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So now I want to load symbols from the Microsoft server, say for\n  <code>\n   ntdll.dll\n  </code>\n  (or any other Windows module for that matter):\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QEsCN.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QEsCN.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  This fails with the following message in the output window:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nV5gn.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nV5gn.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <pre><code>DWARF: Cannot determine location of DWARF info for \"C:\\Windows\\System32\ntdll.dll\".\nCould not load debug info for module: \"C:\\Windows\\System32\ntdll.dll\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Any idea what am I doing wrong?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I also noticed that in the menu for that command, it says,\n <code>\n  \"... you can specify .dll or .exe. In that case IDA will try to find and load PDB specified in its debug directory.\"\n </code>\n How do I configure that\n <code>\n  debug directory\n </code>\n ? I know in WinDbg one needs to provide a URL to Microsoft public symbols. Do I need to do the same for IDA?\n</span>\n</body></html>",

It also affects WinDbg, Visual Studio and other tools that make <i>some</i> use of the debug helper API to fetch symbols. You can fine-tune what location to use as cache and thereby keep your own local network share for your local symbols (e.g. of own products) but also consult the Microsoft servers and cache those symbols. If you have a VS subscription there's a chance you can also still access symbol packages for older Windows versions, if needed. But the symbol servers are reasonably fast, I find.</span>",
