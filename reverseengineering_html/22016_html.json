    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  SizeOfHeapReserve and SizeOfHeapCommit are in the optional header of windows executables. They are set to 0x100000 and 0x1000 respectively in most executables (my firefox has 0x40000 as reserve for example). The\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#optional-header-windows-specific-fields-image-only\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   docs\n  </a>\n  just say it is \"The size of the local heap space to reserve/commit\".\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   How do executables ever get a pointer to this reserved heap space? I thought they always needed to call\n   <code>\n    HeapAlloc\n   </code>\n   /\n   <code>\n    VirtualAlloc\n   </code>\n   to get heap space?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   How do linkers decide what to set these values to?\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
