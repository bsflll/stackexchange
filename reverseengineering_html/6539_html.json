Then I used\n  <strong>\n   <a href=\"https://github.com/devttys0/sasquatch\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    sasquatch\n   </a>\n  </strong>\n  utility to extract content of dpc.squashfs file, and I got the same\n  <code>\n   squashfs-root\n  </code>\n  directory. I compared content of both\n  <code>\n   squashfs-root\n  </code>\n  directories and find, that the squashfs-root dir extracted with binwalk have\n  <code>\n   www\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   www_safe\n  </code>\n  folders, whereas in squashfs-root dir extracted with\n  <code>\n   sasquatch\n  </code>\n  that folders are missing. Why the extracted content differs?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You can try forcing the compression type in sasquatch with the -c option instead of letting sasquatch try to guess, which might help. It's probably best to submit this as an issue on the sasquatch github page you linked to, along with a copy of the firmware image.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

It extracted fine both through binwalk and directly with sasquatch. Again, if you're having bugs with either of these tools, it should probably be reported to the binwalk / sasquatch project pages rather than here.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

I tested sasquatch more times, and in my tests it extracts full content of the .squashfs file, include www and www_safe dirs, even without the\n <code>\n  -c lzma\n </code>\n option. Don't know why this happen when I tested first time. Maybe this somehow related to file permissions, as sometimes these directories been extracted with\n <code>\n  drwx--x--x (711)\n </code>\n permission, and this prevents accessing them. Sometimes it been extracted with\n <code>\n  drwxr-xr-x (755)\n </code>\n permission. It extracted fine with binwalk, in fact, it wasn't necessary to use sasquatch tool, but I didn't know content of this squashfs-root.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
