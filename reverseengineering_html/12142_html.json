    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  SysTracer from SysReveal.com (not from www.blueproject.ro) seems to be a very nice tool for live monitoring your system and check what executable files do at your system. I saw some videos on YouTube where sys-admins used it to show e.g. how Ransomware works. In this video on YouTube (\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm5TbBKeFvU\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm5TbBKeFvU\n  </a>\n  ) by the well known company \"Trend Micro\", they mentioned (at 0:56) the website SysReveal.com, where you can download SysTracer. The website is on Google's SafeBrowsing blacklist and the tool \"SysTracer\" hits 8 (\n  <em>\n   .zip) or 9 (\n  </em>\n  .exe) of 55 at Virustotal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I would appreciate it, if you check this tool NOR share your thoughts about it.\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Website: sysreveal.com\n   <strong>\n    (Google's SafeBrowsing Alert!)\n   </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   SysTracer:\nhxxp://sysreveal.com/download/SysTracer.zip\n   <strong>\n    (8 of 55 at Virustotal)\n   </strong>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Image of SysTracer\n  </em>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9KjO2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9KjO2.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
