So, in this case, there seems to be no way to define structs at all. Windows/Reset Desktop should fix it though.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you knew about this, sorry about stealing your time, but if you asked the question because you had no way to define a new struct, it might still be helpful -- doesn't give you the convenience of a hotkey, but at least a way to define your structs.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
