Anyway, you simply need to tell python to treat your payload as bytes by adding the bytes-literal\n  <code>\n   b\n  </code>\n  before the\n  <code>\n   'A'*140\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <pre><code>>>> from pwn import *\n>>>\n>>> puts_plt = 0x8048390\n>>> puts_got = 0x804a014\n>>> entry_point = 0x80483d0\n>>>\n>>> payload  =  b'A' * 40   # Only 40 for the example\n>>> ropchain =  p32(puts_plt)\n>>> ropchain += p32(entry_point)\n>>> ropchain += p32(puts_got)\n>>>\n>>> payload = payload + ropchain\n>>>\n>>> print(payload)\nb'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\x90\\x83\\x04\\x08\\xd0\\x83\\x04\\x08\\x14\\xa0\\x04\\x08'\n>>>\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  For further reading, you can read the\n  <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#strings\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   String and Bytes literals\n  </a>\n  page in the Python3 documentation.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
