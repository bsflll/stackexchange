    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm working on reverse engineering a USB controller. The name of the controller chip is the \"UD6810\" which appears to be a Chinese clone of another chip (since a lot of results about it have been removed from Google via DMCA requests). I've found a program which can successfully flash the firmware.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, I obviously need to determine the instruction set before I can modify it. The datasheets I've found on the web seem to be missing this key information and docs are generally quite hard to find. I have the binary code since I can both see it in the flashing program's files and capture it in the USB traffic as it flashes the chip.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How can I determine the instruction set?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
