If not for the version, the file seems to be normal and JEB loads it without any problem.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But per official spec of\n  <a href=\"https://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik/dex-format.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   DEX format\n  </a>\n  the only allowed values are 035 and 037, with 038 in Android 8.0. Previously the text explicitly read (but not any more):\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Due to a Dalvik bug present in older versions of Android, Dex version 036 has been skipped. Dex version 036 is not valid for any version of Android and never will be.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  The same story is confirmed here -\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali/issues/484\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali/issues/484\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  How Android behaves on such a dex? Does Dalvik simply load it silently or rejects? Or this is a known technique of concealing the file from analysis and the version is being corrected just before the dex is loaded?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
