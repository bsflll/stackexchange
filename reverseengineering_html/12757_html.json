    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I found a binary on a device I've been working on, it's called\n  <code>\n   genrandpass\n  </code>\n  and the only user input is a public key (which is a .bin file) that's stored locally on the device. It also gathers some other information, possibly from the environment to produce three passwords (there is a reference to the Box ID using\n  <code>\n   strings\n  </code>\n  ). Looking thru the shell scripts pertaining to\n  <code>\n   genrandpass\n  </code>\n  , it takes the three generated passwords and:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   uses the first password as the root password\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   uses the second password is called\n   <code>\n    $epass\n   </code>\n   and the third is called\n   <code>\n    $spass\n   </code>\n   (I only note the names in case it means anything to someone smarter than I.)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   it then copies\n   <code>\n    $epass\n   </code>\n   and\n   <code>\n    $spass\n   </code>\n   to the dropbear banner file and these are displayed whenever someone connects to dropbear (prior to even logging in).\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  This makes me think that the developer had intended on being able to use the\n  <code>\n   $epass\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   $spass\n  </code>\n  variables to generate the actual root password. There are a few certificates and one Private key (decryption.pem) on the box itself. Not sure if it's the right key to decipher the code but I'd like to try because I have a few other models of these boxes that I haven't been able to break into yet. I'm just not sure what the correct commands are to try. Any ideas?\n </p>\n <p>\n  genrandpass file at\n  <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23091/genrandpass\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23091/genrandpass\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  examples of the last 2 passwords generated:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    $epass\n   </strong>\n   : SxTV2Z7TFvU0XKP/lYYTDlKAhlRR2jwkDGbWPF68go/oOx6x4Pr5DeyNRlx9oQGF05sHld/vyXXchmxlbzsVzPIwocWIq3OIr3J+ZFJrJYPss9VE7YWrwpyRlGwTVHDvZGIzCKXcaipJd85ldLiWUrNxMl4g+5kzwVA2a3I8LuiuixRFVmc8ji/W2W5ZeU5FTcbaiNjlpoRHjPFUkvHKJ4nHSfXpZuLDRS53hxcSnb8ZmvTmFP4ITAdyj9Yw+C2pvD+gSEWRB/H+1cFPQOTi7wr/FY8266QEWqGZw30ZEsMCUNCC0DgiIX+H68QKcU8QFYUJC5+vui3BtcOfFXKHZl==\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    $spass\n   </strong>\n   :\nRtcTy7fJ11XAQi1P2HiZM4MAxMZMA2NlD6wZL8jNYdrSL5i8qtkGztKDccmGqRWgjiVKI7TcVNcX3PhUSB3UfQCAF6KpBvH7NNezkExdwdM3W2mSnXJvyRLpDSJEgALs0wurUrqIYClZOjTc+xiJzOIUP0Gxb4d2ADOaKXHQ6n6H2Ss/1smITjrbXJ1K8RentZu26sAy3DW+zRIxtxnktSAGUscdG1oytlOL15aAROSL27NUcPSoA3+4o76zggq5TspIBTSmidVRUccEdXPyAzZggR0yqGNrm99uJXHlhw4zCW+GzKJFsJSTwDHZvCoeLERCLuyXFVrgmIISKf6E2V==\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Thus i wouldn't put too much weight on the fact the rsa function is called \"decrypt\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd assume the run_sha function generates a random 32 bit key, uses that to do the encryption, and saves it to what i call\n  <code>\n   rsa_buffer\n  </code>\n  . Later, run_rsa_ks (ks for key save) rsa-encrypts that sha key. So, if you lose the root password to a device, and ask the vendor for help, they\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   use the private key to decrypt the second code, to get the sha key\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   use the private key to decrypt the first code, to get the sha output\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   use the sha key and the sha output to get a buffer that contains your root password, and the finder id\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   verify if the finder id matches the id you told them\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   tell you the root password.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Unfortunately, and as i already said in my comment, this means unless you can crack rsa, and don't have any other means to get the private key, your quest ends here. Unless the vendor used a very weak RSA key, but this isn't very probable when they used the effort they did to secure the root password.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Update\n  </strong>\n  : I glanced over some of the functions in that libjsonsigner.so, and the\n  <code>\n   get_finder_id_public_key\n  </code>\n  as well as the rsa functions use a device named\n  <code>\n   /dev/vixs/xcodedrv\n  </code>\n  , which hints at a\n  <a href=\"http://www.vixs.com/index-ee.php/products/product/xcode\">\n   video hardware chip\n  </a>\n  .  There's a\n  <code>\n   get_certificate\n  </code>\n  function as well which uses a\n  <code>\n   get_device_certx\n  </code>\n  function that uses the same device. So at least a part of the certificate stuff, as well as the rsa encryption, seem to be hardware-assisted. This means without dynamical analysis on the actual hardware, good chip documentation, and a\n  <em>\n   lot\n  </em>\n  of time, you won't get very much farther (and will probably still smash into a wall at some point because of RSA).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Anyway, a lot of the RSA stuff seems to be hardware-assisted, see my update above. And RSA (it's the algorithm used in ssl/https) is designed to not allow you to decrypt if you have just the encryption key, and vice versa, so no, having one half of the key won't help you.</span>",
