The canvas on which the websites are being rendered will be a single\n <i>\n  window\n </i>\n in terms of how Windows (user32.dll) looks at it. Everything inside is drawn by the application. However, something like MFC or WTL makes use of the native windowing capabilities built into Windows and that involves sending/receiving so-called window messages. These two extremes require completely different approaches even though both can run on Windows.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
