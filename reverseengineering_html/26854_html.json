When i use burp suite with my android emulator it was making a\n  <strong>\n   POST\n  </strong>\n  request to a method of an api in form of\n  <strong>\n   JSON Array\n  </strong>\n  (Encrypted)...is there any way that i can decrypt this text or find decryption key?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also i have found that after deobfuscating i found a method named as void decode() but it doesnt reveal any information..so is there is anyway to use this method explicitly?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Then I would use\n <a href=\"https://frida.re\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  frida\n </a>\n on an rooted phone to hook that method and extract the used encryption key (assuming the used encryption algorithm is something standardized like AES).\n</span>\n</body></html>",
