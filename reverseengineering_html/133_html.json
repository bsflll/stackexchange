I wouldn't recommend reading it all (it does get boring). Just the first three or four chapters. This will help with having a foundation of knowledge for the structure and keywords. Here are the two I would recommend.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://wwwimages.adobe.com/www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/swf/pdf/swf-file-format-spec.pdf\">\n   SWF File Format\n  </a>\n  PDF,\n  <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/actionscript/articles/avm2overview.pdf\">\n   ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview\n  </a>\n  PDF\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once you have a basis of knowledge check out some posts on Flash Exploits. Here is a list of posts in no particular order or value\n  <a href=\"http://x9090.blogspot.com/2009/05/swf-exploit-analysis-part-1.html\">\n   1\n  </a>\n  ,\n  <a href=\"http://www.h-online.com/security/features/CSI-Internet-Matryoshka-in-Flash-1057907.html\">\n   2\n  </a>\n  ,\n  <a href=\"http://blog.threatexpert.com/2008/05/flash-exploit-goes-wild.html\">\n   3\n  </a>\n  ,\n  <a href=\"http://zarestel.blogspot.com/2008/06/just-quick-one-on-swf-exploit-cve-2007.html\">\n   4\n  </a>\n  ,\n  <a href=\"http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/cyber-exploits/2009/07/actionscript_heap_spray.html\">\n   5\n  </a>\n  ,\n  <a href=\"http://www.vupen.com/blog/20110326.Technical_Analysis_and_Win7_Exploitation_Adobe_Flash_0Day_CVE-2011-0609.php\">\n   6\n  </a>\n  ,\n  <a href=\"http://community.websense.com/blogs/securitylabs/archive/2010/06/09/having-fun-with-adobe-0-day-exploits.aspx\">\n   7\n  </a>\n  . Searching the\n  <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/search?q=flash&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all\">\n   RE Reddit\n  </a>\n  is also another good resource for SWF/Flash analysis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For better or for worse a lot of great work has been done by the exploit community for reverse engineering SWF/ActionScript/Flash/etc. There a number of researchers I would recommend google stalking their work. Haifei Li is one notable individual. A quick google search for filetype:PDF + \"Haifei Li\" will bring up a lot of great resources. Example:\n  <a href=\"http://www.fortiguard.com/files/CanSecWest2011_Flash_ActionScript.pdf\">\n   link\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  IF you are sick of reading I'd recommend downloading some samples.\n  <a href=\"http://contagiodump.blogspot.com/\">\n   Contagiodump\n  </a>\n  is a good place to grab samples. Typically the sample have the proper CVE number. This can be helpful because a quick google of CVE-number + \"analysis\" will allow you to do the at home follow along version. Of course you will need tools. I personally would recommend\n  <a href=\"http://zeltser.com/remnux/\">\n   REMnux\n  </a>\n  by Lenny Zeltser. Almost all the tools listed in this thread are already installed in it. If you are working with SWFs embedded in documents I'd recommend\n  <a href=\"http://hooked-on-mnemonics.blogspot.com/2011/12/xxxswfpy.html\">\n   xxxswf.py\n  </a>\n  for extracting them. The source code isn't that badly commented so it will give you some basics about the file structure.\n  <em>\n   Disclaimer: my tool.\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  A couple of tools that aren't listed that I'd recommend is Flash Decompiler by\n  <a href=\"http://www.flash-decompiler.com/\">\n   Trillix\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/opengg-clean-player/downloads/detail?name=Yogda.1.0.564.zip&can=2&q=\">\n   Yogoda\n  </a>\n  . Both of these tools are for Windows.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
