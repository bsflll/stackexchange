My specific problem was related that\n  <code>\n   0x90\n  </code>\n  byte on my file was a\n  <code>\n   latin\n  </code>\n  character which\n  <code>\n   UTF-8\n  </code>\n  couldn't recognize. On top of my file I wrote\n  <code>\n   # -- coding: latin-1 --\n  </code>\n  and it was fixed. For anyone curios the little pest was this character\n  <code>\n   Ãˆ\n  </code>\n  at byte\n  <code>\n   0x90\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
