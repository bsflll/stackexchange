    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have an android app that reads/writes a data file which seems to be encrypted, and i want to make a tool to read/write that file, so i need to reverse the encryption.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The app in question consists of a few hundred classes and several .so libraries, and grepping through the classes and the output of\n  <code>\n   strings\n  </code>\n  on the .so files doesn't find the name of the game file (i tried case-sensitive, omitting the extension, and all that stuff), so the \"easy\" way to find the function doesn't work. So, what i want to do is intercept calls to the\n  <code>\n   open\n  </code>\n  system call, and check the stacks (dalvik and C) for the callers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On Windows, this is quite easy using\n  <code>\n   procmon\n  </code>\n  which saves the stack of each system call; on Linux, there is\n  <code>\n   strace -i\n  </code>\n  which doesn't give me a stack backtrace, but at least an IP value; also, i could make a named pipe having the filename in question to make the app block on opening it and attach gdb to get the backtrace.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The problem with using\n  <code>\n   strace\n  </code>\n  and or a debugger on android is that i a) it seems to be non-trivial to get a version of\n  <code>\n   strace\n  </code>\n  that works with a particular OS level of android, b) when i try the named pipe approach, the app just exits, c) unless the whole encryption stuff is done in one of the\n  <code>\n   .so\n  </code>\n  libraries, i need the Java stack as well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I found\n  <a href=\"http://newandroidbook.com/tools/jtrace.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   jtrace\n  </a>\n  which seems to be a replacement for\n  <code>\n   strace\n  </code>\n  , but doesnt show the stack, and\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1714/dynamic-java-instrumentation\">\n   this question\n  </a>\n  has some links, but they seem to be targetted at instrumentation/profiling, not what i need.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So the question really is in the title: Is there a tool that traces system calls on android, and shows the stack trace, like\n  <code>\n   procmon\n  </code>\n  does on windows, including the java stack if possible? Or another idea to quickly find the code that opens and decrypts the file?\n </p>\n <p>\n  If all else fails, i'll probably attach IDA to the process, put a breakpoint on\n  <code>\n   open\n  </code>\n  , and write a breakpoint condition that checks the file name. But that still won't give me the java stack, and i'd like to avoid the effort if there's a \"nicer\" tool.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

After that you just need to use -k to get system call stack for each system call.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
