In addition to changing variables in the method I want to change the arugment passed to the method. I know how to do this with Xposed but I'm not sure with Frida.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Generic Question:\n  </strong>\n  How can the arugments passed to method be maniputed with Frida and what is good souce of documentation and examples for Frida?\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   More specific question:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I wanted something that was more of a challenge so I moved onto Snapchat. My aim is to emulate the speed spoofing feature of the\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/marzika/Snapprefs\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   SnapPrefs\n  </a>\n  Xposed module as this seemed fairly simple to do and its effect can be easily seen in the app. I looked through the SnapPrefs souce and found that I need to hook the \"adL\" class and change the argument passed to the \"a\" method.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The code for the method in the APK is:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   public final void a(float paramFloat)\n  {\n      ....\n  }\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm using this JavaScript code in order to print \"Speed showing\" to the screen whenever the method is active.\n </p>\n <pre><code>Java.perform(function () {\n// Function to hook is defined here\nvar SpeedometerView = Java.use('adL');\n\n// Whenever button is clicked\nSpeedometerView.a.overload('float').implementation = function (v) {\n    // Show a message to know that the function got called\n    send('Speed showing');\n\n    // Call the original onClick handler\n    this.a.overload('float');\n};\n});\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So from this: What would be the easiest way to manipulate the paramFloat argument?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

            "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  If I understand your question correctly, you want to change the parameter,\n  <code>\n   v\n  </code>\n  , inside the inner function. Right? \nIf that's the case, you would already have access to the\n  <code>\n   v\n  </code>\n  argument inside your inner function. So what you can do is something like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Java.perform(function () {\n// Function to hook is defined here\nvar SpeedometerView = Java.use('adL');\n\n// Whenever button is clicked\nSpeedometerView.a.overload('float').implementation = function (v) {\n    // Show a message to know that the function got called\n    send('Speed showing');\n    old_param_value = v;\n    new_param_value = 100.00;\n    // Call the original onClick handler\n    x = this.a(new_param_value);\n};\n});\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  also, assuming you wanted to change the value of the param from whatever exiting to 100.00\nreturn x if needed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, if you are looking to do this dynamically, like say based on user input etc., at run time, I do not know how to do it. In fact, I would be keeping an eye out for it if someone answers that !\n </p>\n <p>\n  In fact I tried things like this:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   s4.js\n  </code>\n </p>\n <pre><code>Java.perform(\n function()\n {\n   var item = Java.use(\"java.util.Random\");\n   console.log(\"Found random loaded\");\n   item.nextInt.overload(\"int\").implementation = function(a)\n   {\n     var ret = this.nextInt(a);\n     send(\"[*] The random no \" + ret.toString());\n     recv(function (received_json_object) {\n           cheat_num = received_json_object.my_data\n           console.log(\"[*] Cheated bot number received \" + cheat_num);            \n       }).wait();\n     return cheat_num;\n   }\n }\n);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   not_working.py\n  </code>\n </p>\n <pre><code>import time\nimport frida\n\ndef my_message_handler(message, payload):\n   print message.get('payload')\n\n   if message[\"type\"] == \"send\":\n       print \"in here\"      \n       place_bot_chic_at = raw_input(\"Give the index where bot chicken should be placed \")\n       print \"bot chick will be placed at \" + str(place_bot_chic_at)\n       # script.post({\"my_data\": 7331}) # This works perfectly fine.\n       script.post({\"my_data\": place_bot_chic_at}) # This gives error as :\n       print \"Bot chick position sent\"\n\ndevice = frida.get_device_manager().enumerate_devices()[-1]\npid = device.spawn([\"chicken.wars.main\"])\ndevice.resume(pid)\ntime.sleep(1)  \nsession = device.attach(pid)\nwith open(\"s4.js\") as f:\n   jss = f.read()\n   script = session.create_script(jss)\n\nscript.on(\"message\", my_message_handler) #register the message handler\nscript.load()\nraw_input()\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But when I run that python, I get the following error:\n </p>\n <pre><code>lib/python2.7/site-packages/frida/core.py\", line 298, in _on_message\n  callback(message, data)\nFile \"not_working.py\", line 12, in my_message_handler\n  script.post({\"my_data\": place_bot_chic_at}) # This gives error as :\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'post'\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Also, strangely, the moment after the\n  <code>\n   in here\n  </code>\n  string gets printed, I was expecting the user input line to be executed next. But that does not happen unless I press an enter. As soon as I press enter, the user input line\n  <code>\n   place_bot_chic_at = raw_input(\"Give the index where bot chicken should be placed \")\n  </code>\n  gets executed. I give a value and enter and that's when the above error occurs. \nI have no idea what is going wrong. If someone does, please help understand where am I going wrong.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
