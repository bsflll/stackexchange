So the trick is to collect the new pid with a shell script, feed that\n  <em>\n   pid\n  </em>\n  to a\n  <code>\n   gdb\n  </code>\n  command file and then rapidly repeat the command file during the window.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, you can use\n  <em>\n   pidof\n  </em>\n  to get the\n  <em>\n   pid\n  </em>\n  of your program:\n </p>\n <pre><code>echo \"attach $(pidof <program>)\" > attach_pid\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Note that the\n  <em>\n   pidof\n  </em>\n  would pick up a defunct'ed process if there is one.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Under the Unix shell, create an executable file containing the above Unix command. Name it\n  <code>\n   attach.sh\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Next, defined a\n  <code>\n   gdb\n  </code>\n  user defined command:\n </p>\n <pre><code>define a\nshell . ./attach.sh\nsource attach_pid\nend\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Define a long command name will just slow you down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When everything is ready, trigger the program, and quickly during the window for re-attach, just hit\n  <kbd>\n   a\n  </kbd>\n  and press\n  <kbd>\n   Enter\n  </kbd>\n  down until\n  <code>\n   gdb\n  </code>\n  attaches to the process.  Note that a return will repeat the previous command and hold on the Enter key will soon generate a rapidly repeated key stroke.  Also note that when the new\n  <em>\n   pid\n  </em>\n  is not created yet, the\n  <em>\n   attach_pid\n  </em>\n  just contains\n  <code>\n   \"attach \"\n  </code>\n  and gives error messages.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
