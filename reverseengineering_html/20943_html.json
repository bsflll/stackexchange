In short, it will enable you to hook native/Dalvik routines on rooted/non-rooted devices and write hook logic in JS. The framework also has python bindings which can provide means for automation. Following is a short explanation about the usage flow for analysis of APK file:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Rooted device:\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     there is a great quick start guide on the Frida's site -\n     <a href=\"https://www.frida.re/docs/android/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n      link\n     </a>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     <a href=\"https://www.notsosecure.com/instrumenting-native-android-functions-using-frida/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n      here\n     </a>\n     is an example of hooking native function for a running APK file, but you can also use the framework to analyze arbitrary native executable which you can attach to or spawn a new process.\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Not-rooted device:\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     in that case you will need to re-package APK and include server library to it.\n     <a href=\"https://koz.io/using-frida-on-android-without-root/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n      Here\n     </a>\n     is a good example how to do it.\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  The framework is in active development and cross-platform/arch supported. If more granular control is needed, you can even develop lower-level apps (e.g. in C) against it's API library.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
