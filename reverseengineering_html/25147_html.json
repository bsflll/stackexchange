How would I go about dereferencing that member?\n </p>\n <pre><code>struct example {\n  int member1;\n  *object member2;\n};\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Would I be dereferencing member 2 like so (pointer to struct comes as first param):\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov eax, [ebp+8]\nmov eax, dword ptr [eax]\nmov eax, [eax+8] ; this would get me the pointer to member2???\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  any input appreciated\n </p>\n <p>\n  EDIT:\n </p>\n <p>\n  I see, your explanation was understandable, thank you, I appreciate it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have one more question that popped up from my mind. Say in your example, member 2 is a pointer to an int, then\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov eax, [ebp + 8] ; eax contains pointer to struct and its first member\nmov eax, [eax + 4] ; eax contains a pointer to member2 (this is a pointer to an int)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Say i would like to get the value of member to into ecx i would carry on like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov eax, [eax]\nmov ecx, [eax]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So the whole thing would read like so:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov eax, [ebp + 8] ; eax contains pointer to struct and its first member\nmov eax, [eax + 4] ; eax contains a pointer to member2 (this is a pointer to an int)\nmov eax, [eax]     ; dereferenfce the pointer that is pointing to member2\nmov ecx, [eax]     ; dereference member2 itself that is a pointer to an int\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Is this correct?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In your example,\n  <code>\n   [ebp + 8]\n  </code>\n  is a pointer to\n  <code>\n   member1\n  </code>\n  and you can access a pointer to\n  <code>\n   member2\n  </code>\n  like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov eax, [ebp + 8] ; eax contains pointer to struct and its first member\nmov eax, [eax + 4] ; eax contains a pointer to member2\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  When in any doubt, you can always write a simple program, compile it and check the resulting assembler code. In your case, you could write something like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <stdio.h>\n\nstruct example\n{\n    int member1;\n    void* member2;\n};\n\n\nvoid initialiseStruct(struct example* e)\n{\n    e->member1 = 1;\n    e->member2 = NULL;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    struct example e;\n    initialiseStruct(&e);\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And then compile it and run\n  <code>\n   objdump -dM intel FILENAME\n  </code>\n  to get a snippet like the following one:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0000054d <initialiseStruct>:\n 54d:   55                      push   ebp\n 54e:   89 e5                   mov    ebp,esp\n 550:   e8 6b 00 00 00          call   5c0 <__x86.get_pc_thunk.ax>\n 555:   05 83 1a 00 00          add    eax,0x1a83\n 55a:   8b 45 08                mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]\n 55d:   c7 00 01 00 00 00       mov    DWORD PTR [eax],0x1 ; e->member1 = 1\n 563:   8b 45 08                mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]\n 566:   c7 40 04 00 00 00 00    mov    DWORD PTR [eax+0x4],0x0 ; e->member2 = NULL\n 56d:   90                      nop\n 56e:   5d                      pop    ebp\n 56f:   c3                      ret  \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Regarding your second question: you should view\n  <code>\n   []\n  </code>\n  in assembly like\n  <code>\n   *\n  </code>\n  in C in case of\n  <code>\n   mov\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  If\n  <code>\n   member2\n  </code>\n  points to\n  <code>\n   int\n  </code>\n  , you can access this integer this way (I've added C equivalents next to each assembly instruction):\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov eax, [ebp + 8] ; eax = e - remember, in my example e is a pointer\nmov eax, [eax + 4] ; eax = *(e + 4) = e->member2, so now eax contains the memory address at e->member2\nmov ecx, [eax] ; ecx = *(e->member2) - ecx contains the integer value\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
