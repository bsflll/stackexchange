It never affects the instance of that class in the target process.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It means there will be a straight call to A::doThing instead of a reference through the vtable. Another possibility is that the compiler caches the result of the VTable lookup of the first invocation of doThing and reuses the cached address.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
