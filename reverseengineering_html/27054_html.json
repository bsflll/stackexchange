These directories are created by default in your home directory (\n  <code>\n   System.getProperty(\"user.home\")\n  </code>\n  ). These directories contain preferences, script/application logs and other “cached” files. (This cache path is decided using\n  <a href=\"https://ghidra.re/ghidra_docs/api/ghidra/framework/Application.html#getUserSettingsDirectory()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   getUserSettingsDirectory()\n  </a>\n  ) divided by you Ghidra version.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, if you reinstall, rerun Ghidra, they get recreated.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
