Some of them are jpegs but other ones look like they're base64 encoded, except they don't appear to be, as they contain invalid chars such as & and -. If I \"repair\" the invalid chars I can base64 decode it, but it's just random binary data I can't discern anything from (does base64 have a checksum built in or can I base64-decode any string that has valid base64 characters?).\n </p>\n <p>\n  The data is around ~74 KB for an image I'm requesting in 500px width. Here is a bit of the content:\n </p>\n <pre><code>MAXe09nMdH7sLXdcCVfZhA1p3ll44Ye5vJABsCGRPlh4xej7NYAu9otU2xUns35mHcwVr1j12l9Mn2AsSP9RTZEjljoUGNzkCn5yshkPMGLBmyFgrI2PjRpme0UIFX9n/CF1K1FDbA8uhTqgqxLYV2DeA9LpG5hLSFPGlkKbGcsWlYa4YyqsbYtG9mg1knuzedm+kVWvPjUpN/WtypkypnaZKmUVnXh3jFgMxCOpWHLGX9QfptR331mte+pjS2n4Ot51EYvA2Bm0QxYoEZ8ZeV/W1UjkHw9L9PBH65NY/h1mL1s246/XHFsJT6eSnHTPFlILiT66cOVjJ+2T3LDidobQrDkamZi/+wwsugY5520lFrMUYvvtvyFEb\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The API is sending a\n  <code>\n   Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary\n  </code>\n  header with the response.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Are there other common formats to encode binary data that I may not be aware of or does anyone have an idea what kind of data this could be?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
