    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I created a program that performs DLL injection. It does that by opening the process with\n  <code>\n   OpenProcess\n  </code>\n  , writes the DLL path to the process and creates a remote thread with\n  <code>\n   CreateRemoteThread\n  </code>\n  with the dll as a parameter.(The DLL just spawns a messagebox). It works just fine but the problem is the second time i can't see the messagebox. The functions\n  <code>\n   OpenProcess\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   CreateRemoteThread\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   VirtualAllocEx\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   WriteProcessMemory\n  </code>\n  all return true but i can't see the thread being created and the DLL does not run.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

From\n  <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684175\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   the doc\n  </a>\n  (emphasis mine):\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   If the specified module is a DLL that is\n   <strong>\n    not already loaded\n   </strong>\n   for the\n  calling process, the system calls the DLL's DllMain function with the\n  DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH value. If DllMain returns TRUE, LoadLibrary returns\n  a handle to the module. If DllMain returns FALSE, the system unloads\n  the DLL from the process address space and LoadLibrary returns NULL.\n  It is not safe to call LoadLibrary from DllMain. For more information,\n  see the Remarks section in DllMain.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  So if you need to execute your code again you'll have to do it explicitly,\n  <code>\n   LoadLibrary\n  </code>\n  won't do it for you.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   EDIT:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  One possible solution could be to use the address of the function in your (already loaded) DLL instead of\n  <code>\n   LoadLibrary\n  </code>\n  as the address of the second dinjected thread.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
