Or can I untick a box in the Advanced Analysis Option at the beginning before the .exe File is decompiled ? I.e. I choose all the options, except Do not load bin information (-n) that will enable Cutter to Display the correct Assembly Instructions ? Or is there any plugin I could install to rectify this ? This issue occurs, in many parts, of the disassembled Code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any info and help would be much appreciated\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
