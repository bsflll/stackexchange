But ART is a private API and latest Android versions block the loading of\n  <code>\n   libart.so\n  </code>\n  , I can't use it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am using Xposed to instrument the target application at runtime.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

As you can see on the linked web site\n <code>\n  RegisterNatives\n </code>\n is not an exported method but a method that belongs to a struct. So you first have to find the struct then calculate the offset to the method pointer in the struct to get the final pointer you can hook.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
