I am following a tutorial for Windows Reverse Engineering and IDA is a pretty good software for this approach.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have just installed the last version of free IDA (7.6) on my Kali linux.\nA have an .exe and .pdb. The exe is correctly loaded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If I ask to load the pdb file, I have an error just after clicking on the button:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FXMmx.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FXMmx.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  And in the output console:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4lHge.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4lHge.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can someone help me please ?\n  \n\n  I have tested with \"root\" user, same problem. Apparently the plugin is integrated to IDA now so no download is available.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You'll need to have dbghelp.dll (part of the Windows SDKs and WinDbg redistributable packages) and it's unlikely that this exists on\n <i>\n  any\n </i>\n Linux (unless running IDA under Wine). I may be wrong about this, since MS has made some info available about the PDB format and so generally it's possible to make sense of it without dbghelp.dll, but I don't know if IDA has any home-brew implementation of this which would work natively on Linux.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Thank you :) I had to use IDA on a separate Windows machine (I like to separate analysis machine/ test subject hosting machine), because not fully working on Linux apparently. A shame that it was no warned before opening .exe file ... for beginners it could be a little bit frustrating (Any way: first Buffer Overflow exploit for me today :D).\n</span>\n</body></html>",
