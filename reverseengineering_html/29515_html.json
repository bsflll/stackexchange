    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'd like to debug a Firmware (ARM-based) which contains a lot of C-Strings. IDA Pro 7.2 seems to have problems detecting strings having special chars (above 7-Bit ASCII) in it. Here is one example of the Spanish word \"navegaci√≥n\", which has an diacritics \"o\" in it:\n </p>\n <pre><code>MAIN:0007AE4D                 DCB 0x4E ; N\nMAIN:0007AE4E                 DCB 0x61 ; a\nMAIN:0007AE4F                 DCB 0x76 ; v\nMAIN:0007AE50                 DCB 0x65 ; e\nMAIN:0007AE51                 DCB 0x67 ; g\nMAIN:0007AE52                 DCB 0x61 ; a\nMAIN:0007AE53                 DCB 0x63 ; c\nMAIN:0007AE54                 DCB 0x69 ; i\nMAIN:0007AE55                 DCB 0xF3\nMAIN:0007AE56                 DCB 0x6E ; n\nMAIN:0007AE57                 DCB    0\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  You see that 0xF3 is a valid ASCII char (ISO Latin-1), but IDA does not detect it as a valid char. If i now press \"a\" on the first letter (or let IDA doing a string detection), i would end up with this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>MAIN:0007AE4D aNavegaci       DCB \"Navegaci\"\nMAIN:0007AE55                 DCB 0xF3\nMAIN:0007AE56                 DCB 0x6E ; n\nMAIN:0007AE57                 DCB    0\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  It see's the char as if it where a string-termination char.\nHow can i get IDA to as least ignore such special chars and just rely on my setting to show strings in C-Style (0x00 terminated)?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

That configuration variable controls which characters are considered legitimate string characters when converting an address/array to a string.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Add your selected character in the format used and restart IDA.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The comment above the configuration variable is pretty straightforward, so following it shouldn't be an issue:\n </p>\n <pre><code>// the following characters are allowed in strings, i.e.\n// in order to find end of a string IDA looks for a character\n// which doesn't belong to this array:\n// Note about CURRENT_CULTURE:\n//  - if the IDB's default encoding for 1-byte/symbol strings, is not\n//    UTF-8, a \"culture\" will be derived from it. E.g., \"windows-1252\"\n//    will yield culture \"Latin_1\".\n//  - this cannot be done automatically for UTF-8, since UTF-8 covers\n//    the whole Unicode codepoints space.\n//  - regardless of whether a \"culture\" can be derived from the default\n//    encoding or not, this can be overridden by the CULTURE configuration\n//    property (see below)\n//  - the CURRENT_CULTURE directive tells IDA to consider all\n//    codepoints that are defined as part of that culture, as valid\n//    in the string literals.\n//  - this applies to codepoints >= 0x80\n//  - a \"culture\" refers to the name of a .clt file in the cfg/ directory.\n//    E.g., \"Latin_1\" will correspond to the \"Latin_1.clt\" file.\n//    In this case, the culture will contain all codepoints specified by\n//    the file.\n//    (It is worth pointing out that a culture file can, itself, include\n//    other culture file(s))\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  As well as the\n  <a href=\"https://hex-rays.com/products/ida/news/7_0/docs/strlits/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Official IDA documentation\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
