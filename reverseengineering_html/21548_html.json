If its smaller than the original\n <code>\n  pyc\n </code>\n you can replace the corresponding bytes in the exe.  However its a bit more work as pyinstaller stores the pyc, zlib compressed. You have to edit the pyinstxtractor script and comment out the statements which does the zlib decompression Line 239:\n <code>\n  if entry.cmprsFlag == 1:\n </code>\n . So original\n <code>\n  gui.pyc\n </code>\n get replaced with your modified pyc. Do note that both have pyc header removed and are zlib compressed.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

You should resolve all dependencies: or installing packages using pip, or pulling them from extracted PYZ archive folder. In the PYZ folder you can find all files, but you need to rename it and rearrange to modules.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Although your answer does seem to cover most of the question, I think it could quite benefit additional information and details, if you feel like doing that.
