It looks like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>typedef ReturnType (*certain_function)(void* this);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   ReturnType\n  </em>\n  is a class which I don't know.\nI need to pass the returned value of type\n  <em>\n   ReturnType\n  </em>\n  to another function.\n </p>\n <pre><code>typedef void (*another_function) (ReturnType);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  ReturnType neither is a primitive type nor a pointer, it's a class I don't got the definition for.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I don't need to work with the class, hence I dont really need to know what it looks like.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   My question is:\n  </strong>\n  Obviously, I've got to make my own defintion of\n  <em>\n   ReturnType\n  </em>\n  , like:\n </p>\n <pre><code>class ReturnType {\n    public:\n        uint8_t padding[?];\n};\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But how precise does it have to be? Can I just use a insanely large value for\n  <em>\n   ?\n  </em>\n  that definitly would offer enough memory for the class object, or does the size have to be exact? How is Return-by-Value/Call-by-Value done on ASM level? Complete object on the stack?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
