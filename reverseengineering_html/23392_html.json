IDA saves internally the original as well as the patched content.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Make your modifications using the sub menu commands of\n  <strong>\n   Edit -> Patch program\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  If your modifications are completed you can apply the modifications on an external file. To do so use menu\n  <strong>\n   Edit -> Patch program -> Apply patches to input file\n  </strong>\n  . \nIt allows you to select an external file and apply the changes you have made to it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
