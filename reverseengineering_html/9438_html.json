    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a DOS program that I'm trying to reverse engineer. It uses the Causeway Extender(also known as DOS4GW) in order to load the program into 32-bit protected mode, and IDA Pro 5.0 cannot extract this for me. I saw another post that was similar where a guy said he unpacked the exe, but there was no description as to how he did it. I'd provide the link, but ironically I can no longer find it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To clarify, I'm looking for an existing tool which I can use to 'unpack' this program for disassembly by IDA Pro or something. So far I've had no luck finding such a program.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
