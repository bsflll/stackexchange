If it does, then you can grab the entry point address and match the code at that address against your collection of startup routines from those libraries and pinpoint the main() location as you'd know which\n  <code>\n   call\n  </code>\n  is the one transferring control to\n  <code>\n   main()\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, the image might not be linked against any well-known C runtime, say, if it's a code piece that directly invokes kernel syscalls or if it managed to whip its own CRT library.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another good point would be if the program wasn't written in C at all and uses some other fancy language, but that seems to be outside the scope of the question as\n  <code>\n   main()\n  </code>\n  won't be relevant for those, I guess.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
