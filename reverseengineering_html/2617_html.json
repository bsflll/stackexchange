VMware allows you to use an ISO file directly for the dvd drive, you can do that by going in the hardware settings of your VM, selecting the CD/DVD drive and then selecting the ISO image. Your VM should then boot on the Livecd and you can now do your changes as you normally would.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
