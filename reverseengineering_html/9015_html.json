I'd like to know if it's worth my money, I didn't find feedback about the course on the web. Thank you.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For the people downvoting my post...why is that? Because of the tags? Using a tag is mandatory and I couldn't post with more appropriate tags like \"institute\" or \"company\" or something like that. The question is pertinent because it's about an institute that teaches reverse engineering. So I really don't get why the downvotes...don't you want to know how good a R$2000 reverse engineering course is before taking it??\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So you recommend taking the course despite its price and presentation/presenter? Or do you think although you learned a lot everything that was taught can be found on the web?(where then?). Thank you.</span>",
