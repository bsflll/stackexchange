Say, if it generated the following code for loading functions from an array of function names from\n  <code>\n   gpfnCommCtrlAPI\n  </code>\n  :\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Ym12u.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Ym12u.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was able to retype\n  <code>\n   gpfnCommCtrlAPI\n  </code>\n  into\n  <code>\n   char*[14]\n  </code>\n  which made it quite readable:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8wZw8.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8wZw8.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  But then is it possible to retype\n  <code>\n   g_pfnsUxCtrl\n  </code>\n  , a pointer to an array of function pointers, (possibly with a custom\n  <code>\n   enum\n  </code>\n  ) to make it a little bit more readable? Here's an example of how it looks now in case of\n  <code>\n   g_pfnsUxCtrl[7]\n  </code>\n  :\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RHmDT.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RHmDT.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  PS. To understand what index\n  <code>\n   7\n  </code>\n  refers to in that case I need to go back to the\n  <code>\n   gpfnCommCtrlAPI\n  </code>\n  array, which may not be immediately available where\n  <code>\n   g_pfnsUxCtrl[7]\n  </code>\n  is used.\n </p>\n <p>\n  PS2. In that case case, I manually renamed\n  <code>\n   p_comctl32_HandleScrollCmd\n  </code>\n  variable to make it more readable.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Then you'll have a single object with couple of variables and each of those will have a custom name. And if those addresses are constant which is kinda stupid but you can look where you land with that, you can try to set <code>p_comct132_HandleScrollCmd</code> to enumType and <code>g_pfnsUxCtrl</code> to pointer to enumType. Both solutions are silly, in your case I'd just memorize those integers</span>",
