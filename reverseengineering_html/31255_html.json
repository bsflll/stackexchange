    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm working on an IDA script in which I'd like to iterate through addresses that have been marked (with Alt-M).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Looking at the\n  <a href=\"https://hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idapython_docs/ida_moves.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   idapython documentation\n  </a>\n  , it looks like maybe I can do this via the\n  <code>\n   bookmark_t\n  </code>\n  proxy class and related functions, but it's not clear to me how to make this work.  For example:\n </p>\n <pre><code>def find_index(*args) â€‘> uint32\n    find_index(e, ud) -> uint32\n    e: lochist_entry_t const &\n    ud: void *\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   e\n  </code>\n  is obviously a lochist_entry_t, but I can't tell from the context what\n  <code>\n   ud\n  </code>\n  is supposed to represent, or how I would pass it as a void pointer to the call.  (For giggles, I tried to pass\n  <code>\n   None\n  </code>\n  in place of a NULL pointer, and it actually crashed ida.  Oops.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've searched the web for examples of using this api, but haven't found anything helpful.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is what I'm trying to do possible? If so, can someone please provide a working example, or a reference/doc/blogpost somewhere that I missed, or even just a nudge the right direction?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks in advance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Digging through more idapython documentation (in unrelated areas) leads me to believe that\n  <code>\n   ud\n  </code>\n  is user-defined context data, but it's not yet clear how to create this (since passing NULL/None seems to be a no-go) or pass it to the functions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit 2:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Further research has led me to trying to use\n  <code>\n   ctypes\n  </code>\n  to create pointers to various data types, but even when using\n  <code>\n   c_void_p\n  </code>\n  to create a void pointer, I'm still getting a\n  <code>\n   TypeError\n  </code>\n  for the\n  <code>\n   void*\n  </code>\n  argument.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I also found some mention of using SWIG's\n  <code>\n   cdata\n  </code>\n  and similar functions, which would seem to make sense, since it appears idapython uses SWIG.  However, I can't seem to figure out what/how to import to get access to that in python.   Looking at various docs leads me to believe that those functions would be exposed via the SWIG interface definitions, and a quick look through the idapython SWIG interface definitions and the IDA SDK doesn't reveal anything I can actually import to give me access to those SWIG functions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit 3:\n </p>\n <p>\n  I did manage to find\n  <code>\n   uchar_array(size_t)\n  </code>\n  which returns a character array pointer, so I tried to pass that to\n  <code>\n   bookmark_t_size(e, ud)\n  </code>\n  and again IDA crashed.  So at this point, I'm not sure what to try next.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Your mark limit is\n  <code>\n   MAX_MARK_SLOT\n  </code>\n  , so you can use this with those idc functions to iterate through all of the possible marks in the database.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
