I was able to recover computed jumps (by manual patching), however I am struggling to recover control flow graph. Is there any way to do that? I've already tried using HexRaysDeob IDA plugin, but it didn't help. Can you share your experience in this area? What are you usually doing for deobfuscation?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Most existing solutions were made for a specific target and may or may not work on yours, but understanding the basics should allow you to figure out how to do it in\n  <em>\n   your specific situation\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  A few links on the topic that may be useful:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://nerodesu017.github.io/posts/2023-12-01-antibots-part-8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Deobfuscating Geetest CAPTCHA: A Practical Guide to Control Flow Flattening\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://synthesis.to/2021/03/03/flattening_detection.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Automated Detection of Control-flow Flattening\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/deobfuscation-recovering-an-ollvm-protected-program.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Deobfuscation: recovering an OLLVM-protected program\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
