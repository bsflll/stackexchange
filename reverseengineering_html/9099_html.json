(It is wrong because only\n    <code>\n     edi\n    </code>\n    is used. Still, better safe than sorry.)\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <code>\n     mov eax,0cccccccch\n    </code>\n    moves the value 0CCCCCCCCh into register eax. Which is actually kind of self-explanatory.  That instruction in itself does nothing particularly useful, and you should be careful to ask such questions. It is clear from the\n    <em>\n     next lines\n    </em>\n    that the value gets stored into the Local Variable area, to fill it with a 'known' value, rather than having random values.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The value 0CCCCCCCCh is used as a\n    <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17644418/why-is-the-stack-filled-with-0xcccccccc\">\n     sentinel value\n    </a>\n    and so if the context is \"it gets stored somewhere\", then its purpose is to catch uninitialized pointers.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Again, time for an assembly refresher. The first highlighted line\n   </p>\n   <pre><code>add esp, 4\n</code></pre>\n   <p>\n    is not part of the following instructions, it's Stack Cleanup for the\n    <em>\n     previous\n    </em>\n    instruction: the\n    <code>\n     call\n    </code>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The lines\n    <code>\n     mov [ebp+var_E0], eax\n    </code>\n    and\n    <code>\n     cmp [ebp+var_E0], 0\n    </code>\n    have nothing to do at all with any kind of \"allocation\" or \"memory\"! All it does is save\n    <code>\n     eax\n    </code>\n    – the return value of the previous\n    <code>\n     call\n    </code>\n    – into a local variable, and then test if the value is 0. That is boilerplate generated code for\n   </p>\n   <pre><code>var_E0 = new (uint);\nif (var_E0 == 0)\n   ...\n</code></pre>\n   <p>\n    which is the only 'check' there is, and only\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    attempting to allocate, not before.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    'Blue node': the code in assembler does what the C++ code is supposed to do. It\n    <em>\n     allocated\n    </em>\n    space for a single integer before (the\n    <code>\n     push 4\n    </code>\n    in the call to\n    <code>\n     new\n    </code>\n    ) and in the blue node, it\n    <em>\n     stores\n    </em>\n    the value 255 into the newly allocated memory. If you expected it to allocate 255 bytes: well no. It does what the C++ code is supposed to do, which is explained in\n    <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13797926/what-does-new-int100-do\">\n     What does \"new int(100)\" do?\n    </a>\n    and the question of which it is marked a duplicate.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
