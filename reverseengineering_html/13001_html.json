    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I read in the IDA Pro Book that\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   you may use\n   <code>\n    till.exe\n   </code>\n   to parse header files and create standalone\n   <code>\n    .til\n   </code>\n   files which can be made globally available by copying them into\n   <code>\n    <IDADIR>/til\n   </code>\n   .\n  This is all well and good when you happen to have access to source code that you then allow IDA (or\n   <code>\n    till.exe\n   </code>\n   ) to parse.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Now I was wondering what would happen if the header file is from a library version older than the one used by the target binary (or vice versa). The closest I could find was\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/6099885/4480139\">\n   this\n  </a>\n  SO answer:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   If the ABI in the exported functions don't change you should be able\n  to get away with using an older DLL with a program linked against a\n  newer .lib, as long as the program isn't using a new export that are\n  in the new .lib but not in the older DLL.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Things which affect the ABI (I'm not claiming this is a comprehensive\n  list):\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    calling convention\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    export name\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    parameter list (including types)\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Does anyone have experience with using\n  <code>\n   .til\n  </code>\n  files although the version does not exactly match? In the best case, I guess, the\n  <code>\n   .til\n  </code>\n  file should work fine. But what could happen in the worst case, i.e. if any of the above mentioned three things change?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there any chance I can detect when the application of a slightly wrong\n  <code>\n   .til\n  </code>\n  file causes problems?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
