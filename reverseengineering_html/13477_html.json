    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have the following line of code in a game:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   movss xmm0,[eax+000000F0]\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  It basically loads the float speed of the current speed category into the XMM0 register. I already made a jump to an empty code section to get some more space, because I now want to multiply this speed by a hardcoded value of 2 after it was loaded. Sadly, easy-thinking like this doesn't work:\n </p>\n <pre><code>movss xmm0,[eax+000000F0]\nmulss xmm0,2\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I can't simply multiply an XMM register with an integer or float immediate. I read that I can only multiply with another XMM register. But then again I can't push and pop an existing XMM register to the stack to abuse it for that operation temporarily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How would I create such a simple multiplication operation?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The source operand can be an XMM register or a 32-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. The three high-order double-words of the destination operand remain unchanged.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  You could then just point to any offset you control, if code is not relocated. If it is, you could simply use 'lea' if in 64bit mode or do the\n  <code>\n   call $+5 / pop\n  </code>\n  trick in x86.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'll assume x86 because it makes it a bit more complicated. The patch should look something like the following (this wasn't tested):\n </p>\n <pre><code>    push edx\n    call next\nnext:\n    pop edx\n    movss xmm0,[eax+000000F0]\n    mulss xmm0,[edx+float-next]\n    pop edx\n    <return to previous location>\n\nfloat:\n    <float as 32bit data>\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  There might be better solutions, but nothing pops at me.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
