However, you can use\n  <a href=\"http://dynamorio.org/docs/page_drcov.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   DrCov\n  </a>\n  and do yourself the same thing as Minset does and even more powerful things. Indeed, I commonly use this DynamoRIO's tool, DrCov, for doing this exact same thing and others.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
