My\n <i>\n  personal\n </i>\n opinion is that, assuming NVidia failed to provide linux drivers (which they don't!), it would be legal in the EU to disassemble the windows drivers to the extend required to make them work with linux - but\n <i>\n  not\n </i>\n to create a new, independent set of drivers. But i'm not a lawyer either, so this personal opinion should not be taken as a fact.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

For example, you cannot publish a disassembly of a firmware. The thing is that I do not know if you can publish the API that you obtained by reversing the firmware... The API is somehow quite far from the original raw material... and publishing your code in open-source would be somehow the same as publishing the API... So, I do not know exactly where is the limit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I remember a few years ago, with others, we sent a letter to Apple asking them to support Ogg-Vorbis format on their iPod Nano. They received the letter but did not dare to answer. Then, we started to reverse the Nano without breaking the law.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another way to work-around the law against reverse-engineering in Europe is to be part of a laboratory. Then, you can do reverse for studying the software or the hardware that you are focusing on (beware, publishing is still tedious in this case also).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
