For example, is it a DWORD or some other multibyte buffer (maybe a memset/memcpy can give you a clue on its size here in these cases)?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Accurately accounting for these kinds of things is important when dealing with structures with many objects. It can help with your overall understanding of how it is used within the program, as well as further defining structure members\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, keep in mind you can name the fields as you normally would any other variable in IDA. To be thorough, you can also declare the field type in the structure tab, to do this, right-click the field, then select field type.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally, when declaring the size of a multibyte array within a structure for example, you can actually do so in hex by just pre-pending '0x' in the array size field. Doesn't seem like much but it's a small tip that can come in handy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is so much more to explore concerning structures and their use within IDA. If you are looking to learn more about this and IDA in general, then I would highly recommend Chris Eagle's IDA Pro Book.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://www.idabook.com/\">\n   http://www.idabook.com/\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
