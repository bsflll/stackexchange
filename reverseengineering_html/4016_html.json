    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  It is common to set a breakpoint on\n  <code>\n   oleaut32!DispCallFunc\n  </code>\n  to catch the function call to the ActiveX component and it worked for me until recently. I tried to reverse engineer a ActiveX component I got from some web file storage site and IE does not stop on\n  <code>\n   DispCallFunc\n  </code>\n  . Any other tricks to catch function call to ActiveX ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
