There is difference if you need software (for example V-USB) or it has hardware support. Unless your board has dedicated USB output (which usually also mean hardware support) you also need to make required connector to USB cable (watch for appropriate signal voltage level (3.3 V)). And no, USB port used for uploading your program to Arduino cant be used as it is usually only USB to serial converter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And now for software part. You need same VID and PID as your existing device so Windows (I assume you use them) can use correct driver and then you need to implement algorithm on your Arduino which depends on used USB implementation so look at examples available for your implementation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In case you find Arduino inadequate for your task you can look at other ARM MCU development boards (for example Nucleo). Which are faster and more powerful.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
