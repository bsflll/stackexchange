Or completely wrong? If yes, then what would your suggestions?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

(And <code>ana a</code> to AND with itself, but unfortunately for macro-fusion on Sandybridge-family which <i>can</i> macro-fuse <code>and</code> but not <code>or</code>, people settled on <code>ora</code> and kept using it when moving to 8086).  My answer on <a href=\"//stackoverflow.com/a/33724806\">Test whether a register is zero with CMP reg,0 vs OR reg,reg?</a> explains why it's inefficient and mentions history.
