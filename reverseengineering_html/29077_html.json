    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I read\n  <a href=\"https://utcc.utoronto.ca/%7Ecks/space/blog/programming/GoBinaryStructureNotes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   this page\n  </a>\n  in which the author, Chris Siebenmann, states that binaries created using\n  <code>\n   cgo\n  </code>\n  will not have the\n  <code>\n   gopclntab\n  </code>\n  or the\n  <code>\n   gosymtab\n  </code>\n  sections. However, I see that on\n  <code>\n   go version go1.13.15 linux/amd64\n  </code>\n  , I have built a Go program which links basic c code, using\n  <code>\n   cgo\n  </code>\n  , and I've confirmed with\n  <code>\n   radare2\n  </code>\n  that there is in fact a\n  <code>\n   .gopclntab\n  </code>\n  section in the resulting binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Has there been a change since this article (and the referenced\n  <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D13QhciikbdLtaI67U6Ble5d_1nsI4befEd6_k1z91U/view\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Building a Better Go Linker\n  </a>\n  article) was written? Or is there some other situation in which\n  <code>\n   cgo\n  </code>\n  may strip these sections? I ask because I have indeed seen other\n  <code>\n   cgo\n  </code>\n  output binaries that have these sections missing, but I have been unable to reproduce this using my version of the\n  <code>\n   cgo\n  </code>\n  toolchain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Aside from just knowing this fact, this information is relevant to reverse engineering go binaries because the\n  <code>\n   .gopclntab\n  </code>\n  <a href=\"https://rednaga.io/2016/09/21/reversing_go_binaries_like_a_pro/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   can be used to extract symbol information\n  </a>\n  . In the past, the absence of this table due to\n  <code>\n   cgo\n  </code>\n  compilation has made it more difficult to do so.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Not having this section has made it difficult to do so, and I have not found a clear answer in the docs. The question is being asked from a reversing perspective. Although, I do agree that it borderline could be a general Go question; but I've found that Go developer forums usually focus on the language itself, rather than the binary outputs of the compiler at such a low level.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Without it panic() couldn't print a stack trace. I suspect the author you are citing was mistaken about this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That being said, AFAIK gopclntab will not include symbols or unwind information for linked C libraries. This information is exclusively found in DWARF.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
