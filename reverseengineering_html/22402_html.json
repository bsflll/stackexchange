I will attach vulnserver.exe, select run in IB and execute a script to crash vulnserver to analyze the output. Detach & restart vulnserver.exe, then attach again and run the same script. I get two different results in the output.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, if I exit and restart Immunity Debugger between scripts, I get the correct output after running a script each time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is this standard behavior for Immunity Debugger? You have to exit and restart between each debugging capture?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have re-installed IB twice and it continues to give these inconstant results.\n </p>\n <p>\n  TIA\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

However, if I open and close the Immunity Debugger application, I will get the proper (expected) result. It is as if it is perhaps caching information between each attach & detach? As long as I shut Immunity Debugger down and start it again, it works fine. It is just a little annoying to have to restart it over and over.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
