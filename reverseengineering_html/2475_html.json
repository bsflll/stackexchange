Then I tried option 2, but i can only statically analyze the exe, Since dynamic analysis causes it to crash prematurely. Option 1 seems to be the most logical one, and this was the first I tried, but I can't really find an interesting starting point.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there anyone who can point me in the right direction. I have some reverse engineering experience from crackme's and applications, but this is my first attempt at reversing a driver.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Who knows, you might find functionality you were not aware of. The key part of reversing windows service is to realize that it runs within the context of the\n  <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms685150%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <strong>\n    Service Control Manager\n   </strong>\n  </a>\n  , and simply running the executable will not work. There are several major components of any windows service, that you need to be aware of. I have already given an answer to\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2235/how-does-services-exe-trigger-the-start-of-a-service/2237#2237\">\n   <strong>\n    How does services.exe trigger the start of a service?\n   </strong>\n  </a>\n  question. It describes inner workings of a windows service.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is very much possible to reverse a Windows service both dynamically and statically as long as you understand underlining concepts. If you run your service in context of command prompt, it will fail. Every Windows service by design has to call to Service Control Manager, if that call fails it means the service is not executed within the SCM. It is expected to fail being executed outside of the SCM. If services expects input, you will have to figure out what it needs. Firstly, you will need to locate Service Worker Thread. Thereafter, locating part of the way it communicates to control panel should be easy.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
