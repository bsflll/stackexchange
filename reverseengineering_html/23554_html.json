    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Background:\n  </strong>\n  I'm a beginner reverse engineer and I wanted to try writing my own c++ programs and reverse-engineering them. I wrote something and I'm not sure a smart way of reversing it. Usually, I can think of it as a math formula and just do it in reverse to figure out the algorithm but I can't think of any other way than brute-forcing for this scenario.\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main()\n{\n    char key[9];\n    int total = 0;\n\n    cout << \"Enter Key: \";\n\n    cin >> key;\n\n    for (char item : key)\n    {\n        total = total + (int)item;\n    }\n\n    if (total == 895)\n    {\n        puts(\"Correct\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        puts(\"Sorry buddy\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  btw sorry if my c++ isn't very good. I am new to this language haha\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Main Goal:\n  </strong>\n  I want to know if there is a smarter way of going about this or is brute force the only way. Thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
