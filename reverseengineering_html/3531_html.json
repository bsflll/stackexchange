After googling days by days for tools but didn't get any, I had my temporary solution that I write a tool as below:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    For load-time dynamic linking: Parsing the PE structure of this exe to export the dll names in the import directory then search them in %path% enviroment variable and the current directory of the exe. If the dlls exist, I copy them to the output.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    For run-time dynamic linking: Hooking the LoadLibrary functions to get the dll names then check the existence (similar as above).\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
