    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  An Android application I'm analyzing makes calls to a native library to generate a certain value. Here's an example of the native library function declaration from SMALI (Decompiled Java):\n </p>\n <pre><code>.method private native createAlgorithmSolver(II)J\n.end method\n\n.method private native solveAlgorithm(Ljava/lang/String;IJ)[I\n.end method\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This makes sense. createAlgorithmSolver accepts two ints, and returns a long. solveAlgorithm accepts a 32 character string such as \"SM1r0WeJH6qxdfNua2zg7t8ITwQUZYn5\", and it accepts an int, and a long, and returns an int array.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I decompile the actual \".so\" file with IDA Hex-rays decompiler, I get this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>createAlgorithmSolver(int a1, int a2, unsigned int a3, int a4)\nsolveAlgorithm(int a1, int a2, int a3, unsigned int a4, signed int a5)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  When I use \"Retargetable Decompiler\" (\n  <a href=\"https://retdec.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   https://retdec.com\n  </a>\n  ) with Python pseudo code, I get these function declarations:\n </p>\n <pre><code>def createAlgorithmSolver(a1, a2):\ndef solveAlgorithm(a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12, a13, a14, a15, a16, a17):\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  What's causing these weird discrepancies?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This is how JNI methods can make calls into the JVM, which is necessary to do anything nontrivial.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So that accounts for the first int argument of the functions you listed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, the functions are non-static, so they obviously take a hidden\n  <code>\n   this\n  </code>\n  parameter. That accounts for the second argument. After that comes the source level parameters of the methods. In the first case, it's just two ints. In the second case, it's a String object (i.e. a jstring pointer), an int, and a long.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, the decompiler isn't smart enough to guess what the actual types of the parameters are meant to be - it just sees how many values are passed in registers and on the stack. Therefore, all the pointers show up as ints and the long shows up as a pair of ints.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
