It is quite inefficient and do not scale at all when I try to analyze big binaries.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know that IDAPro is having a data-base to store comments and a memory zone, but, in case we do not want to use IDAPro, what techniques or (free) tools are you using to collect your notes and to display it properly ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
