    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Is it any way to connect VirtualKD 2.8 to VBox > 4.3.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I googled it but the nearest result was\n  <a href=\"http://www.virtualbox.org/svn/vbox/trunk/src/VBox/Devices/Misc/VirtualKD.cpp\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   VBOX_WITH_VIRTUALKD\n  </a>\n  config flag and some change logs about\n  <a href=\"https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog-4.3#4.3.16\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   stub/loader\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  OK, because of lack of information in my question, I try to explain my problem...\n </p>\n <p>\n  I start installing the VirtualKD from\n  <a href=\"http://virtualkd.sysprogs.org/tutorials/install/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Ref I\n  </a>\n  using VKD 2.8. exactly in step 2 it said\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Unable to cast COM object of type 'VirtualBox.VirtualBoxClass' ...\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  So I start googleing and i found a great article\n  <a href=\"http://www.virtualroadside.com/blog/index.php/2013/03/11/virtualkd-2-8-with-virtualbox-4-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Ref II\n  </a>\n  . I compiled the C# code and ran it in the VirtualKD-2.8 directory. the first problem is gone but the virtual box said:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Unable to load R3 \"C:\\VirtualKD-2.8\\VBoxKD64.dll\": Not signed ... (VERR_LDRVI_NOT_SIGNED)\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Again I start googleing... the problem is for\n  <code>\n   VBox > 3.1\n  </code>\n  , it force signed dll loading in windows. so I signed the DLL by a self generated sign ( and of curse I added it to my trust list ). now the virtualbox braks with\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Unable to load R3 module \"C:\\VirtualKD-2.8\\VBoxKD64.dll\" None of 1 path(s) hav a trust anchor.: ... (VERR_CR_X509_CPV_NO_TRUSTED_PATHS).\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  so I used a globally trusted sign to do the job but I got a FATAL error from vbox...\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Virtual Box will not load DLLs that are not owned by\n  <em>\n   NT SERVICE\\TrustedInstaller\n  </em>\n  so we have to add Virtual-KD directory to it's kingdom. ( read\n  <a href=\"https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff404240.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   this\n  </a>\n  if you have no ida about what I say )\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also it is a good description in the avast package named\n  <em>\n   Install.txt\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
