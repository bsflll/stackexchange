If i open this exe as archive (7zip) i can see only .rdata and others (\n  <a href=\"https://i.postimg.cc/FRXJc92D/image.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://i.postimg.cc/FRXJc92D/image.png\n  </a>\n  , in .rsrc only icons), tried to check with ida pro but i cant extract jar. I think there must be a jar file cuz it opens with java and in hex i saw MANIFEST, COM.CLIENT.LAUNCHER (java path). So can anyone help me with it? If requires i can upload file\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This is how it looks in a hex-editor:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oTkv8GOA.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\".jar file in hex-editor\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oTkv8GOA.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can open your .exe file in a hex-editor and then find text 'PK' using Ctrl+F. It is usually aligned by 16 or 8 bytes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After that, remove the contents of your .exe file that come before the 'PK' signature and you'll get your .jar file.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

But the zip/jar file is usually not contained in the exe structure itself instead it is just appended. Use a different zip client that can not interpret exe/dll files and thus opens the attached zip/jar file.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
