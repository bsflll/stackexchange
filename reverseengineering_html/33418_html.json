I was wondering if this object can provide me insights about the packet's source app (either PID or procname)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is it possible to extract this info from the object NEFilterPacketContext ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It has no API; all you can do is pass it around.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  and that\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Finding out what app it come from is going to be tricky. If you delay the packet (resulting in an\n   <code>\n    NEPacket\n   </code>\n   ) you may find useful info in the\nmetadata property. However, Iâ€™d advise against deferring every packet.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
