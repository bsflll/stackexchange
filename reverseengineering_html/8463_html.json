This will probably be more complicated if we are talking about some custom and sophisticated packers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I also strongly suggest to avoid various automatic unpacking plugins as they leaving you without the understanding of the process.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So in most cases unpackers (in terms of unpack process) will try to:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   validate their payload\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   allocate new memory to store the unpacked code (data). This will (in most cases) be done with the help of\n   <code>\n    VirtualAlloc(Ex)\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   unpack routing will take the obfuscated code and write the clean one to the allocated space\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   at the end of the process transfer control to the payload\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  What you should try to do:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   place the HW breakpoint on the\n   <code>\n    VirtualAlloc(Ex)\n   </code>\n   as there are packers which will check the preamble for the BP placements. Press\n   <code>\n    execute till ret\n   </code>\n   and at the\n   <code>\n    EAX\n   </code>\n   you will get the allocated memory area address\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   right click on the\n   <code>\n    EAX\n   </code>\n   to follow the address in\n   <code>\n    Dump\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   place the\n   <code>\n    Memory On Write\n   </code>\n   breakpoint or\n   <code>\n    HW on write\n   </code>\n   breakpoint which should get you to the actual unpack routine\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   analyze the flow of the unpack routing to place another breakpoint at the end of the unpack process\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   once the unpacking is done, right click on the\n   <code>\n    Dump\n   </code>\n   windows to save the unpacked payload to the file.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  In your case, the payload will probably will not be the clean\n  <code>\n   MZ\n  </code>\n  file or in contrary, the unpack routing intentionally had crippled the payload.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Probably this will be an iterative process as you also need to validate that the unpacked payload is actually the code. Try to use\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    Trace\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   in addition place\n   <code>\n    HW on Execute\n   </code>\n   at the beginning of the unpacked payload\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   dump unpacking routine / area and open it in IDA to understand (find) if there are any control transferring process near by.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Have Fun!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you are looking to learn how to manually unpack or if it is not a standard unpacker then you can proceed.  It does not look like it has finished unpacking.
