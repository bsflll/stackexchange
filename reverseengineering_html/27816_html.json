    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a strange error. I created for testing purposes a normal Console Application and run my own Tracer which is written with the help of Mono.Cecil on this application. I embedd a Stopwatch at the entry and exit of every method.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After I embedd it (the IL doesn't have any errors or warnings in it, when I inspect it with ILSpy) and try to run the Console Application it throws:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Unhandled Exception: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly   'System.Runtime\n.Extensions, Version=4.2.2.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its depende\nncies. The system cannot find the file specified.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Which is really strange, because Version = 4.2.2.0 doesn't even exists? Does anybody have a idea how this could be solved?\n </p>\n <p>\n  So when I try to give that Application any other Version of System.Runtime.Extensions this is thrown:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Unhandled Exception: System.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Runtime.Ext\nensions, Version=4.2.2.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencie\ns. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from\nHRESULT: 0x80131040)\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  I'm stuck and would be thankful for every help or idea to resolve this problem.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I have no idea why it would ask me for this kind of version. I could solve it a little bit with Mono.Cecil, by loading System.Runtime.Extensions and change the Version to '4.2.2.0'. But I think it is not a good idea to do it this way.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
