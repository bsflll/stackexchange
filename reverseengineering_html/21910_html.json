Even when there exist tools that can perform the job automatically for you, it's good to know what has to be done \"underneath\".\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Write and compile the code you want to add. You can do it later of course, but this way you will know how much space you need to add.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Having the knowledge obtained in\n   <code>\n    1.\n   </code>\n   , you can now interpret the output of\n   <code>\n    readelf -S executableToPatch\n   </code>\n   command. It will list the sections present in the executable along with the information such as their offset in the file.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   If you are lucky, the offset of the section you want to update + its basic size + size of the code you want to add is less than the offset of the next section. In such a case, you simply want to create a file containing the new content of this section (that is, entire content before your modification and the extra code appended by you). Then you can simply run:\n   <code>\n    objcopy --update-section .text=fileWithTheNewContent nameOfExe nameOfExePatched\n   </code>\n   and you are done.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   If you are not so lucky, you can still run the command from the previous point, but you will get messages similar to this:\n   <code>\n    objcopy: nameOfExe: section .text offset adjusted to newOffset\n   </code>\n   , which simply means that\n   <code>\n    objcopy\n   </code>\n   has moved some subsequent sections forward in such a way that they don't overlap with each other (which, from\n   <code>\n    1.\n   </code>\n   , is one of the requirements of the ELF specification). However, contrary to the previous point, you cannot simply finish here, because it could be the case that some section with data has changed its offset as well.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Check which sections have been relocated. If none of them contains data, you can now test the program whether it behaves the same as before your modification. If it does, your job is done - your code has been successfully updated.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   If it behaves differently or some of your sections with data has changed its offset, it is necessary to fix the data references to this section, that is to patch the code, so that it references offsets in the new data section location. For example, when\n   <code>\n    .rodata\n   </code>\n   has been moved forward by\n   <code>\n    4096\n   </code>\n   bytes, you will have to change all references to\n   <code>\n    .rodata\n   </code>\n   by adding\n   <code>\n    4096\n   </code>\n   to each address, i.e. if you have\n   <code>\n    mov rax, [rip+0x20]\n   </code>\n   you want to change it to\n   <code>\n    mov rax, [rip+0x1020]\n   </code>\n   , but it isn't straightforward to do, although it's still possible.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In comparison with the methods they developed, as well as with more modern techniques, taking the\n  <code>\n   objcopy\n  </code>\n  route seems rather crude. There is no need to re-invent the wheel.\n </p>\n <p>\n  More modern approaches to manipulating ELF binary runtime behavior have emerged since then, including a variety of injection techniques and instrumentation frameworks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For the purposes of this question we can divide approaches to modifying binary functionality into 2 approaches:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   adding code to the file itself (static modification, occurs prior to program runtime)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   inducing new behavior via injection (runtime modification).\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <h2>\n  Static Modification Techniques\n </h2>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Text Segment Padding Infection\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The classic ELF\n  <code>\n   text\n  </code>\n  <em>\n   segment\n  </em>\n  (not section) padding infection method seems to be the most closely related to what you are currently attempting.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Page padding at segment borders however provides a practical location for\n  parasite code given that its size is able.  This space will not interfere with\n  the original segments, requiring no relocation.

If we save the state of the GOT before replacing, we can call the old library routine and thus redirect any library call.\n   <sup>\n    2\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  The easiest way to implement this method seems to be using the LIEF instrumentation framework.
