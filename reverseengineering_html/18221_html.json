On the left we have memory addresses.Since i am using a 64 bit machine ,shouldn't ever memory address have 64 bits?but in the picture every memory location has 32 bits . Also the stack starts at 0x28fed0 and the second address is 0x28fee0 ,where are the address between these.I mean where is 0x28fed1?\nI studied architecture many years ago and i seem to be missing something basic.\nCan any one help me out?\n </p>\n <p>\n  thanks\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

To see individual bytes, use\n  <code>\n   b\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  As for addressing, each 32-bit item occupies four 8-bit bytes, so a row of four of them adds up to\n  <code>\n   4*4=16\n  </code>\n  , or\n  <code>\n   0x10\n  </code>\n  bytes, that's why the next line starts at\n  <code>\n   0x28fee0\n  </code>\n  . The byte at address\n  <code>\n   0x28fed1\n  </code>\n  is present inside the 32-bit word at 0x28fed0. Try dumping memory in different formats to get the feel for the data layout.
