Tracing methods is quite easy - it would be difficult if we would like to trace fields usages. .NET assemblies contain rich type/method information that can be used to inspect/modify them. There's also a great library that does that plus more -\n  <a href=\"https://www.mono-project.com/docs/tools+libraries/libraries/Mono.Cecil/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   Mono.Cecil\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  With the help if this library we can achieve what you want (\n  <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/pawlos/4758365fdef3bcbf733ba73e636fcfb7\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   gist\n  </a>\n  ).\n </p>\n <pre><code>using System;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing Mono.Cecil;\nusing Mono.Cecil.Cil;\n\nclass TraceIL\n{\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        if (args.Length != 1)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"TraceIL.exe <assembly>\");\n            return;\n        }\n\n        string fileName = args[0];\n        ModuleDefinition module = ModuleDefinition.ReadModule(fileName);\n        MethodReference consoleWriteLine =\n            module.ImportReference(typeof(Console).GetMethod(\"WriteLine\", new Type[] {typeof(object)}));\n        foreach (TypeDefinition type in module.Types)\n        {\n            foreach (var methodDefinition in type.Methods)\n            {\n                var ilBody = methodDefinition.Body;\n                var ilProcessor = ilBody.GetILProcessor();\n\n                var firstOp = methodDefinition.Body.Instructions.First();\n                var ldstrEntering = Instruction.Create(OpCodes.Ldstr, $\"--Entering {methodDefinition.Name}\");\n                ilProcessor.InsertBefore(firstOp, ldstrEntering);\n                var call = Instruction.Create(OpCodes.Call, consoleWriteLine);\n                ilProcessor.InsertBefore(firstOp, call);\n                var ldstrLeaving = Instruction.Create(OpCodes.Ldstr, $\"--Leaving {methodDefinition.Name}\");\n                var lastOp = methodDefinition.Body.Instructions.Last();\n                ilProcessor.InsertBefore(lastOp, ldstrLeaving);\n                ilProcessor.InsertBefore(lastOp, call);\n            }\n        }\n        module.Write(Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(fileName)+\".modified\"+Path.GetExtension(fileName));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Just to explain a little bit what's going on. For every method on every type we find in the assembly, we get the\n  <code>\n   ILProcessor\n  </code>\n  that allows us to modify the code. Having that we just insert a string and a call to\n  <code>\n   Console.WriteLine\n  </code>\n  just before the first existing opcode, and similar code just before the end of the method. At the very end we save the new binary under the same name with\n  <code>\n   .modified\n  </code>\n  added.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The example run:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   λ TestApp.exe\n   \n\n   Inside Run\n   \n\n   Inside Inside\n   \n\n   MoreInside\n   \n\n   OtherProgramRun\n   \n\n   \n\n   λ TraceIL.exe TestApp.exe\n   \n\n   \n\n   λ TestApp.modified.exe\n   \n\n   --Entering Main\n   \n\n   --Entering .ctor\n   \n\n   --Leaving .ctor\n   \n\n   --Entering Run\n   \n\n   Inside Run\n   \n\n   --Entering Inside\n   \n\n   Inside Inside\n   \n\n   --Entering MoreInside\n   \n\n   MoreInside\n   \n\n   --Entering .ctor\n   \n\n   --Leaving .ctor\n   \n\n   --Entering OtherProgramRun\n   \n\n   OtherProgramRun\n   \n\n   --Leaving OtherProgramRun\n   \n\n   --Leaving MoreInside\n   \n\n   --Leaving Inside\n   \n\n   --Leaving Run\n   \n\n   --Leaving Main\n   \n\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Of course form there you can do some crazy stuff, like adding timestamp and/or list passed arguments, etc. Since your sample is obfuscated it might not work form the start, but I guess this code is not that difficult to be modified as needed.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Static analysis of dotnet binaries can be done easily by using de4dot and then using ILSpy to create a visual studio project, then you can analyze the source code in visual studio. You can also use dnSpy which allows you to debug the binary easily.\n </p>\n <p>\n  About the instrumentation, a dotnet binary still runs native code at runtime, with all the normal Win32 libraries. You can use Api Monitor (\n  <a href=\"http://www.rohitab.com/downloads\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   http://www.rohitab.com/downloads\n  </a>\n  ) to monitor os api calls at runtime, it's an awesome tool that works by hooking libraries and decoding parameters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Moreover you can use procmon to display simple information like file system operations, registry, etc..\n </p>\n <p>\n  Good luck\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
