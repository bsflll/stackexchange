That's where usually the human in front of the screen is called for, to help out (the \"interactive\" part in IDA stems from that, IIRC). While this isn't IDA, the fundamental principles apply all the same.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

My guess would be that it happens because COM files have no defined structure or headers with magic values unlike other executable formats such as ELF, PE, or DOS MZ EXE, so it falls back to raw data bytes display.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
