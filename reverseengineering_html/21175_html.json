One check would be that if the zip isn't much smaller than the contained image that indicates a high level of entropy compared to executable code meaning the image is probably compressed and/or encrypted.   Your best bet may to be physically open the product to see what sort of processor it uses, and see if there is a flash chip perhaps containing the executable version of the firmware in a more direct form.   But runtime decompression or decryption by a boot ROM or even hardware is possible....\n</span>\n</body></html>",
