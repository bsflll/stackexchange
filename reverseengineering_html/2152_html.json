I managed to install\n  <code>\n   tinycc\n  </code>\n  with the small modification of the\n  <code>\n   Makefile\n  </code>\n  and the installation script did not complain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But, once I tried to use the script\n  <code>\n   miasm/example/disas_and_graph.py\n  </code>\n  , the CFG stop suddenly shortly after the entrypoint.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Strangely, I installed Miasm on a 32bits virtual machine and it worked fine and displayed the whole CFG properly. So, did I miss something about a restriction or a bug on amd64 architecture ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

What is really misleading, is that the elf-64 is handled but the disassembler fail to recognize the amd64 opcodes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, this behavior is \"normal\" even if no error message is issued.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The good news, is that the main contributor of miasm is working on a second version of the software (\n  <code>\n   miasm2\n  </code>\n  ) which is handling amd64 (and with a lot of new features).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
