Later, I went through and marked some sections as undefined, or code, etc.  Now IDA can't re-create a section as a function. It complains about\n </p>\n <pre><code>The function has undefined instruction/data at the specified address.\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I think this is because it has remembered where I've marked thing as undefined or data or code.  And those marks are confusing the auto analyzer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If there are many such places, you can also try a mass selection and\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/blog/igor-tip-of-the-week-04-more-selection/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   force everything in a range to code\n  </a>\n  (though this may backfire if code is obfuscated).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
