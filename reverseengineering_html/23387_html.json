Do you have prints in the hkItemPos() or anything to verify?   Does the offset value make sense for the binary? That looks like a very very common search string I would guess you're hooking something else and when that gets called you crash\n</span>\n</body></html>",

I have cut the search string so that the code was not very extensive. But definitely yes, it hooks to the right function.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
