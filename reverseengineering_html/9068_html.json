Can you tell us the compiler and it's parameters you used? Will the SHL instruction be present if you recompile this code with\n <code>\n  arr\n </code>\n beeing a byte array? You could also attach a dynamic debugger (Ollydbg) and see what is happening exactly by stepping trough your code.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

This is the start of your array. As an integer has 4 bytes on your machine, counter gets multiplied by 4, which is the same as left shifting it by 2 - but the left shift is faster on many processors, which is why it's chosen over the multiply.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

A statement that possibly needs reminding you that not any value here is in \"bits\" â€“ but maybe you confused it with <i>bytes</i>. Still: how did you come to the conclusion that there is <i>any</i> additional space left between <code>0x10</code> and <code>0xD8</code>? That space is <b>exactly</b> the amount needed for the 50 integers that your original code says there should be, nothing more and nothing less.</span>",
