It could be a false positive, but I didn't run it yet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So far I've tried to open it with IDA, Radare2, and Ghidra, but all of them have problems when trying to parse the file:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   IDA - \"the processor type 'cli' is not included...\",\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Radare - \"[w] Cannot open 'dbg://../a.exe' for writing.\", and\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Ghidra can't properly decompile it.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I will look into those to see if I am missing something, and also tomorrow I'll try to run it inside a VM. Am I doing something wrong? Are there any other approaches that I'm missing or some way to analyze malware?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
