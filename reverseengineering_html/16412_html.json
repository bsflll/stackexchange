So in the binary, all calls to this subroutine should point to this address. Thus, it should be possible to list all calls to this address, am I wrong ? It seems to be a simple things to look for, yet I cannot find anything about that elsewhere.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

We can simplify it by relate to it as XREF-To and XREF-From. The referenced can be either Data or Code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  XREFs are a valuable resource when we want to figure out exactly where a function was called from or what functions the current function calls. This, as you understand, can be quite useful, so we donâ€™t have to iterate the stack for frame pointers to look for the function that called the current function or alternatively searching by hand for a\n  <em>\n   CALL\n  </em>\n  s to specific addresses.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Hopper\n </h2>\n <p>\n  In hopper disassembler you can can see XREFs-To addresses by pressing\n  <kbd>\n   X\n  </kbd>\n  while you mark the desired address. XREFs-From can be shown using\n  <kbd>\n   Alt\n  </kbd>\n  +\n  <kbd>\n   X\n  </kbd>\n  . Alternatively you can find the Cross References lists under\n  <code>\n   Navigate\n  </code>\n  in the Hopper's top toolbar.\nYou can also find the references to and from an adress by pressing Right Click on it and then choosing either \"References to...\" or \"References from...\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Ys1Sj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Ys1Sj.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Neverthless, when a program is analyzed, Hopper is adding a list of\n  <em>\n   XREFs-From\n  </em>\n  in the comments:\n </p>\n <pre><code>  j_puts:\n08048390   jmp   dword [puts@GOT]   ; puts@GOT,puts, CODE XREF=sub_8048662+15, sub_8048662+31, sub_8048662+86, sub_8048662+104\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
