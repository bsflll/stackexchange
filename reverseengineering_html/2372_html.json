    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I recently stumbled on a\n  <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1ep2ur/reverse_engineering_a_mass_transit_ticketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   talk\n  </a>\n  from Ruxcon 2012 explaining the reverse of a mass transit ticketing system.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Basically, they focused on paper tickets reverse engineering with a skimmer and a lot of brain activity. This seems to be quite amusing and interesting. But, nowadays a big part of the ticketing system is also using NFC (Near Field Communication) or RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) especially for people who are subscribing for a month or more.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I found a few websites (like\n  <a href=\"http://users.skynet.be/marc.sel/index-MTC.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   this one\n  </a>\n  or\n  <a href=\"http://wiki.yobi.be/wiki/MOBIB\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   this one\n  </a>\n  ), trying to gather knowledge about how all this ticketing system works. But, nothing really global and fully furnished (from the paper ticket system up to the NFC/RFID system).\nI would like to know how to set up such a lab.\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   What hardware is required (skimmer, NFC/RFID/Smartcard reader, the needed computing power to gather, ...) ?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   What is, approximately, the cost, in time for setting such a lab (and getting the necessary material to work on) ?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   How to proceed once the lab has been set-up and the material gathered ?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Is there some tricks that can lower the cost/time that you spend on it ?\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
