But AFAIK not too important. IDA will create different segment for different code parts based on this input, but will handle fine which ever values are entered.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Is the ROM section my OCRAM, 0x00000000 - 0x00007FFF?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Yes, this is again correct but again AFAIK it's not too important.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   What about Input file loading address, file offset, loading size?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  for low-level code executed, and especially for boot loaders, the loading address should be specified in the chip's datasheet.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Would the loading size be the 16MB of my SDRAM?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Yep. IDA will add the RAM address space as an additional segment for you.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Where does the peripherals addresses go?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  IDA doesn't explicitly support peripherals, you'll need to include those in your RAM definition or create a different segment manually after the file is loaded. You'll need to manually specify what peripheral is exposed at each address either by adding different segments for different peripherals or by creating and naming variables/structures.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
