My DummyApp has only one imported dll which is user32.dll and it can be resolved by my loader, because kernel32.dll and user32.dll have the same address for all running process. I have no idea why this problem occurs. It perfectly works on Windows10 (no mater if DummyApp or InjectTarget are 32 or 64, still works). I tried to run InjectTarget under the debugger, and when the error occures I'm getting the error code which is 0x05 which means Access Denied. But why? Why I'm getting access denied?</span>",

Compilers use this feature to produce position-independent code which does nit need to be relocated. On x86, emulating this kind if addressing is expensive, so your compiler instead emits \"use the string constant at 1001230 (to be relocated)\".</span>",
