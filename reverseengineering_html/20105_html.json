    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am trying to get to know how Nextbike's API works. It's not a public API but capturing the outgoing traffic with my phone I can see all the traffic and endpoints that are being contacted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've stumbled upon a problem where the app calls the API and it uses an API key. That key hasn't been shared before and I don't know how it's calculated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Even before attempting to log-in the phone makes some requests with the key. They key is of the form\n  <code>\n   TR6EHaaNTSFGFmMt\n  </code>\n  , with 16 characters. My problem comes here, is it randomly generated? Is it a hash of the IMEI/MAC Address? Is it possible to reverse it or know more or less how it's created? How can I know which hash function has been used?\n </p>\n <p>\n  My knowledge on cryptographic functions is still a bit limited.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
