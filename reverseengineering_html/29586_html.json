The only answer suggests to use graph-easy for Linux. I'm on Windows. How to convert the graph to an image on Windows 10?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I googled how to convert gdl to image, too, and there's some ArchiCAD software for $3000 or something, and it looks like it's some big program for modeling or whatever. Then there's this online tool which doesn't work:\n  <a href=\"https://fileproinfo.com/tools/viewer/gdl\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://fileproinfo.com/tools/viewer/gdl\n  </a>\n  . Says the preview doesn't work. There's also: Stanford Microarray Database GDL Data . Their site is dead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Please help.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
