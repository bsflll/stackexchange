I've looked everywhere and couldn't find anything similar for x64dbg. It's very useful when you want to view or modify memory of the process which employs anti-debug measures.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

But I'm asking if there is a plugin or functionality in x64dbg to do this without attaching the debugger. It seems to me that the only way to open a process in x64dbg is to attach the debugger.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

You're talking about using a tool that is exclusively a debugger but without any debugging. Cheat Engine is fine if you simply want to view / edit memory. There are many memory manager tools, why so insistent on x64dbg when it doesn't seem to be the right tool for your job?\n</span>\n</body></html>",
