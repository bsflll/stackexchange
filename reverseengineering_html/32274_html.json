As in earlier posts I said:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Excuse me, I am just liking to use the SkiFree source code for my very own purpose. The purpose is basically adding my own enemies and stuff to it (with it's own functions) rather than replacing the sprites for already existing stuff and characters using software such as decompilers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have made concept art for my own game. Here it is below:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Fn7wh.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Fn7wh.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8LiDP.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8LiDP.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  [![enter image description here][3]][3]\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9LY0f.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9LY0f.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  [enter image description here][5]\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TmZzl.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TmZzl.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yjhFf.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yjhFf.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I started this project in 2020. It is only after reading this on the official SkiFree site.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In 1993 I started working on Version 2 of SkiFree, which would have slightly more realistic physics, multi-player, network play, robot opponents, and sounds. I got about half of those things done (split screen/keyboard multiplayer, very crude robots, and sound), but managed to get the physics completely screwed up to the point where it was no longer playable. At about the same time I also lost the original source code and got distracted by other projects, so SkiFree sort of went into permanent stasis at version 1.0 - Chris Pirih\n </p>\n <p>\n  As you can see, I felt upset about the developer so I am willing not to remake his project but only to add new additions (including a status bar below and a menu above) as seen in the concept art.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am happy to thank the creator of\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/yuv422/skifree_decomp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   skifree_decomp\n  </a>\n  for having my three year wish to come true.\n </p>\n <p>\n  *Note - Now there is a problem... I downloaded Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Standard from WinWorld and installed it. I fixed some code errors and when I was building the executable, this happened. Now what can I do? How can I follow those instructions.\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Convert functions to C\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Convert data to C\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Make sure all functions exactly match with the original binary\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Make sure data segments match the original exactly\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  *Update - I tried it again and it works, ok!\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Togos.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Errors\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Togos.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
