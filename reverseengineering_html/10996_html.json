It is used in at least ZyXEL P-724 firmware images. Running\n  <code>\n   file\n  </code>\n  doesn't show anything.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Comparing the files I have, I found there seems to be a fixed-size header of around 20 bytes (checked with two files drastically different in both size and contents -- namely,\n  <code>\n   HTPCode\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   RasCode\n  </code>\n  ). Poking around\n  <code>\n   BootExt\n  </code>\n  I can see decompression-related string, but nothing that would give away the exact algorithm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The suspected header bytes are (bytes that differ marked out):\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   08 00 xx xx 71 A8 1A xx 17 2A 7C 60 xx C2 02 0C 20 83 10 00\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  A sample containing the original image, extracted ROM object, and the compressed data itself:\n  <a href=\"https://yadi.sk/d/lBRqhldYjRMPf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   https://yadi.sk/d/lBRqhldYjRMPf\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
