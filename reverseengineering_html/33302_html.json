But after few days it didnt show any trial option. I tried in another emulator it worked again for few days. Somehow it can recognize emulators. It doesnt work even you create new profiles in emulator and change android model,imei etc. I also tried magisk and android faker, but it didnt work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So is there any way to bypass this app tracking system?\n </p>\n <p>\n  How is it tracking?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
