    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm newbie on virtualized code obfuscation. I can break many features to avoid debugging/reversing and packer/protector (even Themida, without vm option), but I'm not good at virtualized code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Though I made own code virtualizing obfuscation tool, It's too hard to break other virtualized code framework.(e.g: Themida, VMProtect, Code Virtualizer)\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, I decided to break easy target to get an insight that makes me be good at virtual cpu framework. but I can't find any good target for newbie. Could you recommend easy target(crackme or protector) for newbie?\n </p>\n <p>\n  If possible, I want target of which virtualized-code was translated from x86 assembly code.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
