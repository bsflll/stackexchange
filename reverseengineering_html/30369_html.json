    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  So, there is a PLC and a SoftMaster program to work with it. The PLC works according to the XGFenet protocol.\nWhen connecting to the PLC for the first time in SoftMaster, a password must be entered. And I caught this whole process using Wireshark.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the very beginning, we send a message like this to the PLC:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/m92Ir.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/m92Ir.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  where 41 44 is a request for a specific session key.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With the next package we get:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/cH9fl.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/cH9fl.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The PLC sent us a set of bytes. It is these bytes that are causing this question. More details further.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We enter the password\n  <em>\n   qwerty\n  </em>\n  and it will be converted to\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VkCDK.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VkCDK.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Obviously, the bytes sent in the second packet encrypted our password in this form.\nAnd after that we get\n  <em>\n   correct password\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/M4uDC.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/M4uDC.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Question: how did the bytes sent in the second packet encrypt our password to this form?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I experimented and wrote a script to request this session key multiple times. All the bytes sent differed by about 1000 units, respectively, something like a time or a countdown is sent to us and the password is encrypted based on it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you do not know the answer, advise what other experiments can be done to understand what it is or in what direction to study. Thank you.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   UPD\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The password length is limited by SoftMaster and you cannot enter more than 8 characters. But, even if the password consists of one character, the encrypted password does not differ in length from eight characters. Similar to hashing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here are some examples:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Password\n  <em>\n   A\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/T4f5e.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/T4f5e.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Password\n  <em>\n   AA\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n8kCO.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n8kCO.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Password\n  <em>\n   AAA\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/A0i3F.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/A0i3F.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  And here is the same password\n  <em>\n   qwerty\n  </em>\n  entered with a difference of a couple of seconds\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KIb0t.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KIb0t.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DXQUr.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DXQUr.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  But there is nothing strange here. Before each entry, a new session key is requested and these two identical passwords are encrypted with different keys.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Using ProcessMonitor, I checked the services that are called during password entry and validation. Maybe there's a hint here\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FC7cU.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FC7cU.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
