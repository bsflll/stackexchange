    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  My goal is to see what's going on \"under the hood\" in the Windows command prompt when a user pastes text into it. So I loaded\n  <code>\n   cmd.exe\n  </code>\n  into IDA Pro that is set up in conjunction with the WinDbg debugger.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My initial guess was to put a breakpoint on\n  <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms649048(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   OpenClipboard\n  </a>\n  API which must be used to access clipboard, but it seems like cmd.exe doesn't even have a dependency on\n  <code>\n   User32.dll\n  </code>\n  (where OpenClipboard comes from):\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hPeWB.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hPeWB.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So am I reading it correctly?\n </p>\n <p>\n  PS. I'm doing this on Windows 10.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   EDIT:\n  </strong>\n  You know, there's something other than deferred loading. I let the\n  <code>\n   cmd.exe\n  </code>\n  initialize and begin running, after which I suspended it. The loaded modules list still didn't have\n  <code>\n   user32.dll\n  </code>\n  :\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fbkl5.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fbkl5.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  and my deferred breakpoint didn't trigger upon clipboard operation either:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/d609W.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/d609W.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Could there be some other process that does all the \"command line\" logic?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   EDIT 2:\n  </strong>\n  Just tried to attach to a running\n  <code>\n   conhost.exe\n  </code>\n  :\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3UEJS.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3UEJS.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  while IDA Pro was running as administrator and got this error:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Hwolt.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Hwolt.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   EDIT 3:\n  </strong>\n  Just tried to attach to\n  <code>\n   conhost.exe\n  </code>\n  via just WinDbg itself and got this error. I'm not sure how\n  <code>\n   NTSTATUS 0xC00000BB\n  </code>\n  applies here:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TEIKb.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TEIKb.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It turns out that IDA Pro cannot attach to a 64-bit process so it was using a 32-bit version of WinDbg implicitly. Thus I was getting that strange error. I also discovered that I was using an old version of WinDbg. And lastly, even though I was originally starting a 32-bit version of <code>cmd.exe</code> it was implicitly connecting to a 64-bit version of <code>conhost.exe</code>. So eventually I had to ditch IDA and go with bare WinDbg which is somewhat hard to use... but it did the job. So thank you!</span>",
