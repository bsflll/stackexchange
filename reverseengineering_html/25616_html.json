It appears that they are ignored if symbols aren't loaded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have found it weird how GDB behaves when there are no symbols at all loaded and if I want to debug something I am having to set a break point at\n  <strong>\n   __libc_start_main@plt\n  </strong>\n  and\n  <strong>\n   nexti\n  </strong>\n  until I reach a the main binary.  I also noticed that I cannot disassemble there in the main binary either (I receive this odd message \"\n  <em>\n   No function contains program counter for selected frame.\n  </em>\n  \"), but that aside it break points are essentially ignored. I have found an odd work around and that is setting\n </p>\n <pre><code>set *0x56555878 = 0xcc \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  My questions are:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Why does GDB behave so weirdly without symbols?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Why do normal for breakpoints fail to be recognized?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Is setting my desired breakpoints to 0xcc and then resting; Is this a good practice?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Is there a better way to set breakpoints?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Why can I not disassemble without Why can I not disassemble without symbols?\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Edit: It looks like I cannot set *breakpoints in glibc but I can when I land in int main() program , But while in the int main() , I lose ability to disassemble.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
