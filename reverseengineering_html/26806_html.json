I think I need to import all of the raw files into the same program tree. I've tried using\n  <code>\n   analyzeHeadless\n  </code>\n  to import all of the shared libraries into the project, but I don't see way to place them into an existing program using that tool (it instead creates a new program for each file). Let me know if I'm doing something wrong.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you have already imported the program you can still fix this with ELF files as described in\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues/396\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   this issue\n  </a>\n  but for some reason there is no premade script for PE files, i.e.\n  <code>\n   .dll\n  </code>\n  s. There might still be a way to do this manually though, the idea is just to also have imported the relevant DLL file so you can link it to a program that requires it as an external library. The relevant functions will then be properly linked.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
