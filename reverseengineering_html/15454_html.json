For that you would use functions like\n  <code>\n   PatchByte\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  EDIT:\n </p>\n <p>\n  I think i know what you want to do: You want to rename the subs in the struct. Not the struct membernames themselves.\n </p>\n <pre><code>MakeName(Dword(ofs))\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
