Basically here's what I want to know.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This might sound a bit silly but, if you have a disassembled instruction say:\n </p>\n <pre><code>jz 0x8048e1a\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and you also have the source code, how do you go about figuring out what this instruction relates to in the source code?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I should probably mention that I am using Intel's PIN as the application that spits out these disassembled instructions, so I know which function/routine these instructions belong to, I just want to be a bit more precise.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks for any help/hints.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The compiler is\n  <em>\n   already\n  </em>\n  producing a mapping between the original source code and the assembly instructions; that's what debugging information\n  <em>\n   is\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The easiest way to see it in action is to start the program in the debugger, set a breakpoint, and when that breakpoint hits, switch to the disassembly view. That'll show you the instructions, as well as the source lines which led to them. (If the compiler had optimizations enabled there won't always be a good correspondence between the two, but you can at least see the rudiments.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can also tell your compiler to stop after the code generation phase, and output an assembly file instead of object code. Depending on the compiler, you may also be able to get it to annotate the assembly with the source lines; this'll produce similar information to what you can see in the debugger's disassembly view.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The details of how you do all that depend entirely on your IDE. Read its documentation.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
