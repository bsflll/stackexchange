This can only be accomplished by reversing the executable file.  There are no hints when the file is run.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I came across these two random jump instructions which appear to be inserted out of the flow of the program.  What is the reason for their existence?  Is this a byproduct of an unoptimized compilation?  If they're there on purpose then which instruction points to these?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LlIS9.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Mysterious entry points\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LlIS9.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QRTOk.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Entire Function + To/From locations\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QRTOk.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Appreciate any help!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Looking at the \"flat\" view it appears that they are not called from anywhere.  Could these jumps be sites of malicious code injections if someone had bad intentions?  It seems that if they are connected to a proper flow the injected code would go unnoticed at first glance.  If I should open another thread for this question I can do that too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CAidQ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Flat View\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CAidQ.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you really want to see the jumps in a \"proper\" graph, you can clear no-returning flag from those functions, but it will be somewhat artificial since those instructions are not reachable in normal execution flow.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
