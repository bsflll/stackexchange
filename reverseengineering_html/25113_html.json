For some reason, Ida autoanalysis didn't recognized code that comes from\n  <code>\n   libc\n  </code>\n  as \"library function\", but as a \"regular function\". Let me make it more clear with some screenshots.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My tutor got the following result (sorry for the low quality, I describe whats in it after the shot):\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jobXw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jobXw.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  This is the same image and you (maybe) can see that the\n  <code>\n   malloc\n  </code>\n  function at\n  <code>\n   0xE0E5DE\n  </code>\n  is recognized as library function. The whole neighborhood is recognized as library function, since this section is for static-linked\n  <code>\n   libc\n  </code>\n  symbols.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But when I'm loading the image its a \"regular function\", and of course it doesn't resolve as\n  <code>\n   malloc()\n  </code>\n  :\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/R1iiJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/R1iiJ.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried to re-autoanalyze the code (\n  <code>\n   Options --> General --> Reanalyze Program\n  </code>\n  ) but it didn't help. Hence I'm asking for help:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Is there another automatic way to make IDA \"notice\" this code comes from static linking of a library?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Maybe there is a manual way to do it? like: marking a code chunk as library function and compare it against\n   <code>\n    libc\n   </code>\n   ?\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   P.S: the app was once packed with UPX, I decompress it. I don't believe it has anything to do with this problem, but maybe it has so I'm mentioning it\n  </strong>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Ida comes with a lot of pre-calculated FLIRT signatures but of course it can not contain signatures for each and every combination of library version and used compiler.
