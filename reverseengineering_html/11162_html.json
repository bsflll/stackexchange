    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have been impressed with the reverse debugging (that is stepping back in time through a program) capabilities in GDB and tools like QIRA, but I am a little confused as to why no such program exists for the OSX platform (GDS does not support reverse debugging on OSX.) Is there a technical reason why a reverse debugger is not possible on OSX? I would imagine that under the same architectures the task of implementing a time oblivious debugger would be almost exactly the same. Why would porting to OSX be a impossible or difficult? I mostly assume there is a technical challenge here because no one has implemented such an obviously useful program.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It's\n  <em>\n   really\n  </em>\n  slow (because it records individual instructions), so you generally have to turn it on just for a critical piece of the program. I don't know of very many people that use it, which may explain why it hasn't been ported widely. I'm not familiar with QIRA's implementation so I don't know what the reasons would be there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Something like\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/rr\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Mozilla's\n   <code>\n    rr\n   </code>\n  </a>\n  can be a lot faster, because it records at the system call boundary. But that's much more tied to the specific OS, so it's a lot of work to reimplement for another platform.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One last possibility is something whole-system, that records hardware events and so would be OS-agnostic by default. But then you have to run a full OS to record/replay one program, so this may not be very attractive either. This is the route that\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/moyix/panda\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   PANDA\n  </a>\n  and some\n  <a href=\"https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2015-09/msg04623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   experimental QEMU patches\n  </a>\n  take (note that PANDA doesn't actually support the gdb reverse-step instructions yet, but it could be implemented).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
