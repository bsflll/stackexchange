I'm looking for guidance on where should I look for it and how to do it. Here is a picture of the mainboard.\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/J24ZV.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/J24ZV.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n  The chips on the board are:\n  \n\n  IC 1 says:\n  \n\n  74HC4051D\n  \n\n  ?85HYC06D\n  \n\n  ?UnG1336L\n  \n\n  Probably an 8 Channel Analog Multiplexer\n  \n\n  \n\n  IC 2 says:\n  \n\n  8002B\n  \n\n  CG0920F\n  \n\n  Probably Audio Power Amplifier\n  \n\n  \n\n  And IC 3 which don't have any writing on it. This one seems like the MCU.\n\nDoes anyone see a UART, JTAG or SPI on the board and could guide me on how to find and connect to it?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Backside pictures:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/u5yYx.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/u5yYx.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Chances are it's a Chinese 8051 or PIC clone, possibly OTP or mask ROM, probably read protected so getting firmware out it may require 'decapping' the package and probing directly onto the chip (not practical for an amateur, and risks destroying the chip).\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Some\n  </em>\n  older MCUs can be broken into with simple non-destructive techniques. But first you need to know which MCU you have. Trace out the circuit and try to figure out the function of each pin. Then match it up with known MCUs that have the same number of pins. The package shape (size and position of the 'pin 1' dot etc.) can also be a clue. You could remove the chip from the board and look on the underside for markings, but this may not tell you much.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Having a full understanding of the circuit and how it operates could allow you to develop your own code for another MCU (bonus if it has the same pinout and can be a drop-in replacement). You may find this is quicker, easier, and more enjoyable than a (probably futile) attempt to extract and reverse-engineer the original firmware.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
