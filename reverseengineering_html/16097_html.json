    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am trying to get all the library function calls that a binary performs in a preorder-DFT traversal of the CFG. I'm able to get the CFG like:\n </p>\n <pre><code>import sys, angr\nimport networkx as nx\nproj = angr.Project(sys.argv[1],auto_load_libs=False)\ncfg = proj.analyses.CFG().graph\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I was able to get the CFG and I can even traverse it like this (Suppose I'm getting the correct main function's node):\n </p>\n <pre><code>s = nx.dfs_preorder_nodes(cfg,mainFuncNode)\nnodes = []\ntry:\n    while True:\n        nodes.append(ns.next())\nexcept:\n    pass\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However I don't know how to get the function calls from the nodes (if they are actually doing it).\nI read some documentation and all I could come up with was:\n </p>\n <pre><code>for n in nodes:\n    if n.is_simprocedure:\n          print n.to_codenode().function\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The output is all None and I'm sure that's wrong because the binary Is doing some I/O operations. So I expect to see something like:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    libc_puts\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    libc_gets\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   ...\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I would appreciate if you could give me some better pointers.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Each\n  <code>\n   CFGNode\n  </code>\n  has a\n  <code>\n   .function_address\n  </code>\n  member, which tells you the address of the function that the node belongs to.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For the latter, every edge in the graph is labeled with properties, and we use 'jumpkind' to mark the type of an edge. An\n  <code>\n   Ijk_Call\n  </code>\n  jumpkind means that edge is a call from a block (or a node) to a function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By the way, angr's CFG class is more than just the\n  <code>\n   .graph\n  </code>\n  member (which is a\n  <code>\n   networkx.DiGraph\n  </code>\n  instance). You might find it easier sometimes to directly work on\n  <code>\n   CFG\n  </code>\n  , instead of manually traversing the graph.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In addition, once a CFG is generated, you can access all functions by accessing\n  <code>\n   CFG.functions\n  </code>\n  . Each\n  <code>\n   Function\n  </code>\n  instance has two intra-function graphs associated with it: a\n  <code>\n   .graph\n  </code>\n  and a\n  <code>\n   .transition_graph\n  </code>\n  . You may find it easier to work with than traversing the CFG of the whole binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the end, if you like GUI, and you have a lot of patience, you might want to give\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/angr/angr-management/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   angr Management\n  </a>\n  a try.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
