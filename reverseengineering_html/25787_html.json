It seens it ways built on unity 2018.4.11.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know I have to find the functions that call what I want, but don't know how to do it and what to do after this. The tutorials are very confusing on this area.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So being objective, can anyone help me what I have to search and what I have to do with what I found, like, if I'm trying to find the function that calls the button to start a play, how can I call it after I found it?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you very much?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
