Its closed source but just wondering\n </p>\n <p>\n  what is the starting point for learning hardware reverse engineering?\n </p>\n <p>\n  e.g. Putting mouse to deep sleep when not in use, I guess it eats up battery even if not using\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Try to find anything written and see if you can spot soldered on chips with markings that help to identify them. If you happen to spot a flash chip, look up its specs and see if you can dump it and make sense of it with binwalk, for example. This question is really very open-ended, despite being about a specific device.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
