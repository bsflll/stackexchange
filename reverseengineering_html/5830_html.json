The only problem is that, sometimes, you'll have indirect calls/jumps. Meaning, the operand will be a register containing the target address. This will occur very often if the target binary file original source code was written in\n  <code>\n   C++\n  </code>\n  (virtual functions) for example. One way to obtain the target address in this case is to emulate or run the chunk of code that computes it. Another is to assess its value heuristically (heuristics are hell).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two, you can run your binary file with multiple input data sets and dynamically extract the call graphs (this can be performed through instrumentation). You can then cross reference all the obtained call graphs ...\n </p>\n <p>\n  Three, I would recommend a\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_block\">\n   basic-block\n  </a>\n  centric approach rather than a functional one. Mainly, because a function is a basic-block in itself and you'll have more luck finding functions this way than trying to match patterns which can change from one compiler to another, or from one version of a compiler to another.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The following publications are extremely interesting :\n  <a href=\"http://www.cse.scu.edu/~atkinson/papers/apsec-04a.pdf\">\n   [1]\n  </a>\n  ,\n  <a href=\"http://www.cse.scu.edu/~atkinson/papers/serp-02.pdf\">\n   [2]\n  </a>\n  ,\n  <a href=\"http://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/pub/paradyn/papers/Harris05WBIA.pdf\">\n   [3]\n  </a>\n  , and also I would encourage you to check\n  <code>\n   DynInst\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   callgrind\n  </code>\n  if you want to learn more about the subject.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Just like what you are proposing. For example, searching for\n    <code>\n     push\n    </code>\n    es in the binary can provide a (rather) rough approximation of function starts. Things are more difficult if you want to locate function ends though.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Machine learning. Pattern matching can be automated using machine learning. There are several proposals in the literature like [\n    <a href=\"https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-127.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     1\n    </a>\n    ], [\n    <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-bao.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     2\n    </a>\n    ], and [\n    <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-shin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     3\n    </a>\n    ]. All of which attempt to learn byte-level features of function starts and ends. However, modern compiler optimizations make it challenging for such approaches to generalize to binaries beyond the training set.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    CFG-based techniques. This is the most promising approach based on [\n    <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/2968455.2968505\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     4\n    </a>\n    ] (disclosure: first author here) and concurrently [\n    <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuroSP.2017.11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     5\n    </a>\n    ]. Basically, it proceeds with (1) direct call target analysis, (2) CFG traversal to locate function ends, and (3) tail-call target analysis.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Call frame information (CFI) records. Before doing anything fancy, checkout the CFI records in the\n    <code>\n     .eh_frame\n    </code>\n    section. There is a good chance that functions are defined there already. In order to dump CFI records, you can use something like\n    <code>\n     readelf --debug-dump=frames /bin/ls\n    </code>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I've recently revisited the problem of function identification in this blog\n  <a href=\"https://blog.formallyapplied.com/2020/05/function-identification/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   post\n  </a>\n  where I provide more details.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
