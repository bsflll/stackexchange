The game is also packed in Termida/WinLicense, can't unpack it as it keeps crashing during the process, but I managed to get a memory dump and a Dr. Watson\n  <code>\n   crashdump.dmp\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I posted screenshots of WinDBg below and a IDA PRO of the line that it seems to crash on any idea how to repair this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Everytime I attempt to load up the game I get this a Dr. Watson error box\n  <img alt=\"8\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wH44s.png\"/>\n  <img alt=\"1\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rlHCi.png\"/>\n  <img alt=\"2\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iUmCw.png\"/>\n  <img alt=\"3\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MERKD.png\"/>\n  <img alt=\"4\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2qvF3.png\"/>\n  <img alt=\"5\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NvMZH.png\"/>\n  <img alt=\"9\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hHOSl.png\"/>\n  <img alt=\"10\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DF41L.png\"/>\n  <img alt=\"6\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pcAQk.png\"/>\n  <img alt=\"7\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1ZIsP.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyone give me any advise how to fix this game so it loads up? Anything I need to install on my computer to make it run?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is the game binaries and dll files.\n  <a href=\"https://www.mediafire.com/?3g3ro8qt7hbaqr3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.mediafire.com/?3g3ro8qt7hbaqr3\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The decompilation above may have effectively been written as:\n </p>\n <pre><code>if (InterlockedIncrement(...) == 1)\n{\n    Log_Error(...);\n    Log_Error(..., L\"\\r\n\", ...);\n    if (something())\n    {\n        ...\n    }\n    FORCE_CRASH();\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  You may want to take a closer look at the data at\n  <code>\n   off_203C1C8\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   unk_1BC2AE8\n  </code>\n  , and\n  <code>\n   a1\n  </code>\n  to get some more hints. But if it were me, I'd just uninstall the game and move on. I wouldn't be able to trust developers who forcibly crash their program if I have a firewall enabled.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you really want to pursue this, I'd recommend getting in touch with TERA's support staff.</span>",
