I've searched Google and 0 results came up, I've been searching and reading everything I can about ATMs and reverse engineering them but there's not much information. I was able to find the ATM's update file and in the update file is a file called\n  <code>\n   boot.bin\n  </code>\n  and when I throw it into IDA Pro and set processor to ARM Little-Endian ARMv4T because the processor is an S3C2410A and that's what the datasheet said but I cannot figure out the address to load the binary at to get any disassembled code that looks correct, but inside that file is the string \"COM download is failed\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  So what I am asking is, can anyone help me find the loading address of\n  <code>\n   bios.bin\n  </code>\n  in the update file located\n  <a href=\"https://ufile.io/4xbb1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

For example, loading\n  <code>\n   bios.bin\n  </code>\n  at F000:0000 and starting disassembly from F000:FFF0 (standard x86 entrypoint) produces nice code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>cseg:FFF0                _reset:                            \ncseg:FFF0                                                   \ncseg:FFF0 FA                             cli\ncseg:FFF1 BA A4 FF                       mov     dx, 0FFA4h\ncseg:FFF4 B8 02 80                       mov     ax, 8002h\ncseg:FFF7 EF                             out     dx, ax\ncseg:FFF8 EA 20 00 00 F0                 jmp     far ptr loc_F000_20\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The code is apparently hardware-specific and does not resemble much the classic BIOS of the generic PCs.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
