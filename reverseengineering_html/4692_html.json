    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I was asked to help extract information from an old Progress database. I have physical and remote access to both the database server and a workstation with the client application installed. I am able to run the client application which requests and presents information from the database. The connection appears to be via ODBC and I am able to connect to the host/service but do not have valid credentials.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I presume the credentials have to be stored somewhere on the client machine since logging in to the client application allows me to connect. I already reviewed the registry and file system for any hints of configuration and found many useful pieces of information but no credentials. My next thought was to try to trace the network communication but I expect that the communication would be encrypted so that would be a whole other issue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How can I best go about finding what the database credentials are?\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Update: I should also mention I'm not familiar with Progress databases - my experience is in Oracle, SQLServer, and MySQL. I'm just trying to help an old coworker out and assume once I can connect it's just like any other relational database.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Launch Progress Data Administration utility:(Admin-> Security-> Edit User List)  2. Delete the sysprogress user account  3. Recreate the sysprogress user account noting the password.

Personally the first thing I'd do is to see how it establishes the ODBC connection (which driver etc). And then try to place a shallow wrapper around that which can help to sniff out the data I need. One way is to place a DLL implementing the used ODBC functions and using export forwarders for the uninteresting ones. You can then force the client to load your DLL by placing a manifest or even modifying the import table (assuming no integrity checking).\n</span>\n</body></html>",

The idea of tracing the .DLL calls is a great and one I actually had myself. It is beyond my current knowledge but I know there are resources that should allow me go that route. I had tried turning on tracing in the DSN manager but there was no log output which made me worry that it wasn't actually using that driver.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
