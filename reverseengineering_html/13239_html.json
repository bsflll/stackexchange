    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I want to be able to do what an ordinary disassembler does—list the assembler instructions of an arbitrary executable—but from C#. It would consist, for instance, of finding a specific instruction from its address and determining which memory address is accessed by it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any Google search I tried leads me rather to the resources which explain how to decompile C# applications themselves in order to get IL bytecode. Except that I don't care about IL bytecode: what I want is to get the actual instructions of any app, including ones written in plain C or any other language.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In other words, I want the same thing as in\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/840363/240613\">\n   <em>\n    How can I see the assembly code for a C++ program?\n   </em>\n  </a>\n  question, but to be able to do it programmatically instead of using a GUI tool.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How do I do that?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

That was the whole point of that \"managed\" circus, to avoid direct machine code, IIRC.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
