    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am reverse engineering how a CPS software package communicates to a radio device. I have the basics down, and want to trick the software into thinking COM1 is the radio, when in reality I want to capture the control flow pin state changes (CTR and RST).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am running Windows XP in Qemu and/or Virtual Box with Linux as the base OS. Is there a way for Linux to emulate a software-defined serial port that captures all pin state changes?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have tried using\n  <code>\n   socat\n  </code>\n  , specifically with something like this\n  <code>\n   socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0,b9600 pty,raw,echo=0,b9600\n  </code>\n  , but attempts to change the control flow pins on the resulting\n  <code>\n   /dev/pts/X\n  </code>\n  will result in an\n  <code>\n   ioctl\n  </code>\n  error. Also, simple\n  <code>\n   cat /dev/pts/X\n  </code>\n  only shows content sent over the device, not control flow changes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How would I do this? And, how would I pass the resulting device to a Windows VM to make it think it is communicating with\n  <code>\n   COM1\n  </code>\n  ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
