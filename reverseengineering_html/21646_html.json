To set the break point where it writes\n  <strong>\n   Incorrect password.\n  </strong>\n  I need to run the program first. But after it prints the password is incorrect, it closes, and when I click Debug>Restart it deletes the break point.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, how can I fix this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am using OllyDbg 2\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It's because it supports x86 architecture, while C# program is compiled to Common Intermediate Language which is not x86 assembly. You can rewrite it in C++ an everything should be fine.
