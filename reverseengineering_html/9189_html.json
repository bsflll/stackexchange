    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  While exploiting a strcpy() buffer overflow in Win XP, I used the address of ESP after the crash to overwrite EIP. The address contained a null byte so it did not work, so I found a jmp esp instruction and used that instead. Then I ran the program and it worked fine. Then I realized that the shellcode (from msfpayload) also had null bytes allover. However, it executed fine and I got a reverse shell.\nWhy does null bytes in the shellcode not corrupt the rest of the payload whereas a null byte in the return address corrupted the rest of the payload?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
