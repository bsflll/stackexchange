    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I want to capture packets from Android apps. I need an packets forwarder on phone that creates a VPN to redirect all TCP packets to PC, then capture them with 'mitmproxy'. I want to use mitmproxy because it supports python addons, and it's free/opensource.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But I can't find a suitable packet forwarder. Here are what I've tried so far:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Postern: sometimes it causes DNS error, I can't ping sites when it's enabled, unable to modify DNS server in settings, project abandoned.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   ProxyDroid: fails to resolve dns somehow\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   TunProxy: http only, not support tcp\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   burp, http_toolkit: non-free, not possible to save packets without paying\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   HttpCanary/Reqable/PacketCapture/PCapDroid: doesn't collaborate with other apps like mitmproxy\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Any suggestion?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
