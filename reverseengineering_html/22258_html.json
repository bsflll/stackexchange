I'm a complete newbie in reverse engineering so it's hard for me to learn how it works only using assembly code. I found out, there are a lot of original function names left in the dump:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7WfBE.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7WfBE.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is it possible to get C code with original function names from this? I don't have Hex Rays decompiler tho.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The code itself is still machine language and there's no way to directly translate that back into the original. Your best option is a decompiler like Hex-Rays, but that will still only give an approximation.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
