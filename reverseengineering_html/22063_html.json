Using this setup I have been able to acquire good pcap from most samples, but this one is a bit vexing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can see that my sample is reaching out over TCP to the correct C2 server, but ICMP returns \"destination unreachable (network unreachable)\". I went ahead and used route/iptables as described in this post:\n  <a href=\"https://techanarchy.net/blog/installing-and-configuring-inetsim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://techanarchy.net/blog/installing-and-configuring-inetsim\n  </a>\n  but now I'm finding it difficult to find the traffic since it's all to my IP in wireshark, and it seems to be ssl encrypted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Where do I go from here?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I can't go into further detail without mentioning the particular sample family I was working on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I didn't need to decrypt SSL traffic or anything, my previous steps actually did expose the web traffic the way I wanted it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, I was wrong that my steps changed the source/destination in wireshark, it was actually fine.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
