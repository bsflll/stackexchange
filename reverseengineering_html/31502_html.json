Thus, one dynamic basic\nblock may contain one or more static basic blocks that are defined as\nfollows: a sequential run of instructions that starts with an\ninstruction that is a target of a taken branch and ends with the first\n   <strong>\n    branch\n   </strong>\n   in sequence\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/pintool/docs/98484/Pin/html/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Intel Pintool User Manual\n  </a>\n  defines their basic block (BBLs) as:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Pin breaks the trace into basic blocks, BBLs. A BBL is a single\nentrance, single exit sequence of instructions. Branches to the middle\nof a bbl begin a new trace and hence a new BBL\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  I am not clear if Pintool BBLs is static or dynamic bbls?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Please advice!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
