The camera's 60fps function is disabled. The sensor can handle 100fps. Blackmagic only provides Max. 30fps. So there is more to it than offered by Blackmagic.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The\n  <code>\n   *.bin\n  </code>\n  files can be found in the Blackmagic Camera Setup and only there. In all other versions the\n  <code>\n   *.bin\n  </code>\n  files are not to be found. It concerns the following files:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VBD7E-E-8eVjextm0Z2AjaX7u3NKRPEF/view\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VBD7E-E-8eVjextm0Z2AjaX7u3NKRPEF/view\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The FPGA chip is Spartan 6 from Xilinx\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is it possible to extract the firmware, then modify it and pack it back as firmware?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I hope for some tips.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
