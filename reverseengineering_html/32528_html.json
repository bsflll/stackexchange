I have someone at the moment trying to get what I gotten a few years ago but with the static.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This just happened all of a sudden when 'circuit bending' the game with a simple speed control knob changing the pitch of the game.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know on low batteries this game can do a lot of things like making it count up to 69. Here's the spectogram of the audio that was captured with the static.\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7tPCV.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7tPCV.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
