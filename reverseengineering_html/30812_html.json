    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have an arm64 binary that I've been reversing and I've reached a point where it would be immensely useful to visually emulate / debug a section of code. I have the full binary and I can also find a way to dump the memory of the process at the particular code segment I'm interested in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What would be nice is some emulator that I could load my binary into along with the registers and stack values. Then I would like to emulate the instructions step by step until the routine is complete. I'm mostly wanting to know how the code is manipulating data step by step.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd like access to the full instruction set but at a minimum I'd need an emulator that supports all the x and w registers. Here is a very useful tool I've found but it only emulates a small subset of arm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/Wunkolo/OakSim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/Wunkolo/OakSim\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does anyone have any recommendations for an arm64 emulator that suits my needs? Thank you!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
