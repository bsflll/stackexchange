I've tried several CRC16 algorithms and none of them seem to work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tx message format looks like:\n </p>\n <pre><code>start(10B) + messageIndex(1B) + data(5-15B) + checksum(2B) + end(1B) \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Rx message has same format but only 1 data byte. Here are few examples provided (hash # added to separate the blocks; hexadecimal format):\n </p>\n <pre><code>Tx: 82 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 ff c1 # 48 # 56 57 50 41 54 5f 30 5f 31 3d 31 # 7f 12 # 83\nRx: 82 00 00 00 ff 00 00 00 01 01 # 48 # 4f # cc 68 # 83\n\nTx: 82 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 ff c1 # 49 # 56 57 50 41 4e 5f 30 5f 32 3d 49 55 30 30 30 # f5 16 # 83\nRx: 82 00 00 00 ff 00 00 00 01 01 # 49 # 4f # 5c 69 # 83\n\nTx: 82 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 ff c1 # 4a # 56 57 50 41 54 5f 30 5f 32 3d 31 # b8 1b # 83\nRx: 82 00 00 00 ff 00 00 00 01 01 # 4a # 4f # ac 69 # 83\n\nTx: 82 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 ff c1 # 4b # 56 57 41 4b 54 50 4e 5f 30 3d 32 # 60 6f # 83\nRx: 82 00 00 00 ff 00 00 00 01 01 # 4b # 4f # 3c 68 # 83\n\nTx: 82 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 ff c1 # 4c # 56 57 50 41 4e 5f 31 5f 31 3d 49 4c 30 30 30 # 6a ec # 83\nRx: 82 00 00 00 ff 00 00 00 01 01 # 4c # 4f # 0c 6a # 83\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  If necessary, I can provide more data. Any help or hint would be appreciated ;)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Best regards,\nZlatko\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   EDIT\n  </strong>\n  The correct algorithm is regular CRC16 (0x8005 polynom).
