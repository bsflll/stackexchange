    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to understands how it works by decompiling my own Objective-C code. Here's the decompiled instruction:\n </p>\n <pre><code>var_8= -8\nvar_4= -4\n\nSUB             SP, SP, #8\nMOVS            R2, #1\nSTR             R0, [SP,#8+var_4]\nSTR             R1, [SP,#8+var_8]\nMOV             R0, R2\nADD             SP, SP, #8\nBX              LR\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  From my understanding (correct me if I'm wrong), by line:\n </p>\n <pre><code>SP=SP-8\nMove 1 to R2\nStore R0 into SP+8+var_4\nStore R1 into SP+8+var_8\nMove R2 into R0\nSP=SP+8\nNext Function\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And the actual code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>%hook SomeClass\n- (int)somemethod {\nreturn 1;\n}\n%end\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now I don't understand why it needs\n  <code>\n   STR R0, [SP,#8+var_4]\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   STR R1, [SP,#8+var_8]\n  </code>\n  for, as I can't see it purposes. And if I were to\n  <code>\n   return 0\n  </code>\n  , a simple change to of\n  <code>\n   MOVS R2, #1\n  </code>\n  to\n  <code>\n   MOVS R2, #0\n  </code>\n  would do, wouldn't it? But that didn't works.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
