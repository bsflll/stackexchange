Can we find a non blacklisted packers ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any ideas ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This of course costs money, but even this only slows down the reverser long enough to get sales from the product. This has been cracked and is constantly being cracked. Denuvo though updates its product regularly to combat these reversers, but again .\n  <em>\n   You can only slow a reverser - not stop him.\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can make your own, but you will run the risk of malware detection. There are some commercial products which have a higher cost which should bypass antivirus. You should understand that the same techniques used to protect your PE are being used for malware.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You should ask what are you trying to protect from and what time frame and if it is just enough time to make sales then sometime standard should suffice. But if you are expecting something eternal to suffice to never be cracked or something, then it will never happen.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This might slow down the performance of your code by quite a bit though - so it is often only used to protect key portions of the code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some packers that provide this feature are VMProtect, Themida. Might have a few more but I can't quite recall.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you use an outdated packer (cracked versions are usually outdated), it would often have scripts available in public that helps someone to restore the original, unprotected PE file. So be prepared to pay a bomb to buy the official product, and keep it up to date.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
