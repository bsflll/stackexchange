It scans through the code-section of every loaded module of each running process and compares it with the file-image. If it detects discrepancies it tries to determine the type of hook or patch and reports it to the user.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Currently implemented hook detection:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   * - Inline patches / Hooks (NOP, Exceptionhandler, relative Jumps, Custom patches)\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   * - Other custom patches [...]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   * - VTable Hooks\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   * - IAT and EAT Hooks\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   * - Relocation Hooks\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   * - Hardware Breakpoints\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   * - PAGE_GAURD Candidates\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
