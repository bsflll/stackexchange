Below is the snippet of the section I'm having trouble with:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <wdm.h>\n\n#define MAX_PATH 260\nVOID listprocess() {\n\n    // Access the doubly linked list of processes\n    PEPROCESS currentProcess = PsGetCurrentProcess();\n    PLIST_ENTRY processListEntry = currentProcess->ActiveProcessLinks.Flink;```\n\n\nPS: I'm a beginner so please indulge me if it's too basic as question, Thanks!!!\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Main reason is that the structure happens to change a lot. Best way to use it is to extract and convert it from the PDB file of the\n <b>\n  exact\n </b>\n kernel version you're experimenting with into C and use the header in your program. There are some programs to convert PDB structures (named\n <code>\n  UDT\n </code>\n in PDB parlance) to C header files (e.g.\n <a href=\"https://github.com/wbenny/pdbex\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  pdbex\n </a>\n ) or online websites such as\n <a href=\"https://www.vergiliusproject.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  Vergilius\n </a>\n .\n</span>\n</body></html>",
