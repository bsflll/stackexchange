I'm attatching a python script that will print each function call with a number of calls to it, to the file named\n  <em>\n   output\n  </em>\n  . Feel free to use it for your purposes:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport gdb\nimport re\n\nbreakpoints = []\ngdb.execute('rbreak', to_string=True)\ngdb.execute('run', to_string=True)\ntry:\n    while True:\n        a = gdb.execute('continue', to_string=True)\n        reg = gdb.execute('info registers rip', to_string=True)\n        b = reg.split()[1][2:]\n        f = reg.split()[3]\n        c = gdb.execute('info breakpoints', to_string=True).split('\n')\n        d = [s for s in c if b in s]\n        if len(d) > 1:\n            sys.exit(1)\n        e = d[0].split()[0].split('.')[0]\n        gdb.execute('disable breakpoints ' + e)\n        breakpoints.append(e)\n        breakpoints.append(f)\nexcept:\n    f = open(\"output\", \"w+\")\n    [f.write(b + '\n') for b in breakpoints]\n    f.close()\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  You can invoke it by running\n  <code>\n   gdb name_of_your_program\n  </code>\n  and then\n  <code>\n   source gdb.py\n  </code>\n  assuming that the script name is\n  <em>\n   gdb.py\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  After doing this two times, you will get two files: one containing all function calls, while not pressing buttons, and the other one containing function calls when buttons are being pressed. Simply running\n  <code>\n   diff\n  </code>\n  on this files will reveal which functions are responsible for button press handling.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If, for some reason you cannot use GDB,\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/21235/function-call-trace-with-radare2-or-break-on-all-function-call/21724#21724\">\n   this answer\n  </a>\n  shows the way it can be done in\n  <a href=\"https://rada.re/n/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   radare2\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This is\n  <em>\n   logging\n  </em>\n  debugee's actions at a predefined granularity level. That could be logging all individual instructions, or as you desire, function calls. Using function tracing (\n  <code>\n   Debugger -> Tracing -> Function Tracing\n  </code>\n  ) a user is able to view all functions called throughout the tracing duration. Keep in mind this may generate a big trace, and logging it to a file may be recommended.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Then, simply run the program and the debugger will stop the execution of the program at the time each function is called.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, if you want to see when a program calls CreateProcessInternalW, you can go into the function import table (sometimes called \"symbols\") and set breakpoints on the function listed there. Now, when a program creates a new process, the debugger will break execution at that point so you can see the arguments passed and return value. For convenience, I've attached a screenshot of this in IDA Pro - pay attention to the right side of the screen where I have the function list of\n  <code>\n   apphelp.dll\n  </code>\n  which I got to by finding it in the \"Modules\" window and then double-clicking the DLL file name. Now we can right-click on a specific function like I've shown and click \"Add Breakpoint\", then run the program. This is only available in the IDA Debugger once the debugger has been started.\n </p>\n <p>\n  NOTE: Sometimes the imports are not fully resolved at the beginning of the program, so as you continue through the program, more of these functions will become available to break on.\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FFItk.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FFItk.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
