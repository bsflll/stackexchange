I would like to step through the APK instruction by instruction, and possibly set breakpoints on certain APIs or certain smali instructions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've tried decompiling with apktool, loading into netbeans, and the connecting to the emulator, and I've also tried using IDA Pro, but I always get errors along the lines of \"JDWP error: Connection reset by peer\". I've tried with both the default Android emulator and Genymotion with Android 5.0.1.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Has anyone had any success with this? Could you describe your setup and tools that you used?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
