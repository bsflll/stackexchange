I've used PIX to see all the DirectX calls of the game, and that part worked correctly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After that, I wanted to know where in the code those functions were called from. Therefore, I tried to use API Monitor, but there I got the first surprise: no calls were being found to\n  <strong>\n   Graphics and Gaming/DirectX Graphics and Gaming\n  </strong>\n  (where all the Direct3D functions are).\n </p>\n <p>\n  As that didn't work, I used IDA instead; In the Imports window, only these were being shown:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/b3wcg.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/b3wcg.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  And in the Functions window, none of the DirectX functions was found.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, is this the proper way (if it's possible at all) of doing this? Also, how is that API Monitor doesn't register any DirectX calls, although PIX does?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
