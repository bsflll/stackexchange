So 6.6 should work, maybe the error is somewhere else, possibly you executed the 64bit binary?\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you don't stick to the IDA debugger but rather choose something like OllyDbg or WinDbg and examine the corresponding code sections in IDA on your host, you don't need that remote setup.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Still of you want to do the remote setup, Hex-Rays provides a tutorial for that\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/freefiles/remotedbg.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .

[From 7.0 onwards it doesn't work.] I guess I'll say to make sure you're running XP SP3 - I am here, and it works, so could be that. Another more probable reason that happened with me was that I had copied the IDA folder from the host to the VM without installing (and I didn't have Python installed either), and that happened. After installing, all is fine. So check if Python is being installed, for example. Else, no idea what could be. Actually installing it did it for me.</span>",

No idea why, but I can. It loads just like the 32-bit EXE. I can even start the \"Local Win32 debugger\" from Debugging Tools 7.1.0 and start debugging idaq64.exe (either idaq64 or idaw64, doesn't matter, both run just fine). Either it's related to the VM, or I've no idea (my CPU is 64-bit, but supposedly that shouldn't matter). Just thought I'd say this.</span>",
