    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  So in a malware sample (Shelter) IDA doesn't include some parts of the function in the function itself, and puts the endp in an earlier part, so for example the function really ends at 0x401080 but it thinks it ends at 0x401050 for some reason even tho the last instruction isn't ret and its just a SUB instruction, and the next instruction is a valid and instruction and I'm not sure why its not detecting it\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
