The translation was done by Google Translate.\nI'm trying to work on a .dll from a Unity game, I managed to decompile the entire game, open the .dll, but it is obfuscated and I can't unobfuscate it in any way. Do you know of any way I can deobfuscate the .dll? I can't go to the next step.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
