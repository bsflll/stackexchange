Every segment has a unique name that you can change. A segment with the name .text means that the content of this segment is read-only and not writable. So if a piece of code is accessing this segment and changing a variable value in it, the message in your question will appear and say that the target segment is\n  <strong>\n   considered\n  </strong>\n  read-only, which results in wrong decompiled code.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   How can we fix this issue in IDA Pro?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Two workarounds:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Change the\n   <code>\n    segment name\n   </code>\n   to something else:\n   <kbd>\n    View\n   </kbd>\n   ->\n   <kbd>\n    Open\n   </kbd>\n   <kbd>\n    subviews\n   </kbd>\n   ->\n   <kbd>\n    Segments\n   </kbd>\n   (\n   <kbd>\n    Shift\n   </kbd>\n   +\n   <kbd>\n    F7\n   </kbd>\n   ), right click on the segment-->Edit, Change the name.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Change the\n   <code>\n    segment permission\n   </code>\n   to read and write: Follow the above path and check the\n   <code>\n    write\n   </code>\n   and\n   <code>\n    read\n   </code>\n   check boxes.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
