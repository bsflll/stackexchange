            "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  That site is good if you're familiar with how the encoding works but if you're just starting I'd skip it for now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The best starting point is probably the Intel's\n  <a href=\"http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html\">\n   Architectures Software Developer Manuals\n  </a>\n  . Have a look at CHAPTER 2 INSTRUCTION FORMAT in the Volume 2, and also the appendices, particularly APPENDIX B INSTRUCTION FORMATS AND ENCODINGS and APPENDIX A OPCODE MAP. They describe how to decode instructions in great detail.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once you're a little familiar with parts of the instruction encodings, the notations in the instruction listing pages will start to make sense. For example, let's check the one you need.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the page for\n  <code>\n   MOV\n  </code>\n  , find the variant you need. This one looks like it:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Hex     Mnemonic          Encoding   Description\n8E /r   MOV Sreg,r/m16**  RM         Move r/m16 to segment register.\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Looking up 'RM' in the following table, we get:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Op/En Operand 1     Operand 2     Operand 3 Operand 4\nRM    ModRM:reg (w) ModRM:r/m (r) NA        NA\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And so we can start assembling the opcode.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first byte is fixed to be\n  <code>\n   8E\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The second byte is the ModRM byte. It consists of three fields:\n  <code>\n   mod\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   reg\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   r/m\n  </code>\n  . Let's assemble it with the help of this\n  <a href=\"http://sandpile.org/x86/opc_rm.htm\">\n   nice table\n  </a>\n  from Sandpile.\n </p>\n <p>\n  First up is the\n  <code>\n   mod\n  </code>\n  field. Since our second operand is a register and not a memory reference, this corresponds to\n  <code>\n   mod=11\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  From the\n  <code>\n   RM\n  </code>\n  encoding line we see that\n  <code>\n   reg\n  </code>\n  encodes the first operand, in our case\n  <code>\n   DS\n  </code>\n  . Looking it up in the table, we can see that\n  <code>\n   DS\n  </code>\n  is encoded as\n  <code>\n   011\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  And finally is the\n  <code>\n   r/m\n  </code>\n  field encoding operand 2, i.e.\n  <code>\n   AX\n  </code>\n  . It is encoded as\n  <code>\n   000\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  So our ModRM byte is\n  <code>\n   11:011:000\n  </code>\n  , or\n  <code>\n   D8\n  </code>\n  . This makes the full opcode to be\n  <code>\n   8E D8\n  </code>\n  . You can check it with your favorite disassembler, e.g. XED:\n </p>\n <pre><code>>xed.exe -d 8E D8\n8ED8\nICLASS: MOV   CATEGORY: DATAXFER   EXTENSION: BASE  IFORM: MOV_SEG_GPR16   ISA_SET: I86\nSHORT: mov ds, ax\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  (BTW, the\n  <code>\n   /r\n  </code>\n  notation in the encoding line tells us that the\n  <code>\n   reg\n  </code>\n  field of the ModRM byte encodes a register and is not an opcode extension. In the latter case the notation would have a\n  <code>\n   /<digit>\n  </code>\n  notation where  is the value of the\n  <code>\n   reg\n  </code>\n  field).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
