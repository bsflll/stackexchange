    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Let's say I have a carbon objective-c executable, and a crash report. From the crash report, it is apparent that the main method is located at\n  <code>\n   0x00002639\n  </code>\n  , and the NSApplicationMain method from the AppKit is at\n  <code>\n   0x93ba0025\n  </code>\n  . I anticipate that the first main method has background processes, and NSApplicationMain is the method typed by the user.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there any sort of predictable interval to instructions? I want to make breakpoints at every instruction written by the programmer. Let's say for example that the main after the main method, the instructions are separated by 2, so from\n  <code>\n   0x93ba0025\n  </code>\n  , the next function would be\n  <code>\n   0x93ba0027\n  </code>\n  , etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Would the above apply, or will I have to do something more to achieve this?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
