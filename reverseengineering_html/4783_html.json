    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I modified the byte-code of a third party Java desktop application's\n  <code>\n   .class\n  </code>\n  file (and repacked the\n  <code>\n   .jar\n  </code>\n  ), only to see that during runtime, my change made no difference, unless my change caused a crash somehow. The most simple experiment I did was to use a hex editor and simply replace a letter in a text string in the\n  <code>\n   .class\n  </code>\n  file. Runtime (of course, after restarting the Java application), the text was still the original text.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's an example of the original byte-code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>ldc \"Some text.\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Using a hex editor, I changed the string, and looked again in the byte-code editor:\n </p>\n <pre><code>ldc \"Xome text.\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The decompiled code also shows the modified string. There are no more references to the original string in the\n  <code>\n   .class\n  </code>\n  file. Despite this change, the displayed text at runtime is \"\n  <em>\n   Some text.\n  </em>\n  \" rather than \"\n  <em>\n   Xome text.\n  </em>\n  \".\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there anything I need to take into consideration, e.g. some sort of cache (outside the scope of the application) that must be cleared? I tried to delete the \"\n  <em>\n   Temporary Internet Files\n  </em>\n  \" in the Java console, to no avail.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you for any assistance you can provide! :)\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Removed:\n  </strong>\n  The decompiled code and modified files for the real-world application I was experimenting on, due to their questionable nature (didn't really help anyone anyway).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

There are plenty of them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You tried editing the\n  <code>\n   class\n  </code>\n  file and to your surprise the changes you made were not reflected. At that point you should be pretty much sure that there\n  <em>\n   must\n  </em>\n  be some other tricks such as generating the strings dynamically, encryption, obfuscation etc.The\n  <code>\n   class\n  </code>\n  files could also be loaded from some other locations such as a\n  <code>\n   cache\n  </code>\n  which you do not expect.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One way to get information about which classes are loaded is to use the following command line switch while starting java.\n </p>\n <pre><code>java -verbose:class -jar <Your jar file>\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This way the\n  <code>\n   jvm\n  </code>\n  will notify you when classes are loaded and from which locations. Using this you can know if there is some sort of\n  <em>\n   hidden\n  </em>\n  <code>\n   cache\n  </code>\n  from which it loads\n  <code>\n   class\n  </code>\n  files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After this option fails, i.e. when you are sure that there is no such hidden\n  <code>\n   cache\n  </code>\n  , you can almost be sure that there is\n  <code>\n   encryption\n  </code>\n  involved or the strings are generated \ndynamically.\n  <code>\n   Decompiling\n  </code>\n  would help, but of course if there is no obfuscation to hinder decompiling. If everything else fails, you may try inspecting the\n  <code>\n   bytecode\n  </code>\n  of the\n  <code>\n   class\n  </code>\n  files as a last resort.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
