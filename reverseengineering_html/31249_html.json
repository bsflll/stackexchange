I'm new here and I'm hope someone can help me with the problem I'm facing.\nI've been trying to reverse engineer a program but everytime I change an instruction, not matter how small it is, I always get the same result which is after I patch the file it simply wont open and it looks like it saved properly and everything is fine but it just doesn't open. I suspect it's probably an Anti-debug feature because other program I've dealt with in the past don't give me this issue. I've the basic solutions provided on the internet but nothing works. I'm use x64dbg and if I try to run the file in the debugger I get a \"A debbuger has been found running in your system. please unload it from memory and restart your program.\"\nAny information would greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
