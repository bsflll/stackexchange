To alleviate that, I wanted to use the custom resolution option in Intel graphics management panel, however, I cannot choose advanced options in the custom resolutions options and it is driving me crazy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I remembered Intel GFX drivers used some\n  <code>\n   *.inf\n  </code>\n  to enable some options and I believe it is in\n  <code>\n   igdlh64.inf\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Has any of you  tried to modify this or have some knowledge on this (and no there is not a documentation provided anywhere)?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
