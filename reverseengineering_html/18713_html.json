    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a process that runs and does it's job sometimes (takes some files and does some work). However when I feed it some\n  <em>\n   incorrect\n  </em>\n  files, it fails. I'd like, if possible, to record every step the process goes through, twice and then compare them to see where the two runs diverge.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My end game here is to force the process to work with the incorrect files; it doesn't really matter what then happens, assuming I can get past this issue - it's become more of a quest for an answer than any real usable outcome at this point.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm tentatively OK with using IDA Pro Free, and reasonable comfortable using cheat engine. I'm happy to learn a new program, if there is one that does this task specifically that'd be great! If there's a program that can record the steps for one iteration and save them to a file I can read, I'm happy to write my own program to compare and find the differences!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
