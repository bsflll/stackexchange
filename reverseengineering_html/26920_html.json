    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a proprietary tablet with mediatek chipset MT8163v, and getting the factory ROM and/or scatter file is out of the question. My goal is to flash with TWRP.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The device has a custom android repo that doesn't allow me to install apps or anything of that nature, so I can't go that route.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm trying to do a readback of the preloader partition with spflash tool, then use WwR to generate the scatter. The details of how this works can be found\n  <a href=\"https://forum.hovatek.com/thread-21970.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  . It's pretty simple.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I attempt the readback, I'm getting this error:\n </p>\n <pre><code>s_dl_get_dram_setting_fail(5054)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Everything I've read indicates that this is due to an incorrect scatter file. However, just to be safe, I used a secure boot bypass found\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/MTK-bypass/bypass_utility\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  just to make certain that secure boot isn't the problem. With the bypass however, I get the same error.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From everything I've read, a readback is the\n  <em>\n   one thing\n  </em>\n  I should be able to do without the factory rom/scatter files. Which is why I'm perplexed as to why I'm getting this error when doing a simple readback.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've even payed the tech guys at Hovatek (who were very helpful) to help work on this. We tried the newest Infinity Box with dongle as well, to no avail.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is the partition info in the scatter generated by WwR:\n </p>\n <pre><code>- partition_index: SYS0\npartition_name: PRELOADER\nfile_name: preloader.bin\nis_download: true\ntype: SV5_BL_BIN\nlinear_start_addr: 0x0\nphysical_start_addr: 0x0\npartition_size: 0x80000\nregion: EMMC_BOOT_1\nstorage: HW_STORAGE_EMMC\nboundary_check: true\nis_reserved: false\noperation_type: BOOTLOADERS\nreserve: 0x00\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Seems to me the only variable properties are\n  <code>\n   physical_start_addr\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   partition_size\n  </code>\n  . However, it seems that when I look at scatter files for other mediatek chipsets, it's always either\n  <code>\n   0x80000\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   0x40000\n  </code>\n  . And from what I've read this shouldn't matter just doing a readback. But I've tried both to no avail.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does anyone know anything else I could try?? I'm even willing to try ROMs from other devices with the same chipset. At this point I don't care if I brick it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
