When optimization is not enabled, you may see all kinds of redundant/useless calculations which are eliminated with optimization. The compiler probably did something like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>delta = elemsize*index\nelemsize = 4, index=1\ndelta = 4*1 -> 4*(1 shl 0) -> 4 shl 0\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  which was then faithfully reproduced by codegen in assembly.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
