The summary for the most common ones is:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    db\n   </code>\n   - byte (8 bit integer)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    dw\n   </code>\n   - word (16 bit integer)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    dd\n   </code>\n   - double word (32 bit integer)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    dq\n   </code>\n   - quad word (64 bit integer)\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  The\n  <code>\n   ?\n  </code>\n  denotes that this value is unknown and will only be known at runtime. And example of this are variables inside an uninitialized data section.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you start a debug session with IDA, the address will eventually contain\n  <em>\n   some\n  </em>\n  value. But since you use static analysis without running the code, there is no information what value it will contain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And you can't know the value during static analysis. This is one of the big limitations of static (not running the code) versus dynamic (running the code) analysis.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
