Taking out the BufferRegister directive will give you a shellcode blob that determines the location manually, but isn't pure alphanumeric. This should run in your program though.\n </p>\n <p>\n  An alternative would be to use something that runs shellcode from a file, since these often have a jmp/call reg32, which you can then use with BufferRegister.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The first <code>jmp</code> goes to the <code>call</code> which is just before the string <code>\"/bin/sh\"</code> and the <code>call</code> send the <code>eip</code> to the instruction just after the original <code>jmp</code>. Meanwhile, the <code>call</code> has pushed the return address on the stack, which is in fact the address of the string. This technique is fully documented on Internet in several articles.</span>",
