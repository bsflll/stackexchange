Therefore a library could simply wait for the permissions requested by other parts of the app and then access the data without requesting the permission itself. Therefore you should search for API methods that require specific permission rather than code parts that request a permission.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

In that case, you'll have to look for a way to remove those protections\nfirst, and APKiD will help you in first step of figuring out what exactly you're fighting against.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
