Simplified version:\n </p>\n <pre><code>call $+5\nadd [esp], 5\nret\nxor eax, eax\nret\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And with annotations:\n </p>\n <pre><code>_main:\n  call $+5     ; call address of next instruction, placing return address on stack (esp)\n  add [esp], 5 ; add 5 bytes to the return address\n  ret          ; return to the address from the stack ... which happens to be\n  xor eax, eax ; ... this instruction\n  ret          ; return for good from _main ...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So what this does is to return 0 as a 32-bit value from\n  <code>\n   _main\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Given the (decompiled) condition:\n </p>\n <pre><code>if ((cVar1 = func_0x8b4c55a0(), cVar1 == -0xe) || 1)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  ... this doesn't change a thing, however, as the\n  <code>\n   || 1\n  </code>\n  will ensure that this condition is always true and\n  <code>\n   cVar1\n  </code>\n  doesn't subsequently get used.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So as far as you provide context, this is pure distraction.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
