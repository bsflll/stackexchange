It uses OllyDbg as the primary program. (I'd be more interested personally in using IDA, however). Is that so?

But a lot of what you'll have to learn is assembler language, OS calls, stack usage, file formats etc., and that isn't really dependent on tools. However, a tutorial that uses a debugger will be more likely to teach that than a tutorial that's about using IDA - IDA takes a \"higher level\" approach, and a lot about reversing is a good understanding of the \"low levels\".\n</span>\n</body></html>",
