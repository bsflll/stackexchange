(\n  <code>\n   code reuse\n  </code>\n  ?)\n </p>\n <p>\n  I also have a game project in which I found 3 statically linked libraries in the exe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thus, I would also like to get acquainted with this technique in more detail and take it into my arsenal.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  If any of you are very familiar with this technique, please share your experience.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
