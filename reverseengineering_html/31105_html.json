For example:\n </p>\n <pre><code><addr>      301ac1da               invalid\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Looking up the hex code, I found out this is the\n  <a href=\"https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0596/2020-12/Base-Instructions/AUTDA--AUTDZA--Authenticate-Data-address--using-key-A-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   AUTDA\n  </a>\n  instruction. Seems like for some reason Cutter / rizin cannot parse this kind of instructions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried to write\n  <code>\n   pd\n  </code>\n  in the console directly, but it gave the same results.\nVersion info:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Version 2.1.2\nUsing rizin 0.4.1 (9023f8b)\nBased on Qt 5.15.5 (Clang 13.0 (Apple), 64 bit)\nOptional Features:\nPython: ON\nPython Bindings: ON\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Is there a way to make Cutter recognize this instruction?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
