AFAIK it can even try to build a Visual Studio Solution (\n  <code>\n   .sln\n  </code>\n  ) file from your input which should be what you look for.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   But\n  </strong>\n  under certain circumstances some information is lost during the compilation process.\n  \n\n  You would have to manually fix those errors. For example anonymous functions can confuse a decompiler easily. And of course - if the developer tries to protect his application there are various techniques like obfuscation which would make your life harder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   So to answer your questions directly:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   In most cases there isn't a 100%\n   <code>\n    Plug and Play\n   </code>\n   solution.
