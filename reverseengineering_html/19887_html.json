            "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Okay, so after looking into this a bit further I came to the following conclusion. This\n  <em>\n   may\n  </em>\n  work for you by picking another processor model supported by the\n  <code>\n   nec850\n  </code>\n  processor module. However,\n  <strong>\n   RH850 support in particular was only introduced in IDA 7.2.\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Looking further we can see in the Wikipedia article on\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renesas_Electronics\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Renesas\n  </a>\n  we find out why it ended up in the\n  <code>\n   nec850\n  </code>\n  processor module:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <h3>\n   History\n  </h3>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Renesas Electronics started operation in April 2010, through\n  the integration of NEC Electronics Corporation and Renesas Technology\n  Corporation.\n   </strong>\n   NEC Electronics was established in November 2002 by a\n  spin-off of the semiconductor operations of NEC. Renesas Technology\n  was established on April 1, 2003, as a joint venture of Hitachi, Ltd.\n  (55%) and Mitsubishi Electric (45%).\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  The name RH850 is actually not used in the IDA SDK 7.0 and 7.1 (this particular processor module comes with source code included as also indicated on the Hex-Rays website).\n </p>\n <p>\n  And in the\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/7.2/index.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   release information for IDA 7.2\n  </a>\n  we can read:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   The NEC 850 processor module has been extended to handle new\n  addressing modes and instructions for V850E2M and RH850 from Renesas.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  So no support prior to IDA 7.2 as I already surmised. In the IDA SDK 7.2 we can then find this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>static const char *const shnames[] =\n{\n  \"V850\",\n  \"V850E\",\n  \"V850E1\",\n  \"V850E2M\",\n  \"RH850\",\n  NULL\n};\n\nstatic const char *const lnames[] =\n{\n  FAMILY\"NEC V850\",\n  \"NEC V850E\",\n  \"NEC/Renesas V850E1/ES\",\n  \"NEC/Renesas V850E2/E2M\",\n  \"Renesas RH850\",\n  NULL\n};\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  (This should also provide the clue which possible alternative names you could try for rudimentary support using related processor models.\n  <em>\n   All\n  </em>\n  of those are implemented in that same\n  <code>\n   nec850\n  </code>\n  processor module.)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
