    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  A jump table I am reversing uses relative offsets to both data and functions. These relative offsets are 32-bit integers added to the address that the value is stored at. Does Ghidra support typing these as relative addresses for generating references (like how you can type a value as an absolute address by pressing\n  <kbd>\n   P\n  </kbd>\n  )?\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example:\n </p>\n <pre><code>                                 INT_00010f00                                            \n           00010f00 49 ff ff ff       int          FFFFFF49h\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Is actually a reference to\n  <code>\n   0x00010f00 + 0xffffff49 = 0x00010e49\n  </code>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

There you can providing the correct address calculated by adding\n  <code>\n   base address\n  </code>\n  and an\n  <code>\n   offset\n  </code>\n  . If you have more than one, you can automate it via\n  <code>\n   python\n  </code>\n  script.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've recorded a video detailing such situation in action\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvH7b_qLmbU\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvH7b_qLmbU\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
