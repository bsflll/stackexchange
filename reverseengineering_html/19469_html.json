So first of all I needed to either have a MIPS Linux box or take the emulation path. After some research and effort I got QEMU running a Debian MIPS system with network access and USB support to copy the file in the emulated file system:\n </p>\n <pre><code>qemu-system-mips -M malta -kernel vmlinux-2.6.32-5-4kc-malta -hda debian_squeeze_mips_standard.qcow2 -append \"root=/dev/sda1 console=tty0\" -net nic -net tap -usb -device usb-host,hostbus=1,hostaddr=8\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So I copied the file, changed the\n  <code>\n   rwx\n  </code>\n  attributes and tried to execute it, but without success\n </p>\n <pre><code>root@debian-mips:~/myfiles/# ./generator\n-bash: ./generator: No such file or directory\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The file actually exists if I list the contents of the directory.\nAfter that I did notice some missing libraries :\n </p>\n <pre><code>root@debian-mips:~/myfiles# ldd generator\n    libcrypto.so.0.9.8 => /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8 (0x2aaad000)\n    libc.so.0 => not found\n    libd1.so.2 => /lib/libd1.so.2 (0x2ac2d000)\n    libz.so.1 => /usr/lib/libz.so.1 (0x2ac41000)\n    libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x2ac67000)\n    /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0 => /lib/ld.so.1 (0x55550000)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So I copied the missing\n  <code>\n   libc.so.0\n  </code>\n  from the extracted router firmware files:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   cp libc.so.0 /usr/lib\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then there was another missing file:\n </p>\n <pre><code>root@debian-mips:~/myfiles# ldd generator\n    libcrypto.so.0.9.8 => /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8 (0x2aaad000)\n    libc.so.0 => /usr/lib/libc.so.0 (0x2ac2d00)\n    libd1.so.2 => /lib/libd1.so.2 (0x2ac8f000)\n    libz.so.1 => /usr/lib/libz.so.1 (0x2aca3000)\n    libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x2acc9000)\n    /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0 => /lib/ld.so.1 (0x55550000)\n    ld-uClibc.so.0 => not found\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Copied it again from the router extracted firmware:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   cp ld-uClibc.so.0 /usr/lib\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Everything seemed OK at this point:\n </p>\n <pre><code>root@debian-mips:~/myfiles# ldd generator\n    libcrypto.so.0.9.8 => /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8 (0x2aaad000)\n    libc.so.0 => /usr/lib/libc.so.0 (0x2ac2d00)\n    libd1.so.2 => /lib/libd1.so.2 (0x2ac8f000)\n    libz.so.1 => /usr/lib/libz.so.1 (0x2aca3000)\n    libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x2acc9000)\n    ld-uClibc.so.0 => /usr/lib/ld-uClibc,so,0 (0x2ae4b000)\n    /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0 => /lib/ld.so.1 (0x55550000)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However, I am still unable to execute the file.\nSome additional info about it:\n </p>\n <pre><code>root@debian-mips:~/myfiles# file generator\ngenerator: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS32 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I did mess around a bit more with the library files deleting those i copied and tried something like this :\n </p>\n <pre><code>ln -s /lib/libc.so.6 /lib/libc.so.0\n\nroot@debian-mips:~/myfiles# ldd generator\n    libcrypto.so.0.9.8 => /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8 (0x2aaad000)\n    libc.so.0 => /lib/libc.so.0 (0x2ac2d000)\n    libd1.so.2 => /lib/libd1.so.2 (0x2adaf000)\n    libz.so.1 => /usr/lib/libz.so.1 (0x2adc3000)\n    /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0 => /lib/ld.so.1 (0x55550000)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Still the same disappointing \"no such file or directory message\"...\nAny kind of help would be appreciated cause it feels like a dead end after all this...\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  @ SYS_V It appear that the Debian Mips distro didnt have strace and apt-get install was failing.

Read that if you want an elaborate explanation and some basic troubleshooting tips.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Firmware Analysis Toolkit is the easiest to work with and it is an automator script for Firmadyne.\nEither clone FAT from the\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/attify/firmware-analysis-toolkit\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   github repo\n  </a>\n  , or you can just download\n  <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C5BKrpoCtxqZODbF0A-tt0UNjx-UmKt3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   AttifyOS‘s Virtual machine file\n  </a>\n  for a pre-configured environment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once FAT has been installed, copy the firmware file into FAT’s directory.
