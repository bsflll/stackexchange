I'm able to enter in DFU mode and use the\n  <a href=\"http://dfu-util.gnumonks.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   <code>\n    dfu-util\n   </code>\n  </a>\n  . I'd also like to use STM32's original Dfuse tools, just for completeness sake. Unfortunately the embedded device has a changed USB vendor and device, so the original STM drivers don't recognize the device.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any ideas how to work around that?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If the DFU protocol/fuses is the same it should work ... but is highly possible you can have USB inf conflicts if the original inf is already installed. (at least on Windows are USB drivers a mess so keep trying ...) the best will be do it on clean machine (or virtual machine)\n</span>\n</body></html>",

I did not do such thing my drivers usually just access bulk transfers but most DFU I have seen have pretty good documentation including source codes ...\n</span>\n</body></html>",
