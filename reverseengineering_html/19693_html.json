Those registers are not likely used by user mode programs but used to control and initialize the processor and low-level constructs the CPU is aware of. They control CPU subsystems such as the MMU unit, task scheduling, etc. Documentation of those registers can be found in the\n  <a href=\"https://support.amd.com/techdocs/24593.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   AMD64 Architecture Manual\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can see most of them in the following figure, taken from the\n  <a href=\"https://support.amd.com/techdocs/24593.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   AMD64 Architecture Manual\n  </a>\n  :\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qK2sg.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"system registers\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qK2sg.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Not in the above picture is the new Extended Control Registers family of registers, for which only\n  <code>\n   XCR0\n  </code>\n  is currently defined.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The System Registers are part of the Model Specific Registers that, as the name implied, are model specific. The variety also changes between CPUs. A full list for the AMD64 architecture can be found in \"Appendix A MSR Cross-Reference\" of the\n  <a href=\"https://support.amd.com/techdocs/24593.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   AMD64 Architecture Manual\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  There are\n  <em>\n   extensions\n  </em>\n  that certain AMD64 based CPUs support/implement that extend the set of\n  <code>\n   XMM\n  </code>\n  registers available. The\n  <code>\n   XMM\n  </code>\n  (and later\n  <code>\n   YMM\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   ZMM\n  </code>\n  ) are currently extended to up to 32 registers of 512 bit each in\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions#AVX-512\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   AVX-512\n  </a>\n  . Similar to general registers,\n  <code>\n   XMM\n  </code>\n  registers allow access to the lower parts of their\n  <code>\n   YMM\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   ZMM\n  </code>\n  counterparts.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There are additionally what's called \"memory mapped registers\" which basically means those registers are accessed through memory operations instead of designated instructions. They can be, depending on your definition, countered as registers. One such example is the \"APIC Registers\" described in section 16.3.2 of the AMD64\n </p>\n <p>\n  There are even internal registers that are not exposed through the instruction set but are used for performance reasons.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
