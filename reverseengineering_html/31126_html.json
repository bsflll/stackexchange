There are many such resources;\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/libvmi/libvmi/blob/master/notes/pe.txt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here's one\n  </a>\n  . Specifically, you're going to want to locate the\n  <code>\n   IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER\n  </code>\n  structures, and then consult their\n  <code>\n   VirtualAddress\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   SizeOfRawData\n  </code>\n  fields. You can identify the\n  <code>\n   .text\n  </code>\n  section either through the\n  <code>\n   Name\n  </code>\n  field, or by checking the\n  <code>\n   Characteristics\n  </code>\n  field for the\n  <code>\n   IMAGE_SCN_CNT_CODE\n  </code>\n  bit.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
