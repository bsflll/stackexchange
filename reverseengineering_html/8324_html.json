When a breakpoint is hit, i'd like to know what called 'A' in the first place. Is there something like a function call stack?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have found 'debugger->tracing->stack trace' option, but when i press it after breakpoint is hit, it only shows this, which doesnt make any sense:\n  <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pHQbr.png\"/>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Sometimes it helps to single-step a few instructions. Also, when you're certain you're at the very first instruction in the function, check the top of the stack (the dword at [esp/rsp], depending on whether you're on 32 bit or 64 bit) for the return address. If your assembly code wasn't produced by a compiler, and uses a nonstandard way of handling the stack, this might be the only way.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
