I had a similar situation for an android game which killed it self the moment it detected debuggers. What I did was, catch syscall\n  <code>\n   kill()\n  </code>\n  and find the instruction which caused it and then changed the condition that caused the call to\n  <code>\n   kill()\n  </code>\n  function. You could do a similar approach but when doing that I used\n  <code>\n   gdb\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
