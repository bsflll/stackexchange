But there's a myriad of ways to hide and obfuscate facts. So while - in principle - what you're asking is possible, it's going to be tough to be certain that you caught all of the possible parameters. Specifically because on Windows there exist a multitude of ways to fetch the command line arguments at any time. So this is a bit of a broad question.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
