When i opened the program there were multiple icons sizes, but when i tried to replace one icon, it generated multiple icons of a single ico file. After that, it looked like the exe icon has been  changed, but only in the file manager, When i opened the programs, the icon on the window and taskbar was not changed. Why is this and how can i change it?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

When an icon is loaded the best fitting image is loaded, depending on the size and color depth. Therefore if you only modify one icon image it can happen that the other images are still shown at different positions in the application.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
