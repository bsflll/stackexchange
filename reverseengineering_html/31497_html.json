BTW: \"JS\" means JavaScript but the posted code is Java not JavaScript which is a major difference. Please edit your question and write a full question including more details about what you want to hook, a J2SE application, and Android app? Also Stackexchange is a not a script writing service, what have you tried, ho far did you got? If you are unsure how to hook a method, use Jadx-Gui, select the method and let it generate the frida code snippet for you and place it in your Frida script.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
