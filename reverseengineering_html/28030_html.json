This might be related for some protections? I'm new to RE and to IDA. I did not yet analyze deeply the routines before the\n  <code>\n   int 2Dh\n  </code>\n  anti-debug technique.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The view during static analysis is:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/juuW4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/juuW4.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The view during debug is:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/k0GWi.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/k0GWi.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  As you may notice, the original\n  <code>\n   int 2Dh\n  </code>\n  command has been reverted.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
