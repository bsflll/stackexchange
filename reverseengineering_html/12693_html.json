I'm interested to find its network traffic but dynamic analysis is failing. Using IDA I'm able to identify network calls but when I try to reverse its caller using\n  <code>\n   x\n  </code>\n  shortcut after couple of callers I get stuck at this point:\n </p>\n <pre><code>.text:00407230                 dd offset sub_40600C\n.text:00407234                 dd offset sub_403C30\n.text:00407238                 dd offset nullsub_4\n.text:0040723C                 dd offset sub_40601C\n.text:00407240                 dd offset sub_4039BC\n.text:00407244                 dd offset sub_40C294\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I would like to ask how I can proceed further.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
