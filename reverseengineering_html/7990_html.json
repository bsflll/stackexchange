Are there any other writeups that you could point me to that discuss the RE'ing of a VM based obfuscation from scratch?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, is the source code for any VM based obfuscator available online?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

A forerunner of this work, which in retrospect I'm not all that happy with, was published in ACM CCS 11 [\n  <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2046739\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   link\n  </a>\n  ].\n </p>\n <p>\n  I don't know of source-code availability of any VM-based obfuscators.  There's a free system called Tigress, available (in binary form) from\n  <a href=\"http://tigress.cs.arizona.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://tigress.cs.arizona.edu/\n  </a>\n  , that performs virtualization at the C source-code level.  This system gives you a lot of control over a lot of the parameters of the obfuscator so you can experiment with different combinations of settings.  The FAQ explains the rationale for not distributing the source code.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
