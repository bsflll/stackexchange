    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I came across the following piece of 16-bit x86 code for multiplying a value by 40, using just shifts and additions:\n </p>\n <pre><code>; BX holds the value we want to multiply.\n; The result is stored in AX.\nMOV AX, BX\n\n; Multiply by 4 using two shifts\nSHL AX, 1\nSHL AX, 1\n\n; Add the original value, this gives us BX * 5\nADD AX, BX\n\n; Now multiply by 8 using three shifts for the final result\nSHL AX, 1\nSHL AX, 1\nSHL AX, 1\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now what I'd like to know is why this code uses multiple shifts in a row instead of just doing\n  <code>\n   SHL 2\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   SHL 3\n  </code>\n  . It was almost certainly written by hand, so I assume there was some speed benefit or something. Does anyone have any insights?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The code was written in 1991 and was targeting 286 and 386 class machines.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

On the 8086 only shifting/rotating by 1 or CL was possible.  So it is likely you have some 8086 code.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Perhaps SHL AX, 1 and SHL AX 3 deal with overflow differently? otherwise, I don't see a difference unless there is possible some speed difference.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
