            "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  The error you've received was probably thrown by either\n  <a href=\"https://www.oreans.com/themida.php\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   Themida\n  </a>\n  or\n  <a href=\"https://www.oreans.com/winlicense.php\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   WinLicense\n  </a>\n  , a well known protectors. I'd say here that fully bypass of both\n  <em>\n   Themida\n  </em>\n  and\n  <em>\n   WinLicense\n  </em>\n  are goals that are hard to reach for an inexperienced reverse engineer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Because it's the 3rd question you ask about this subject, and it seems like you are truly struggle with it, I'll show you a quick\n  <em>\n   step-by-step\n  </em>\n  tutorial of how to bypass\n  <code>\n   IsDebuggerPresent\n  </code>\n  on runtime, from inside IDA and avoid the pop-up message.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  First, let's create a small program which all it does will be to check whether it was executed inside a debugger or not:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <windows.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(){\n    if (IsDebuggerPresent()) {\n        printf(\"Debugger found\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Debugger not found\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  As you can see, the program only contains a\n  <code>\n   main()\n  </code>\n  function which will print \"\n  <em>\n   Debugger found\n  </em>\n  \" or \"\n  <em>\n   Debugger not found\n  </em>\n  \", depends on the result of\n  <code>\n   IsDebuggerPresent()\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Let's compile the program. I used\n  <a href=\"https://bellard.org/tcc/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   TinyCC\n  </a>\n  because it is less noisy than some of the other compilers. Basically you can use whatever C compiler for windows you wish.\n </p>\n <pre><code>./tcc.exe check_for_debugger.c\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now that we have an executable\n  <code>\n   .exe\n  </code>\n  file, let's execute it:\n </p>\n <pre><code>./check_for_debugger.exe\nDebugger not found\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  As expected, we ended up with \"\n  <em>\n   Debugger not found\n  </em>\n  \" printed to the console. Let's open the executable in IDA Pro. As you can see, the main function looks something like this (click on it to enlarge):\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/42Z96.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"main function\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/42Z96.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Let's execute it. You may want to put a breakpoint before the program exits but not before the message is printed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We can see that \"Debugger found\" was printed to the console.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now let's modify the result of\n  <code>\n   IsDebuggerPresent()\n  </code>\n  by changing the value of\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  just after the function was called. For this, we'll create a breakpoint in offset\n  <code>\n   0x0040100F\n  </code>\n  (in my program) which is where the result of\n  <code>\n   IsDebuggerPresent()\n  </code>\n  is checked by\n  <code>\n   test eax, eax\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Execute the program inside IDA. The program has stopped at our breakpoint on\n  <code>\n   test eax, eax\n  </code>\n  and we can see in the registers panel that\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  has non-zero value (in my case eax==1).\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NZfyX.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"eax=1\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NZfyX.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Let's right click on\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  and choose \"Zero value\", and immediately the value of\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  will changed to zero.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0sYVf.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0sYVf.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now let's continue the execution (don't forget the breakpoint before\n  <code>\n   exit()\n  </code>\n  in case you removed it for some reason). And as we wanted, the message \"\n  <em>\n   Debugger not found\n  </em>\n  \" is printed in the console.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Hope you understood how to bypass\n  <code>\n   IsDebuggerPresent\n  </code>\n  by modifying the value of\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  , now you can continue your reverse-engineering process.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
