We can see that it calls\n  <code>\n   StepOver\n  </code>\n  which is a method provided by TitanEngine.\n </p>\n <pre><code>CMDRESULT cbDebugRtr(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\n    StepOver((void*)cbRtrStep);\n    cbDebugRun(argc, argv);\n    return STATUS_CONTINUE;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  In the TitanEngine document the description of StepOver is described as follows :\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   StepOver function\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The StepOver traces code by single-stepping over calls. This tracing\n  function sets an INT3 breakpoint after the call, which is used to call\n  your callback. There is no guarantee that code execution will return\n  from that call, and thus no guarantee that your callback will ever be\n  called. The breakpoint is run only once, and is removed once your\n  callback has finished.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  TitanEngine is also open-source, here is the implementation of\n  <code>\n   StepOver\n  </code>\n  in\n  <code>\n   TitanEngine / TitanEngine.Debugger.Control.cpp\n  </code>\n </p>\n <pre><code>__declspec(dllexport) void TITCALL StepOver(LPVOID StepCallBack)\n{\n    ULONG_PTR ueCurrentPosition = GetContextData(UE_CIP);\n    unsigned char instr[16];\n    MemoryReadSafe(dbgProcessInformation.hProcess, (void*)ueCurrentPosition, instr, sizeof(instr), 0);\n    char* DisassembledString = (char*)StaticDisassembleEx(ueCurrentPosition, (LPVOID)instr);\n    if(strstr(DisassembledString, \"CALL\") || strstr(DisassembledString, \"REP\") || strstr(DisassembledString, \"PUSHF\"))\n    {\n        ueCurrentPosition += StaticLengthDisassemble((void*)instr);\n        SetBPX(ueCurrentPosition, UE_BREAKPOINT_TYPE_INT3 + UE_SINGLESHOOT, StepCallBack);\n    }\n    else\n        StepInto(StepCallBack);\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  After each step the callback function\n  <code>\n   cbRtrStep\n  </code>\n  is called which checks if the current instruction is a\n  <code>\n   RET\n  </code>\n  and if so the debugger is stopped. (\n  <code>\n   x64_dbg_dbg/debugger.cpp\n  </code>\n  )\n </p>\n <pre><code>void cbRtrStep()\n{\n    unsigned int cipch = getCIPch();\n    if(cipch == 0xC3 or cipch == 0xC2)\n        cbRtrFinalStep();\n    else\n        StepOver((void*)cbRtrStep);\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So, to sum up,\n  <kbd>\n   Ctrl\n  </kbd>\n  -\n  <kbd>\n   F9\n  </kbd>\n  is doing step-over until it encounters a\n  <code>\n   RET\n  </code>\n  instruction. If you press\n  <kbd>\n   F7\n  </kbd>\n  and\n  <kbd>\n   Ctrl\n  </kbd>\n  -\n  <kbd>\n   F9\n  </kbd>\n  the debugger will single-step the instructions of the function; the function you are calling might be doing debugger detection that is not triggered when setting a breakpoint after this function.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
