I've seen schemes like this where both parties have a hard-coded \"key\" that they pre-pend and/or append to the challenge, thus you still need the \"key\".  Could also be something like HMAC-SHA1 with a pre-shared key.  Probably need to get into the firmware on the 8-bit MCU to confirm.  One easy thing to try is take the challenge and try pre-pending a byte 00-FF, see if that works.  Also try appending 00-FF (one byte at a time).  That's only 512 tries, test against your data set.  Good luck!\n</span>\n</body></html>",

From your description it looks like you separated cells from BMS and after that made BMS work again using pin T. Did I get that right? Because some BMS refuse to work after you separate cells. I'm afraid to work on my battery because not sure I can get BMS work again after replacing cells. Thanks!\n</span>\n</body></html>",
