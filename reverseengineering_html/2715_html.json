    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'd like to write something using Python C-Types that hooks API calls and can be leveraged for unpacking executables. Currently my (Python with C-Types) code launches an executable in a suspended state then performs DLL injection using the\n  <code>\n   createremotethread\n  </code>\n  API. The DLL is loaded and the code is successfully executed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd like the injected code to patch the executable so that it hooks certain API calls.  Eventually I'd like to find code caves but I'm currently just allocating virtual memory (\n  <code>\n   virtualalloc\n  </code>\n  ).  I'd like to do this using just Python.  Is this possible?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I imagine since it can be done in C it can be accomplished using Python's C-Types.  In my research I've seen people use\n  <code>\n   DiStorm\n  </code>\n  for certain parts of this, but again  I'd like to use Python. I understand that this has been done before but I'd like to code something up as a learning exercise.  Looking for some direction and any guidance is welcomed.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

But it's a matter of taste. I.e. the injected DLL would do all the patching up, but be careful to avoid complications with the loader lock (i.e. don't use\n <code>\n  LoadLibrary\n </code>\n and friends within\n <code>\n  DllMain\n </code>\n ).\n</span>\n</body></html>",

The framework enables one to literally inspect every aspect of the running process by registering event handlers for BPs, memory executions/reads/writes, stack inspection, etc.. You can change whatever you want in the process you are debugging.\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     <a href=\"http://wikisecure.net/security/pydbg-an-installation-guide\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n      PyDBG installation\n     </a>\n     - it's a little bit old but can point you in the right direction.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     <a href=\"http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pydbg\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n      Pre-compiled installation for PyDBG\n     </a>\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"http://winappdbg.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    WinAppDbg\n   </a>\n   - python module allows developers to quickly code instrumentation scripts in Python under a Windows environment.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  By using the above tools you can write a general unpacker and if you find something more serious, there is no other way , other than do it manually and incorporate the knowledge into scripts. I've experience with the above tools for solving just the same problem you are trying to solve, and I can tell that those frameworks do a good job.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a start you can BP all memory allocation, protections changing and freeing APIs and inspect those buffers - (\n  <em>\n   VirtualAlloc(Ex), VirtualFree, VirtualProtect\n  </em>\n  ). In addition, add\n  <em>\n   WriteProcessMemory\n  </em>\n  and inspect buffer that just to be written to other processes (in case of malware). For more advanced packers you can also inspect *UnmapViewOfSection APIs too.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
