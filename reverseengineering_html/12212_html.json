I have tried altering the smali code as explained here:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://blog.dewhurstsecurity.com/2015/11/10/mobile-security-certificate-pining.html\">\n   http://blog.dewhurstsecurity.com/2015/11/10/mobile-security-certificate-pining.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was able to view two requests (one of which is shown in the last screenshot of the provided link), however the app seems to apply some other protection mecanism because when trying to login to an account, it gives an error message saying: \"ssl3_get_server_certificate certificate verify failed\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have tried every public tutorial I could find online to no avail, I would appreciate any input on how to do this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd also be happy to provide the decompiled source code, apk, and the modified apk if needed.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

According to JustTrustMe explanation on github, it should have worked, so I'm assuming there is a custom pinning functionality implemented.  Thanks for your suggestion, I will try and make time to study this. If you have any book/tutorial recommendations to get me started please let me know.</span>",
