I took all of your samples and sorted them into the order you posted them (from top to bottom).  I then decoded the 8-byte strings starting from byte 11 of each sample as a double in IEEE format and then dumped the floating-point number in text form.  (I wrote a quick C++ program, but one could do that with many other methods.)  I then put those into a spreadsheet (I used Libre Office, but one could also use Excel) to interpret them as Microsoft's 64-bit OLE date formats which are number of seconds from 30 December 1899 0:00:00 and got the following (mm/dd/yyyy format):\n </p>\n <pre><code>01/05/2014 00:35:48 41644.02486\n01/05/2014 01:21:34 41644.05664\n01/05/2014 01:22:25 41644.05723\n01/05/2014 01:25:32 41644.0594\n01/05/2014 15:22:37 41644.64071\n01/05/2014 15:24:14 41644.64183\n01/05/2014 15:24:36 41644.64208\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  It looks like the last three samples were sequentially created within two minutes, which makes sense to me.  So they are indeed dates, but not the ones you think they are.  Look elsewhere for changes in the file for 8-byte sequences ending with 0x40.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
