    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I tried Javascript scripting on WinDbg (TTD specifically); but even in simple example I get error\n  <code>\n   Unable to get property 'Debugger' of undefined or null reference\n  </code>\n  .\nLine was simply\n  <code>\n   var ctl = host.namespace.Debugger.Utility.Control;\n  </code>\n  but it does not work.\nDoes TTD have Debugger property? I cannot find any specific document about scripting for TTD; so I assume they have the same interface with regular session. How can we send commands to debugger from a script in TTD sessions?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So if that line is in your initializeScript function or one that is called from initializeScript namespace doesn't exist yet.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
