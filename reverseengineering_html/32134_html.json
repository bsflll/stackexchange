You can lookup run length encoding in TGA image files for a code example. But personally I would first check if it's LZ4 since that uses RLE. You will likely need to use the LZ4 api if so. I would write a for loop that attempts to LZ4 inflate at offset 0,1,2,3,... and see if any complete without error and have an expected size.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
