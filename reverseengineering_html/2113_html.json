I know that unlike windows libraries, libraries in Linux and Mac still have their symbols (function names and parameters).\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   API Monitor\n  </a>\n  allows you hook exported functions from other libraries but only for windows, which is somewhat of what I need.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Basically I want to hook certain functions in either Linux or mac and see their parameters and order of calls.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any help is appreciated!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
