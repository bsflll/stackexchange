    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am currently learning RE and I came upon this piece of code which made me question whether  stack frames grow upward:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0x080483f4 <main+0>:    push   ebp\n0x080483f5 <main+1>:    mov    ebp,esp\n0x080483f7 <main+3>:    and    esp,0xfffffff0\n0x080483fa <main+6>:    sub    esp,0x60\n0x080483fd <main+9>:    mov    DWORD PTR [esp+0x5c],0x0\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So I understand that from\n  <code>\n   <main+0>\n  </code>\n  until\n  <code>\n   <main+6>\n  </code>\n  , we're setting up the stack frame. Being that the stack grows downwards, it makes sense that we\n  <code>\n   sub esp,0x60\n  </code>\n  thereby allocating 96 bytes for the main function's stack frame.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My confusion/doubts, however start on\n  <code>\n   <main+9>\n  </code>\n  <code>\n   mov    DWORD PTR [esp+0x5c],0x0\n  </code>\n  which from what I understood stores the value\n  <code>\n   0\n  </code>\n  in a location 4 bytes above the stack pointer and we know that the stack grows downwards, but this operation seems to indicate that the data in the stack frame is stored bottom up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So my question is, does that mean that while the stack as a whole grows downwards individual stack frames actually grow upwards?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Say two variables 'a' and 'b' are created which one will be closer to the stack pointer the first or the second variable?</span>",
