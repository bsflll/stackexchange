    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am new to reverse engineering and I was trying to debug why a 3rd party application was crashing when I m injecting my DLL in it. (There are some cases where it didn't crash)\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I was able to figure out from a set of instructions/subroutine where the application was throwing an error. There is was able to figure out that it was probably getting a null pointer for some TLS value.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is my question w.r.t to this problem\nI want to break/notify my debugger whenever a value is getting changed at that given TLS slot.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'll add the ASM to make better sense, This is the disassembly of kernel32!TlsGetValue. I want to watch the TLS slots for the given thread. To put it in simple words I want to add watcher for\n  <strong>\n   GS:[0x1480]\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does anyone have any idea how to do it x64dbg?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZzTXw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZzTXw.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
