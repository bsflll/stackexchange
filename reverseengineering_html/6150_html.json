If it's\n  <code>\n   P-Code\n  </code>\n  , I cannot help. If it's native, what you need to do is known as differential debugging. You can do it without using plugins or external tools\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/tutorials/replayer/trace_replayer.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   directly from IDA\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  If by any chance you're running an old version of IDA that lacks that support, you can use\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/joxeankoret/mynav\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   MyNav\n  </a>\n  , a tool I wrote for doing differential debugging as a replacement for\n  <a href=\"https://www.zynamics.com/binnavi.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   BinNavi\n  </a>\n  , a tool that you might be able to use if your target is a 32 bits one.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You might also want to take a look to this question:\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2565/trace-assisted-code-identification\">\n   Trace assisted code identification?\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
