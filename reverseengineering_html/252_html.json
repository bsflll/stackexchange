That way you can see straight away if the compiler embedded any strings as hints. You should also consider that some languages use C as an intermediate language. An example of that would be\n  <a href=\"http://www.netlib.org/f2c/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   f2c\n  </a>\n  a Fortran 77 to C compliler. It appears that f2c also links a support library so you would look for that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As far as determinining which libraries are used on linux you can use the\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5554343/understanding-ldd-output\">\n   ldd command\n  </a>\n  for dynamic binaries and\n  <a href=\"http://cboard.cprogramming.com/linux-programming/71132-static-library-how-do-i-list.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   nm for static ones\n  </a>\n  to dump the symbols.

That aside, even in the <code>f2c</code> case you can probably see spot patterns used by the converter to represent Fortran concepts or convert from Fortran to C conventions.</span>",
