The code was obfuscated but I found out how the Bluetooth protocol works.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, the app use the Android NDK to call a native (armeabi) library that calculates data like body fat percentage from the data sent from the scale (weight, impedance...): libBodyfat.so\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know what all the parameters are and what the C-functions return, but I don't know how they do it (what calculations are done).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Apparently it's not possible to create readable code from a C library the way it's possible with Java. I found some tools that were recommended to work with C binaries (e.g. IDA) but they don't work with ARM binaries.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What can I do to understand how the library works?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
