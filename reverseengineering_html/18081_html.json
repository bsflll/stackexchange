However, when I use Scylla to try to fix the import table of the dumped .exe I get some invalid/missing results, and I couldn't find any information on how to determine the correct function to assign. I tried running the tool Universal Import Fixer, which seems to fix all the invalid imports but I would be unable to fix my dumped file. Any help would be appreciated!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is a screenshot of what I see:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/elqud.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/elqud.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
