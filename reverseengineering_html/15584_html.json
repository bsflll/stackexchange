I currently document routines statically then do dynamic and break on thread creation.  I see other people navigate large binaries in a third of the time to do things like figure out file formats and crypto keys across dozens of threads.</span>",

There are scripts and plugins for IDA for detecting usual encryption methods, you can find some known APIs to try determine what is it doing, etc... But is not enough, usually.</span>",

It seems there are more efficient methods than static documenting then doing runtime and referencing notes on thread and buffer BP  I'm not a fan of the sandbox logging method a lot of malware researchers use.. It's worthless for learning file formats or static encryption..</span>",
