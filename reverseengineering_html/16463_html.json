    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  While reverse engineering an iPhone app remotely, I set up breakpoints to some function's adresses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  These adresses comes from the disassembled binary analysed with Hopper, and it seems like they\n  <strong>\n   must\n  </strong>\n  be called by the app. Like\n  <code>\n   user_click_on_blue_buton\n  </code>\n  , or equivalent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I checked that the breakpoint are set up correctly:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   none is in pending state,\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   all have the flag resolved to true:\n   <code>\n    resolved = 1\n   </code>\n   ,\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   and the disassembled code at these addresses is the same as in the binary statically analysed with Hopper.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  But then, when I click on the blue button, lldb does not stop at breakpoint. The process continues like there was no breakpoints. To be exact, some are working, but just a few, not all of them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is it possible that lldb misses the breakpoint ? Or is it because the app is tricking me and these functions are not called ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Obviously the app is a released iOS app from the app store. So definitely not compiled to be debugged. Is it the reason ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It's not because a function is named\n  <code>\n   user_click_on_blue_button\n  </code>\n  that it will be called when the user click on the blue button. Another function, with a less obvious name, was used instead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can't find my previous account, so using a new one.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
