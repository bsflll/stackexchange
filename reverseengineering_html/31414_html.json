So I'm not sure I totally agree with your assessment; even though I certainly would expect this to be fixed eventually. Have you contacted Hex-Rays?\n</span>\n</body></html>",

You can use Export Data (\n  <kbd>\n   Shift-E\n  </kbd>\n  ) to get the selection in different formats, including as a structure instance (if you have a struct defined):\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://hex-rays.com/blog/igors-tip-of-the-week-39-export-data/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://hex-rays.com/blog/igors-tip-of-the-week-39-export-data/\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
