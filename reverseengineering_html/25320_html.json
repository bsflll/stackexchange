I found and populated a 20-pin header:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mfRh0.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"ARM JTAG 20-pin header\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mfRh0.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  but JTAGulator doesn't think it has a valid combination of TDI/TDO/TMS/TCK on either a IDCode or bypass scan. I put a logic analyzer on it and don't really see a steady clock:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HIEoZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"logic analyzer 20-pin jtag\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HIEoZ.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is it possible the clock is elsewhere and some of the header pins are still TDI/TDO etc., or do any of the logic analyzer data seem they could be from JTAG?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
