But before I endorse into such a costly purchase I ask the following question(s):\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   If I have native IDA Pro on Linux, can it disassemble/decompile a Windows PE (or Mac OS X apps as a bonus)?\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   If not, when I multi boot Windows, can I download the Windows version of IDA on the Windows without purchasing it again?\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <h1>\n  Motive\n </h1>\n <p>\n  Some renowned programs I'd like to reverse (for fun) are Windows executables, so if it can't disassemble a Windows executable from Linux, I'll have to multi boot (tedious)\n </p>\n <h1>\n  Note\n </h1>\n <p>\n  If it helps, I have a 32-bit machine with a x86 processor\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

There are .pdf forms that break out the pricing for IDA/IDA Pro. You must purchase the Linux and Windows version separately. As far as I understand, the disassemblers for IDA/IDA Pro are the same across platforms. You can see the differences in included disassemblers per edition\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/processors.shtml#starter\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  . As one of the other answers to this question has pointed out, some of the integrated debuggers are not included on non-Windows versions.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

IDA uses some Microsoft dll's for parsing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another point:\nAs IDA is a 32bit application (even the 64bit disassembler) you always have to use remote debuggers for handling 64bit applications.\n </p>\n <p>\n  IDA works well for me with Wine under Linux.
