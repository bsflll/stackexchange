The dialog shown will allow you to select the register, the offset delta to add to the displacement, and the struct you want to apply.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The dialog does some preparation work/struct analysis before showing up. If you have a large selection or a lot of structures it can take a while to appear, you just need to be patient. When you change the register/delta inside the dialog, the analysis needs to be updated, which again takes time. Placing the selection cursor over an occurrence of the register you want to change\n  <em>\n   before\n  </em>\n  calling up the dialog is a good idea.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
