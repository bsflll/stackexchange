    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've always been more knowledgeable about binary reversing -- x86/x64 type stuff -- so lately I decided I wanted to try reversing some flash.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Used SoThink to get the .AS from a SWF, but the SWF is pulling data from a server. It's then de-obfuscating that data and .loadBytes'ing it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've made a file of the de-obfuscated data (via FileReference.save()), but it isn't a valid, stand-alone flash file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How do I go about decompiling this dynamically-loaded flash byte array, or at least transforming it into something I can work with?\n </p>\n <p>\n  EDIT for clarity:\n </p>\n <pre>\nvar foo = new Loader(); // Is later addChild'ed  \nvar bar:LoaderContext = new LoaderContext(false, ApplicationDomain.currentDomain);\n\nfoo.contentLoaderInfo.parameters.parent = this;\nfoo.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, fooFunc);\nfoo.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(\"securityError\", this.onSecurityError);\nfoo.loadBytes(someByteArray, bar); // 'someByteArray' is the deobfuscated stuff from server\n</pre>\n <p>\n  In the above situation, the 'fooFunc' is never called, but based on the comments/feedback provided, it appears as though the file has already been fully loaded once 'fooFunc' happens.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This leads me to believe that 'someByteArray' is binary data that is loaded dynamically into the swf, but the 'someByteArray' data is not valid SWF, if that makes sense.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I don't have enough experience with Flash to have immediately known a Loader().loadBytes() with a data type of \"data.BINARY\" was necessarily going to be a Flash file (as opposed to some form of assembly).\n </p>\n <p>\n  The file was obfuscated with an encryption scheme. The key was hardcoded.\n  <strong>\n   Turns out I typoed the key when I went to de-obfuscate the file.\n  </strong>\n  9 hours of racking my brain later, I start over from scratch, mark the correct key, and voila:\n  <strong>\n   my de-obfuscated file was a standard .SWF.\n  </strong>\n  I decompiled it normally.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks for those who tried to help. Unfortunate that it turned out to be a false lead.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
