    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I want to know whether there is any way to understand program by reading through lines of assembly produced by OllyDBG?\n  \n\n  Is it really logical and normal thing to do? For instance, for understanding  how the malwares or viruses inject DLL into specific programs to change the way they execute by loading their own functions, is it a normal practice to read line by line? Are there any resources available to teach how to read such instructions and understand the program line by line? I have seen several RE tutorials. But most of the time, the guy would go through and look for specific instructions to manipulate and does not care about how the other areas of the program function.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
