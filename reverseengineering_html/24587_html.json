    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I want to debug & reverse engineer open source code such as\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   this project\n  </a>\n  . I usually use CLion to write and debug C code on Linux. I've also used GDB. What steps do I need to take to download a library like this example, and be able to get source-code-level debugging working? I've tried for example cloning that repo and opening it in CLion, but it seems that the build system that is used is not fully understood by CLion. If I do a\n  <code>\n   make && make install\n  </code>\n  , the project gets built and I have the binaries, but then I cannot get source-level debugging if I say, open the binary with gdb. Are there any techniques to get into an open source repo and get the code building in an IDE or debugging system?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You only really need -g. Barring quirks in the build system these are universal when compiling with GCC, and generally you want to edit / override CCFLAGS and LDFLAGS to set these, and check they aren't stripped (<code>strip</code>) after linking.</span>",

If you're using someone else's binary e.g. a library from your linux distro then they will have often built the debug symbols but not put them in the main package; check for specific debuginfo packages you can download an install too to debug into their binaries.</span>",
