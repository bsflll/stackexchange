An amount of 500-600 files would be great.\nWhile there are plenty of websites where you can download malware, I have not found one where you may download a big amount of non malicious executables.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Do you have some ideas where I could obtain such a big amount of Portable Executables which are not malicious?\nThank you in advance!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

That is why it is technical too and I believe that it is changing with the same pace as malware stuff.

They have the option to automate installation of setups and also keep the dropped files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can go to download.com or softpedia.com and download a large amount of setups/installers(crawler is suggested), put them in a folder and run an automatic analysis on them. You will get a list of folders with each analysis where you can search for *.exe, *.dll, etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suggestion: as some setups come bundled with toolbars, adware, etc, I suggest running a virustotal scan for all the files you obtain in order to have 100% clean set.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If it's an academic project, they might provide to you. Except them, I don't know who else might have such lists of safe PEs.</span>",
