Ideally I would write parts of the assembly or the entire thing and IDA would try to generate the C code for it. I don't have the binary, just pictures of various small programs (all linux x86). Also don't have any code segments etc (only the picture to guide me).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Right now I only know how to generate C code if I have the compiled binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am using IDA Pro + Decompiler.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
