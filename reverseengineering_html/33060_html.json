Here's what I did:\n </p>\n <p>\n  I created a custom\n  <code>\n   Struct\n  </code>\n  in Ghidra, let's call it\n  <code>\n   MyClass\n  </code>\n  , and set up a member at its offset 0x28, as my custom function, let's call it\n  <code>\n   MyFunc\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   MyFunc\n  </code>\n  was defined as such:\n </p>\n <pre><code>NTSTATUS MyFunc(MyClass * this, DWORD wnf_paraM1, bool bUpdateUI)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/M6zFGYIp.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/M6zFGYIp.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  And even though it made the Assembly code above more readable, the call through the CFG shim still wasn't showing the function parameters:\n </p>\n <pre><code>if ((pVars->paraM1 == 0) ||\n   (lVar9 = (*(pMyClass)->\n              MyFunc)(), -1 < lVar9)) goto LAB_18001be80;\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Any idea how to make it work with the CFG shims?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
