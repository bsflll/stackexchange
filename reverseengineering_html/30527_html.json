In doing so, if you didn't already have the key their $50,000 machines become paperweights.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The key to unlock their driver takes information and exports it, then you send it to the company which they send back a different\n  <code>\n   .xuk\n  </code>\n  file which you import and it unlocks the driver.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have both the before and after\n  <code>\n   .xuk\n  </code>\n  files and can open them in a hex editor, but I don't know how to read it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This is equivalent to learning a language by just looking at some pages from a book with unknown content. A more realistic way is to disassemble the program theat reads and processes those files. Even if this code is obfuscated and equipped with anti-reverseengineering techniques it will be much more simple to reverse the code than just the files.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
