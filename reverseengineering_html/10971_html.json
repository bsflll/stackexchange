From this SO\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19072897/xamarin-android-does-native-code-compilation-make-reverse-engineering-harder\">\n   post\n  </a>\n  it appears they are actually .NET IL binaries (not native machine code). However, this other SO\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/4624/how-do-i-reverse-engineer-so-files-found-in-android-apks\">\n   post\n  </a>\n  on Android NDK development appears to contradict this. In the apk file, there is a lib/armebi folder and a lib/x86 folder. Is it possible for .NET to be compiled to ARM format? If that is possible, it appears that x86 based .NET decompilers like ILSpy cannot handle ARM code too. Is there a better solution?\n </p>\n <p>\n  EDIT: I know Hopper and IDA Pro works with ARM mode, but we get assembly instead of .NET code.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

(like the DLL file containing the  author's code may not be named in packages such as com.mycompany.MyApp as with the Java classes in classes.dex) Furthermore, there are a sizable number of third-party Xamarin extensions too.</span>",
