Am I on the right path?\n </p>\n <p>\n  (\n  <strong>\n   Edit: I moved my .idb, idc and batch file to another directory and now my .idb file is being rewritten each time I launch the command instead...)\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I think my  file which is a .idc is correct:\n </p>\n <pre><code>    #include <idc.idc>\n\n    static main()\n    {\n         Batch(0);\n        Wait();\n        Exit(1 - RunPlugin(\"zynamics_binexport_8\", 2));\n    }\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
