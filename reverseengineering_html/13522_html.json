They were abundant, but all seem to perform extremely specialized functions and I have doubts about how well they would represent legitimate programs in the real world\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     Finding and downloading programs manually.\n    </strong>\n    This would be extremely slow and tedious, and also ineffective to get large numbers of such programs.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I suppose what would be ideal for my situation is a sort of program dump, but I'm not aware of any that exist.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As someone unaffiliated with any organisation, is there an effective way of getting a large number of public normal programs for the purpose of comparing their features to a set of malicious programs?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
