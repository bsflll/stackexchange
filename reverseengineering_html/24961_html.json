    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  On my nougat device, I have downloaded an app from the playstore, which is running great. I then extracted the apk from the installed app, and uninstalled it and again successfully, with the package installer. But the second time on app launch, it crashed. I have analysed both installation with apk analyzer. First one shows com.android.vending as installer and the application source as \"Google Play\". Sideload installation shows com.google.android.packageinstaller and source Unkown.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My first thought is that developer doesn't want users to install the app from unknown sources to avoid MOD app or pirate release, etc., and is checking programmatically for this parameter. I have decompiled to Java but didn't find any clue where such a condition is begin checked and exception generated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is a permission BIND_GET_INSTALL_REFERRER_SERVICE, maybe its causing a crash. I know how to decompile and do some smali editing and already changed verifyinstallation method to true in Smali but the app still crashes.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Its not related to licensing because its not paid app. Your link article saying   \"Google Play considers a user to be licensed if the user is a recorded purchaser of the application\". its free with inapp purchase and anyone can install and use it. Installing same apk after successfull installatiin fail to run as expected. I think app has some installation source checking routine and then generating exception. App is <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inscode.autoclicker\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inscode.autoclicker</a></span>",
