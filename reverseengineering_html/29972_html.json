This is the same in your case, meaning that receiver identifies the transmitted code, not the sender specifies the unit that is addressed with an action.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Looking at you full data stream, I can see that it is pulse length coded. I think your interpretation of semantic is guiding you the wrong direction at the moment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What is the real physical length of a \"1\" and \"0\"? Is their length exactly the same? I can see only \"1\", \"0\" and \"00000\", so 3 different time lengths, is this correct?\n </p>\n <p>\n  What device has been used for capturing the stream?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there anything known about your device?\nOOK on 433MHz is standard method, and a lot of codes had been identified and made public, by example\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433/tree/master/src/devices\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  . That will shorten the process if successful\n </p>\n <p>\n  Doing it the long way the transcoding of your bitstream and using above assumption (0=longLow, 1=shortHigh, 2=shortLow) gets:\n </p>\n <pre><code>..000101210121012101210121210121010121210121010121210121012101012121012101012121010121012101212101012101212101012101210121012101210000..\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This needs to be transcoded into data stream next to identify the \"0\" and \"1\" and identificationID of sender actions etc.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
