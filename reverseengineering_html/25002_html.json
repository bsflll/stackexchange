    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have taken a deep dive into reversing software with IDA, I used Ghidra before. I have already solved a couple of basic crackmes now I have targeted another one which's code is obfuscated, also has anti-debugging features and as far as I can understand it modifies its code during the the tls callbacks (at least thats what IDA indicated when stepping through the tls callbacks, there are 3 of them). I suspect the tls callbacks check for debuggers and also it unpacks the executable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I would like to ask a couple of questions in connection with this.\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    How would you go about reversing a code that is heavly obfuscated?\n(Lots of jumps and opaque predicates.) Maybe after the tls callbacks\nfinish the code is unpacked and some of the obfuscation is removed?\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    I have added breakpoints to the main debug checking functions from\nntdll.dll and kernel32.dll to see if they call any, I saw they had\nmultiple calls to ntqueryprocessinformation, I suspect they are\nquerying their own process?\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Also, if i want to read the memory of the application during runtime,\nI will need to find a way to bypass their anti debug features,\nmeaning I have to figure out what they are doing with the tls\ncallbacks and also from the entry point of the PE?\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I am looking for any general or specific guidelines you guys can throw me, in order to defeat their obfuscation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
