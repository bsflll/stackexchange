I'd assume the assembly modifies r1 somewhere, which makes it different from a2, so the decompiler chooses to create a different variable name for it instead of producing a (possibly confusing) assignment to a2.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If your function calls other functions, it will even need to overwrite r0..r3 (depending on the number of arguments to that function), so most code i've seen saves the arguments to the stack, or some other register. If your r1 doesn't get saved anywhere (because it's just needed at the start of your function and never again), this might be the reason why the decompiler doesn't want to assign a variable name, as well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To get a definite answer, i think you'd have to ask your question on the hex-rays forum and include the disassembled code, they tend to have excellent support there.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
