    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm reversing a C++ program using IDA PRO to examine how the some data is stored, encrypted and decrypted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've managed to identify the data is encrypted with AES CBC 16 block and 256 bit key. I have tested this as I have found the generated key in the program and managed to decrypt the data using online tools.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The problem I have is working out how the AES 256 bit key is generated. I have identified the code but is several hundered lines long. I \"think\" its a cut n copy of one of the hash functions from OpenSSL as I see references to that in other areas of the code but I cant be 100% sure.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There isn't much to go on in the code except a few magic numbers like 0x2AAAAAAB and that 3 DWORDS are pushed to the stack before the sub is called.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've downloaded the OpenSSL code but cant find anything yet. I've also used tools like Detect it Easy and a Plugin for IDA, which finds some crypto signatures which I BP, but they are never hit when stepping over the keygen function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can anyone recommend anything what can help which this ? My ASM skills are no where near good enough to Single Step several hundreds of instructions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  EDIT: I used the Hex Rays decomplier for the specific func and it churned out only a few lines of code !?!\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've put it on paste bin at:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/y6Zu42Ux\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://pastebin.com/y6Zu42Ux\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can anyone explain what it does ? However I'm not even sure this is the correct code as no matter where I press F5 to generate the Pseudo Code, it gives me the same output.\n </p>\n <p>\n  EDIT: here is the paste of the full code\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/x0pjyuZD\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://pastebin.com/x0pjyuZD\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
