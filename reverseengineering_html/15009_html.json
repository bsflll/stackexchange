But now I want to use WinDbg for scripting and when I try to set the same breakpoint, I get no breaks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In OllyDbg, the following breakpoint gets me exactly what I want:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   Address=75B0C4FA |  Module=KERNELBA | Active=Always | Disassembly=CMP EAX,103\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  But when I try to set a breakpoint in WinDbg , it never comes back with anything:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   bp 75b0c4fa\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  According to\n  <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff538903(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   the MS Dev Center documentation\n  </a>\n  for the\n  <code>\n   bp\n  </code>\n  command, I should be able to reference addresses specifically, but in my searching, most people are using\n  <code>\n   bp\n  </code>\n  to reference API calls, such as\n  <code>\n   bp ReadFile\n  </code>\n  (which does break as expected).\n </p>\n <p>\n  My questions: is it possible to use the breakpoint (75B0C4FA) using WinDbg?\nAnd if so, what am I missing in terms of adapting the address I have to make it work in Windbg? \nDoes it have to do with\n  <code>\n   bp ReadFile\n  </code>\n  accessing the ReadFile API calls for the main process, while with my breakpoint, it is trying to put breaks into sub module?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Now in windbg find where kernelbase is loaded. Ssy 58xxxxxx. Add the 01xxxxx to this base address. And  set bp viz 58xxxxx + 01xxxxx = 59xxxxx\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bp 59xxxxxx.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Read about rva aslr loadaddress etc to get a hang of this\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

One thing I don't understand is this \"viz\" when I googled for it, it was mostly other responses from you on stack overflow, etc... Can you explain that? Thank you!</span>",

The abbreviation viz. (or viz without a full stop), short for the Latin videlicet, is used as a synonym for \"namely\", \"that is to say\", \"to wit\", or \"as follows\". It is typically used to introduce examples or further details to illustrate a point.[1]</span>",
