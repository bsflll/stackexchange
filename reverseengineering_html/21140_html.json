In IDA help (press\n  <code>\n   F1\n  </code>\n  ), under the\n  <code>\n   Problems List\n  </code>\n  header you have the list of possible problems encountered during analysis. In your case it seems to be\n  <code>\n   BADSTACK\n  </code>\n  , which means:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   The value of the stack pointer at the end of the function is different\n          from its value at the start of the function. [...] The most probable cause is that stack tracing has failed.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  You will see each line causing this problem in the\n  <code>\n   List of problems\n  </code>\n  window.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The description how to fix this problem is included in the IDA help as well, below the problem description.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
