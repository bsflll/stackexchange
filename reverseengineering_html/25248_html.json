In the current version (6) that file is an\n  <code>\n   sqlite3\n  </code>\n  database. You can find some of the information you're looking for in the tables in that database-- specifically, the\n  <code>\n   functions\n  </code>\n  table contains the number of basic blocks and edges.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since you're using IDA, I also recommend you check out\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/TakahiroHaruyama/ida_haru/blob/master/bindiff/bindiff.py\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   ida_haru\n  </a>\n  , it may also export some of the information you're looking for.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
