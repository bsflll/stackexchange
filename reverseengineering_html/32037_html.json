    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Normally in CLI apps you can use\n  <code>\n   Ctrl + c\n  </code>\n  /\n  <code>\n   Ctrl + d\n  </code>\n  to terminate/exit, but they don't seem to do anything in\n  <code>\n   r2\n  </code>\n  - at least not in debugger's\n  <code>\n   v\n  </code>\n  (visual) mode, which is how I use it. To exit, I press\n  <code>\n   q\n  </code>\n  , then type \"exit\", and have to press\n  <code>\n   y\n  </code>\n  twice to confirm quitting and killing the process, which is quite tedious.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is it possible to terminate a visual debugging session and exit\n  <code>\n   r2\n  </code>\n  with a single key combination ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
