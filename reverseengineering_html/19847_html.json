That is you want to know what all changed in the process address space after you step over the call to\n  <code>\n   test.test()\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I hope you understand anything can change anywhere when you step over a single unknown arbitrary function over the whole process memory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example,\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    A global variable may be modified  which would normally reside in the writable section of a binary.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Stack contents may be modified.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    A third / nth module/s  may be loaded and  whole blocks of memory may be added which didn't exist prior to executing the function.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  etc ..... etc ....\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can't reliably look for what changed between one single step of a function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  x64dbg on the trace window provides you what changed on each execution,  you have to scroll and look what changed for each instruction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or, if you can limit your lookup to a certain memory range you can dump the memory to a file and diff them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  x64dbg provides you one command to save a block of memory\n </p>\n <pre><code>savedata :memdump: , 0x400000 , 0x1000  \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  or for that matter all debugger will provide you a mechanism to dump raw data at some address of some size to a file.\n </p>\n <pre><code>windbg .writemem \nida makesnapshot\nollydbg binary -> backup  or dump in memory map gui\nx64dbg savedata (scriptcommand) or dumpmem in GUI memory map\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  You can use a hexeditor like hxd to byte compare two dumps for looking at all changes to a certain region of memory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As a real world example you can set a breakpoint as you have set in the specific code on the screenshot.
