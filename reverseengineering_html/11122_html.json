    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am new to reverse engineering so this seems like a very basic issue, and still I was not able to find an answer to it myself yet. Hopefully someone can point me in the right direction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am on Windows, I disassembled an exe file using \"PE Explorer\". For now, my process was to somehow, mostly by trial and error, identify the machine code steps I want to change in the dissasembly, then make the necessary change by opening the same exe in a hex editor, finding the same instruction and changing it there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  (Side note here: This two step process is quite inefficient. Is there a program you can recommend where I can combine both steps in one go, or at least side by side?)\n </p>\n <p>\n  While this has worked for me so far, I believe there must be a better way than doing this by trial and error and manually trying to identify the functions in the machine code. Is there? Particularly, is there a way to run a program (exe) and in parallel follow the steps in the dissasembly (ideally slowed down..)?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

As for my personal favorite, it depends on the requirements. For user-mode x86 debugging on Windows, I use OllyDbg. For user-mode x64 debugging on Windows, I use x64dbg. For kernel-mode debugging on Windows and for user-mode and kernel-mode debugging on non-Windows platforms, I use IDA Pro's debugger.</span>",
