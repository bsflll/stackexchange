Is this common or potentially something more sinister? Is the next best course of action to run reshack in a debugger and watch what happens?\n </p>\n <p>\n  UPDATE\n </p>\n <p>\n  I manually saved the potentially offending bitmap in question by right clicking and pressing 'save'. I will analyze the bitmap independently.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
