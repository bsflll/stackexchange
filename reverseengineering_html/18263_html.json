    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  So now we see that the Swedes are going large with their implantable chips which allow them to carry out certain kinds of transactions without using plastic.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/2145896/thousands-people-sweden-get-microchip-implants-new-way-life\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Thousands of people in Sweden get microchip implants for a new way of life\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Excerpt:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   It’s the size of a grain of rice but could hold the key to many\n  aspects of your life.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A tiny microchip inserted under the skin can replace the need to carry\n  keys, credit cards and train tickets.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   That might sound like an Orwellian nightmare to some but in Sweden it\n  is a welcome reality for a growing number who favour convenience over\n  concerns of potential personal data violations.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The small implants were first used in 2015 in Sweden – initially\n  confidentially – and several other countries.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Swedes have gone on to be very active in microchipping, with scant\n  debate about issues surrounding its use, in a country keen on new\n  technology and where the sharing of personal information is held up as\n  a sign of a transparent society.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Sweden’s SJ national railway company has won over some 130 users to\n  its microchip reservation service in a year.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Conductors scan passengers’ hands after they book tickets online and\n  register them on their chip. Sweden has a track record on the sharing\n  of personal information, which may have helped ease the microchip’s\n  acceptance among the Nordic country’s 10 million-strong population.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   My question is:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <h2>\n  How to read the information, then what information is stored in them?\n </h2>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   How do these microchips work?  Are they merely RFID units that store a single personal ID number?  Or is it something more complex, like a SIM card or Smartcard with some other kind of registration?\n  </strong>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
