But is there any way to read data that is modified through pass by reference. I am attempting to read some data in an iOS application that utilizes this scenario. These are also called inout parameters in Swift. This is the piece of code in Swift:\n </p>\n <pre><code>var pubKey, privKey: SecKey?\nlet status = SecKeyGeneratePair(parameters, &pubKey, &privKey)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Because SecKeyGeneratePair isnâ€™t really returning anything but rather modifying a variable by reference, I am unsure what to hook into.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The only problem is that you should modify them in onLeave but they are by default only present in onEnter. AFAIR you can save them to\n <code>\n  this.variablexyz\n </code>\n so that you can access them in onLeave (sorry I am not able to find a full example at the moment).\n</span>\n</body></html>",
