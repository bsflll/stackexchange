Do you need\n  <strong>\n   to be able to run\n  </strong>\n  this thing on 64bit and interact with it or is the objective\n  <strong>\n   to actually port it\n  </strong>\n  ?\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Run it\n </h2>\n <p>\n  If you only needed to run it and we can assume the compatibility libraries (those allowing to run 32bit programs on 64bit) as a given, you could probably intercept all kinds of functionality using the standard\n  <code>\n   ld.so\n  </code>\n  methods (\n  <a href=\"http://linux.die.net/man/8/ld.so\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <code>\n    LD_PRELOAD\n   </code>\n   and friends\n  </a>\n  ) as also outlined in answers to\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/185/how-do-i-add-functionality-to-an-existing-binary-executable\">\n   How do I add functionality to an existing binary executable?\n  </a>\n  Going from there you'd be able to interface with the existing and unchanged 32bit program by means of memory mapped files or sockets or really any kind of IPC mechanism that you deem suitable for the purpose.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Quite frankly this is likely the best method with the least effort to put in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On Debian 5 the compatibility layer is in the following two packages:\n </p>\n <pre><code>libc6-dev-i386 - Embedded GNU C Library: 32-bit development libraries for AMD64\nlibc6-i386 - Embedded GNU C Library: 32-bit shared libraries for AMD64\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The same name is used on Ubuntu 10.04 through 12.04. These are the only versions I could check at the moment, but I'm aware of similar stuff in RHEL/CentOS/ScientificLinux.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Port it\n </h2>\n <p>\n  Otherwise you'd run into a whole plethora of problems, the biggest of which were already outlined by\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/1695/245\">\n   ange albertini here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  In general, if you are lucky and it looks like that, the debug information (\n  <code>\n   not stripped\n  </code>\n  it says) will allow you to sort out names of source files, so you may be able to put puzzle pieces like libraries together and can then concentrate on the \"actual\" code. This may not be a big advantage, but for the reverse engineer every little straw helps.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Decompilers like the Hex-Rays plugin or the one that comes with Hopper could be a good way of getting a more high-level idea of the code. Still this will be a lot of work unless you focus on the functional parts that you need - which is why I (being lazy and all) would always go with the option above, i.e. running it in compatibility mode.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
