    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am trying to teach myself some ROP programming. And I have tried\nto do some training exploits from different sites. So, right now, I have this\nlittle application where GS, safeSEH ALSR and DEP are enabled (on application level not on OS). So, when I make an attempt to exploit this application it works pretty well (\n  <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/TdDR3W0y\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://pastebin.com/TdDR3W0y\n  </a>\n  ). It just pops\n  <code>\n   calc.exe\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  But, on the other side, when I enable OS level DEP, then my exploit generates a segfault and crashes the application.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, my question is what is the difference between application level DEP and OS level DEP ? Do, I have to make other/different function calls (instead to VirtualProc) when I try to circumvent DEP ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The likely reason why you are seeing segfaults is because the 0x7c801ad4 for VirtualAllocEx() probably moved between reboots, as a result of ASLR, but which is visible as a side-effect of enabling DEP and then rebooting.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
