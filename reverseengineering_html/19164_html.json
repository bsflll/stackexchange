Due to how\n  <code>\n   scanf\n  </code>\n  works with\n  <code>\n   %s\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  As per the C\n  <a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/scanf/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   reference sheet\n  </a>\n  ,\n  <a href=\"https://linux.die.net/man/3/scanf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   documentation\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanf_format_string\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   multiple sources\n  </a>\n  (seriously, google is full of scanf documentation pages describing that):\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   <code>\n    %s\n   </code>\n   : Scan a character string. The scan terminates at whitespace. A null character is stored at the end of the string, which means that the buffer supplied must be at least one character longer than the specified input length.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  scanf will immediately stop reading characters into a string denoted with\n  <code>\n   %s\n  </code>\n  once a whitespace character (space included, obviously) is encountered. Even if you manually enter the correct password by hand into your newly created executable you'll get the error message instead of the success.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Additionally,\n  <code>\n   gets\n  </code>\n  behaves the same when it comes to whitespaces.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   But you can solve the crackme by hand, it appears\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Although this appears not to be the behavior you experience in your program, for some unknown reason, this is still the behavior angr\n  <em>\n   assumes\n  </em>\n  when handling\n  <code>\n   scanf\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   scanf\n  </code>\n  -like library functions. It is perhaps not widely known that angr, to avoid path explosion at the first encounter of a string library function, does not \"natively\" handle those functions like any other encountered function. In favor of efficiency and speed, angr \"cheats\" around library functions, format string functions included.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For that purpose angr has its own\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/angr/angr/blob/master/angr/procedures/libc/scanf.py\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   scanf function implementation\n  </a>\n  in python, and that implementation follows the standard. You can see that\n  <code>\n   scanf\n  </code>\n  delimiters are\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/angr/angr/blob/master/angr/procedures/stubs/format_parser.py#L17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   defined\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/angr/angr/blob/master/angr/procedures/stubs/format_parser.py#L130\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   used\n  </a>\n  to delimit\n  <code>\n   scanf\n  </code>\n  s possible output. Issues with\n  <code>\n   scanf\n  </code>\n  are even documented in\n  <a href=\"https://docs.angr.io/docs/gotchas.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   angr's gotchas page\n  </a>\n  :\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   For example, our scanf implementation is not complete, but if you just need to support a single, known format string, you can write a hook to do exactly that.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  One way to avoid that is to modify the\n  <code>\n   scanf\n  </code>\n  implementation to something that does not consider whitespaces as delimiters. Another option is to disable that behavior by passing\n  <code>\n   exclude_sim_procedures_list=['scanf']\n  </code>\n  as argument to your\n  <code>\n   Project\n  </code>\n  . You could also, as the gotcha's page suggest, implement something specific for your scenario.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
