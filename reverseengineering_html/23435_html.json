I also think it must be some sequence, but I have extracted a long sequence of values ​​and I have tried to locate some pattern but I don't see it. I have tried to externally send the same signal as the PDA with the last byte with a fixed value of 90 and the mainboard responds with the data, the problem comes when I try to update some parameter on the main board, which does not work and must be where it enters I play the last byte</span>",

This makes me think random number generator, probably\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   LCG\n  </a>\n  or\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   XOR shifter\n  </a>\n  . In both cases the algorithm can be reverse engineered with enough data. And if it is an RNG it will\n  <em>\n   eventually\n  </em>\n  repeat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Interestingly except for the 05, all values are 230 plus something from 0 to 16 (inclusive!!) There could be a mod-17 going on somewhere.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Seen another way, they are all within 238 +- 8.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Why an RNG? Beats me. Theoretically you could work out how many packets have been sent since it was turned on by observing a sequence of them. A strange sort of sequence number.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you aren't always seeing the same sequence... could it be a time-delta (the time since the last reading?) to prevent clock drift or something. I don't know what the point would be, and it's strange that the same value never repeats twice in a row. But it might fit with the theory that it isn't known at checksum-time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Good luck...\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
