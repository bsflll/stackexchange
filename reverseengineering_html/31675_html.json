The C++ code itself is not important. It is important to decompile the project architecture and generate the appropriate header and cpp files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I really don't want to invent it myself. But, if there is no other choice - apparently - it will be necessary. Because already 3 projects are pending.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
