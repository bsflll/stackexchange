    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a VHDX file containing a single NTFS partition, when I mount this VHDX using Disk Management it's determined to be \"dirty\":\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UXDiQWED.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"There's a problem with this drive\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UXDiQWED.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I do indeed have some issues reading this disk until I run\n  <code>\n   ChkDsk\n  </code>\n  on it, so the message is correct.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I want to check, programmatically, if a partition needs ChkDsk before attempting to read it and after reading NTFS documentation from\n  <a href=\"https://dubeyko.com/development/FileSystems/NTFS/ntfsdoc.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"https://www.top-password.com/blog/how-to-manually-clear-or-set-dirty-bit-on-windows-volume/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  I understood the Dirty flag should be set in the\n  <code>\n   $Volume\n  </code>\n  file in the\n  <code>\n   $VOLUME_INFORMATION\n  </code>\n  attribute:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HlbJQNoO.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"$VOLUME_INFORMATION\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HlbJQNoO.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  However if I read this information the Dirty flag is not set as can be seen from this hex dump:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ykBWbrh0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ykBWbrh0.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, after mounting (and without making any further changes) with Disk Management the dirty flag is immediately set:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iP0hwxj8.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iP0hwxj8.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So how does Windows determine the disk is dirty if the flag was not set?\nAnd if I cannot use the dirty flag, how can I determine it programmatically?\n </p>\n <p>\n  In this example the disk is from Windows 7 and the partition is MBR style. There are no other partitions in the VHDX.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   EDIT\n  </strong>\n  Found the following extra information in Windows Internals 7th edition part 2 (page 709):\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   The dirty bit has a slightly different meaning compared to previous editions of Windows. The $VOLUME_INFORMATION attribute of the NTFS root namespace still contains the dirty bit, but also contains the P-bit, which is used to require a Proactive Scan, and the F-bit, which is used to require a full check disk due to the severity of a particular corruption. The dirty bit is set to 1 by the file system driver if the p-bit or the F-bit are enabled, or if the $Corrupt stream contains one or more corruption records.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  So it looks like the P-Bit (Proactive scan bit) or the F-Bit might be set. Unfortunately I haven't found information where this bits are stored. Perhaps in 2nd byte of the flag field which is a\n  <code>\n   USHORT\n  </code>\n  ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
