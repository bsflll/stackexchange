    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm reversing a Delphi program and have a part where it says:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Result = *(Self - 44);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But I want it to say something like:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Result = *(Self - offsetof(VMT_ClassDefinition, vmtClassName));\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Being VMT_ClassDefinition the following struct:\n </p>\n <pre><code>struct VMT_ClassDefinition {\n    Cardinal vmtSelfPtr;\n    Cardinal vmtIntfTable;\n    Cardinal vmtAutoTable;\n    Cardinal vmtInitTable;\n    Cardinal vmtTypeInfo;\n    Cardinal vmtFieldTable;\n    Cardinal vmtMethodTable;\n    Cardinal vmtDynamicTable;\n    Cardinal vmtClassName;\n    Cardinal vmtInstanceSize;\n    Cardinal vmtParent;\n    Cardinal vmtSafeCallException;\n    Cardinal vmtAfterConstruction;\n    Cardinal vmtBeforeDestruction;\n    Cardinal vmtDispatch;\n    Cardinal vmtDefaultHandler;\n    Cardinal vmtNewInstance;\n    Cardinal vmtFreeInstance;\n    Cardinal vmtDestroy;\n};\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Where cardinal is unsigned int. The problem is that after using \"Right Click > Struct offset\" on top of the number 44 it generates the following result:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Result = *(Self - offsetof(VMT_ClassDefinition, vmtSafeCallException));\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I was doing what is said in\n  <a href=\"https://hex-rays.com/blog/new-features-in-hex-rays-decompiler-1-6/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   New features in Hex-Rays Decompiler 1.6\n  </a>\n  section 3, but as you can see the expected result and what I got is totally different.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My guess is that it forgets about the \"-\" sign and just advances from the start +44. Is there a way to reverse this behavior? I know it can be done in ASM view by inverting with \"_\" and then pressing \"T\" like in\n  <a href=\"https://hex-rays.com/blog/negated-structure-offsets/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Negated structure offsets\n  </a>\n  , but that does not apply to the Pseudocode view.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
