What is the assembling process of these (and similar) macros an assembler will turn to binary? Do they become static, custom binary format used within file itself, do they become x86 instruction,  etc.?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Example you could try:\n </p>\n <pre><code>[ORG 0x7C02]\n[BITS 16]\njmp $\ntimes 510-($-$$) db 0\ndw 0xAA55\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The syntax of an assembly language will dictate how you specify operands, the order in which they are specified, how to specify the size of the operands and much more.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In addition an assembly language will generally include a set of directives to help make your life easier and may include a facility for declaring macros. There is a distinction between directives such as\n  <code>\n   dd\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   resd\n  </code>\n  , and\n  <code>\n   times\n  </code>\n  which instruct the assembler to do very specific things and macros which are generally just shortcuts which are expanded by the assembler during a preprocessing phase. Macros may expand to code, data, directives or any combination thereof.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the case of your example, the assembler is being asked to pad with zeros (\n  <code>\n   db 0\n  </code>\n  ) out to a size of 510 bytes (\n  <code>\n   510 - ($-$$)\n  </code>\n  ), finally the word value\n  <code>\n   0xAA55\n  </code>\n  will be appended to make the total section size 512 bytes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  More generally, data declarations such as\n  <code>\n   db\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   dw\n  </code>\n  ,and\n  <code>\n   dd\n  </code>\n  get translated into initialized data in a\n  <code>\n   .data\n  </code>\n  section, while data \"reservations\" such as\n  <code>\n   resb\n  </code>\n  may be translated into file sections that results in the creation of a\n  <code>\n   .bss\n  </code>\n  section which gets allocated at process load time. Please keep in mind that much of this is also dependent on any section directives that you may use which also dictate when and where data may be allocated.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
