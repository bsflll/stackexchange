    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to solve a crackme that contains a key check like so:\n </p>\n <pre><code>    lVar4 = vulnerability1(passwd);\n    if (lVar4 == 0x260a4c7d7af23fc0) {\n      solve_check(1,0xffffffff);\n      free(passwd);\n      uVar3 = 1;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  with childhood vulnerability being\n </p>\n <pre><code>long vulnerability1(char *param_1)\n\n{\n  char *local_20;\n  long local_10;\n\n  local_10 = 0x7364626d;\n  local_20 = param_1;\n  while( true ) {\n    if (*local_20 == 0) break;\n    local_10 = local_10 * 0x1003f + (long)(int)*local_20;\n    local_20 = local_20 + 1;\n  }\n  return local_10;\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  }\n </p>\n <p>\n  Basically, vulnerability1 cycles through each letter of param1 and applies some transformations. It returns this transformation and it must be the value\n  <strong>\n   0x260a4c7d7af23fc0\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  My question is: Is there an more \"correct\" way of finding the correct string besides brute force? How would a veteran RE person do this?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
