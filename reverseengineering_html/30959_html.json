Could someone please help me to identify the solution for the above said with the help of Radare2?\n </p>\n <p>\n  If it is not possible with radare2, could you please suggest some other tool that can do it (apart from OllyDbg. Since it is available in GUI mode, I need some tool that can be handled from the terminal (CLI))\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
