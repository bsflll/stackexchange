    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to prettify a representation of Pascal-string \"Could not access file \"\" in Hex-Rays decompiler's output. As you can see below,\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XUIBC.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"\n\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XUIBC.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  now its type is\n  <strong>\n   char[25]\n  </strong>\n  due to inclusion of hexademical string length. How can I force IDA to perceive Pascal-strings properly during their depiction in Hex-Rays pane? I want to see for all Pascal-string in corresponding window something like\n </p>\n <pre><code>LODWORD(v90) = ConcatenateStrings_R8_R9_to_RCX(v140, 255i64, \"Could not access file \\\"\", v158);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I tried to change types via \"Set item type...\" as showed below.\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SPXGe.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SPXGe.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unfortunately, these options didn't help.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
