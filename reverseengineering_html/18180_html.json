    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  With Microsoft Visual C++ executables, I often run into decompilations like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>void __cdecl Pbdf::ReadString(char *dst, Pbdf *pbdfOrLength)\n{\n    Pbdf *pbdf; // esi\n\n    pbdf = pbdfOrLength;\n    Pbdf::ReadBytes(&pbdfOrLength, 1, pbdfOrLength);\n    Pbdf::ReadBytes(dst, (unsigned __int8)pbdfOrLength, pbdf);\n    dst[(unsigned __int8)pbdfOrLength] = 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The function is actually more like this (as seen in a Watcom executable doing the same thing):\n </p>\n <pre><code>void __usercall Pbdf::ReadString(char *dst@<eax>, Pbdf *pbdf@<edx>)\n{\n    unsigned __int8 length; // [esp+0h] [ebp-14h]\n\n    Pbdf::ReadBytes(pbdf, &length, 1u);\n    Pbdf::ReadBytes(pbdf, dst, length);\n    *((_BYTE *)dst + length) = 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So, from a Pbdf file-like struct, it's reading a single byte determining the number of following bytes to read into a buffer, and terminates that buffer with a 0.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, in the MSVC decompilation, you can see it merged the length and Pbdf struct into one variable, causing me to name the variable \"pbdfOrLength\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is it somehow possible to tell the decompiler to \"split\" these variables up / handle them as two separate ones, to get an output similar to what is seen in Watcom?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Your description reminds me of the (still current @ 7.5) issue where mapping a variable to an\n <code>\n  enum\n </code>\n will\n <b>\n  sometimes\n </b>\n cause unrelated variables to self-convert to the same\n <code>\n  enum\n </code>\n . This happened again yesterday, in applying an enum for\n <code>\n  socket(2, 0 ...\n </code>\n aka\n <code>\n  socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM...\n </code>\n all my\n <code>\n  bool\n </code>\n returns changed to\n <code>\n  return SOCK_STREAM;\n </code>\n .  TBF 7.5 is otherwise fairly impressive.  e.g. I haven't had to map v1= a1; v2 = a2; v3 = a3 once!\n</span>\n</body></html>",

You can only apply \"ForceVar\" to stack variables, not to registers -- which is naturally where one needs it, since register re-use is a lot more common than stack re-use.\n <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/decompiler/manual/cmd_force_lvar.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  hex-rays.com/products/decompiler/manual/cmd_force_lvar.shtml\n </a>\n</span>\n</body></html>",
