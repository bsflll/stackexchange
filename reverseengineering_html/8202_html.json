The point here is to recover precisely the encryption scheme of CTB-Locker to see if there is a way to break it.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Most of them wanted to know if it’s possible to restore the compromised files without paying the ransom. The answer is simple: it’s impossible without knowing the Master key! That key resides on the malicious server and it’s the only way to restore every single compromised file.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  And, follow a full analysis of the encryption scheme of CTB-Locker. A good reading for anybody wants to know more about it !\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://zairon.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/ctb-locker-encryptiondecryption-scheme-in-details/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    CTB-Locker encryption/decryption scheme in details\n   </a>\n   , by Zairon, February 17, 2015.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
