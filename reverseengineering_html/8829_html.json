I have a MIPS elf file, [myelf][1] .You can see bellow the output of\n  <code>\n   file myelf\n  </code>\n  :\n </p>\n <pre><code>myelf: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-I version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.18, BuildID[sha1]=0xc89c3571514c7ec1afc74a189a9c2d24e276ec4c, with unknown capability 0xf41 = 0x756e6700, with unknown capability 0x70100 = 0x1040000  stripped\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I just want to run and debug the program. So i don't need a cross compiler right ? As i don't have MIPS hardware (i have an INTEL microprocessor), i need an emulator. I've chosen to use QEMU. According to this\n  <a href=\"https://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/mips/\">\n   site\n  </a>\n  , i downloaded the following kernel image and initrds:\n </p>\n <pre><code>debian_squeeze_mips_standard.qcow2\n\nvmlinux-2.6.32-5-4kc-malta\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Then i've run the specified command for a 32 bit (because the elf informations) MIPS system.\n </p>\n <pre><code>qemu-system-mips -M malta -kernel vmlinux-2.6.32-5-4kc-malta -hda debian_squeeze_mips_standard.qcow2 -append \"root=/dev/sda1 console=tty0\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So far, i have the emulator running in one shell and the command uname -a gives me:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Linux debian-mips 2.6.32-5-4kc-malta #1 Tue Sep 24 00:02:22 UTC 2013 mips GNU/Linux\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  There are only the very basics commands/tools on the emulator. I've read that gdb can debug on a remote target (here the MIPS-emulator) from an host machine which is my x86_64. And to be honest i have no idea about what i should do now. I first tried to install gdb itself on the the qemu emulator.When i run gdb my elf i can see that gdb was automatically configured as mips-linux-gnu.\n </p>\n <pre><code>root@debian-mips:~# gdb myelf \nGNU gdb (GDB) 7.0.1-debian\nCopyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Let's start at the beginning.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  QEMU and GDB\n </h2>\n <p>\n  QEMU is an emulator for various architectures.  Generally, it's used to emulate an entire PC (i.e. to run a virtual machine).  However, for debugging a single program this is not necessary.  On Linux, you can use QEMU User-Space emulation.\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install qemu qemu-user qemu-user-static\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Additionally, the GDB which is installed by default for Ubuntu and similar operating systems does not know anything about other architectures.  Luckily, there is a\n  <code>\n   gdb-multiarch\n  </code>\n  packages which does!\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install gdb-multiarch\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Finally, Linux generally relies on the shebang (\n  <code>\n   #!\n  </code>\n  ) at the top of shell scripts to inform it what interpreter to use.  For binary files, there is no such standard.  In order to fill this void, the\n  <code>\n   binfmt\n  </code>\n  package can be used to look at what type a file is, and automatically invoke the correct interpreter.  In our case, it will see that you're trying to run a little-endian MIPS (\n  <code>\n   mipsel\n  </code>\n  ) binary and invoke\n  <code>\n   qemu-mipsel\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install 'binfmt*'\n</code></pre>\n <h3>\n  Running Statically-Linked Binaries\n </h3>\n <p>\n  For a statically-linked MIPSEL binary, this is normally all that would be necessary.  However, the one you linked to relies on external libraries.  If it were statically linked, you could run it now.  You can create an example binary to demonstrate this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ echo 'int main() {puts(\"Hello world!\");}' > hello.c\n$ mipsel-linux-gnu-gcc -xc -static -o mipsel-test hello.c\n$ file mipsel-test\na.out: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-I version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.18, BuildID[sha1]=2556cc80429de1ab3116278ac10832d72bd7ebab, not stripped\n$ ./mipsel-test\nHello world!\n</code></pre>\n <h2>\n  Libraries\n </h2>\n <p>\n  Since your chosen binary is dynamically linked, you will need to install libraries like\n  <code>\n   libc.so\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   ld.so\n  </code>\n  for the appropriate architecture.  We also need to tell\n  <code>\n   binfmt\n  </code>\n  where to find them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ubuntu provides cross-architecture packages for ARM and AArch64.  For example:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install libc6-armhf-armel-cross\n</code></pre>\n <h3>\n  Ubuntu (if older than Ubuntu 16.04 / Xenial)\n </h3>\n <p>\n  Ubuntu 14.04 and does not provide packages for MIPS.  Luckily, Debian (which Ubuntu is based off of) does provide packages, and these packages are compatible with Ubuntu.  Un-luckily, Debian does\n  <em>\n   not\n  </em>\n  support little-endian MIPS (mipsel).  Lucky us once again, as a different Debian derivative, Embedded Debian (emdebian) does provide those packages.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can add both repositories to your Ubuntu or other Debian-based distro with the command below.\n  <em>\n   If you were only working with ARM or AArch64, you don't need to do this\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install debian-keyring\n$ sudo apt-get install debian-archive-keyring\n$ sudo apt-get install emdebian-archive-keyring\n$ sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/emdebian.list << EOF\ndeb http://mirrors.mit.edu/debian squeeze main\ndeb http://www.emdebian.org/debian squeeze main\nEOF\n$ sudo apt-get update\n</code></pre>\n Clean Up\n <p>\n  When you are done installing the packages (see below), I highly recommend removing the file\n  <code>\n   emdebian.list\n  </code>\n  which we created earlier.  While the Emdebian packages are compatible,\n  <code>\n   apt\n  </code>\n  does weird things and may elect to use a\n  <code>\n   Debian\n  </code>\n  package instead of the one your distro is supposed to.  If you need to install more packages later, you can just add it again.\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/emdebian.list\n$ sudo apt-get update\n</code></pre>\n <h3>\n  Installing the libraries\n </h3>\n <p>\n  Now we can install packages!  The package which includes all of the\n  <code>\n   mipsel\n  </code>\n  libraries you need to run the binary you selected is\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install libc6-mipsel-cross      # For MIPS-EL\n$ sudo apt-get install libc6-armhf-armel-cross # For ARM\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  If you want to build programs like the sample above, you'll need a cross-compiler.\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install gcc-4.4-mipsel-linux-gnu # For MIPS-EL on Ubuntu 14.04\n$ sudo apt-get install gcc-mipsel-linux-gnu     # For MIPS-EL on Ubuntu 16.04\n$ sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf  # For ARM\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Very finally, we need to tell\n  <code>\n   binfmt\n  </code>\n  where the libraries are for\n  <code>\n   mipsel\n  </code>\n  binaries.\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ sudo mkdir /etc/qemu-binfmt\n$ sudo ln -s /usr/mipsel-linux-gnu /etc/qemu-binfmt/mipsel # MIPSEL\n$ sudo ln -s /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf /etc/qemu-binfmt/arm # ARM\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now you can run the binary on your system*!\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ ./myelf\nUsage: ./crackme password\n</code></pre>\n <h2>\n  Debugging\n </h2>\n <p>\n  This is the whole point, right?\n </p>\n <h3>\n  strace\n </h3>\n <p>\n  The quickest thing to do is to be able to run\n  <code>\n   strace\n  </code>\n  on the binary.  You can do this with:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ qemu-mipsel -strace ./myelf\n12825 brk(NULL) = 0x00411000\n12825 mmap(NULL,4096,PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS,-1,0) = 0x767ca000\n...\n12825 ptrace(0,0,0,0,0,0) = -1 errno=89 (Function not implemented)\nqemu: Unsupported syscall: 4026\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  You should've seen from running the binary, and from\n  <code>\n   strace\n  </code>\n  , that this binary attempts to call\n  <code>\n   ptrace\n  </code>\n  on itself.  This is one of the limitations of\n  <code>\n   qemu-user\n  </code>\n  , is that\n  <code>\n   ptrace\n  </code>\n  is not supported.  If the binary\n  <em>\n   needs\n  </em>\n  to ptrace itself, you will need to build a full QEMU system image.  I generally use the ones available\n  <a href=\"https://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/mipsel/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .  Running QEMU is outside the scope of this answer, but the page I linked to has useful command-lines.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can easily remove the\n  <code>\n   ptrace\n  </code>\n  call from the binary (it's anti-debugging stuff), and it runs fine.  However, I think this is part of the crackme :P.\n </p>\n <pre><code>$./myelf\nKO\n$ sed -i 's|ptrace|isnanl|' myelf\n$ ./myelf\nUsage: ./crackme password\n</code></pre>\n <h3>\n  QEMU GDB Stub\n </h3>\n <p>\n  In order to debug the binary with GDB, you need to launch\n  <code>\n   qemu-mips\n  </code>\n  so that it exposes a GDB stub, and connect from GDB.\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ qemu-mipsel -g 12345 ./a.out &\n$ gdb-multiarch ./a.out\n(gdb) set arch mips\nThe target architecture is assumed to be mips\n(gdb) set endian little\nThe target is assumed to be little endian\n(gdb) target remote localhost:12345\nRemote debugging using localhost:12345\n0x00400280 in _ftext ()\n(gdb) x/i $pc\n  => 0x767cb880    move   $t9, $ra\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  You can now debug as you normally would.  Note that since you're running inside of\n  <code>\n   qemu-user\n  </code>\n  , some commands my not work as expected.  In particular,\n  <code>\n   info proc maps\n  </code>\n  doesn't work.  You may want to take a look at my\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/zachriggle/pwndbg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   pwndbg\n  </a>\n  project, which works around some of these limitations.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
