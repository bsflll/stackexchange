Whenever I develop a C++, Python application, I need to version control it. For example, the csproj file managed by Visual Studio holds the compiling configurations for a C# project, and I put the file into git.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, as a newbie in reverse engineering, I'm using IDA. I like IDA's abilities to rename functions and variables, add comments, etc. I find an IDA project has a database, but it's not plain text.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How would I save my reverse engineering progress in git? How would I share my comments, notes, renamings to others so that they can pick up and continue studying the same executable?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
