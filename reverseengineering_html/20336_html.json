On the far left you have also some arrows indicating jumps and on the far right there are comments.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   May I know how the command below:\n   \n\n   wa je 0x400976 @0x00400968\n   \n\n   changes 760c to 740c and jne 0x400976 to je 0x400976?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   wa\n  </code>\n  command, which you could check by requesting help in r2, is a command that writes the opcode of the provided mnemonic.\n </p>\n <pre><code>| wa[?] push ebp       write opcode, separated by ';' (use '\"' around the command)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So executing\n  <code>\n   wa je 0x400976 @0x00400968\n  </code>\n  will write the opcodes for the\n  <code>\n   je 0x400976\n  </code>\n  at the address of\n  <code>\n   0x400968\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  And actually it changes from\n  <code>\n   750c\n  </code>\n  , and that is the opcode of the jump-not-equal with the offset of\n  <code>\n   0xC\n  </code>\n  bytes. You requested (by issuing the command\n  <code>\n   wa\n  </code>\n  ) to write on that spot the jump-if-equal and the opcode of this is\n  <code>\n   74\n  </code>\n  . The offset stays the same.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Also, what does that accomplish? Does it just bypass the function\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  It changes the condition so from now on the jump will be taken when the strings that are being compared (@\n  <code>\n   0x400961\n  </code>\n  ) are equal and not taken if they are different. This also happens to the string being printed at offset\n  <code>\n   0x400971\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Apart from the first question this is nor really radare2 specific stuff. It looks like you should start with some basic assembly and/or RE topics/tutorials that are plenty on the internet.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
