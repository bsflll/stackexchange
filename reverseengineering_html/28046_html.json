The program was written in Visual Studio and has Russian dialogs, which I like to convert to English.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've loaded the EXE into Ghidra, it shows up a lot of information:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   visualstudio:unknown\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Portable Executable (PE)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Little Endian\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   and much more\nThen I let it analyze the program. After that, I'd like to find is the main() function. In the \"Symbol Tree\" under \"Exports\" or \"Functions\" there is only an \"entry\" function shown, and the decompile of this function makes no sense to me:\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <pre><code>/* WARNING: Instruction at (ram,0x0045280e) overlaps instruction at (ram,0x0045280d)\n    */\n/* WARNING: Removing unreachable block (ram,0x004527db) */\n/* WARNING: Removing unreachable block (ram,0x00452823) */\n/* WARNING: Removing unreachable block (ram,0x004527a1) */\n\nulonglong entry(void)\n\n{\n  undefined8 uVar1;\n  ulonglong uVar2;\n  uint uVar3;\n  int iVar4;\n  int iVar5;\n  \n  iVar4 = -1;\n  while (iVar4 != 0) {\n    iVar4 = 0;\n  }\n  uVar3 = 0;\n  iVar4 = -1;\n  while (iVar4 != 0) {\n    iVar4 = 0;\n  }\n  uVar1 = rdtsc();\n  iVar4 = 1;\n  do {\n    if (uVar3 == 0) {\n      uVar3 = 0;\n    }\n    else {\n      uVar3 = (uint)uVar1 | 2;\n    }\n    iVar5 = -1;\n    while (iVar5 != 0) {\n      iVar5 = 0;\n    }\n    iVar4 = iVar4 + -1;\n  } while (iVar4 != 0);\n  uVar2 = rdtsc();\n  uVar3 = (int)uVar2 - (uint)uVar1;\n  do {\n  } while (0x1000000 < uVar3);\n  iVar4 = -1;\n  while (iVar4 != 0) {\n    iVar4 = 0;\n  }\n  iVar4 = -1;\n  while (iVar4 != 0) {\n    iVar4 = 0;\n  }\n  return uVar2 & 0xffffffff00000000 | (ulonglong)uVar3;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I don't get what this means, I somehow expected a whole function-tree with a lot of subs and stuff.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
