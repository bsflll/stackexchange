I used the same function on a different processor architecture before but i'm sure the signature has changed by the devs because I tried to call it same as before but it crashes every time, here's the old signature:\n </p>\n <pre><code>void(*DrawText)(int, float x, float y, int color, const char * text)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Here's the assembly for the function in amd86_64 starting from the caller function:\n </p>\n <pre><code>    push    rbp\n    mov     rbp, rsp\n    push    r15\n    push    r14\n    push    r13\n    push    r12\n    push    rbx\n    sub     rsp, 178h\n    lea     rdi, [rbp+var_108]\n    mov     esi, 1\n    xor     edx, edx\n    call    sub_937750\n    lea     rax, dword_1885C10\n    vcvtsi2ss xmm0, xmm0, dword ptr [rax+54h]\n    vmovss  [rbp+var_164], xmm0\n    vcvtsi2ss xmm0, xmm0, dword ptr [rax+58h]\n    vmovss  [rbp+var_168], xmm0\n    lea     rsi, a30f_1\n    vmovss  xmm0, dword ptr cs:qword_10799B8\n    xor     edi, edi\n    call    sub_A0E930\n    lea     rcx, qword_17FAB50\n    mov     rcx, [rcx]\n    cmp     byte ptr [rcx+2E87h], 0\n    jnz     loc_4994\n    cmp     byte ptr [rcx+2E81h], 0\n    jz      loc_4994\n    mov     eax, eax\n    vcvtsi2ss xmm0, xmm0, rax\n    vmovss  xmm1, [rbp+var_168]\n    vsubss  xmm0, xmm1, xmm0\n    lea     rax, unk_1871D60\n    vmovss  xmm2, dword ptr [rax]\n    vxorps  xmm1, xmm1, xmm1\n    vucomiss xmm2, xmm1\n    jbe     loc_3E5E\n    vmovss  xmm1, dword ptr cs:qword_10799B8\n    vdivss  xmm1, xmm1, xmm2\n    vmovss  [rbp+var_16C], xmm1\n    vcvtss2sd xmm2, xmm2, xmm2\n    lea     rdi, [rbp+var_108]\n    lea     rdx, a62fFps\n    mov     eax, 0FF0000FFh\n    mov     ecx, 0FF00FFFFh\n    mov     r14d, 0FF00FF00h\n    vucomiss xmm1, dword ptr cs:qword_10799B8+4\n    cmova   r14d, ecx\n    vaddss  xmm1, xmm1, dword ptr cs:qword_10799B8+8\n    vucomiss xmm1, dword ptr cs:qword_10799B8+0Ch\n    cmova   r14d, eax\n    vmovss  [rbp+var_168], xmm0\n    vmovss  xmm1, [rbp+var_164]\n    mov     esi, r14d\n    mov     al, 3\n    call    DrawText\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Here's what I gathered so far (not sure if it's right though), 1st arg is a pointer\n  <code>\n   lea rdi, [rbp+var_108]\n  </code>\n  2nd and 3rd are floats which is the positioning coordinates:\n </p>\n <pre><code>vmovss  xmm1, dword ptr cs:qword_10799B8\nvdivss  xmm1, xmm1, xmm2\nvmovss  [rbp+var_16C], xmm1\nvcvtss2sd xmm2, xmm2, xmm2\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  4th and 6th are int's (hex code for rgb colors I assume)\n  <code>\n   mov esi, r14d\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   mov ecx, 0FF00FFFFh\n  </code>\n  the 5th arg is a char pointer\n  <code>\n   lea rdx, a62fFps\n  </code>\n  . The function doesn't return anything so i'm sure it's a void.\n </p>\n <pre><code>void(*DrawText)(int *, float x, float y, int color, int, const char * text)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I tried to call this way but it also crashes, please let me know if I got something wrong and explain stuff because i'm little newbee when it comes to assembly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Note:\n  </strong>\n  This is not a\n  <strong>\n   PLEASE DO IT FOR ME\n  </strong>\n  question but rather explain how do I read the params properly, I don't mind posting the final result at the end of the answer though.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I have no experience with the AMD64 calling convention but here's my take:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Wikipedia says:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   The first six integer or pointer arguments are passed in registers RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9 (R10 is used as a static chain pointer in case of nested functions[19]:21), while XMM0, XMM1, XMM2, XMM3, XMM4, XMM5, XMM6 and XMM7 are used for certain floating point arguments.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Judging from that I'd say the following mapping would be right then:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Argument #  | Register   | Desc\n------------|------------|---------\n1           | rdi        | int *\n2           | xmm0       | x\n3           | xmm1       | y\n4           | rsi        | int color\n5           | rdx        | unnamed int\n6           | rcx        | const char *text\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   The following was my mistake as I misread the post, the old signature posted at the top agrees with me, the one at the bottom does not\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  but when I worked through your code reading bottom up it didn't fit:\n </p>\n <pre><code>lea     rdx, a62fFps\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  that loads the text to print into\n  <code>\n   rdx\n  </code>\n  but if above mapping would be right,\n  <code>\n   rdx\n  </code>\n  should be some unnamed int, and only the next argument would be the text.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note that this may be my fault because I may have missed some nuance of AMD64.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   End of mistake\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Back to what does work:\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first argument, the pointer, should be in\n  <code>\n   rdi\n  </code>\n  . If you read upwards,\n </p>\n <pre><code>lea     rdi, [rbp+var_108]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  is the first line to write to\n  <code>\n   rdi\n  </code>\n  , so that's your pointer (it fits the type). Floats seem to be passed via\n  <code>\n   xmm0\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   xmm1\n  </code>\n  so those will be\n  <code>\n   x\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   y\n  </code>\n  . The color is the 2nd non-float argument, which would be in\n  <code>\n   rsi\n  </code>\n  and reading the code we find:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov     esi, r14d\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and\n  <code>\n   rsi\n  </code>\n  contains\n  <code>\n   esi\n  </code>\n  , so that would be your color, only it's 32 bit in size. If you read the code, it also seems to fit the color type.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then above problem appears where I was expecting another int but the next argument seems to be the text instead.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
