The right branch isn't out by quite as much as in the original screenshot for some reason.

Normally they should be the same, however IDA failed to reconcile them, probably due to too many indirect calls in the function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One peculiarity of manual stack delta adjustments is that they apply\n  <em>\n   after\n  </em>\n  the instruction at which you're setting them. In our case, we need to make 501C49 have the delta of E8, however we can't do it on the instruction itself but need to go to the previous one\n  <em>\n   by address\n  </em>\n  and not the control flow, i.e. the\n  <code>\n   jmp\n  </code>\n  at 501C44. Since that address has SPD=E0, specifying delta of -8 should work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is why such manipulations are best done in text view and not graph.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I must have been under the misconception that Alt-K would change the next instruction in the control flow rather than the next instruction in memory, which really wouldn't make any sense. Thanks again!</span>",
