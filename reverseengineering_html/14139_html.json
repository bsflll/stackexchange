    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I try to use IDA to debug application with official Android ARM emulator. I set up debugger, installed APK and run application, it starts, writes \"waiting for debugger\", and debugger writes that \"connection has been gracefully closed\", and I see following message in IDA log:\n  <code>\n   ADB error: listener 'tcp:23915' not found\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The application is for sure debuggable; I have sources and debug the same APK with Android Studio. I can also debug C++ code with IDA remove ARM on the same emulator and the same APK.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So why does Dalvik debugger not work?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I found that when IDA tries to connect to Dalvik debugger, I see following message in log:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   Ignoring second debugger -- accepting and dropping\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  In not doubts no second debugger existed. Next, I found that this AVD doesn't work even with Android Studio and gives the same error.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I found that other people have similar issue:\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3735450/ignoring-second-debugger-and-service-hang-in-android\">\n   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3735450/ignoring-second-debugger-and-service-hang-in-android\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The problem disappeared when I rebooted Windows.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
