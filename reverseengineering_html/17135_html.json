    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Recently I got really interested in BIOS RE and I used\n  <strong>\n   <em>\n    chipsec\n   </em>\n  </strong>\n  to dump the content of SPI Flash ROM of my\n  <strong>\n   HP Omen\n  </strong>\n  Desktop PC to start my journey. But unlike older BIOSes, the binary file was pretty huge (8.4 MB).\n </p>\n <p>\n  The bios image is\n  <strong>\n   AMI A0.57 rev A\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have a couple of problems with this BIOS image:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    I can't disassemble it correctly. Using\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      radare2\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    with\n    <em>\n     -b flag\n    </em>\n    , I tried 16,32 and 64 but the file doesn't get disassembled correctly.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Using\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      UEFI Tool\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    , it fails at parsing it correctly.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    I googled and google and google. There no resource to solve my problem.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      IDA Pro\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    also treats the file as BIOS Image and uses one of its plugins\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      bios_image.py\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    to analyze the file but fails at some point with an error: Cannot relocate segment something at something (some addresses) because it overlap another segment.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Then I thought maybe Chipsec has failed with dumping the SPI Flash and the file is corrupted but I downloaded the BIOS image from HP's website (ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp81501-82000/sp81781.exe) and the file is the exact same. So, I have no clue and I need help to start learning BIOS reverse engineering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  P.S. I have read BIOS Disassembly Ninjutsu Uncovered; and I can provide the binary if necessary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Please be\n  <strong>\n   as specific as possible\n  </strong>\n  in your answer since I googled 100 times and I'm really disappointed.\nThanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I can't find <i>anything</i> on this. My laptop is booted into legacy bios and has EA at 0xFFFF0 and 90 90 E9 at 0xFFFFFFF0</span>",
