These applications share a common feature and what I have found is that in each decompilation each application shares the same set of functions.  If the binary is stripped how does IDA pro work out the function names ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The functions that I am seeing in common between the applications are all very abstract, for example\n  <code>\n   v404()\n  </code>\n  , and as far as I can work out don't come from any open source library set of functions.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
