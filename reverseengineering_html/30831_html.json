I have access to the images themselves, but they seem to be encrypted and cannot be viewed. Looking at the image in a hex viewer shows that the png headers are missing and have been replaced.\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aZ87B.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"screenshot of hex data\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aZ87B.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I do have access to the sourcecode after decompiling with APKTool, but I am not entirely sure what I am looking for in order to decrypt the images. Ive looked around for anything relating to 'decrypt' but a lot of it has been dead ends with network decryption, not decryption of the asset files.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
