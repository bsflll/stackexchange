I uploaded a sample to VT and only Microsoft flagged it as malicious. As of today's signatures I am not seeing any further detection's and I am hoping this is simply a false positive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm using this as an opportunity to learn more about malware analysis and incident response. To take a deeper dive I opened the file with the JPEXS decompiler, but have no idea on where to go from here. Looking for guidance on how to better understand and analyze this for myself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, are there any online tools/sandboxes that accept swf files that would provide any value?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
