I manage to go to the entry address that points to the _start function. But impossible to know where is libc_start_main (for locate main).\n </p>\n <p>\n  _start:\n  <a href=\"https://ibb.co/nDpQyvv\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://ibb.co/nDpQyvv\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  sub_44a770:\n  <a href=\"https://ibb.co/dK74pG5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://ibb.co/dK74pG5\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  sub_44a560:\n  <a href=\"https://ibb.co/7S76m7t\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://ibb.co/7S76m7t\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  All your advice is good, if you have articles on the subject, I'm interested.
