I tried Hopper v2.8.8 (freeware) with no success.\n  \n\n  \n\n  I had no problem until I tried to display a pseudocode. In fact, I can't find the option for that as you can see on this screenshot :\n  <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0x93j.png\"/>\n  \n\n  I believe to know that I can do it because IDA should support ARM decompilation... So my question is : How to decompile an objective-c library ? Or, Am I missing something ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It has two versions. Standalone and plugin to IDA. The latter supports all IDA's architectures, provides full GUI integration - is easy to work with -, makes use of\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/175/what-is-a-flirt-signature\">\n   IDA Flirt signatures\n  </a>\n  and will make use of runtime information if you use it together with\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/deresz/funcap\">\n   funcap\n  </a>\n  . There is also\n  <a href=\"http://decompiler.fit.vutbr.cz/decompilation/\">\n   Retargetable Decompiler\n  </a>\n  , an online decompiler developed at Brno University of Technology that supports x86, ARM, ARM+Thumb and MIPS and can decompile to C or Python. It provides not only the decompilation but packer and compiler information, extraction of debug information, call and flow graphs, and signature-based removal of statically linked library code. Its only problem is its input size limitation of 10MB.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If those do not suffice your needs, you could also adapt or wait for the implementation of ARM support in either\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/EiNSTeiN-/ida-decompiler\">\n   Einstein's IDA Decompiler\n  </a>\n  ,\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/jcdutton/libbeauty\">\n   libbeauty\n  </a>\n  -\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/jcdutton/reference\">\n   reference material\n  </a>\n  -, or\n  <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/desquirr/\">\n   desquirr\n  </a>\n  - as someone already\n  <a href=\"http://www.embedded.com/design/real-time-and-performance/4023282/3/Decompiling-the-ARM-architecture-code\">\n   did\n  </a>\n  but released no code. The first two are the most promising. You could also wait for\n  <a href=\"http://hopperapp.com/\">\n   Hopper\n  </a>\n  to improve it's ARM support. \nHowever, if you need to decompile it now, you'll have to purchase\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/\">\n   IDA\n  </a>\n  and the\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/decompiler/\">\n   Hex-Rays Decompiler\n  </a>\n  , which is more than worth its cost - if you can afford it - and goes for about 3314 USD - including courier shipping - as of now for a named license. More informations about the purchase can be found in the link Mr.Skochinsky\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/order.shtml\">\n   provided\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
