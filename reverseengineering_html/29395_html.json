Most Google results show that it should be\n  <code>\n   __vbaVarIndexLoad\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  If so, it is a function reserved for internal use and you shouldn't care too much about it. Judging by its name it probably pushes a variable on the VM stack by the index.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While working with Visual basic programs, you should check if it is p-code compiled or native code compiled, then choose correct tools, since usually you don't want to reverse the whole VM.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
