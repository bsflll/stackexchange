    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I did a brief survey on malware unpacking and I found several theses on automated general unpacking:Eureka, PolyUnpack, omniUnpack, Malware Normalization.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, these theses are written years ago and I don't think these methods still work. A basic assumption of these methods is an unpacker routine restore whole protected code at a time. Thus, we can get original code dumping a certain memory region when an unpacker routine finishes its work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When it comes to more sophisticated packer (such as\n  <a href=\"http://bitlackeys.org/#maya\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Maya's veil\n  </a>\n  ), it doesn't reveal whole protected code. As far as I know an attempt to attack this problem is to\n  <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5645447/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   distinguish between code that performs unpacking routine and code does not\n  </a>\n  and I think this is not really unpacking.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Only way to unpacking sophisticated packers is manually reversing it?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
