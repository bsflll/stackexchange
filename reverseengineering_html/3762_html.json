    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I use IDA Pro 6.1 to disassemble static linked binary on Windows 32bit\n </p>\n <p>\n  See, in the interactive screen, this subroutine (which is in one library function) can be found:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"IDAPro asm display\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BjLOg.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  But as I use these two ways to generate asm code:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   File->Produce->Create ASM File\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   IDC script to iterate all the functions\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  In both ways I can find this library function, but I can not find the definition of the subroutine\n  <code>\n   $LN28_0\n  </code>\n  . Which means in the generated asm code, all the\n  <code>\n   jmp $LN28_0\n  </code>\n  is undefined.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, I am wondering if it is a bug of IDA Pro? Or, do I need to configure some things?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
