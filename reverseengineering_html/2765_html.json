I downloaded firmware update pack which is available as Windows EXE, then used Hauwei Modem Flasher to unpack real firmware from installer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've got 4 files:\n </p>\n <pre><code>01.bin: data\n02.bin: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1, statically linked, not stripped\n03.bin: data\n04.bin: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1, statically linked, not stripped\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  As we can see\n  <code>\n   02\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   04\n  </code>\n  are executable files.\n  <code>\n   01\n  </code>\n  is probably some kind of bootloader (I assume it from string analysis).\n  <code>\n   03\n  </code>\n  is some kind of pseudo FS.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I started from analyzing\n  <code>\n   03\n  </code>\n  (I posted it\n  <a href=\"http://czlug.icis.pcz.pl/~pbm/03.bin\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  ):\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is header part\n </p>\n <pre><code>02 00 EE EE  50 BA 6E 00  20 00 00 00  D0 A2 02 00\n7B 02 00 00  00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   7B 02\n  </code>\n  as 16 bits gives 635 which is number of files in binary (verified using\n  <code>\n   strings\n  </code>\n  ). Then there are 635 parts describing each file (call it directory) and at the end there is content of files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is directory entry for first GIF file which I found. I choosed GIF because it's easy to identify (there is header GIF8X and footer 0x3B).\n </p>\n <pre><code>77 77 77 5C  75 6D 5C 70  75 62 6C 69  63 5F 73 79\n73 2D 72 65  73 6F 75 72  63 65 73 5C  42 75 74 74\n75 6E 5F 43  75 72 72 65  6E 74 2E 67  69 66 00 00\nlot of zeros\n18 22 11 00  10 02 00 00  00 00 00 00  00 00 FF EE\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  We can see its name:\n  <code>\n   www\\um\\public_sys-resources\\Buttun_Current.gif\n  </code>\n  and in last line there is offset of file in binary and file size, but I'm not really sure how to interpret this values.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I found first GIF after directory and extracted it manually (from header to footer) which gives me file of size 528 bytes, so reading\n  <code>\n   10 02\n  </code>\n  as 16 bit unsigned gives me that number. I tried to treat\n  <code>\n   18 22\n  </code>\n  as 16 bit unsigned to get offset, but it was different from offset that I manually read from file. Bu there was constant difference between offset and real offset of file of\n  <code>\n   1286864\n  </code>\n  . So I created script for unpacking this binary (I'm getting offset and adding to it\n  <code>\n   1286864\n  </code>\n  ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Script worked only partially. It recreated directory structure, but was able only to extract files in one particular directory (directory with GIF which I was using as reference). After check on different part of file it seems that offset of offset in different subdirectories is another that in this GIF directory. So, my guess is that I'm interpreting offset wrong (but treating it as 32 bits gives nothing useful).\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is unpack script:\n </p>\n <pre><code>import sys, struct, os\n\ndef main(args):\n    outdir = args[1]\n    f = open(args[0], 'rb')\n    f2 = open(args[0], 'rb')\n    header = f.read(32)\n    print(len(header[16:]))\n    number_of_files = struct.unpack(\"h\", header[16:18])[0]\n    print(number_of_files)\n\n    for i in range(number_of_files):\n        body = f.read(272)\n        file_, rest = body.split(b'\\x00', 1)\n        offset = struct.unpack(\"H\", body[256:258])[0] + 1286864\n        size = struct.unpack(\"H\", body[260:262])[0]\n        file_ = file_.decode(encoding='UTF-8').replace('\\\\', '/')\n        dirname = os.path.join(outdir, os.path.dirname(file_))\n        filename = os.path.basename(file_)\n        print(filename, size, offset, dirname)\n        try:\n            os.makedirs(dirname)\n        except OSError:\n            pass\n\n        outfile = open(os.path.join(dirname, filename), \"wb\")\n        f2.seek(offset)\n        outfile.write(f2.read(size))\n        outfile.close()\n\nif __name__=='__main__':\n    sys.exit(main(sys.argv[1:]))\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Usage:\n  <code>\n   ./script.py 03.bin output_directory\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So my question is: what I'm doing wrong? Maybe I should read some another data type as offset/size? Which one?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It doesn't matter if offset of this file is 16 or 32 bit because in both cases is 0.

Offset of it was\n  <code>\n   0x2a2d0\n  </code>\n  . Then I checked size of\n  <code>\n   ZSP.bin\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know that where it is, but I didn't know if it is 16 bits or 32 bits (\n  <code>\n   B4 C3\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   B4 C3 0C 00\n  </code>\n  ). When I added\n  <code>\n   B4 C3\n  </code>\n  as 16 bits unsigned to my known offset\n  <code>\n   0x2a2d0\n  </code>\n  I landed at address\n  <code>\n   0x36684\n  </code>\n  which doesn't look like beginning of XML file (which is third in directory, but second one have 0 length). So I tried adding\n  <code>\n   0xcc3b4\n  </code>\n  (32 bits value) to my offset, which gives me\n  <code>\n   0xf6684\n  </code>\n  and at this address there was beginning of XML file... :)\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I modified my code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>offset = struct.unpack(\"I\", body[256:260])[0] + 172752\nsize = struct.unpack(\"I\", body[260:264])[0]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  After manual check of some random not binary files all of them were ok (proper begins and ends of HTML and XML, GIFs identified as GIFs)...\n </p>\n <p>\n  BTW, idea of checking first file in directory not this GIFs was first thought that got to my mind after I woke up... :)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

But when I found it I never looked at header again. About entries in directory: it is weird to me that at the end of every entry there is \"end mark\": <code>FF EE</code>, because all entries are have the same length. In fact you could calculate length of each directory entry from <code>offset_to_data / number_of_files</code>, so this separator is not needed... Thanks again. Your code will definitely help make my script more beautiful... :)</span>",
