But it stands to reason that in order to find out what valid inputs the underlying device driver expects, you should find out the driver to which the device object (the one you opened with\n  <code>\n   CreateFileA\n  </code>\n  ) belongs and then reverse engineer that. To find out, you can use a tool such as\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/winobj\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   WinObj\n  </a>\n  or similar.

The WDK does usually carry all the relevant IOCTLs for Windows components you interact with from another driver or user mode. However, as any third-party can define their own IOCTLs, these will not be contained. You can <i>decode</i> them exactly as pointed out above (there's no difference), however you won't be able to give that IOCTL a meaningful name without deducing its meaning from analyzing the target disassembly, for example.</span>",
