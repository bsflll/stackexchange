    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am working on reversing a router for which I cannot find downloadable firmware anywhere. I managed to get a root shell on the router. I am now confused as I cannot see any persistent writeable mounts. Most are tmpfs filesystems, one is a sysfs which as far as I understand is not an actual filesystem, and /dev/mtdblock7 which is a squashfs filesystem (and is readonly). Where is the persistent storage that keeps my configurations? What am I missing here?\n </p>\n <pre><code># mount\n/dev/mtdblock7 on / type squashfs (ro,relatime)\n/proc on /proc type proc (rw,relatime)\ntmpfs on /var type tmpfs (rw,relatime,size=15360k)\ntmpfs on /mnt type tmpfs (rw,relatime,size=16k)\nsysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,relatime)\ntmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,relatime,size=3096k)\nnone on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw,relatime)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Update:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Board\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is a ZTE router, the board has a printed label that says:\n  <code>\n   ZXHN H367N V1.0\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The default update file that uboot looks for when booting over tftp is called\n  <code>\n   H367N_image.bin\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Running zcu signature on the config file gives\n  <code>\n   ZXDSL 931VII V3.0\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The decryption password used to decrypt and encrypt the file is the same as the one used in\n  <code>\n   ZXHN H208N\n  </code>\n  according to\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/11626/zte-encrypted-backup-config-file#answer-25255\">\n   this\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, I remember seeing\n  <code>\n   H368N\n  </code>\n  somewhere, but I'm not sure where.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally I found paths that have the directory\n  <code>\n   H367N_Develop_UGW5.4\n  </code>\n  in them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   mtdblocks\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  (This is a summary of what binwalk found)\n </p>\n <p>\n  mtdblock0:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   List item crc\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   uImage header \"u-boot image\"\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   lzma\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  mtdblock1:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   UBI erease count header\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  mtdblock2:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   nothing found\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  mtdblock3:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   uImage header \"GPHY Firmware\"\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   lzma compression\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   uImage header \"GPHY Firmware\"\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   lzma compression\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   zlib compressed data\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   PEM RSA private key\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   PEM certificate\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   uImage header \"MIPS LTQCPE Linux-2.6.32.42\"\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   lzma\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   squashfs\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   uImage header \"MIPS LTQCPE Linux-2.6.32.42\"\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   lzma\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   squashfs\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  mtdblock4:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   uImage header \"GPHY Firmware\"\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   lzma\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   uImage header \"GPHY Firmware\"\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   lzma\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  mtdblock5:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   zlib compressed data\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   PEM RSA private key\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   PEM certificate\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  mtdblock6:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   uImage header \"MIPS LTQCPE Linux-2.6.32.42\"\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   lzma\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  mtdblock7:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   squashfs\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  mtdblock8:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   uImage header \"MIPS LTQCPE Linux-2.6.32.42\"\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   lzma\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  mtdblock9:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   squashfs\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  mtdblock10:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   nothing\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  mtdblock11:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   nothing\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  mtdblock6 and mtdblock8 are identical\nmtdblock7 and mtdblock9 are identical\nmtdblock3 contains the same binary as mtdblocks 6,7,8 and 9, and likely others as well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried remounting /dev/mtdblock7 but failed.

For starters, if it's small bits of information it may not end up in a different type of device (and specifically who says it has to be in a file system?). Also, in theory, a device could full well remount a certain file system read-write on-demand and then revert back to read only after being done saving data. What other MTD devices are there? What have you tried?\n</span>\n</body></html>",

That would give you exactly this result: No writable partitions but some binary is taking care of reading and writing to that NVRAM (wherever that might be). Check if there's anything called nvread, nvconf or something like that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If that's not successful you can always try to find a binary that uses a configurable option, load it into a Disassembler and see what's going on there.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
