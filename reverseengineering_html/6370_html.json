    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Id like to debug (to log function calls) native ARM Android Code in a shared library. So far I got no source and tried to disassemble it with IDA, but its hard to track all the calls down to a specific function.\n  \n\n  \n\n  So I came up with IDA's\n  <code>\n   android_server\n  </code>\n  , which didnt work(\n  <em>\n   not breaking on breakpoints, pausing takes me always to the same loop, cant step through\n  </em>\n  ) and Android NDK's\n  <code>\n   gbdserver\n  </code>\n  using as remote GDB Debugger in IDA based on that\n  <a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=35602033&postcount=5\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=35602033&postcount=5\n  </a>\n  which results in the same. Using NDK's\n  <code>\n   gdbserver\n  </code>\n  and cli\n  <code>\n   gdb\n  </code>\n  didnt work, cause it requires the (source) project folder.\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  Thats why Id like to ask if there is  a way to debug native code w/o source or tracking down the calls is possible?\n  \n\n  <em>\n   (in this case nearly all of the app runs on native code/the funcs Id like to track arent called directly over JNI)\n  </em>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

There are some commands that rely on source/symbols, like disassemble, but you can use commands like x/20i <address> instead.
