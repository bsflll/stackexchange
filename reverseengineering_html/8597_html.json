Assume that we have the following scenario:\n </p>\n <pre><code>                   + -----------------------+\n          004019EF |                        |   <----- we are here\n                   |   content of function  |\n                   |   004019EF             |\n                   |                        |\n                   |                        |\n                   +------------------------+\n                   |                        |\n                   |     this area contains |\n                   |     lines which        |\n                   |     I want to bypass   |\n                   |     quickly            |\n                   |                        |\n                   +------------------------+\n         00401E1F  |                        |     <-- we want to go here\n                   |     content which I    |\n                   |     want to analyze    |\n                   |                        |\n                   |                        |\n                   +------------------------+\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So, the situation is that I am for example at 004019EF and then I figured \nout that the location at 00401E1F also seems to be important. And I decide to go there. For that reason, I click on Ctrl+G, type the target address and\nset a breakpoint(clicking F2) at 00401E1F. Then I let it run. But the program doesn't reach the place. It terminates the process and ends at a location with RETN.\nSo, I started the process again. But this time, I step manually from line 004019EF to 00401E1F. On the way, I eliminate all the lines/instructions which leads to a termination by replacing them with a NOP instruction.\nAt the end, I reach the address 00401E1F.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My question would be :\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I replace instructions with a NOP or change the flags of jump-instructions to modify the execution flow of the programm, then will these modifications be a problem for the content of 00401E1F ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I mean can I say the following :\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"These instructions causing problems, so deleting them with NOP would be unproblematic\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  OR\n </p>\n <p>\n  Am I going to miss some results of the area between 004019EF and 00401E1F which could be important for the content of 00401E1F ? \nIf yes, then:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there another way to bypass that lines to reach the target address without patching/changing lines or instructions?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The most straightforward approach would be to just change\n   <code>\n    EIP\n   </code>\n   . This can of course be problematic though with regard to side effects.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   If the code before\n   <code>\n    00401E1F\n   </code>\n   is executed conditionally, satisfy whatever conditions are required such that that code doesn't get executed.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Consider this C code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>int size;\nint nelem=1;\nstruct whatever *data;\nif (debugger_is_running)\n    nelem-=2;                 // pass an unreasonable value to malloc\nsize=sizeof (struct whatever)*nelem;\nif ((data=malloc(size))==NULL)\n    abort_program(\"No memory\");\n......\n// use data here\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  It's the\n  <code>\n   nelems-=2\n  </code>\n  instruction you want to patch out. If you just\n  <code>\n   nop\n  </code>\n  out the call to\n  <code>\n   abort_program\n  </code>\n  , your data will still be a NULL pointer and cause the program to crash whenever you use it, much later.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You really need to analyze everything between your code blocks, find out how the program detects the debugger, and change that piece of code.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
