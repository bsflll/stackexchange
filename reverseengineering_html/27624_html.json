You need to remove the breakpoint and then assign the trace.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you set a function to be traced, and it doesn't print anything, put the cursor on the desired function, on the menu press\n  <code>\n   Debugger -> Tracing -> Function tracing\n  </code>\n  .  Try again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can view all the traces in the breakpoint window by pressing\n  <code>\n   Ctrl+Alt+B\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
