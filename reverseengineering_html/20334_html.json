They're not operator locked. I'm trying to use them on an American network for 3G connectivity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Even though they state \"850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz\" bands in their specs, and my network supposedly has UMTS on 850 MHz, I can only get a 2G (EDGE) connection and furthermore, they all detect my SIM card as out of network and put me in \"roaming\" mode.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've found out that the radios in these things are usually universal but the band limits are only in software. Therefore I was wondering if there would be any way (through undocumented AT commands or firmware flashing) I could get either one of these modems to switch allowed bands and let me get 3G speeds in North America.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Are there any resources where I can get AT command lists and/or different region firmware for these devices? Or is there anyone that could maybe point me in the right direction?\n </p>\n <p>\n  These are the devices I have:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Huawei E3131\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Huawei E353\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   ZTE MF190\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   D-Link DWM-156\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I tried flashing different versions of firmware and/or googling AT commands to change bands on some of these, but at the end, the moment I switch mode to 3G I get \"no service\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any help would be greatly appreciated...\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
