Since the delphi compiler version is not specified, I will assume it to be Delphi 7.\nI have tested the above scenario by making a demo application having\n  <code>\n   TEdit\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   TMemo\n  </code>\n  components.(\n  <a href=\"https://codeberg.org/k/delphi7snippets/raw/branch/main/OnChange_Event.pas\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   link to source code\n  </a>\n  )\n </p>\n <p>\n  For finding the section of code of the function\n  <code>\n   OnChange\n  </code>\n  of a text field, you need to search through the\n  <code>\n   .CODE\n  </code>\n  section of the file in Ollydbg. Though I would suggest you use a disassembler of your choice as it would make searching and analyzing\n  <code>\n   .CODE\n  </code>\n  section easier and faster.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, if I don't have another choice except Ollydbg, then I would right click on CPU view\n  <strong>\n   Search for\n  </strong>\n  ->\n  <strong>\n   All referenced text strings\n  </strong>\n  and then search for\n  <code>\n   TForm1\n  </code>\n  assuming the developer has not changed the default name of\n  <code>\n   TForm\n  </code>\n  . Clicking on the occurrence of\n  <code>\n   TForm1\n  </code>\n  would take me to\n  <code>\n   .CODE\n  </code>\n  section where the predefined text, names of components would reside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have attached 2 screenshots for reference:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/shBxJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Ollydbg screenshot\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/shBxJ.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n \n\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vyynE.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"ida screenshot\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vyynE.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   How to set breakpoint on any window show event:\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Right click on Disassembly/CPU view, click on\n  <strong>\n   Search for\n  </strong>\n  ->\n  <strong>\n   All intermodular calls\n  </strong>\n  , you will get the list of windows functions used by the application. Now you can set breakpoints individually or on all the calls of a specific function. for example. If you set a breakpoint on every\n  <code>\n   SendMessageA\n  </code>\n  function call then you can trace the method executed when the\n  <code>\n   TEdit\n  </code>\n  field is changed.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
