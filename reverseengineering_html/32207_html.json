Here's why:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Analyzing malware demands the skill to read and track its behavior.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   A significant portion of malware targets Windows and Linux on x86 systems, which underscores the importance of x86 assembly knowledge.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Based on data from\n   <a href=\"https://portal.av-atlas.org/malware\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    av-atlas\n   </a>\n   and other sources, the next major targets are Android and MacOS, emphasizing the need for ARM assembly knowledge.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The importance of ARM assembly in this area is growing as the number of devices with ARM processors increases, presenting more potential targets for malware.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  By learning x86 assembly, you address most of your assembly language related malware analysis requirements, with ARM assembly serving as a beneficial, and at times necessary, addition.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
