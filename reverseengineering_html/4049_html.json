Here is a paper about\n  <a href=\"http://www.comp.nus.edu/~liangzk/papers/asiaccs11.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Jump Oriented Programming\n  </a>\n  . Also,\n  <a href=\"https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~s/papers/noret_ccs2010/noret_ccs2010.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Return Oriented Programming without Returns\n  </a>\n  . They went through libc-2.7 (/lib/i686/cmov/libc-2.7.so of Debian Linux 5.0.4) and found alternative gadgets. These included gadgets ending in\n  <code>\n   jump\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   call\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   jump+call\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   ret\n  </code>\n  . Logically there will be more\n  <code>\n   ret\n  </code>\n  rop gadgets however there are still some extremely useful non-return gadgets such as the one below.\n </p>\n <pre><code>popa ; Load all registers\ncmc ; No practical effect\njmp far dword [ecx] ; Back to dispatcher via ecx\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Also seeing a call to a register is not uncommon especially when dealing with C++ binaries that leverage vtables for objects.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When ROP-ing on ARM its almost mandatory to use less traditional gadgets. Which includes branches into registers,e.g.\n  <code>\n   BX LR\n  </code>\n  (the most traditional return) or\n  <code>\n   BLX R3\n  </code>\n  , or straight loads into the program counter, e.g.\n  <code>\n   LDMFD SP!,{R3,PC}\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  As for are there non-useful rop gadgets, of course. There are many gadgets that will lose you control of execution. Depending on the amount of gadgets you have, you wont always have control of all registers so if you cant control say\n  <code>\n   edx\n  </code>\n  , any rop gadget that ends with a\n  <code>\n   call [edx]\n  </code>\n  is now not useful.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   EDIT:\n  </strong>\n  Added details about ARM Gadgets and link to Return Oriented Programming without Returns for more complete references.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
