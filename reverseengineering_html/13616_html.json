Everytime I tried to use it, it produces very large zip file that fill the disk until I reach a disk full error (using Linux).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am trying to understand what I did wrong, so here is a simple scenario hopefully to understand what I am doing wrong.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Steps:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ dd if=/dev/zero of=head bs=1 count=512\n$ dd if=/dev/zero of=tail bs=1 count=512\n$ wget https://github.com/devttys0/binwalk/archive/master.zip\n$ cat head binwalk-master.zip tail > full\n$ binwalk -z -C demo -D 'zip archive:zip:unzip %e' full\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Could someone please let me know why I am seeing the following:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ find demo\ndemo\ndemo/_full.extracted\ndemo/_full.extracted/483BD.zip\ndemo/_full.extracted/200.zip\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Where is this file coming from ?

But, because there is not any information in the header about the size, the worst case should be used and the whole remaining file should be written out.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Because the header identification cannot be perfect and false positives are possible, you cannot assume that the second header means the end of the first zip.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you want to extract the zip files without tail, you can do the followings:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Reverse the structure of the binary file. Generally every image part starts with a header with exact size information. You have to identify the header and size or offset values in it.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   If you works with a flash image, then you can perform entropy analysis, which helps to split the whole image into smaller parts.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   In a flash image, the parts are generally separated with several\n   <code>\n    0xFF\n   </code>\n   bytes from each others. You can also use this information to extract the image parts.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
