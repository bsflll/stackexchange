    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Good day!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sorry to come up with something very old. Since I am currently teaching myself hardware hacking, I wanted to use my old router for this. I soldered pins to the JTAG interface and connected them to my Pi2 GPIO. I connected them as follows:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/eFZ2l.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/eFZ2l.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n  Unfortunately, I cannot dump the firmware because the device does not want to switch to halt. Only time-out for halt request appears.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have changed the freq, checked for cold solder joints. (I don't have any errors)\n </p>\n <pre><code>init\nreset halt\nJTAG tap: bcm5352e.cpu tap/device found: 0x0535217f (mfg: 0x0bf, part:\n0x5352, ver: 0x0)\nHalt timed out, wake up GDB.\ntimed out while waiting for target halted\nTARGET: bcm5352e.cpu - Not halted\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Any ideas?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
