You can increase the length of the fields that you're seeing get truncated so that the entire contents can fit. This might make the document a little harder to read in an editor since you might have to scroll horizontally, but if you're scraping the output then perhaps this won't bother you.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
