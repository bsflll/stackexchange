At first the algorithm seems to:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Perform a SHA-1 for the 6 byte long MAC address\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    key\n   </code>\n   is memset with the size of 12, double the size of the MAC address, so theoretically to store the MAC address in the hexlify form\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   the loop uses 20, the size of the SHA-1 digest, you didn't share the size of the key buffer, but the memset seems useless, and\n   <code>\n    (i < (int)(n - 2)))\n   </code>\n   is a big redflag, this condition will break the for loop earlier\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    key\n   </code>\n   is duplicated to the\n   <code>\n    iv\n   </code>\n   buffer, 17 could be 128-bit + null char, but it doesn't make sense, because the key and iv have a fixed size, they don't have to be null terminated, maybe it's related to the hexlify and string operations, but the loop never null terminate the buffer anyway\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    aes_set_key(aesCtx,&key,128,0);\n   </code>\n   , I wonder what's the last parameter 0, same with\n   <code>\n    AES_cbc_encrypt(aesCtx,aesOut,aesOut,112,iv,0);\n   </code>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I also think a\n  <code>\n   strcpy\n  </code>\n  with fixed sizes could be optimized into a\n  <code>\n   memcpy\n  </code>\n  with string length + 1.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Overall, I think your analysis and the decompiled code is accurate, but the original code is really sketchy.\nThere's a chance the IV is actually based on uninitialized data, but one of the 0 parameter tells the IV size is 0, and thus ignored.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you can share more details or a use case, like inputs and expected output, it will help to figure out what happened.\n </p>\n <p>\n  BTW, did you identify the AES library used for this code?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
