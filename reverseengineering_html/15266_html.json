I've been expecting a large number of relocation entries (just like with Windows PE or Android ELF) but all the executables contain zero relocations (well, at least the\n  <code>\n   __text\n  </code>\n  section I'm interested in).\n </p>\n <p>\n  The\n  <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachOTopics/1-Articles/dynamic_code.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   oficial docs\n  </a>\n  say that this is because the segments are always located at a constant offset from each other and that makes sense to me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, can I take this for granted? Do all typical iOS applications contain no relocations because all the code and data are usually located in one binary (i. e., dynamic libraries are usually not used)?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I've described how they work\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/8836580\">\n   previously\n  </a>\n  . For even more gruesome details see dyld sources and inspect actual binaries.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
