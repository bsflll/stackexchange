As I use segment to separate something, now I want my name automatically shows in the following form\n  \n\n  <code>\n   9     dseg_1234      the same as 2, but without data type specifier\n  </code>\n  ,\n  \n\n  which is described in\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/609.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/609.shtml\n  </a>\n  \n\n  The Java processor and loader can change the name representation to number 9 without any additional settings. However I failed to find any code relating to changing the name representation :(\n  \n\n  So how does the Java processor change this option?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
