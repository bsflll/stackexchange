Pulling the binary and running\n  <code>\n   otool -L\n  </code>\n  on it reveals, unsurprisingly, that it's linked against\n  <code>\n   /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreMedia.framework/CoreMedia\n  </code>\n  .  However, that directory on the phone doesn't have any file called\n  <code>\n   CoreMedia\n  </code>\n  .  In fact, all it has are two\n  <code>\n   .plist\n  </code>\n  files and some text file called\n  <code>\n   CodeResources\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Where is the actual Mach-O file for the CoreMedia framework?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You can find this cache on the phone at\n  <code>\n   /System//Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld/dyld_shared_cache_arm64\n  </code>\n  .
