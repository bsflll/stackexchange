This will be easier if e.g. it's the only instance of that value in the calculation, and hasn't been merged with other values at compile time. But it's going to be a lot simpler and safer to just modify the source and recompile with the new value. If you don't have the source yourself your first step should be to talk to the people who do.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
