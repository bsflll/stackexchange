For example I get the same with just\n <code>\n  -m\n </code>\n but the\n <code>\n  [uc]\n </code>\n works perfectly fine for me.

It does work on WinDbg, I made a mistake (I did\n <code>\n  !db [uc] 00000000`fffffff0\n </code>\n which didn't work at that time because I was on bootmgr (so it couldnt read past 4GiB). I tried it again on WinDbg with\n <code>\n  !db [uc] 00000000`ffffff00\n </code>\n and it worked). This however does not work on\n <code>\n  kd -kl\n </code>\n no matter what, which is a shame because I'm more interested in my own hardware -- RwEverything is what I have to use\n</span>\n</body></html>",
