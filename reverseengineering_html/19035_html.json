    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have been attempting to reverse engineer a format for a visual novel psp game ('Mirai Nikki RE: WRITE - 13 Ninme No Nikki Shoyuusha') and I have come to the understanding that the format works as a type of archive by looking at the boot.elf file of the game. From this decoded boot.elf file I learnt that music is stored in the format at3 (which is atrac3) and sound effects as fsb (fmod sound bank). There are multiple 'MIG' files which I believe are actually GIM files which is a format used by the PSP for images (these are likely the character portraits, backgrounds and ui). The string YKLZ is also repeated throughout the file and seems to act as a sort of file or directory end. The header T2FP also occurs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After learning this I have hit a wall as I am unsure of how to progress in getting the files as I do not know how it is encrypted or where the files start and end. If anyone can tell me how I could go about reversing the decryption function in an emulator or can provide any help about the file it would be greatly appreciated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/sa38i7asc699glv/ULJM05565.BIN?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Decrypted boot.elf\">\n   Decrypted boot.elf\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/i2dxvjfo45dalfx/res.ptd?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"The game archive file\">\n   The game archive file\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit: The hex code 87 4C 74 68 also occurs multiple times throughout the file.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

A good place to find people to inquire with might be the Henkaku Discord server:\n <a href=\"https://discord.gg/2bfq4XA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  discord.gg/2bfq4XA\n </a>\n There are primarily Vita hackers there, but they're a knowledgeable lot and should be able to point you in a good direction.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
