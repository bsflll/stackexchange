In which section i can find variable names and it's sizes?\n  \n\n  then i have another doubt as you can see in the picture there is some address like  00402000. is it the address of a byte which exist in harddrive?\n  \n\n  like RAM , HardDisk also an has address for each byte?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Information about variables such as name, size and type are high-level language concepts. Such information is lost when code written in a high-level language is compiled into machine code. This is part of the reason why reverse engineering binary executables can be challenging.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Read the answers to this question:\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/16811/how-data-types-and-variables-are-converted-to-machine-code\">\n   how data types and variables are converted to machine code?\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The bit width of a value (half-word, word, double word, etc) can sometimes be inferred from the read/write operations performed on it; if it is written from memory into a register, you can look at the size of the register.\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  is 32 bit,\n  <code>\n   al\n  </code>\n  is 16 bits, etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To locate statically allocated variables, disassemble the function(s) in which they are accessed. Pointers (memory addresses) to these variables will be operands in instructions that access these values.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In your case this means disassembling\n  <code>\n   main()\n  </code>\n  . Since nothing is done with the variables in\n  <code>\n   main()\n  </code>\n  other than reassignment, it is possible that the compiler did not generate any code referencing these variables (dead code elimination).\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   then i have another doubt as you can see in the picture there is some address like 00402000. is it the address of a byte which exist in harddrive?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  This is an address in virtual memory.
