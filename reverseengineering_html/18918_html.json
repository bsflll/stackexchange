    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  So I was messing with an interesting keygenme, written in C++, which derives the key based on the values of the\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/unmanaged-api/metadata/osinfo-structure\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   OSINFO\n  </a>\n  structure. Now, when checking for a valid key it uses the following instruction:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   CMP EAX, DWORD PTR DS:[key]\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  My question is: why isn't the key stored in a local variable or something like:\n  <code>\n   [EBP-X]\n  </code>\n  ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  How would I translate it back into C++ so that it stores the key in\n  <code>\n   DS:[key]\n  </code>\n  rather than in the stack?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
