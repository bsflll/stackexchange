    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am trying to attach debug a program that has an \"anti-debug\" feature on it.  When stepping through, it seems to step through a maze of call and jmp commands that eventually just loop around.  The loop only happens when stepping line by line and I am trying to understand it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I don't know if there is added obfuscation, but why would lines such as this appear?\n </p>\n <pre><code>014D658C   0FCA    BSWAP EDX\n014D658E   0FCA    BSWAP EDX\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  If I understand correctly, BSWAP will just invert the bits, but twice in a row should leave the EDX register untouched.  I've also noticed other strange things like comparing registers and then seemingly doing nothing with the result (no jump calls after or setcc or anything like that)\n </p>\n <pre><code>014D657C   66:81FF 8408     CMP DI,884\n014D6581   30D8             XOR AL,BL\n014D6583   8D96 1A30A4DD    LEA EDX,DWORD PTR DS:[ESI+DDA4301A]\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The two\n <code>\n  BSWAP\n </code>\n s don't do anything (watch out for code jumping to the second\n <code>\n  BSWAP\n </code>\n however, and the\n <code>\n  CMP DI,884\n </code>\n doesn't do anything either (as the the next instruction resets the flags). This may be an attempt to evade antivirus signatures as well, by introducing nonsense into the code that can be modified to different nosense easily.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
