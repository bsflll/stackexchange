Should that mean that the firmware for it will be some variant of ARM ISA/opcodes (because it's machine code for the ARM processor)? If so, where should I begin decrypting and should I continue to determine, if possible for me, what version of ARM, ISA (instruction-set=architecture), etc.?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The firmware has a magic number right at the beginning of the file (which just says the company's name), but afterwards it has unencrypted bytes, then more magic numbers, then encrypted bytes, then more magic numbers, then more unencrypted bytes, etc., etc. You can tell the encrypted parts apart because each byte has a completely inane ASCII character that no other part of the file has, and they're in followed segments. This says clearly that these are irregular, encrypted ranges of bytes.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Look around, you'll see that many questions even provide links to the downloadable firmware. As it is right now, the only answer you can get is probably \"run binwalk and signsrch on it and see what happens\". If it's ARM, it's likely it runs some kind of linux, which in turn makes it likely that you're dealing with some kind of squashfs.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

You have to identify the\n    <strong>\n     FileFormat\n    </strong>\n    type (usually by boot sector first\n    <code>\n     512\n    </code>\n    Bytes). Then extract the files inside and start over again from scratch. Sometimes helps if you take an\n    <strong>\n     USB\n    </strong>\n    key and write the file system dump to it 1:1 and then try to access it from OS that supports various fileformats.

Beware there could be no\n    <strong>\n     ID\n    </strong>\n    string present. You are basically looking for hex encoded length or offset in file that would add up to file size or next chunk structure that have the length at specific chunk offset or in separated table. Do not forget it can be booth\n    <strong>\n     LSB or MSB\n    </strong>\n    first do not assume anything. Length/offsets are usually encoded\n    <code>\n     16/32/64\n    </code>\n    bit (\n    <code>\n     2/4/8\n    </code>\n    BYTE) Also try to find repeating patterns (if some kind of header of chunk is present)\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     Identify file system\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    some\n    <strong>\n     FS\n    </strong>\n    have specific\n    <strong>\n     ID\n    </strong>\n    at some offset so look for that (like\n    <code>\n     FAT32\n    </code>\n    ,...). Most\n    <strong>\n     FS\n    </strong>\n    use\n    <strong>\n     FAT+DIR\n    </strong>\n    tables so look for something like this:\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <img alt=\"MDOS DIR example\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Iobw6.png\"/>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    this is how\n    <strong>\n     DIR\n    </strong>\n    table looks like in\n    <strong>\n     MDOS\n    </strong>\n    file system. It is a structure holding all files/directories of the disc. Each file should have encoded name,type(extension),start sector,length.\n   </p>\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     <code>\n      E5 hex = 229 dec\n     </code>\n     usually marks free directory space (in many FS systems)\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n   <p>\n    so if you know any filename that should be present in the target system you could look for it to locate\n    <strong>\n     DIR\n    </strong>\n    table ...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    <img alt=\"MDOS FAT example\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/A9bv9.png\"/>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    this is how\n    <strong>\n     FAT\n    </strong>\n    table looks like in\n    <strong>\n     MDOS\n    </strong>\n    . The\n    <strong>\n     FAT\n    </strong>\n    holds information about each sector/cluster of the disc. In this case it is 12 bit so each value is 1.5 Byte long !!! Some values mark sectors as system/reserved (non usable),bad,free or if any other value present then it is an index of next sector that is connected to this like in linked list. While decoding take in mind that endianess could be both little or big\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <strong>\n     To identify bin memory dump\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    In this case the file is memory dump of your arm\n    <strong>\n     OS\n    </strong>\n    . That mean you should look for specific parts of program like:\n   </p>\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     interrupt table\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     specific program tokens (what it prints out... )\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     graphics\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n   <p>\n    The last two are pretty straightforward so I will add info only for the interrupts. Interrupts on most processors have fixed location in memory so for each interrupt there is few bytes reserved. In this place is usually some jump instruction present that jump should lead to interrupt handler routine which should end with specific end of interrupt instructions like:\n    <code>\n     reti\n    </code>\n    ,\n    <code>\n     retn\n    </code>\n    or by setting/reseting specific register to mark interrupt was handled ...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    So look for tightly packed jump instructions inside bin and if found check if their count and distance match the\n    <strong>\n     CPU\n    </strong>\n    datasheet. Also you can check if somewhere near the jump address is return from interrupt present. If yes then you have all you need. Offset of the interrupt table is usually fixed ... so you should easily find out where from the bin dump starts in the target device memory map.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Beware your bin can have offset encoding like the Intel hex files\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
