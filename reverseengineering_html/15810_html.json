    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am working on a reverse engineering task, in which I need to recover function prototype (including number of parameters, type of each parameter) from the input binary (\n  <code>\n   ELF\n  </code>\n  binary on\n  <code>\n   64-bit\n  </code>\n  Linux).\n </p>\n <p>\n  While\n  <code>\n   IDA-Pro\n  </code>\n  can be guided to recover function prototype for functions defined inside the binary code, I am trapped in recovering library functions invoked inside the binary code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov str_pointer, %rdi\ncall puts  <---- Library function \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So here is my question:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   can I use IDA-Pro to somehow recover the library function's prototype?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   If notï¼Œit seems to me that I can benefit from some database on this info? Could anyone shed some lights on this?\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Thanks\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you have the decompiler, just decompile it and check if the prototype it guessed is right. Often you will need to fix things manually. However, I can assure these ways work because I actually use them almost daily.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
