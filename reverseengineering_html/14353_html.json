    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I wrote a simple IDAPython script that only prints out local functions and ignores library functions. But somehow, it prints every single function. Here is the script:\n </p>\n <pre><code>import idc, idautils\nfor func in idautils.Functions():\n    flags = idc.GetFunctionFlags(func)\n    # Ignore library functons\n    if flags & FUNC_LIB:\n        continue\n    print idc.GetFunctionName(func)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I based my script from the second code snippet in this tutorial (\n  <a href=\"http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/06/unit42-using-idapython-to-make-your-life-easier-part-6/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/06/unit42-using-idapython-to-make-your-life-easier-part-6/\n  </a>\n  ).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Aside from 'extern,' I also need to make sure that segment name is not \".plt,\" \".init,\" or \".fini.\" So to simplify the code, I just check if segment name equals \".text\" or not.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

In IDA-speak, \"library function\" means \"a function from a (compiler) standard library\", i.e. a function recognised by a FLIRT signature (usually colored in cyan). These are encountered in practice mostly in statically-linked Windows executables. On Linux and OS X the standard functions usually come from shared libraries so you will need another way to distinguish them - e.g. what what was suggested in the comments.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
