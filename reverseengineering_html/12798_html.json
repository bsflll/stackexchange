Steam is used for multiplayer and online games. So it is very likely that the original value is stored on a server and only the value to be displayed is sent to you in a network package. Cheating by memory modification doesn't help much there. Usually input and graphics hacks are used with online and multiplayer games.\n </p>\n <p>\n  ugtrain can only help if you want to lock/freeze/refill a local memory value you've already found and successfully modified with scanmem. I'm maintaining both tools. Talk to me on GitHub.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
