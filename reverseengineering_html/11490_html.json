The data at that memory address may get read or written, but won't get executed¹ since it's not code. Software breakpoints are only useful on code that gets executed, and since the data at that memory address won't get executed, a software breakpoint won't be helpful.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   ¹ There are exceptions to this, but it's out of context for your question.\n  </em>\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   How can I set such a breakpoint in gdb?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  In gdb, you can set a hardware breakpoint on the memory address pointed to by\n  <code>\n   ESP\n  </code>\n  by setting a\n  <strong>\n   watchpoint\n  </strong>\n  , which is documented\n  <a href=\"https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Set-Watchpoints.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
