I successfully extracted the cramfs filesystem and now I have the following files inside the cramfs-root directory:\n </p>\n <pre><code>-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2289232 Dec 31  1969 gui_res.tar.lzma\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root     744 Dec 31  1969 new_10.bin\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 Dec 15  2015 Player_ml\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  824944 Dec 31  1969 player.zip\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    2936 Dec 31  1969 start.sh\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6213824 Dec 31  1969 sys_app.tar.lzma\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 3585544 Dec 31  1969 uImage\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1881320 Dec 31  1969 WebComponents.exe\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  689296 Dec 31  1969 webs.tar.lzma\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I tried using unlzma and tar --lzma -xvf to extract the *.tar.lzma files, but I had no luck. I came across\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/13619/open-a-non-standard-compression-tar-lzma-file-extracted-from-firmware-download\" title=\"this post\">\n   this post\n  </a>\n  which suggested running the kernel in an emulator in the hopes of finding the necessary extraction tools there. I've been tearing through QEMU documentation and online videos but I can't figure out exactly what I need to do to get QEMU to run the uImage kernel using qemu-system-arm. What do I need to do in order to get the kernel to run?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
