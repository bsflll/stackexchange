I have two things: 1) the binary for the program 2) a packet dump from Wireshark (I am still able to get another dump, if needed). Now, the protocol, from what I can see from the dumps, is TLS/SSL (not sure which one) encrypted. I am aware that Wireshark has the capabilities to decrypt these packets, given that I have the required keys.. but how in the world do I extract the keys out of the binary?\n </p>\n <p>\n  tl;dr Can I access plaintext SSL given the originating binary?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

With the amount of proprietary systems that exist today (synchronization protocols, instant messaging, etc.), the amount of work required to keep up when developing interoperable solutions will quickly become a big burden when limited to traditional techniques. However, when the sniffing is done on the API level it allows a much more fine-grained view of what's going on.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  oSpy works by attaching to the process whose traffic you want to analyze and then monitor certain APIs.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
