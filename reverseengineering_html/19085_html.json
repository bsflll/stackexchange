Uhm, actually setting a breakpoint will in fact - through operating system facilities - typically end up as some kind of \"hook function\" being called. Alas you don't specify the environment (such as the OS) you're running in and it's not exactly clear what you're looking for, given how breakpoints pretty much\n <i>\n  already\n </i>\n achieve what you want (in particular hardware-assisted breakpoints, whose number is limited, though).\n</span>\n</body></html>",

You cannot do this in user mode, however. The hooks you cite deal with user mode DLL entry points, which is easy to achieve. The paging mechanism is implemented in the kernel, at Ring 0, so basically you will need to write a driver which, in case of a Page Fault, checks if the address is in the range you want monitored and, if yes, calls your function; otherwise calls the default kernel routines. Quite tricky to do, especially on Windows (Linux is somewhat easier) and you risk in de-stabilizing the entire system.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is what kernel-mode debuggers such as SoftICE  (\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftICE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftICE\n  </a>\n  ) or WinDbg (\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/getting-started-with-windbg--kernel-mode-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/getting-started-with-windbg--kernel-mode-\n  </a>\n  ) do.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you really want to go for it, a good starting point for information is here:\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18431261/how-does-x86-paging-work\">\n   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18431261/how-does-x86-paging-work\n  </a>\n  and of course\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  PS: No way to do it for registers\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
