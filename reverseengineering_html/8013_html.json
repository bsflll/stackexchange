    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to change the icon of a .exe file, normally a simple task but this .exe file is a installer and for some reason when after I change or remove the icon, the exe shrinks in size from 300 mb to 12 kb and crashes when it runs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've tried using Resource Hacker to either replace the icon or remove it but when I try to save it, the result ends up as a tiny file which crashes when it runs. I also tried using IconChanger 3.8 and the same thing happened. I cannot change any resources on the file using Resource Hacker. If I attempt to modify version info, description, anything, it will save as a tiny 12 kb file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there some kind of protection against changing resources that I don't know about? What can I do in this situation? Any other methods that might work for changing an icon or removing its icon in this situation?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If IconChanger or Resource Hacker don't recognize that resource, they'll probably throw it away.

The overlay is located at the end of the sections. When a\n  <code>\n   PE\n  </code>\n  is loaded the overlay is\n  <strong>\n   not\n  </strong>\n  mapped into the memory of the process.\n </p>\n <p>\n  An overlay is common with installers, self extracting archives etc. In order to extract the overlay, you can use any decent PE editor such as\n  <em>\n   <a href=\"http://exeinfo.atwebpages.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    exeinfope\n   </a>\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <em>\n   <a href=\"http://ntinfo.biz/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Detect It Easy\n   </a>\n  </em>\n  or like\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2014/how-can-one-extract-the-appended-data-of-a-portable-executable\">\n   this\n  </a>\n  way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hence for your problem, I would suggest to dump the overlay, make required modifications on the PE, and finally re-append back the dumped overlay to the end of the executable.\n  \n\n  For the last step you can use a Hex Editor or the\n  <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/71161\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   MS-DOS COPY command\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
