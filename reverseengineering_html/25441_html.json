    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have thousands of old backup files from EaseUs Todo Backup. They are incremental backups saved inside a \".pbd\" file (EaseUs's proprietary backup format). I've tried to get my files out using their official tools, but they dont work due to the amount of files I have. I want to write my own program to take these files out and extract them to a more common format like .zip.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I figure I'd start by using their software to backup a simple text file (with contents \"hello world\"), then change that text file to \"hello world123\" and run another incremental backup. This way I can compare the two initial files to see where the file names/contents are stored within the binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here are the two test files:\n  <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/6fhqrkodz68vgv0/backups.zip\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/6fhqrkodz68vgv0/backups.zip\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Screenshot of files:\n  <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/a4pui0hugym10xq/explorer_sWDcZaogNa.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/a4pui0hugym10xq/explorer_sWDcZaogNa.png\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I compare the two files in a hex editor, I can't seem to find where the names/contents are, and how I can parse these files in software. This is the first time I've reverse engineered anything native (I've decompiled java/c# a bunch) so any tips/advice are appreciated.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
