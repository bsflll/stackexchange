If you would like a great example of use cases to see both in action (individually and together), consider the following workshop:\n  <a href=\"https://www.begin.re/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   Reverse Engineering for Beginners\n  </a>\n  (specifically,\n  <a href=\"https://www.begin.re/hacking-minesweeper\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   the final section\n  </a>\n  regarding hacking Minesweeper)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Actually, it isn't maintained any more (or is it?) while IDA is actively maintained. One real advantage over IDA, however, is that OllyDbg is freeware while IDA is a commercial application and its freeware version lacks debugging capabilities.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
