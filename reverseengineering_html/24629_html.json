Also support for\n  <strong>\n   CAN bus\n  </strong>\n  (OBD2 scanning and sniffing) has been added. Supported protocols: ISO9141, ISO14230, ISO15765, CAN Raw.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The program is still growing. I added lots of new features in the last months.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now it can also download the\n  <strong>\n   flash memory\n  </strong>\n  from the MT05 ECU with the calibration tables, correct the checksum and program the flash memory (tuning).\n </p>\n <p>\n  HUD ECU Hacker finds\n  <strong>\n   calibration tables\n  </strong>\n  automatically in a flash memory file. It finds approx 170 tables and 500 scalar values.\nCalibration tables can also be displayed as 3D model.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Download and detailed description here:\n  <a href=\"https://netcult.ch/elmue/HUD%20ECU%20Hacker/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://netcult.ch/elmue/HUD%20ECU%20Hacker/\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XTK5s.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"HUD ECU Hacker Control\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XTK5s.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/poGcy.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"HUD ECU Hacker Dashboard\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/poGcy.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tX8PI.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"HUD ECU Hacker Graph\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tX8PI.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tIzbr.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"HUD ECU Hacker Delphi MT05 Calibration Table Tuning\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tIzbr.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Z0N7f.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"HUD ECU Hacker Delphi MT05  Calibration Table Tuning 3D\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Z0N7f.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
