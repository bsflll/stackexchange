After that I'd take a backup of the packed and the unpacked IDB and then proceed with either of the choices IDA gives and then backtrack and use the other choice if the former doesn't work. If your VM crashes the state of the DB is likely in an inconsistent state, so the best bet is to contact\n <code>\n  support@hex-rays.com\n </code>\n . Otherwise you can use the SDK and the IDA book to figure out the details of the IDB format and extract what details you can salvage.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

And while it makes sense to ask Hex-Rays support it makes equally sense to inquire about a public key. For example it could be that the IDB contains sensitive data that must not get to any third party under any circumstances. So I think regardless of the background it's a valid and valuable questions. I for one hope to see an answer pointing to such publicly available tool. Even if it may only sate my appetite for curiosity about the IDB format without digging into\n <code>\n  netnode.hpp\n </code>\n ;)\n</span>\n</body></html>",

That's the nature of proprietary binary databases: if you're hosed, you've got to keep all the pieces.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But I may suggest that you should foresee and be prepared to IDA database corruption, which is imminent and happens sooner or later to almost everyone. So:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Prefer using unpacked database (less bugs to trigger in IDA).\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Make backup of binary database files early and often.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Save your database as an IDC file early and often (File -> Produce File -> Dump database to IDC file).\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Give step 3 a special attention - an IDC file is your ticket out of IDA walled garden. It is known that it doesn't contain all the information IDA stores in the database, but it has most important, and it is a text file which you can re-import into IDA to restart analysis with just an executable file, or process with a simple script to filter out needed data, etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Overall, the problem of database corruption can be solved only with an open tool which uses database in open format. As a shameless plug, I work on interactive disassembler which stores database in a simple text format -\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/pfalcon/ScratchABit\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   ScratchABit\n  </a>\n  . Sooner or later, IDC import script will be written for it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
