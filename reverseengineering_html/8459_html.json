I now have a large array of bytes I cannot use directly in the shellcode. My idea is to load the code, then manipulate it with add/sub and such in a first stage, then execute the decoded instructions later on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The decoding however does not\n  <em>\n   always\n  </em>\n  work properly. Mostly, when I try to use pointers like\n  <code>\n   [rax]\n  </code>\n  , the content read during runtime is not the same as the one read by\n  <code>\n   gdb\n  </code>\n  . Here is a simplified version of what I am trying to do :\n </p>\n <pre><code>decrypt:\n  cmp byte [rax], 0x66\n  jae no_change\n  cmp byte [rax], 0\n  je no_change\n    add byte [rax], 0x3f\n\nno_change:\n  inc [rax]\n  loop decrypt\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This does not work. Usually\n  <code>\n   [rax]\n  </code>\n  is not read properly. However when I add a few\n  <code>\n   NOP\n  </code>\n  instructions in front of the\n  <code>\n   no_change\n  </code>\n  label then it works correct. I just don't get why I can't use\n  <code>\n   [rax]\n  </code>\n  to point to any location.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This sounds like you're using absolute addresses, and the error comes from the overhead introduced by debugging with gdb that creates an offset for any absolute address compared to when you run the program without debugger.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
