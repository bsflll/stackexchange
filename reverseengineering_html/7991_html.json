The other tools (except JSwat) from the top-voted answer aren't actually debuggers (even though some claim that in their description.) JSwat probably never had byte-code level stepping based on its more detail description (on github) and has also been dead for 10+ years.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Your best bet: use jdb (with\n  <code>\n   step\n  </code>\n  ) and watch the\n  <code>\n   bci\n  </code>\n  (byte code instruction) counter, while having the disassembled file on the side.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you wonder what Recaf is: a perhaps better version of Bytecode Viewer, but still not a debugger. These two are static analyzers that let you search for strings, method/field site calls etc. Recaf lets you also modify bytecode and reassemble. (Sometimes the result is broken though, esp. with newer features like INVOKEDYNAMIC.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  And if you want to try your hand at dynamic instrumentation, btrace is a modern/supported tool and can run in unsafe mode, in which it can modify stuff. Ibid Byte Buddy. Neither is a debugger as such though. They substitute for the defunct JavaSnoop though (but are not 'zero-conf' unlike that thingy). Both of these [as did JavaSnoop] use the Java agent interface, not the debugging API.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now to be slightly more pedantic on the last point, Oracle/Sun did unify the APIs under one umbrella of JVMTI, so the\n  <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/jvmti/jvmti.html#SingleStep\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   step function\n  </a>\n  and the bytecode\n  <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/jvmti/jvmti.html#RetransformClasses\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   retransform\n  </a>\n  are in the same thingy, but generally tools that use one don't use the other and vice-versa.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
