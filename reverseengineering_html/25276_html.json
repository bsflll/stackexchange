This can be done by going to Edit -> Tools Options. This would bring you to a page as seen in the screenshot below\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ihwZg.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ihwZg.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Under the Analysis options in the Decompiler folder, there is a checkbox called \"Eliminate unreachable code\", uncheck that and apply the option. I hope this helps!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
