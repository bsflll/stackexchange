Except\n  <code>\n   ImportDescriptor\n  </code>\n  gets an RVA of 0x6000, when inspecting\n  <code>\n   ModuleBase + 0x6000\n  </code>\n  for the RVA it shows that this memory region is invalid, so I believe that the 0x6000 RVA is incorrect and I'm not sure why\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   BUG CHECK CODES:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   BSOD Error Code: PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   BUG Check Code: 50\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I think with more than sixteen years of Windows KM development and some formal training in the subject matter, I know a thing or two. And even if you don't dabble in KM your are certainly aware that assertions don't fire in \"release\" (free) builds, but do in \"debug\" (checked) ones. Heck that's the whole reason for the name checked builds in the first place. Similarly macros expand differently. Loads of them actually. Now one could argue that this is \"technically\" not altering the logic. But in fact it is, because differently expanding macros mean different code...</span>",

If I end up writing an answer, it will be a different one. So long I'll make this non-answer a community wiki, attempting to give clues, ask for details and point to resources.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Correct me if I'm wrong but since kernel drivers share the same\naddress space I can just simply use memcpy or RtlCopyMemory [...]\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Uhm this statement is \"sort of\" true, but then it also isn't. It depends on so many aspects in (Windows) kernel mode. While the address space (i.e. min through max address) is\n  <em>\n   technically\n  </em>\n  the same, it depends a whole lot in which context your code executes (e.g. the IRQL) and of the attributes for the memory you attempt to access (e.g. NonPagedPool vs. PagedPool).\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, this is introductory material for KM driver development, so I recommend you pick up a book such as \"Windows Kernel Programming\" from Pavel Yosifovich or even the somewhat older work \"Programming the Microsoft Windows Driver Model\" from Walter Oney. The courses offered by OSR and Yosifovich would also be a great way to learn this stuff.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Besides you forgot to mention\n  <em>\n   which\n  </em>\n  bug-check code you're getting. This is very much relevant to help you. The parameters included in the bug-check can also give an idea in absence of a full memory dump (or in your case a live debug session). The parameters are those four items included alongside the bug-check code in a blue screen.\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   At what IRQL is your code executing during the bug-check? You can't touch\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   How is the code marked in your driver? (e.g.\n   <code>\n    PAGED_CODE()\n   </code>\n   or similar?)\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     Also, in case you attempt this in\n     <code>\n      DriverEntry\n     </code>\n     that one always runs at\n     <code>\n      PASSIVE_LEVEL\n     </code>\n     either way ...\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Who is the caller of the function?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Assuming you're not doing this inside an I/O request code path, you're still fairly wasteful with stack. KM code has quite the limits when it comes to available stack.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   All the above questions, comments, remarks also should be checked for code you call (such as\n   <code>\n    Log::Debug()\n   </code>\n   ).\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  That said, your above statement should be true for all intents and purposes at\n  <code>\n   PASSIVE_LEVEL\n  </code>\n  and to some extent at\n  <code>\n   APC_LEVEL\n  </code>\n  . But even then it pays of to make use of SEH for some code and make use of\n  <code>\n   MmIsAddressValid\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   ProbeForRead\n  </code>\n  and similar routines as appropriate.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Btw:\n  </strong>\n  perhaps you'd like instead to tell us what it is you're trying?
