It says:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Cannot Reach Destination From current location\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Any reason for this problem ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit:\nThe Program is Trying to\n  <code>\n   CreateFileA\n  </code>\n  .\nIt Then makes a\n  <code>\n   cmp\n  </code>\n  between\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   0FFFFFFFFh\n  </code>\n  ( i am guessing it returns -1 if file doesnt exist ).\nMore Information\n  <code>\n   jnz     short FileExist ; Jump if Not Zero (ZF=0)\n  </code>\n  Changing that to\n  <code>\n   jmp short FileExist\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit 2: \nSo I changed the hex code for the jmp and it works but when i do it by assembly it doesnt , still yet to find out why.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Your new jnz destination is probably outside that range. There is another jnz (opcode 0x0f 0x85) that has a longer parameter, but if your current instruction is the 0x75, you have only 2 bytes, and you don't have space for the longer one. See, for example,\n <a href=\"http://www.mathemainzel.info/files/x86asmref.html#jne\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  mathemainzel.info/files/x86asmref.html#jne\n </a>\n</span>\n</body></html>",

(And fill in any extra bytes with nop)That will set your flags appropriately and it's much easier than computing jump targets.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
