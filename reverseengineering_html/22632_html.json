What you do is patch the portion you’re interested in and then apply the changes and write to a new exe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If this is something you see yourself doing quite a bit, you can program it and do it that way. If you end up going that route, you can use\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/erocarrera/pefile\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   pefile\n  </a>\n  with Python or put a little bit more work in and do it in C/CPP.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
