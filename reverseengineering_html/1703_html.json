Your link error is likely due to an incorrect edit which changed some offsets within the file. If you don't adjust the offsets, you have to replace a string with a string that is no longer than the original, and you cannot add new fields unless you have a known amount of slack space available.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Use\n  <code>\n   readelf -a\n  </code>\n  to check the ELF file headers, and compare old with new.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
