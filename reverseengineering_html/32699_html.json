    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I want to modify a firmware image for a WiFi router. The image file consist of an UBI image, 0x04100000 bytes in size. Additonally, 20 bytes of unknown metadata have been appended to the UBI image data. I have two different official firmware files for this router. After comparing those 20 bytes of both files I am convinced now that the first 4 bytes are a 32 bit CRC of some sort.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Because CRC32 is very common, I tried CRC32 with various common start values and polynominals without luck. I applied it only across the UBI data before those 20 bytes, the UBI data with the remaining 16 bytes and the UBI data with the whole 20 bytes while using a 0x00000000 and 0xffffffff placeholder for the CRC.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/g7v4f.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/g7v4f.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  What could I try next? Is there a way to programatically find CRC32 start values/polynominals when the data and CRC are given?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here are the files:\n  <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/15n_Pg8zeSOf_VCcflWoTaMm8MwxBaFXk/view?usp=drive_link\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://drive.google.com/file/d/15n_Pg8zeSOf_VCcflWoTaMm8MwxBaFXk/view?usp=drive_link\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Decompiling the Broadcom CFE bootloader that installs the firmware would be an option but isn't going to be easy at all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
