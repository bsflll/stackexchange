How can I load debug symbols from that? It would help to see the types, function names, class names, etc. from the code calling the library.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Other than by manually hunting down and changing signatures in the decompiled code. There must be an easier way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  (If there's a way to do this in IDA, I can switch to that instead, just for this.)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
