However, it should not be assumed that all C library functions execute system calls, as none of the\n  <code>\n   string.h\n  </code>\n  library functions, including\n  <code>\n   strcmp\n  </code>\n  ,  execute any system calls.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   A system call is a controlled entry point into the kernel, allowing a process to request that the kernel perform some action on the process’s behalf. The kernel makes a range of services accessible to programs via the system call application programming interface (API).\n   <sup>\n    1\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  The mechanism by which system calls are made is quite different than by that which function calls are made:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   The [C library] wrapper function executes a trap machine instruction (\n   <code>\n    int 0x80\n   </code>\n   ), which causes the processor to switch from user mode to kernel mode and execute code pointed to by location\n   <code>\n    0x80\n   </code>\n   (128 decimal) of the system’s trap vector.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   More recent x86-32 architectures implement the\n   <code>\n    sysenter\n   </code>\n   instruction, which provides a faster method of entering kernel mode than the conventional int\n   <code>\n    0x80\n   </code>\n   trap instruction.

The canary value is then checked before the function returns; if it has changed, the program will abort. Generally, stack buffer overflow (aka \"stack smashing\") attacks will have to change the value of the canary as they write beyond the end of the buffer before they can get to the return pointer. Since the value of the canary is unknown to the attacker, it cannot be replaced by the attack. Thus, the stack protection allows the program to abort when that happens rather than return to wherever the attacker wanted it to go.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/584225/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n     4\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Here is some example annotated code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>000000000040055d <test>:\n  40055d:   55                      push   %rbp\n  40055e:   48 89 e5                mov    %rsp,%rbp\n  400561:   48 83 ec 20             sub    $0x20,%rsp\n  400565:   89 7d ec                mov    %edi,-0x14(%rbp)\n  400568:   64 48 8b 04 25 28 00    mov    %fs:0x28,%rax     <- get guard variable value\n  40056f:   00 00 \n  400571:   48 89 45 f8             mov    %rax,-0x8(%rbp)   <- save guard variable on stack\n  400575:   31 c0                   xor    %eax,%eax\n  400577:   8b 45 ec                mov    -0x14(%rbp),%eax\n  40057a:   48 8b 55 f8             mov    -0x8(%rbp),%rdx   <- move it to register\n  40057e:   64 48 33 14 25 28 00    xor    %fs:0x28,%rdx     <- check it against original\n  400585:   00 00 \n  400587:   74 05                   je     40058e <test+0x31>\n  400589:   e8 b2 fe ff ff          callq  400440 <__stack_chk_fail@plt> \n  40058e:   c9                      leaveq \n  40058f:   c3                      retq   \n</code></pre>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  <sub>\n   1.
