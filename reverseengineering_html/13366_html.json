Since my egghunter can't find the rest of my shellcode, I assume it's not written in the memory. The OS is Windows 7 x86 without SP1.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there any way to expand the space for my shellcode or to exploit the application in another way?

First you send the reverse shell(with egg marker) with a another command and then the vulnerable command with the egghunter. \nYou have to search for a command that keeps the reverse shellcode in memory after the execution of the first command so that the egghunter can find the egg. \nVulnserver: GDOG puts the reverse shellcode in memory and KSTET sends the egghunter.\n  <a href=\"https://bogner.sh/2016/04/the-hard-life-of-exploit-developers/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://bogner.sh/2016/04/the-hard-life-of-exploit-developers/\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It could be that there are other requests that store content in memory, which you can then look for later using your egghunter. Alternatively you could consider another attack, for example if the service supports auth, use th 44 bytes you have to patch out the auth check to always return true, etc.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
