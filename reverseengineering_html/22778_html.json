That is,\n  <strong>\n   2 Bytes\n  </strong>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The instruction you are patching (\n  <code>\n   mov byte ptr ds:[ecx+0x72], al\n  </code>\n  ) is\n  <code>\n   88 41 72\n  </code>\n  and so takes up\n  <strong>\n   3 Bytes\n  </strong>\n  . See the problem already?\n </p>\n <p>\n  That means you are only patching the first two bytes of the instruction and need to pad it with a single-byte NOP (no operation, i.e.\n  <code>\n   90\n  </code>\n  ) in order for all subsequent instructions to be correct.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Otherwise the processor will start decoding at\n  <code>\n   <patched-instruction>+2\n  </code>\n  and assume that it is correct. Which it probably isn't.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <s>\n   Not sure what all those screenshots are supposed to be about. They seem to have no relation to the instructions you said you were patching ...\n  </s>\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Now that you have posted the screenshot of the patch site, we can even potentially tell you what the CPU was trying to execute.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The patch site before your patch was directly at the return from a function:\n </p>\n <pre><code>88 41 72                mov    BYTE PTR [ecx+0x72],al\nc2 04 00                ret    0x4\n; ------ end of function\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  After your patch it would have looked like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>b0 01                   mov    al,0x1\n72 c2                   jb     0xffffffc6\n04 00                   add    al,0x0\n; ------ end of function\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Still 12 Bytes overall (6 inside the function you were patching), but a completely different meaning. We can guess that either the jump instruction was taken and led into a location which gave the access violation, or that the condition (of\n  <code>\n   jb\n  </code>\n  ) didn't evaluate to true and the CPU executed the\n  <code>\n   add\n  </code>\n  followed by 6x\n  <code>\n   nop\n  </code>\n  and then ended up in a completely different function (at least this looks like a function prologue) but with the stack still in place from the call to the previous function and so on ...\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
