    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to analyse a piece of malware and after finding the OEP I'm having trouble dumping the process.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Using LordPE (and IDA) I get an error saying \"Couldn't grab process memory\", I searched for this and resolved it by using the intellidump engine in LordPE. Although this produces an exe, the file doesn't have an icon. I also tried using OllyDump and get the error: \"Unable to read memory of debugged process...\". I tried to fix this by modifying memory segments in Olly, setting their access to 'full access' however I'm still getting the same error.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I try to use ImpREC on the dump from LordPE, I get sometimes get another error with similar gist.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm guessing there's some kind of memory protection going on here but really have no idea what to do next. Any help would be much appreciated.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
