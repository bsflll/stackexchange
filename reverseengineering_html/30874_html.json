I have tried\n  <strong>\n   uncompyle6\n  </strong>\n  +\n  <strong>\n   pyinstxtractor\n  </strong>\n  however this only works for python files, not cython. There is also no known cython decompiler.  I have had a try with\n  <strong>\n   Ghidra\n  </strong>\n  and IDA but no luck although I am new to it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You would need to treat the\n  <code>\n   .pyd\n  </code>\n  as a standard PE DLL and disassemble it, then recreate the python from what you understand of the assembly.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
