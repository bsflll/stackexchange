So the bootloader is encrypted. This also applies to the Kernel itself. The Kernel AES key is stored within the bootloader binary once you get the bootloader decrypted (which requires shifting the encrypted bytes as well as the AES key and the AES IV around).\n </p>\n <p>\n  This MCU supports locking the access to the OTP area once the bootloader has started. The developer just has to set the \"READ-PROT LOCK\" bit after bootup and any reads from that area will then return zeroes (0). This definitely applies to your target.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've been previously working on the LPC3143 on my own regarding the encryption and hacking open access to the locked OTP area (with success). The effort was big as it requires soldering at least 14 up to 16 wires to the target and some expensive extra hardware as well as Python scripts and an ARM memory dumper written and compiled in C.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the AES key only won't be enough as LPC3143 encrypted binaries also require the AES IV which is hiding itself within this MCU's BOOTROM.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Regarding your own target, I almost have the whole OTP area dumped as well as the BOOTROM and the bootloader AES key and AES IV extracted as I've been working on the XKEY as well. With UART connected to the PCB you basically only see debug output of the bootloader but not from within the Kernel itself. So how did you get terminal access there as it doesn't print out any messages after decryption and verification of the Kernel header and jumping into SDRAM where it resides?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I did not get past the bootloader screen either, but I managed to get a read access to specific files within the system. Once you upgrade the xkey to the latest firmware 2.04 then you will see there is another File System RWFS that is unencrypted. This stores data of how many times you run games. There is a http address that will display the content of the file, ad using symlink, it enabled me to display /etc/passwd content. It is still progress, but not as far I wanted to be.</span>",
