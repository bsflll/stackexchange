    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Is it possible to switch between debuggers and preserve where you are paused? Often times I find myself wanting to use a feature from a different debugger while paused in a specific context as each of them have their strengths (IDA has source level stepping, x32dbg has excellent patching, call stacks and easy to use hardware breakpoints, Visual Studio can cast memory to C++ structs in the Watch window). Some are more useful in getting to a destination than others. Is there any kind of software available that enables this feature?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
