    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to use YARA to sort out a variety of files into families. Some malware drops other malware from images within their resource images. What I'd like to do is write a signature that ignores string hits that exist within the resource section. This would allow my signatures to correctly identify droppers from the malware that is dropped. I tried doing something like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>        (pe.sections[0].characteristics & pe.SECTION_CNT_CODE) and $handshake \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  to limit my condition to the .text section, but this is definitely not write. That is going to trigger only if the .text section is the first section and the $handshake string exists anywhere within the binary. what I'd like is a way to limit the $handshake to the .text section (or in any section that is not the resource section).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is this even possible with YARA or is that getting a bit too complicated for YARA?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
