A SDK exists, but unfortunately the company does not seem too keen on distributing it. I have to extract frames from a video stream in my software, and although it works perfectly with my webcam stream, it does not work with the frame grabber (that works perfectly with the bundled soft).\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   The frame grabber has an integrated MPEG-2 encoder, so the output stream should be MPEG-2\n  </strong>\n  , but since it does not work, I guess it is not standard. VLC is able to read the stream, though.\n  <strong>\n   Since it seems I will have to reverse engineer to get my soft to read the output stream, and as I have never done that kind of thing, could someone please give me a hint on how to proceed about that?\n  </strong>\n  I mostly have experience with the python language.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You can debug the data-flow through VLC to see how VLC handles the format, allowing you to understand the format itself.</span>",
