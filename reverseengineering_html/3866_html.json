I've identified the subroutine, and now I want to navigate to the subroutine in the functions window so that I can jump around some of the other subroutines in the vicinity rather quickly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know that I can search the functions window with\n  <kbd>\n   Alt + T\n  </kbd>\n  , but I was wondering if there was a shortcut to automatically jump to the currently selected subroutine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There are more than 200,000 subroutines in the functions window, so searching is slow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is it possible to navigate directly to the current subroutine, or to navigate directly to a subroutine based on address? If so, how?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
