To see live video I have to properly connect to server etc. using methods of created object. The best idea will be to monitor which methods are called from IE.\n  <strong>\n   Is there any possibility to monitor these calls\n  </strong>\n  and parameters with for example plug-in for IE or some API monitor program?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"OCX information in OLEView\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9Dy2r.png\"/>\n  <img alt=\"Methods details\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vNGuJ.png\"/>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You can then see the order in which IE calls them and the arguments that are passed.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
