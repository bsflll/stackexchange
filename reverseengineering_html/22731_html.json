In particular, PIC sequences do not contain any relocatable\n  addresses embedded in the instructions. This property enables the code\n  to work regardless of its memory location at runtime.  Furthermore,\n  PIC does not need to be patched by the loader, enabling it to be mapped\n  as read-only data—which is useful for shared code such as dynamically\n  linked libraries [14]. When a compiler is emitting\n  position-independent code  it typically creates jump tables that are\n  also position-independent.  These tables are usually embedded in the\n  text segment of the executable and consist of a sequence of offsets\n  rather than virtual addresses.  A jump that uses the offset table\n  first loads a nearby address,\n   <sup>\n    1\n   </sup>\n   then uses this to index into the table\n  and retrieve an offset.  The offset is added to the address that was\n  previously loaded and then used in an indirect jump to reach the\n  desired destination. The problems posed by position-independent jump\n  tables are three-fold:\n   <em>\n    (i)\n   </em>\n   the offset tables, which are really no\n  different than data, appear in the instruction stream;\n   <em>\n    (ii)\n   </em>\n   the code\n  sequences that perform the indirect jumps are often complicated and\n  may not adhere to a single pattern that is easily recognizable; and\n   <em>\n    (iii)\n   </em>\n   it is entirely possible that an offset table does not contain relocation entries.  Taken together,these properties make the task of\n  disassembling PIC sequences involving jump tables more difficult than\n  standard code.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
