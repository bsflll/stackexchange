In such case, the compiler generates code which fills all stack variables with the byte 0xCC, so that any uninitialized value is clearly visible during debugging. \nSee also\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/11865164\">\n   https://stackoverflow.com/a/11865164\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
