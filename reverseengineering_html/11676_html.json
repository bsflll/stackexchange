    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  A qualifier - all I know of what I'm about to explain has been gathered from spending the last few hours researching to solve my problem, so forgive the naivety and clumsiness of a non-expert in this particular area of tech... including the title.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have a very old and small (possibly DOS) .exe program file that I got from the net. The program works perfectly, but its text strings are in French. I'm wanting to modify just those text strings to change them to English. According to PEid, the program was written in MS Visual C++, although I couldn't find a C++ decompiler that was free, or anything else that would allow me to edit the program in anything other than Hex or machine code. Hex is a lot less intimidating, so I decided to opt for editing it via CFF Explorer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Explorer is great because it allows me to update the checksum each time I edit the file, which does away with a previous problem that corrupted the program file each time I tried to edit it, but now I'm having another problem: I can only seem to edit the text strings of the program with CFF insomuch as the overall character count remains the same - add any more or less characters than the original .exe, and the output of the file is overwritten... or at least, that's what it looks like from my end.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, is it possible to edit an .exe file without the limitation of keeping the amount of characters in it the exact same?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd really appreciate an answer. Thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The problem that you will have is whenever the English text would be longer than the French text.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In that case, you would have to extend the size of the file (including adjusting the header fields that specify the length internally), apply the English text to this new area, and then find all references to the original text, and replace them with references to the new text.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Second, if you are in luck the strings can be accessed directly from the program. Open the application in a decen hexeditor (HxD, 010, Hiew, Hexworkshop) and scroll down hoping you find the strings. Edit them (dont forget to close with a NULL-Byte), test if that works and work from there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However if the text is written with lets say bitmaps, you'll have to disassemble the application. Can you share the bin w/ us?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
