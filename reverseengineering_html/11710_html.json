    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Even a minimal console Delphi program that has\n  <code>\n   IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_DYNAMIC_BASE\n  </code>\n  set in its PE image does not use ASLR.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   GetProcessMitigationPolicy()\n  </code>\n  returns a\n  <code>\n   PROCESS_MITIGATION_ASLR_POLICY\n  </code>\n  of 0.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Consequently ProcessHacker (which uses this function) reports the process for this Delphi program to have ASLR disabled -- go into the process details window of ProcessHacker to see the ASLR status.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can provide a minimal compiled Delphi program if that helps. I haven't been able to find out why ASLR is not activated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any ideas?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Edit:\n  </strong>\n  Relocation information is part of the executable. After even more debugging I found out that Delphi's delay loading code for functions imported from DLLs is the culprit. I'll precise the question when I have more information or a solution.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Edit2:\n  </strong>\n  I posted the executables as attachment in the following forum, since I found no way to attach anything here:\n  <a href=\"http://wj32.org/processhacker/forums/viewtopic.php?p=6887#p6887\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   http://wj32.org/processhacker/forums/viewtopic.php?p=6887#p6887\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In older Delphi compilers this problem don't exist and as your mentioned it is due to some API's being converted to delayed load import functions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A while ago I reported this issue to Embarcadero and it seems they are working on it (\n  <a href=\"https://blog.marcocantu.com/blog/rad111_pe_security.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://blog.marcocantu.com/blog/rad111_pe_security.html\n  </a>\n  ). They provided a solution for now and willing to fix it in the near feature (I hope the next release).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
