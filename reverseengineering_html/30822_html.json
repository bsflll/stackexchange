I've IDA free but I don't have in app header the menu \"Lumina\" and in the product comparaison (IDA Website) the Lumina function is limited to IDA Home to IDA Teams. I can found some other posts in the website to confirm this; IDA Free don't have access to Lumina server. I have missed somethings ?\n</span>\n</body></html>",

This may be similar to how the auto-analysis differs between Pro and Free. So perhaps it formally has the ability to connect to a Lumina server but isn't able to access the part that is relevant to get the function \"fingerprints\"?!\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Personally, I've tried using Lumina on a number of different binaries, and in most cases, nothing ever comes back rendering it mostly useless (for me, at least). If you're wanting to use the Lumina features for your own internal team, I might recommend looking at a solution like this:\n <a href=\"https://www.synacktiv.com/en/publications/investigating-ida-lumina-feature.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  synacktiv.com/en/publications/â€¦\n </a>\n</span>\n</body></html>",
