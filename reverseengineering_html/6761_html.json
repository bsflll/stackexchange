You can look at\n  <code>\n   _create_script_data\n  </code>\n  in\n  <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/p/py2exe/svn/HEAD/tree/trunk/py2exe-3/py2exe/runtime.py\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://sourceforge.net/p/py2exe/svn/HEAD/tree/trunk/py2exe-3/py2exe/runtime.py\n  </a>\n  for more details.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It is basically a marshalled array holding pyc files. The main script of the application is usually stored here.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In order to make changes you need to unmarshal the code objects, decompile it to\n  <em>\n   py\n  </em>\n  , make changes, recompile back to\n  <em>\n   pyc\n  </em>\n  , marshal it back to generate a new\n  <em>\n   PYTHONSCRIPT\n  </em>\n  and finally update the executable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Modifying library.zip is easier as it is a standard zip file. It contains other\n  <em>\n   pyc/pyo\n  </em>\n  files. You can decompile them, make changes, recompile it back to\n  <em>\n   pyc/pyo\n  </em>\n  , and zip them up. Next replace the overlay in the executable with your new zip file and you are done.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In order to automate some of the above steps you can use a tool\n  <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/p2ebe/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Py2Exe Binary Editor\n  </a>\n  \n\n  <sub>\n   Note: I am the author of the above tool\n  </sub>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
