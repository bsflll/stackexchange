I'm going to be drastically oversimplifying the topic, but the 10,000-foot view is that you have two ways to reverse engineer:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Static Analysis\n  </strong>\n  : Studying a binary without running it. Programs like\n  <strong>\n   <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    IDA\n   </a>\n  </strong>\n  can be used to disassemble a binary to automagically lay bare what it can of the binary's workings. This does A LOT for you if you know what you're looking at. Otherwise, prepare to be 100% overwhelmed. There's an amazing introduction to IDA on YouTube that you can watch\n  <strong>\n   <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGDcTSCB7y4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    here\n   </a>\n  </strong>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Dynamic Analysis\n  </strong>\n  : Studying the behavior of a binary while it's executing. This is when you use debuggers like\n  <strong>\n   <a href=\"http://www.ollydbg.de/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    OllyDbg\n   </a>\n  </strong>\n  ,\n  <strong>\n   <a href=\"https://x64dbg.com/#start\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    x64dbg\n   </a>\n  </strong>\n  ,\n  <strong>\n   <a href=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/download-windbg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    WinDbg\n   </a>\n  </strong>\n  ,\n  <strong>\n   <a href=\"https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Cheat Engine\n   </a>\n  </strong>\n  , etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There are really complex things you can do via other applications/plugins/libraries/frameworks, but you tend to discover those during threads of research. There's likely a plugin or something out there for Olly that will profusely log events/tracing, but the reason what you're interested in won't really work is the amount of data you'd be logging would be insane. You'd still have to search through it all to make sense of everything. Consider there are registers, memory, on-disk, and off-site (which gets you into network protocol land).\n </p>\n <p>\n  For what you're interested in, there's a really, really good video tutorial that uses OllyDbg and IDA to reverse a crackme (\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDYk8zN53A\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   video here\n  </a>\n  ). For a different approach for the same crackme via dynamic analysis, (\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Emiuht3YSXA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here is a video\n  </a>\n  ) where I use Cheat Engine, which is an unorthodox tool for the job but that I think a beginner such as yourself would learn a lot from (there's memory scanning, patching, writing custom Assembly and creating a script, etc.). Full disclosure: the tutorial using Cheat Engine is from me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You have a lot of learning ahead of you, but try to enjoy the ride!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Do you think that a logging script like this: <a href=\"https://github.com/deresz/funcap\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">github.com/deresz/funcap</a> , which is for IDA Pro, can track the x86 registers values for a non-hardcoded generated key? What I'm trying to understand is \"unique key generation\" vs \"generation of lots of compatible keys\". And if a unique generated key can be tracked among the x86 registers values.</span>",

There's just a lot of nitty-gritty details on an individual binary basis where no generic answer can apply. If you're trying to reverse the algorithm used for a dynamically-generated key, then there's no telling what kind of algorithm you're dealing with. By all means, find an automated solution and churn your binary through it, but with what you're asking for, there's not a one-size-fits-all solution. Also, again, registers aren't the only thing to keep track of.</span>",
