Another option would be the C-like syntax used by 010 Editor to describe how to parse (and display) the file format. (And there are possibly many more such formats out there.) Yara is probably the more sustainable method because it's FLOSS and you could continue to maintain it even if the upstream ends up abandoning it. TrID would likely be similar to\n <a href=\"https://linux.die.net/man/3/libmagic\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  libmagic(3)\n </a>\n in scope ...\n</span>\n</body></html>",
