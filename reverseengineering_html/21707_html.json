I have a binary where I suspect that junk isn't junk, and I would like to see what output would a linear disassembly do, but I could not find any option in IDA Pro to change that. Does it even exist? Thanks !\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In kernel options 2, you can uncheck coagulate code/data segments before doing the initial analysis, this will prevent IDA from converting unknown bytes into data. You could also try undefining everything, selecting everything, and then hitting C to convert it to code.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
