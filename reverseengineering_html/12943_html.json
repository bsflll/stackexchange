    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  So I found out that Ontario Driver's Licences have the following format: LXXXX - NNNIY - YMMDD\n </p>\n <p>\n  L - first letter of last name XXXX - number referring to your last name NNN - number referring to your first name I - number referring to your middle initial (0 if you don't have one) YY - year of birth MM - month of birth - add 50 to month if you are female DD - day of birth\n </p>\n <p>\n  My question is, what is the encoding system they use for the first 5 alphanumeric digits? The first letter is the first letter of your last name, but what about the numbers? Everyone with the same last name will have the same first 5 alphanumeric digits. I used to think Ontario had propitiatory system with a database of last names, and attached a number onto them, but I discovered that New Jersey and Quebec uses the SAME system as well by looking at their sample licences on google. I wonder if anyone knows how the name is encoded. I've found something about the SoundEx system, but I don't think it applies in this case. This question has been brought up once at\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/6440/decoding-new-jersey-drivers-license-codes\">\n   Decoding New Jersey Driver's License Codes\n  </a>\n  but they did not manage to crack the code. Thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

But this is I believe Soundex code (It absolutely is the case for the Quebec drivers license atleast), which is based on how names sound rather than spelling.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For Quebec: SSSSL DDMMYY NN - soundex last name + license type, DOB, NN\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hope it helps someone.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
