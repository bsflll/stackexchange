    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have been attempting to intercept when an app performs a DNS lookup using Frida. I assumed that ultimately a DNS lookup will end up in a libc call to\n  <code>\n   gethostbyname\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   getaddrinfo\n  </code>\n  but this does not seem to be the case. For example this Frida trace command does not hit either function\n </p>\n <pre><code>frida-trace -U -i \"gethostbyname\" -i \"getaddrinfo\" \"com.android.my_app\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  According the answer to\n  <a href=\"https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/218015/how-does-android-do-dns-name-resolution\">\n   this\n  </a>\n  question, the\n  <code>\n   netd\n  </code>\n  daemon might be responsible for DNS resolution on android\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   \"DNS lookups are centralized in the netd daemon to allow for\nsystem-wide caching, while apps call functions (such as getaddrinfo)\nin Bionic. The query is sent over a UNIX socket to\n/dev/socket/dnsproxyd to the netd daemon, which parses the request and\ncalls getaddrinfo again to issue DNS lookups, then caches the results\nso that other apps can use them.\"\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  However hooking this daemon doesn't result in any hits either:\n </p>\n <pre><code>frida-trace -U -i \"gethostbyname\" -i \"getaddrinfo\" \"netd\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I am new to Frida so I am not sure if I am missing something here. I would appreciate some insight into how I can hook the DNS lookup call\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Some of those language may implement DNS resolving on their own so that it works on all platforms. I do remember that Firefox for Android e.g. does implement DNS resolving on it's own.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
