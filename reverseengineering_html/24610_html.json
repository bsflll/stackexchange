However I can't promise that this is the best or most convenient way. At the very least, this method is OS dependent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  First, create a named pipe:\n </p>\n <pre><code>root@kali:~# mkfifo my_pipe\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Then, open two shells.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On one shell, redirect GDB's input as the pipe's output:\n </p>\n <pre><code>root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/stackoverflow/24610# gdb -nh test < ~/my_pipe\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  On the other shell, open a Python REPL and connect to the named pipe:\n </p>\n <pre><code>>>> f = open(\"/root/my_pipe\", \"w\")\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The moment you open the pipe, you should see GDB get unblocked on the first shell:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Reading symbols from test...\n(No debugging symbols found in test)\n(gdb)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now, define the following function in the Python REPL:\n </p>\n <pre><code>>>> def cmd(f, s): f.write(s); f.write(\"\n\"); f.flush()\n...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  You should be able to enter input for GDB using the newly defined\n  <code>\n   cmd\n  </code>\n  command. For example, to run the program, enter:\n </p>\n <pre><code>>>> cmd(f, \"r\")\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This will run the program in the other shell:\n </p>\n <pre><code>(gdb) Starting program: /media/sf_CTFs/stackoverflow/24610/test\nPlease enter input\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  You can break GDB with CTRL+C, just remember that all commands need to be entered via\n  <code>\n   cmd\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  When the time is right, you can send your Python command:\n </p>\n <pre><code>>>> cmd(f, 'A' * 10)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  It will be received in the other side:\n </p>\n <pre><code>(gdb) Continuing.\nAAAAAAAAAA\n[Inferior 1 (process 1187) exited normally]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Don't forget to close the named pipe when you're done:\n </p>\n <pre><code>>>> f.close()\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  If this works for you, you can go ahead and create a Python script that acts as an interactive shell, instead of using the REPL.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
