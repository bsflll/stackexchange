You'll most likely want to analyze the binary. To do this, press colon and then\n  <code>\n   aaa\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   aa\n  </code>\n  . Note, that\n  <code>\n   aaa\n  </code>\n  does could take more time, but does performs a more in-depth analysis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once in debugging mode, use db [address] to set a breakpoint. For example, to set a breakpoint at main\n </p>\n <pre><code>db main\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And you can get to main, enter\n  <code>\n   s main\n  </code>\n  . This jumps to main (s is for seek).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, if you want to change the register\n  <code>\n   rdi\n  </code>\n </p>\n <pre><code>dr rdi=0x20\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  For more register options, see:\n  <a href=\"https://r2wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/options/d/dr/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://r2wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/options/d/dr/\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
