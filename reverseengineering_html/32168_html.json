I can pinpoint roughly in the gmae code where it's reading file headers and starting allocating memory/decompressing, but what actually happens is a mystery.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The smallest compressed file is just 5kb, I uploaded it here:\n  <a href=\"https://ufile.io/scibn9hp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://ufile.io/scibn9hp\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The game is from 1996. Can anyone point me in the right direction for learning this stuff? Should I try understanding the program, or is it possible to understand the compression by just messing with the file?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Examining the file in a hex editor, you can see\n <code>\n  CWE sprite\n </code>\n in the file header - I Googled that and found this:\n <a href=\"https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=21665\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=21665\n </a>\n - might be a start.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
