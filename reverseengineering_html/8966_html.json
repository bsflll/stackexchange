Note that the DLL's entry point (which IDA names \"\n  <code>\n   DllEntryPoint\n  </code>\n  \") does not always (and in fact often does not) point to the\n  <code>\n   DllMain()\n  </code>\n  function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can see in the image below (full-size at\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CMUou.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://i.sstatic.net/CMUou.png\n  </a>\n  ) that the DLL's entry point is\n  <code>\n   10807A1C\n  </code>\n  . I've pointed from the entry point's artificial entry in the Exports table (since IDA gets the address from the PE's Entry Point field, not the actual PE Export Table) to the disassembly for the entry point code via arrow #1.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The code at the entry point (named\n  <code>\n   DllEntryPoint()\n  </code>\n  by IDA) calls\n  <code>\n   ___DllMainCRTStartup()\n  </code>\n  via arrow #2. Then\n  <code>\n   __DllMainCRTStartup()\n  </code>\n  calls\n  <code>\n   DllMain()\n  </code>\n  via arrow #3.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The two function executed before\n  <code>\n   DllMain()\n  </code>\n  are from VC++ 6's runtime library.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"IDA\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CzKQj.png\"/>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
