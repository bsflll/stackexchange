They also sell the\n  <a href=\"https://novationmusic.com/en/circuit/circuit-rhythm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Circuit Rhythm\n  </a>\n  , which has some of the features the Tracks is missing but lacks others. It has several MIDI outputs and would make a fantastic MIDI controller, but it's firmware only allows the intended use\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeXnGgzktKY\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   (many users feel this way)\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   First steps:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Circuit Track's firmware can be updated using the Components website (and a standalone version) via\n  <a href=\"http://midi.teragonaudio.com/tech/midispec/sysex.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   MIDI Sysex messages\n  </a>\n  . This led me to discover a bunch of their firmwares, all directly accessible with incrementing indices :)\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   NOTE: This link won't work without the authetication from Components:\n  </strong>\n  <a href=\"https://circuit-librarian.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/firmware/file/89/circuittracks-firmware-3891.syx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://circuit-librarian.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/firmware/file/89/circuittracks-firmware-3891.syx\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was able to download the firmware as a .syx file (416 KB) and first tried running binwalk. No results. As I'm pretty new to this kind of reverse engineering I'm not quite sure how to continue.\nAs I understand it, the file probably is compressed and/or encrypted. Looking at it with\n  <a href=\"http://binvis.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   binvis.io\n  </a>\n  yields an interesting pattern, though I have no idea what to make of it or whether it holds any relevance:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VPOg0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VPOg0.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   So my question is: How/where should I continue?\n  </strong>\n  I'm thankful for any kind of pointer, even if it's related literature/resources so I'll have some clue :)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

There are github projects e.g.\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/dvhdr/launchpad-pro\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/dvhdr/launchpad-pro\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
