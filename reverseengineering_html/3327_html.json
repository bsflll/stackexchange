From here I want to use the bindiff functions to compare this database with another database and output any differences to a file.  Any recommendations?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Those are binaries for batch diffing of IDBs and\n  <code>\n   .BinExport\n  </code>\n  files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The basic usage would be:\n </p>\n <pre><code>differ --primary=<directory-with-IDBs> --output-dir=<output-directory>\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Sadly, this does not work (at least on my machine) as\n  <code>\n   differ.exe\n  </code>\n  fails to find IDA's executable and tries to execute the directory instead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To solve this, we will export IDBs using the following command:\n </p>\n <pre><code>\"<path-to-idaq.exe>\" -A -OExporterModule:<result-directory> -S\"<path-to-export-script>\" \"<path-to-idb>\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The\n  <code>\n   export-script\n  </code>\n  is an\n  <code>\n   .idc\n  </code>\n  with the following code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <idc.idc>\n\nstatic main()\n{\n    Batch(0);\n    Wait();\n    Exit(1 - RunPlugin(\"zynamics_binexport_8\", 2));\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Once you have all your\n  <code>\n   .BinExport\n  </code>\n  files in one directory, run the original\n  <code>\n   differ.exe\n  </code>\n  command on that directory (give it the directory with the\n  <code>\n   .BinExport\n  </code>\n  files instead of the\n  <code>\n   .idb\n  </code>\n  files), and you'll get\n  <code>\n   .BinDiff\n  </code>\n  files for all possible diffs. Those can either be opened up in IDA, or manually parsed (they are SQLite databases).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
