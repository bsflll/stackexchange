    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am trying to logcat the parameters of a function in smali with my own function. I made a new Android studio project and wrote the function then used APKtool to retrieve the Smali file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is my function:\n </p>\n <pre><code>.method public userFunction(II)V\n    .locals 2\n    .param p1, \"a\"    # I\n    .param p2, \"b\"    # I\n\n    .line 28\n    invoke-static {p1}, Ljava/lang/Integer;->toString(I)Ljava/lang/String;\n\n    move-result-object v0\n\n    const-string v1, \"Message\"\n\n    invoke-static {v1, v0}, Landroid/util/Log;->d(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)I\n\n    return-void\n.end method\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  As you can see, it takes two integers and then logs one (forget for now that the other integer is unused).\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is the Android studio code I used to write the above function in Java.\n </p>\n <pre><code>    public void sendMessage(View view)\n    {\n        userFunction(3,2);\n    }\n\n    public void userFunction(int a, int b)\n    {\n        Log.d(\"Message\", Integer.toString(a));\n    }\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now what I can't make sense of, is how to call this function in Smali. My problem may be that I am testing this within a button. The sendMessage is an Onclick method for testing purposes and all it does is perform the userfunction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My reasoning behind this is that the method call in Smali ends up being\n </p>\n <pre><code>invoke-virtual {p0, v0, v1}, Lcom/example/froggyfresh/MainActivity;->userFunction(II)V\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  From what I read, I believe the p0 to be the object calling the function. So I'm not sure how to call the function from within another method that is in the project I am trying to debug.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a work around for this, to create some generic function to log the values?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The issue I get when using p0 in the APK I am trying to debug is APKtool gives me this error:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   C:\\Users\\Dell\\Desktop>apktool b base\n   \n\n   I: Using Apktool 2.4.1\n   \n\n   I: Checking whether sources has changed...\n   \n\n   I: Smaling smali folder into classes.dex...\n   \n\n   base\\smali\\funproject.smali[5059,1] Invalid register: v29. Must be between v0 and v15, inclusive.\n   \n\n   Could not smali file: funproject.smali\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  I know that the p0 is a parameter register and that the parameters are stored in the final v(insertnumberhere) register. So I can make sense of the error but not sure how to go about fixing the issue.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You could move the value from one of the lower registers into v23, and then move the value of p0 into that lower register.\n </p>\n <pre><code>move-object v2, v23\nmove-object p0, v2\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and then after the call, you would need to shuffle the original value of v2 back\n </p>\n <pre><code>move-object v23, v2\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
