    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm reverse engineering a Visual Basic application and I've run into a big of a sticky situation, so I was hoping that someone might have an opinion on a way to approach it. It's basically a crackme but I haven't been able to nail down where the callback code is for the function I'm looking for. I've found the labels and captions but I was hoping for an intelligent way to start looking at the binary instead of crawling through it from top to bottom until I find the right comparison.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've taken a look at the output of VB Decompiler but the output isn't matching up to what I'm used to.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"here's the output from VB Decompiler\" src=\"https://i31.photobucket.com/albums/c367/Fewmitz/decomp_zpsc874945f.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  In other VB apps it seems like the locations given there is enough to get started and find the callbacks, but not with this one:\n  <img alt=\"this is what I get when trying to find any of the actual code\" src=\"https://i31.photobucket.com/albums/c367/Fewmitz/nocodes_zpsc79f980d.png\"/>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I thought at first the code was just being rendered poorly in the debugger but after playing around with it I don't think that location is correct at all. So I'm looking for ideas on where to go from here.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
