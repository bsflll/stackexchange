Your assembler listing doesn't seem to contain any float operations, while the first decompiled listing definitely has them, and the second listing has them as well (implicitly). But the two decompiled listings call different functions, so they seem to be from different parts of the object. And since the operands are missing from the assembly, we can't even match the assembly to either of the other two. So how should anybody figure out what's wrong from what you've given us?\n</span>\n</body></html>",

I cannot tell you why, but it's what the decompiler shows me when I press TAB. Jongware: yeah, I supposed it's the FPU stack, but it only appears now and then. I cannot make it always appear, and it only shows up when the decompilation has a lot of __asm and doesn't have to do with the actual disassembled code.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
