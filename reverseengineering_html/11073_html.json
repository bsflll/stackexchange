    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I just came across the MyNav Python scripts and would like to use some of their functionality on my IDA Pro database. I have IdaPython installed properly, but I cannot seem to get the plugins to show up in the menu. I have gone to File > script and run MyNav.py, but all that happens is the myexport.pyc and mybrowser.pyc files get generated where I have the source files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried copying those into the plugins directory and restarting, but nothing shows up. The install documentation on the google code page is non-existent. Has anyone had any success installing this plugin package?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am using Python 2.7 with IdaPython 1.5.2, but have also tried with Python 2.6\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
