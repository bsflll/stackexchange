So the common way to calculate the address of a function is: 1. Use the address shown in IDA and substract the IDA base address from it. 2. At run-time get the current base address of the executable (or the library) and add the result of 1. According to\n <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18066847/why-does-getting-the-base-address-using-getmodulehandle-work\">\n  this\n </a>\n <code>\n  GetModuleHandleA\n </code>\n does not work to get the base address if the process is 64bit.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

But after 15 second crash and I get a message from game \"Signature Verification of executible failed\". If I remove the line: \"DetourAttach(&(LPVOID&)AddressOfHookSoundFunction, HookMainFunction);\" the game work fine. Any Ideas ?\n</span>\n</body></html>",
