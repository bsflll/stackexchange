I have a Raspberry Pi and some time. I admit that this is my first time delving this deep into hardware RE, so be gentle with me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I got the damn thing to spit numbers out at me, so I know that the chip has a serial output at least. And, I have the chip mounted on a breakout board and I have a breadboard handy. Also, let's assume security bit is not set (\n  <em>\n   fingers crossed!!!\n  </em>\n  ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I try to get out the firmware to a file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any help would be appreciated, even a couple links and a tip or two for my specific case if you could!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
