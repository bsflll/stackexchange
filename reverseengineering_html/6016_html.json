For example, if you already have a disassembly window open and open a new disassembly subview, your original disassembly window tab will be named\n  <code>\n   IDA View-A\n  </code>\n  and your new disassembly window tab will be named\n  <code>\n   IDA View-B\n  </code>\n  . You can then rearrange the disassembly windows (drag and drop the window tabs) to create a split-view.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
