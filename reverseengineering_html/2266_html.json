This appears to be the equivalent of gcc's -O3\n  \n\n  <code>\n   <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/k1ack8f1.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    /Oy\n   </a>\n  </code>\n  Omit frame pointers. (x86 only)\n  \n\n  <code>\n   <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/we6hfdy0.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    /GR-\n   </a>\n  </code>\n  Disable Run Time Type Information\n  \n\n  <code>\n   <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/2kzt1wy3.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    /MT\n   </a>\n  </code>\n  flag is used to static link the various libraries.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Visibility - I don't think  the MSVC compiler has any options to turn off visibility like\n  <code>\n   -fvisibility=hidden\n  </code>\n  offered in gcc, but is this necessary for MSVC since the debugging symbols are stored in the PDB file?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Are there any other things I should include to ensure minimal information is distrubuted in the application?\n </p>\n <p>\n  (I might add that I am creating a standalone executable)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
