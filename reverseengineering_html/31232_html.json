    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I wanted to debug winload.efi using IDA Pro 7.7, but for some weird reason there is no windbg in the list of debuggers in case of EFI files, even tho I can easily debug the kernel using IDA Pro's windbg.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can already debug winload.efi using windbg and there is no problem with that, so how can I force IDA pro to list windbg in the list of debuggers in case of EFI files?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can run IDA pro and attach during boot, thus technically debug the winload.efi, but when I open the IDB file of the winload.efi, there is no windbg option in the debuggers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note that I have used\n  <code>\n   bcdedit /bootdebug {current}\n  </code>\n  , therefore debugger will break In winload.efi during boot.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Within your software maintenance period you can usually expect rather swift responses. With some luck Igor will pop by and see and answer it here, though.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
