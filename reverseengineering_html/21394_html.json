The closest you can get is using iteration (\n  <code>\n   @@\n  </code>\n  ), and printing the stack like this:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   [0x10000b4a1]> pxw 16 @@=rsp rsp-16 rsp-32 rsp-48\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  (For more lines, you simply add additional\n  <code>\n   rsp-?\n  </code>\n  elements).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unfortunately, this method has several disadvantages:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   If you need a variable amount of lines, that won't do. You can either use an external command to generate the elements (via\n   <code>\n    @@c:\n   </code>\n   or\n   <code>\n    @@=``\n   </code>\n   ), or contribute to radare2's iterator code (located in\n   <code>\n    r_core_cmd_foreach\n   </code>\n   , in\n   <code>\n    libr/core/cmd.c\n   </code>\n   ), which currently supports only positive direction (you'd need to add support for negative stepping).\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   For certain hexdump formats (such as\n   <code>\n    px\n   </code>\n   , which is the default format used in panels view), a header is added to the output, and when using an iterator, which results in multiple command executions, the header will appear over and over again.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   For some reason, this kind of iteration does not work in panels view.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  I'd recommend opening a feature request (or implementing it and contributing to the project), to support reverse printing direction.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
