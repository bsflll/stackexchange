I think the V! mode would be very handy as you can watch the registers update as the instruction pointer moves through the program, but I don't understand the layout.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is an example of they layout I would like:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gooa3.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gooa3.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  It seems when I add a window (like Stack or Registers in this photo) it appears offscreen and I have to try closing different and splitting windows until the layout kind of falls into place. Is there an easy way to change exactly what is in each window?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know 'X' closes a window, 'z' switches the current window to the front, and '-' / '|' split a window.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have tried looking at the help but can't seem to figure out any other commands related to this issue.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you literally just want to see how the compiler translates stuff to assembly you may be better off using a compiler (GCC's and Clang's\n <code>\n  -S\n </code>\n switch may be helpful here). Additionally you can use the\n <a href=\"https://gcc.godbolt.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  Compiler Explorer\n </a>\n or install your own instance of it (it's open source).\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Use\n  <kbd>\n   w\n  </kbd>\n  to enter the window mode. \"Window mode\" allows you to control how the panels look like.

Because you can simply select a panel and use\n  <kbd>\n   e\n  </kbd>\n  to change its content :)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Don't forget to use\n  <kbd>\n   ?\n  </kbd>\n  in the different visual screens to get more help\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
