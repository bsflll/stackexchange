If I understand your question correctly, all you have to do is decode it and you'll get your file. If you are on linux I think a simple \"cat sys.base64| base64 -D > sys\" would do the job.\n <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64\n </a>\n</span>\n</body></html>",

However, i'd like to add that this only works if the file is <i>just</i> the base64 decoded string; it might be encrypted/randomized some more, in which case your file will be nothing but garbage, and you'd have to break that extra encryption.</span>",
