    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a chip I am trying to use JTAG communications with using openOCD. However, I get the following error:\n </p>\n <pre><code>openocd -f ocd.cfg \nOpen On-Chip Debugger 0.10.0\nLicensed under GNU GPL v2\nFor bug reports, read\n    http://openocd.org/doc/doxygen/bugs.html\nWarn : Adapter driver 'buspirate' did not declare which transports it allows; assuming legacy JTAG-only\nInfo : only one transport option; autoselect 'jtag'\nsrst_only separate srst_gates_jtag srst_open_drain connect_deassert_srst\nInfo : Buspirate Interface ready!\nInfo : This adapter doesn't support configurable speed\nWarn : There are no enabled taps.

How should I go about debugging this issue?\n </p>\n <p>\n  To be clear I am asking this from the perspective of OpenOCD software, not my hardware:\n  <strong>\n   Why does it expect 0x0001? Can I configure it to expect 0x0002?\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Why is it giving up after these two errors?\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  For the record I am using this config:\n </p>\n <pre><code>source [find interface/buspirate.cfg]\n\n\nbuspirate_vreg 0\nbuspirate_mode open-drain\nbuspirate_pullup 1\n\nbuspirate_port /dev/tty.usbserial-A90809RC\n\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  As my chip is not includes in the /boards directory, I could include a board from there using the source directive.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
