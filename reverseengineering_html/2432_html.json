If it's used in a more complex expression, like\n  <code>\n   [eax + ecx]\n  </code>\n  , one of the two is a pointer and the other is an array index/byte displacement from that pointer, but there's no telling which is which just from that line, more context is needed.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Could i just ask one small last thing: lets say something like this is apparent: <code>mov eax, DWORD PTR [ecx + esi*4 + 0x18]</code> would that indicate that we have an array of structs? Ecx could be the base adr, esi*4 the size of one element and 0x18 the offset inside the struct to the member we want to access? Not saying that it <i>has</i> to be so, but it could?
