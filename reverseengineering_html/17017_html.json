If it was pure squashfs, without any additional header, just generate the new firmware file out of your set of files via mksquashfs\n  <a href=\"https://elinux.org/Squash_FS_Howto#Creating_and_using_squashed_file_systems\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://elinux.org/Squash_FS_Howto#Creating_and_using_squashed_file_systems\n  </a>\n  Otherwise, you'll need to append header/footer to the squashfs file to make it look like the original firmware.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
