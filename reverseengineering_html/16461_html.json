Sections on disk and memory have different alignments. Sections on disk are usually aligned by 512 bytes which is the traditional size of a disk sector (stored in\n  <code>\n   IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER.FileAlignment\n  </code>\n  ). In memory, they are usually page aligned (stored in\n  <code>\n   IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER.SectionAlignment\n  </code>\n  ). It allows the loader to apply different memory protection permissions on different sections since permissions are applied on page by page basis. Example:\n  <code>\n   .text\n  </code>\n  can have\n  <code>\n   PAGE_EXECUTE_READ\n  </code>\n  while\n  <code>\n   .data\n  </code>\n  might have\n  <code>\n   PAGE_READONLY\n  </code>\n  permission only, if\n  <code>\n   .data\n  </code>\n  isn't aligned, it's content that fits in the last\n  <code>\n   .text\n  </code>\n  's page will have\n  <code>\n   PAGE_EXECUTE_READ\n  </code>\n  permission instead of\n  <code>\n   PAGE_READONLY\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
