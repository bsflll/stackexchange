    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Compilers often optimize variables usage, so multiple variables in the source code can be mapped to the same register (or stack variable) in the resulting assembly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know that registers can be renamed within a start and end addresses in the assembly view in IDA, but what about hex-rays decompiler? Can I give a name to a variable only in a part of the decompiled function, and some other in another part?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
