    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've been analyzing an ARMv7 binary for a while and have done a lot of work with it (e.g. labeling functions, creating structs, labeling globals etc.). Unfortunately, I just realized that Ghidra mistakenly selected ARMv8 when it was being imported, which is causing some decompilation issues.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way to change the architecture at this point without needing to reimport? I know you can override the architecture when its being imported, but I have yet to figure out how to change the architecture after the fact.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
