OK, let's consider a file protected/wrapped by HASP.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What's the general layout of said file? There's a HASP API that's embedded. Is it easily identifiable, i.e. more or less a full module, or is it cut up and distributed throughout the file?\n </p>\n <p>\n  When the file is started, is it decoded in its entirety or does it employ a decode/re-encode scheme? How does it move between layers in the decoder?\n </p>\n <p>\n  What are the passive protections of HASP (e.g. import redirection)?\n </p>\n <p>\n  What are the active protections of HASP (e.g. IsDebuggerPresent())?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

What we supposed to do was \"sniff\" the ports to see what data went back-n-forth between the application and the dongle, then try to simulate it or maybe model some function after it. However the basic task was to check the data transference. i remember there were software (HASP testers) which could already do much of this job.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When you have the data map and where in the api these are processed (using a debugger) it could make it easier.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Each applicatioon can use its own way of communicating with the HASP (although there are canned routines and modules also)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does this help you?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Also, I'd imagine it would be difficult to map the entire set of queries/answers by just passively listening in. You would probably need to provoke the more rare queries into being sent to have some decent progress?</span>",
