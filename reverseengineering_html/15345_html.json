    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  This happens a lot where when I am reversing a program in a disassembler or debugger, I run into something like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>push    eax             ; lParam\npush    1               ; wParam\npush    80h             ; Msg\npush    ecx             ; hWnd\ncall    esi ; SendMessageA\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  In order to effectively reverse this, I need to know what 80h is. The problem is that when compiled (preprocessed), all of the Windows constant macros obviously get turned into numbers so I no longer have the semantic meanings. I also cannot go and search for \"SendMessage 0x80\" because there's no real context there either.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The question is, what are some tips in figuring out a Microsoft Windows constant macro name when given only a function and a value like this? I was able to go to\n  <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644950(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   SendMessage\n  </a>\n  on MSDN and then from there, look at the Msg parameter which lead me to the\n  <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644927(v=vs.85).aspx#system_defined\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   System-Defined Messages\n  </a>\n  page. However, like many other MSDN pages, this one only defines the macros by description, rather than provides a table of which value each one corresponds to. This has actually been a regular issue that I've ran into in reversing Windows applications. Another solution I've discovered is to try and locate the .h file for the corresponding macros online and then search for the value there. But this situation is less than ideal because I have no idea if the information is accurate up-to-date, but many times I also do not even know which header file would contain the definition.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
