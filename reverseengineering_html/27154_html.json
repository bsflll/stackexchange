There is a lookup table. first byte and second byte is logical or'ed and represent the real byte. Here is the look up table\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/opj9h.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/opj9h.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
