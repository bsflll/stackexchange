I tried another dump, not from the same brand name, and it worked, but only connected to the server. Now I want us to fix the dumb. This is my first question here. Is there anyone here interested in that?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I replaced it with a new one (25Q128). Yes, the battery is also new and its size is correct in millimeters. There are no links to reset  There is no solution from Hikvision, they do not talk about repair matters......but it is possible to repair in a simpler way than usual, which is to transfer the serial number to another working dump.. Is there anyone here interested in this matter?\n</span>\n</body></html>",
