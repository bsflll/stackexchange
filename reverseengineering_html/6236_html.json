The program pauses at some weird location in ntdll. I went into options and set a breakpoint at the entry. The program still paused at the same location in ntdll. I then set a breakpoint at main. And it still pauses at some location in ntdll.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What am I doing wrong here?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
