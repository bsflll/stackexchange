    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've been reversing an asm checksum code for the last days, and I've managed to understand how it completly works, except for one instruction;\n  <strong>\n   ldrh\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The info I've been able to found says that it's basically a ldr instruction which loads a half word (2 bytes). But the problem is that the ldr() instruction has a lot of variants and there's no info about how this one would be wrote in pseudo C.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Specifically my instruction is:\n  \n\n  <strong>\n   ldrh  r3,[r12,r3]\n  </strong>\n  \n\n  If it were a normal ldr, the pseudo code will be\n  \n\n  <strong>\n   r3 = r12[r3];\n  </strong>\n  \n\n  (r12 is an addres to a memory place so I don't understand what it really does..Does it loads the value at r12+r3 into r3?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
