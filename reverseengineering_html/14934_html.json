I'm stepping through fine, and I do get the WIN API recognition, but I want to edit some memory but am not able to:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/v7hF2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/v7hF2.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd like to, for example, edit the string pointed to by 00404378 to change the string \"Error\" to something else (see stack panel) but as you can see in the dump, it's completely blank. If I scroll the dump up and down, it's all blanked out.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
