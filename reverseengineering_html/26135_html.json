The project README (I have never personally used that project!) states:\n <i>\n  The header of the pyc files are automatically fixed so that a Python bytecode decompiler will recognize it.\n </i>\n so it appears to me that you should simply run the output from your above tool through a Python byte code decompiler.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
