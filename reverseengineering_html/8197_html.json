    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  GDB has a reasonably robust API which is exposed to Python at runtime.  It allows for inspecting various types, but does not appear to allow creation of types.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, types can be manually added by loading an object file at runtime (\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/7272558\">\n   https://stackoverflow.com/q/7272558\n  </a>\n  ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there any way to add or create a new\n  <code>\n   gdb.Type\n  </code>\n  object at runtime?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The intent is to then allow inspection of memory via\n  <code>\n   gdb.Value.cast\n  </code>\n  to the\n  <code>\n   type.pointer()\n  </code>\n  and then\n  <code>\n   .dereference()\n  </code>\n  d.  This would be much better/easier than manually deserializing data field-by-field.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Alternatively, I thought that I could just load an object file programmatically.  It looks like GDB is perfectly happy to load cross-architecture object files for symbol/type purposes.  In order to not kill any real/useful symbols, or create misleading ones, a non-existent address should be used.  However, loading a\n  <code>\n   .o\n  </code>\n  at an unmapped address requires the user to verify (type\n  <code>\n   y\n  </code>\n  ), so when done from\n  <code>\n   gdb.execute(...)\n  </code>\n  it fails outright.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The trick is\n  <code>\n   from_tty=False\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <pre><code>foo = open('foo.cc','w+')\nfoo.write('struct foobar { int x; }; foobar foo;')\nfoo.close()\n\nsubprocess.check_output('g++ -w -c -g foo.cc -o foo.o', shell=True)\n\ngdb.execute('add-symbol-file foo.o 0', from_tty=False, to_string=True)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  You should now be able to view the type in gdb:\n </p>\n <pre><code>gdb $ ptype foobar\ntype = struct foobar {\n    int x;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
