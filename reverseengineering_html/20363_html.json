    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have just converted this piece of code in assembly:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n    return (1);\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Here are my questions:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Once you push the base-pointer value on to the stack, RSP will decrement automatically (to a lower address). This will also happen when memory was allocated for argc and argv (\"mov dword\" and \"mov qword\"). Is this correct? I don't see any instruction to move the stack-pointer up the stack, so I am assuming this is done implicitly.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The instruction \"mov dword [rbp-4H], edi\" is 4 bytes less than the address in RBP, this is as expected since DWORD is 4 bytes in length. What I am confused about is why \"mov qword [rbp-10H], rsi\" is 10H (16 bytes)? Isn't QWORD 8 bytes in length? I was expecting the instruction to be \"mov qword [rbp-CH], rsi\", since 4+8=12 bytes.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Can you explain to me what the comments on the right-side are?\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Below is the assembly code generated from my c program:\n </p>\n <pre><code>SECTION .text   align=1 execute                         ; section number 1, code\n\nmain:   ; Function begin\npush    rbp                                     ; 0000 _ 55\nmov     rbp, rsp                                ; 0001 _ 48: 89.

The alignment value is usually an implementation detail, but compilers usually follow Intel's recommendations to align/place variables next to each other.\n </p>\n <p>\n  According to\n  <a href=\"http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual\n  </a>\n  , section 3.6.7 Stack Alignment*:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Performance penalty of unaligned access to the stack happens when a\nmemory reference splits a cache line.
