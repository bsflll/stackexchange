    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  In the C# decompilation in dnSpy, single clicking on a class or method name takes you to the definition of it. This is handy, but I don't want it to happen every time I click almost anywhere. Sometimes I just want to highlight something to see where it's used. Is there some setting to change this behavior to require double click, or some keypress, as in most IDEs? I can't find it in Options, but maybe I missed it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
