If you have only the binary, then you'll need a hex editor, search for the instruction sequence, and change it there.  However, the snippet is insufficient to know what kind of return is needed here.  You might have more luck by changing the jump target to the functions true epilogue, so that the stack is cleared correctly.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

The\n  <kbd>\n   Change byte\n  </kbd>\n  option could be exactly what you're looking for, but you need to know the hex representation of your opcodes to find the old one and replace it by the same number of bytes. Also, this seems to be limited to 16 bytes at a time, if I remember correctly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Alternatively pick the\n  <kbd>\n   Assemble...\n  </kbd>\n  option and enter\n  <code>\n   ret\n  </code>\n  . Any trailing bytes (your\n  <code>\n   jmp\n  </code>\n  should be at least two bytes) will simply appear as non-code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One point that may matter: this only applies to the IDB itself, not to the binary from which it got loaded. Use the last option in the popup menu for\n  <em>\n   that\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Regarding the part where you take something like the <code>ret</code> mnemonic and try to get to <code>C3</code>, I think you want something like <a href=\"https://github.com/intelxed/xed\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">xed</a>. Probably other libraries exist. But that part would also be \"forward\" engineering, as in <i>assembling</i> to the binary form.
