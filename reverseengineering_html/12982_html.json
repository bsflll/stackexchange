It might not have all the sequencing information you're looking for but I used it as a basis to do something similar a while ago.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you don't want to do it dynamically with IDA's debugger, you can similarly use an IDA Python script to parse the callgraph of a binary. I think Grey Hat Python has a section on IDA Python if you don't want to/can't find open source resources (though I believe there are other plugins that do something like this).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
