This time IDA was able to display both KiSwapContext and SwapContext functions very similar output as WinDbg. On the PC which is not displaying these two functions in IDA I tried uninstalling Norton Security but that didn't help. Doing a search for SwapContext in IDA displays the following two functions:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   SwapContext_PatchStMxCsr and\nSwapContext_PatchLdt\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does anyone know why this is the case ? Could this be a windows update patch by Microsoft and the real SwapContext is hidden somewhere else ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I decided to take your advice and got IDA to reload the symbol file for ntoskrnl.exe (namely ntkrnlmp.pdb) and this time all is working. Both KiSwapContext and SwapContext functions were displayed properly in IDA.</span>",
