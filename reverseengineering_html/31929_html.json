No:\n <code>\n  shell32.dll\n </code>\n is a so-called\n <i>\n  known DLL\n </i>\n . Unless loaded with a fully qualified path, the official\n <code>\n  shell32.dll\n </code>\n will be mapped to the process by the loader essentially. There is a \"preloaded\" (by the session manager) global section object available for each of the known DLLs - two sets exist on systems with WOW64 - in\n <code>\n  \\KnownDlls\n </code>\n and\n <code>\n  \\KnownDlls32\n </code>\n respectively.
