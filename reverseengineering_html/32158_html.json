I would like to find an equivalent type of documentation to the following, but for .NET resources:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/menurc/resourceheader\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/menurc/resourceheader\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  As an example, here is a screenshot of four .NET resources in a sample of AgentTesla:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VZzAD.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Dotnet Resources\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VZzAD.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Focusing on one of them as an example and saving it to a file, in a hex editor, you can see the header and where the PNG data begins. Where is documentation about the specific structure of this header and data?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XLTGR.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"One Dotnet Resource\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XLTGR.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  For reference, here is the hash of the file in the screenshots above:\n40cd96e25835eeba956645398ed73a0f0e14563375530fa5f2db3bcf44dd88d7\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

As dotnet's runtime is open-source (dotnet/corert) you can use the constant you provided to find the details within its repository. This constant resides in RuntimeResourceSet.cs and is linked at\n <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/blob/master/src/System.Private.CoreLib/shared/System/Resources/RuntimeResourceSet.cs#L98\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  github.com/dotnet/corert/blob/master/src/System.Private.CoreLib/…\n </a>\n .\n</span>\n</body></html>",
