I'll skip over some stuff that you might already understand, but we may need to expand this if some stuff is not clear.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   MOV DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-30],400400\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   MOV DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-30],DWORD PTR DS:[400400]\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  The syntax is a bit wonky but we can understand that you want to encode a\n  <code>\n   MOV\n  </code>\n  with two memory operands.\nLet's take a look at some documentation\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ref:\n  <a href=\"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/MOV.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/MOV.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is no possible encoding for\n  <code>\n   MOV\n  </code>\n  that accepts\n  <code>\n   m32,m32\n  </code>\n  . With\n  <code>\n   m32\n  </code>\n  understood to be a 32 bit pointer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It's not obvious this is the case, but unfortunately it is.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ref:\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/33799523/10279341\">\n   https://stackoverflow.com/a/33799523/10279341\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is a good answer if you care about\n  <em>\n   why\n  </em>\n  , but it is supplemental reading only, not critical to this situation.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  So, if we want to copy memory to memory with x86:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ref:\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/1299094/10279341\">\n   https://stackoverflow.com/a/1299094/10279341\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  A commonly accepted solution is to use a register as a temporary value store.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Take note that we need to save the state of the register we are using else we might accidentally alter the program state.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   MOV ECX,DWORD PTR DS:[400400]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   MOV DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-30],ECX\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  So this is on the right track. But we need to save\n  <code>\n   ECX\n  </code>\n  beforehand in case something else is using it.\n </p>\n <pre><code>0x00000000: 51                  push ecx\n0x00000001: 8b 0d 00 04 40 00   mov ecx, dword ptr [0x400400]\n0x00000007: 89 4d e2            mov dword ptr [ebp - 0x1e], ecx\n0x0000000a: 59                  pop ecx\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This should do that you want. We save\n  <code>\n   ECX\n  </code>\n  by pushing it onto the stack. Load the value at address\n  <code>\n   0x400400\n  </code>\n  into\n  <code>\n   ECX\n  </code>\n  . Then write the value of\n  <code>\n   ECX\n  </code>\n  into the memory at\n  <code>\n   [EBP-0x1E]\n  </code>\n  , then restore\n  <code>\n   ECX\n  </code>\n  to it's previous value.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  So how do we patch this into the binary image?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The above assembly is 11 bytes in length and our goal is to alter the instruction\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   0:  c7 45 e2 4c 00 00 00    mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x1e],0x4c\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Which we can see is 7 bytes long.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We can get these extra 4 bytes by use of a \"code cave\". We will redirect execution into an unused bit of memory, execute our code, then jump back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ref:\n  <a href=\"https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20240/The-Beginners-Guide-to-Codecaves\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20240/The-Beginners-Guide-to-Codecaves\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  In short, we're looking \"empty space\" that is allocated/mapped within the exe image, preferably in the .text section, but are not used by the program\n  <em>\n   under any circumstances\n  </em>\n  . This will occur in nearly every executable image due to SectionAlignment in Windows PE being 4096 by default.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The easiest way to implement this is to find unused bytes in the same region of memory that we are trying to modify.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A rudimentary way of finding/applying a code cave with ollydbg is shown here:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://medium.com/@vysec.private/backdoor-101-f318110e1fcb\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   https://medium.com/@vysec.private/backdoor-101-f318110e1fcb\n  </a>\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  After finding suitable memory for our cave, patch in the shellcode:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0x00000000: 51                  push ecx\n0x00000001: 8b 0d 00 04 40 00   mov ecx, dword ptr [0x400400]\n0x00000007: 89 4d e2            mov dword ptr [ebp - 0x1e], ecx\n0x0000000a: 59                  pop ecx\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  using ollydbg's assembler.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then change the original instruction of\n  <code>\n   mov DWORD PTR [ebp-0x1e],0x4c\n  </code>\n  to\n  <code>\n   JMP x\n  </code>\n  where\n  <code>\n   x\n  </code>\n  is your shellcode address, in the same module/image.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Overwrite the rest of the instruction bytes with 0x90 (NOP) if you want.

One possibility would be to create the machine code (usually not by hand, but from an assembler), then patch it in the exe file and test it in your debugger. Often the tricky part is to find a free mem location, large enough, and to not introduce new errors, by e.g. relying on absolute mem addresses (try to understand what \"ASLR\" means) etc. No standard recipes exist.</span>",
