Its very beneficial to understand that everything just comes back to binary. The rest is all just representations. There is no difference between 'A', 0x41, and 0b01000000. You will have to put the leading zero infront of your example, although compilers could assume, that i'm not sure of) but there is a large difference better 0b01100000 (PUSHA) and 0b1110000 (LOOPNZ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  For x86, it might be interesting for you to look at the op code encoding\n  <a href=\"http://ref.x86asm.net/coder32.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   a table can be found here\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  In terms of machine code, the op code deems how many more bytes are needed to complete an instruction. This is one of the differences between a RISC (e.g. ARM) and CISC (e.g. x86) architectures. RISC instructions sets use a fixed instruction length, where as CISC instruction sets have variable instruction lengths.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
