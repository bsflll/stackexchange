I see in the\n  <a href=\"https://datasheetspdf.com/pdf-file/980707/Intel/87C54/1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   datasheet\n  </a>\n  that it has lock bits which can disable the verify (read) function, but I'm not sure if that causes an attempted verify to yield all FF's, or if it would give an error of some kind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the situation where the lock bits are in fact set, is there any known way to bypass them and dump the firmware from the chip? Keep in mind, this chip came from a very rare board, and that chip is the only copy I have of the program, so I don't want to risk erasing it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
