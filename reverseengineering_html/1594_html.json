If you are unsure, you can check whether the cryptid bit is set with otool (see\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7038143/executable-encryption-check-anti-piracy-measure\">\n   this page\n  </a>\n  ).\n </p>\n <pre><code>otool -arch armv7 -l thebinary | grep crypt\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  (where thebinary is the executable binary - see the app's Info.plist, CFBundleExecutable key)\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Pre Decryption:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  if cryptid is 0, you can proceed on to the\n  <em>\n   Post Decryption\n  </em>\n  section. Otherwise, you will need to decrypt the app. The typical method in brief (with a jailbroken iOS device) is to\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Install otool, gdb and ldid from Cydia\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Install the IPA on an\n   <em>\n    authorized\n   </em>\n   device\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Run otool on the binary to get information such as the size of the encrypted payload\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Launch the app and suspend it immediately\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Use gdb to dump the payload (beginning from 0x2000)\n   <code>\n    gdb -p <process id>\n   </code>\n   then\n   <code>\n    dump output.bin 0x2000 0xNNNN\n   </code>\n   where NNNN is the sum of the beginning (0x2000) and the payload size\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Create a new file, using the first 0x1000 bytes of the original binary, and appended with the dump file\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Use ldid to sign the new binary, and change the cryptid to 0 (so that iOS won't decrypt the decrypted app again)\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  There are many tools of dubious purposes (piracy) which automates the process, however the above is the gist of how the process is done.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Post Decryption:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can begin reverse engineering the code when you have access to an unencrypted copy of the binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One possible tool is IDA Pro (Free version does not support ARM).\nIt may still be quite messy since much of iOS's code works with objc_sendMsg().
