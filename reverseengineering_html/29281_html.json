Why Ida cannot recognize such famous function? How can I \"help\" Ida to recognize functions like that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That makes my reversing more easier.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You can use them to identify common definitions from various libraries. You just need to download the flirt signatures, and let IDA do the work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A public flirtdb repo can be found on github\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/Maktm/FLIRTDB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  . You can search for others on google too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit: My bad, totally missed out the ARM linux part. Unfortunately, these signatures are not built into IDA, although I think IDA might have provided some default ones. For ARM linux, I can't seem to find any public ones online, so you may have to generate your own signatures. To do so, you basically generate signatures off precompiled library files. Check out\n  <a href=\"https://www.boozallen.com/s/insight/blog/ida-flirt-signatures-for-linux-binaries.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   this guide\n  </a>\n  I found and see if it works for you.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
