    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Another slightly esoteric microcontroller in a product I'm looking at - the NEC 78K0R microcontroller. This is a 16-bit extension of the 78K0. The 78K0 can be disassembled in IDA Pro, but not the 78K0R.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Renesas Cubesuite allows viewing of disassembly of code compiled/assembled through it, as does IAR Workbench, but I can't see a way of loading a bin or hex file into these for disassembly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  KPIT GNU binutils has support for the RL78, which has a lot in common with the 78K0 instruction set, but is still very different.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a free disassembler for these microcontrollers?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
