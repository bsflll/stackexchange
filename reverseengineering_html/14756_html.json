    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Can anyone point me in the right direction for tutorials etc on reverse engineering RS484 connected battery management system?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have a large 12V lithium battery module which has an internal BMS and its official diagnostic program running on an old XP laptop which uses an RS485-USB dongle to connect the two.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have RealTerm running on the XP laptop snooping on the RS485 connection and can see oodles of traffic going to and fro between the two.  The trafic consists of lots of bytes of data some of which is ASCii plain text which clearlu identifies itself as relating to the battery/diagnostic app (it has the manufacturers name etc in it).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I would like some help in deciphering the traffic as it must represent the battery's internal voltages and temperatures etc that are displayed in the Diagnostic app on the laptop.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ultimately, I want to build a very basic PIC-based (as this is what I already know - I appreciate it may be time to move on to Arduino or similar) 'master' BMS to monitor several battery modules and control the charging and/or trigger alarms should something go out of whack in any of the battery modules.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Regards, MW.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You are right about the PIC, @John.  Unless there is a need for the reader to be smaller than a Pi I can't see any good reason to make that move.  I was happy with it on Win7 but now the Pi is hidden somewhere (with power) and I don't have to worry about it.

Here are some examples:\n  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=flat%20straight-through%20rj-45%20for%20rs485&newwindow=1&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjeiOyB27HSAhXlJMAKHdrsD-4Q_AUICCgB&biw=1366&bih=616\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   RJ-45 terminated cable pinouts for RS-485\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  As opposed to normal Ethernet cables that are TIA-568A or 568B like this:\n  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=tia-568b&newwindow=1&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj5n9aC3LHSAhWIAcAKHQiwBvYQ_AUICCgB&biw=1366&bih=616\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   TIA-568 A/B cables for Ethernet\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  They are NOT interchangeable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As I have searched I am finding very few people trying to do this, but there is a lot of information about RS-485.  Modbus is one thing, but it appears my brand uses nonstandard wiring.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Right now I am using my Win7 machine, (RS485-to-USB) but will soon move it all over to a Raspberry Pi 3 if I can get Debian drivers for it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It sounds like you are a bit ahead of me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am processing all the data in Python.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
