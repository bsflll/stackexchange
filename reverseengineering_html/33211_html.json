    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  If I understand correctly, when a bug-check happens, the\n  <code>\n   KeBugCheckEx\n  </code>\n  function saves the contents of physical memory pages in a swap-file and then the actual\n  <code>\n   .dmp\n  </code>\n  file is created only when the system boots back up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Which NT function is used to save the\n  <code>\n   .dmp\n  </code>\n  file during the boot? And is it in\n  <code>\n   ntoskrnl\n  </code>\n  or in\n  <code>\n   crashdmp.sys\n  </code>\n  ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I also wonder if the same function is responsible for creating different types of crash dump files, i.e. full dump, kernel dump, small dump, live kernel dump?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So I don't know.</span>",

The actual .dmp file is created in user mode after a reboot by the <code>smss.exe</code> process as a part of initializing the page file. <code>smss!SmpCheckForCrashDump</code> has something to do with it. I need to check it further.</span>",
