I don't even know if the\n  <code>\n   addss\n  </code>\n  lines are the correct ones where I can modify the step value (the one that increases or decreases the last\n  <code>\n   xmm0\n  </code>\n  value in\n  <code>\n   movss [eax+30],xmm0 | movss [eax+34],xmm0 | movss [eax+38],xmm0\n  </code>\n  ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am using\n  <a href=\"http://www.cheatengine.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   [CE's]\n  </a>\n  auto assembler tool to achieve this, modifying memory values.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
