It's a standard-looking comic though without much action, but the picture's alt title says \"Wait for it.\". I waited but nothing happened (tried in Opera and IE9) so I took a look at the page source.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Next to the picture's\n  <code>\n   <img>\n  </code>\n  tag there was a\n  <code>\n   <script>\n  </code>\n  which included the following URL:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://imgs.xkcd.com/static/time07.min.js\">\n   http://imgs.xkcd.com/static/time07.min.js\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried to make sense of it, but I can't figure it out. Can someone explain how it works and what was supposed to happen?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

However, there doesn't seem to be much explanation on what exactly the script does, but more of \"here's the URLs it fetches\". I hope someone can post an overview of the script's main parts and how they interact. I, for one, am lost in all the callbacks and closures.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

The bulk of the script seems to be an implementation of EventSource - which, while important, is not terribly interesting for our purposes, so I've omitted it here. After some Googling around, I am in fact fairly certain that the EventSource implementation used here is\n   <a href=\"https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource\">\n    https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource\n   </a>\n   - after minifying and beautifying that code, it looks very similar to what shows up in time07.min.js.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  As far as I can tell, it has no magic in it and serves just as a simple way for the server to let the client know when there is a new image.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
