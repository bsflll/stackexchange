    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I’m trying to repurpose a batch of small TFT screens salvaged from disposable vapes (1.8-inch, made by YIHUA TFT). I’ve searched for information on the display and the connector type but haven’t found much, so I’m hoping to get some guidance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The screen has a 10-pin FPC cable, 6.4 mm wide, and it connects using a press-in/snap-in connector, not the usual ZIF slide-in type. The ribbon cable reads YIHUA TFT YH-177RX6955C2. I’m attaching pictures of the display and the board it was connected to, including a close-up of the chip labeled “Notion,” which seems to be the display controller.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I found this blog about something similar .\n  <a href=\"https://ripitapart.com/category/disposable-vape-hacks/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   This website\n  </a>\n  looks to be similar to what I'm trying to do. Just a different screen/connector. Mine might not be as difficult as this I think (possibly even more difficult)? But I could be wrong. Either way I believe I am on the right track.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What I’ve Tried:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Searches for YIHUA TFT and YH-177RX6955C2 didn’t yield any specific datasheets or specs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I looked into ZIF and FFC connectors, but this one seems different (more like a direct press-fit type).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I plan to interface it with an Arduino or ESP32, assuming it might use a standard protocol like SPI, but I’m unsure where to start without a pinout.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Questions:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can anyone help confirm the type of FPC connector this is?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does anyone have experience with YIHUA TFT displays or similar press-fit connectors?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Are there recommended steps for testing unknown TFT displays with a microcontroller?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DdmHuRA4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"image1\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DdmHuRA4.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/26Q9GulM.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"image2\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/26Q9GulM.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UmJQsQtE.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"image3\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UmJQsQtE.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0klp3hKC.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"image4\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0klp3hKC.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZL32ChTm.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"image5\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZL32ChTm.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oJRs9qA4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"image6\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oJRs9qA4.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2d4QK3M6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"image7\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2d4QK3M6.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

And you could re-engineer the connections of the connector's pins to find supply lines and communicatoin lines. Then can happen with partial disassembly, as you have multiple of the devices.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
