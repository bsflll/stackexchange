It works just fine on XP, but Win7 randomizes address space (ASLR), so this trick become impossible and program crashes with call of my hardcoded\n  <code>\n   printf()\n  </code>\n  address.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What should I do to retrieve IAT RVA of this\n  <code>\n   printf()\n  </code>\n  in win7 to make this work?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
