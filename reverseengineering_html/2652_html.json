It is certainly true that not all DF is for legal cases, but that is what forensics means :)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Reverse engineering is the process of , well, reversing someone else's engineering. There are plenty of reasons to use RE techniques that don't have anything to do with legal investigations, including reversing to gain and maintain compatibility or purely for education and knowledge.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Decompilation/disassembly, debugging, and reading code/assembly, are all techniques that can be used in DF (DFIR), development and testing of software and hardware, as well as RE.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Although I agree much more could be said about the forensic perspective differing from that of RE I don't agree with either of your suggestions. I would say that desired outcome dictates techniques in both fields. Most forensics processes take great care to be reproducible and not to destroy evidence. I think the same is true in a very different way of RE.</span>",
