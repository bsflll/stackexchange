The current DR source tree; however, does not contain DRK, despite the existence of a branch. DRK has yet to be open sourced, and U of T is actively doing kernel DBT research using DRK and a new DBT framework.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you are thinking of porting it yourself, the two main challenges are:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Interrupts and how they interact with the code cache. DRK took the \"direct port\" approach. For example, where DR uses thread-private code caches, DRK uses CPU-private code caches. This results in a lot of annoyances w.r.t. transparency and interrupts.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   What level of transparency you want. DR was designed with a lot of transparency in mind, and DRK kept that promise. My experience with kernel instrumentation so far has been that it is remarkably well-behaved (unless you care about a small portion of device drivers). Transparency on several fronts can be sacrificed, but this is more challenging within the general DR framework.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
