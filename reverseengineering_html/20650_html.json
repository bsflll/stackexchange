If i run the program in gdb i'll get the following error:\n\"Program received signal SIGILL, Illegal instruction.\"\nI researched a bit and found out that it is a problem of libcrypto and that i can ignore that signals using \"handle SIGILL nostop noprint\" before running. Works in gdb, but does not with a gdbserver.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Question:\nHow can i use \"handle SIGILL nostop noprint\" with a gdbserver? If i connect IDA to my gdbserver it always crash with the SIGILL, Illegal instruction error message.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
