So there was no reason for them to reverse engineer anything. Now, IF they had had only the .class files, they would have had to use a java decompiler, possibly fix decompiler errors, annotate the sources, do some optimizations, whatever. But there's no serious way to guesstimate timeframe and cost - running something like\n <code>\n  jd-gui\n </code>\n over the java classes cost an hour.
