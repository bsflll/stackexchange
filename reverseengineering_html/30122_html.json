    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I would like to use regular python packages in my IDAPython scripts, but I can't figure out how to install them into IDA's Python environment. I don't even know where this python environment is, or even where IDA's python.exe is, because\n  <code>\n   sys.executable\n  </code>\n  just prints the\n  <code>\n   ida.exe\n  </code>\n  file path. I can make it work with\n  <em>\n   some\n  </em>\n  packages, like yara and FIDL by installing them with pip, and copying the module's folder from my own python environment's\n  <code>\n   site-packages\n  </code>\n  folder over to\n  <code>\n   <IDA Install Path>\\python\\3\\\n  </code>\n  , but this method doesn't work with more complex modules that have dependencies to other modules, or native DLLs (for example pywin32).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there an easier way to install python packages into IDA so i can just simply import them into my IDAPython scripts?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Basically, IDAPython doesn't use my default system Python installation (in\n  <code>\n   C:\\Python10\n  </code>\n  ), instead it uses the one in\n  <code>\n   %localappdata%\\Programs\\Python\\Python310\\\n  </code>\n  . So all I had to do was to make sure that I'm calling\n  <code>\n   pip\n  </code>\n  in this python installation directory and not the default one, and now I can import pip packages into IDA.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Inside <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Hex-Rays\\IDA</code> find (or create) an <code>REG_SZ</code> value named <code>Python3TargetDLL</code> and point it at whichever Python version you please, e.g. <code>C:\\Program Files\\Python310\\python3.dll</code>. Normally you can use whichever <code>pythonXX.dll</code> you like, but I have issues with <code>python310.dll</code> vs. <code>python3.dll</code> in Wine. On Windows you can use <code>py</code> (Python launcher) to launch the default Python instance or select an alternative one. Don't recall where Python stores which is the default, but the installers offer the option.</span>",
