It's very easy to use it - just make first shot of the registry before you launch your app and then second shot (after say 3-5 minutes) and then press\n  <em>\n   compare\n  </em>\n  -button.\n  <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/regshot/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   regshot\n  </a>\n  will make a report about registry keys/values that have been opened, added, deleted.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
