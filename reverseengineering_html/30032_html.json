I know A.dll uses the main function from B.dll, and they both works perfectly. However, I need to do some other stuff, so I wrote my own DLL (let's call C.dll) and added its funtions to A.dll import table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now I need A.dll to call these functions, just like it does evoking B.dll function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I used CFF Explorer to add  C.dll functions as import to A.dll, but my functions are not being executed. I need this to be done this way, since the main .exe file (which I don't have the source code aswell) will call A.dll on startup.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks for help! :)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

For each export in the Z.DLL, you create an export in your A.DLL with the same name of the function but coming from Z.DLL.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, if Z.DLL exports \"MySuperFunction\", your A.DLL will export table entry for \"MySuperFunction\" will point to the string \"Z.MySuperFunction, instead of code in your DLL.  If you need to to additional work before calling the original function, then you can import the original function from Z.DLL, and your export code will be the code that you want to run first.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I managed to a workaround, I put my code on DLL entrypoint, since this function is loades as soon as the OS loads the DLL. But your solution seems way better. How can I \"redirect\" the calls from my C.dll to A.dll? I mean, I don't have theri .h files.</span>",

I then wrote a script that took the list and generated a header file that contained one statement like this for each function Z.DLL exported:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#pragma comment(linker, \"/export:[mangled_func_name]=[Z.DLL_name].[mangled_func],@[func_ordinal]\")\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  These need to be mangled names, and the field [Z.DLL_name] shouldn't contain the file extension!\n </p>\n <p>\n  You should now be able to\n  <code>\n   include\n  </code>\n  this header in your DLL and compile it. Put your A.DLL in the program's directory and you now have an \"empty\" proxy DLL. It only forwards the function calls through your A.DLL to the original Z.DLL for now though, which is thw work of these\n  <code>\n   pragma\n  </code>\n  s.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To do something interesting, you need to\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   find the mangled name of the function you want to replace\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   run it through\n   <code>\n    undname\n   </code>\n   to get the unmangled signature\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   add a function with that signature to your A.DLL\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   mark your function to be exported using e.g.\n   <code>\n    __declspec(dllexport)\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   delete the corresponding\n   <code>\n    #pragma\n   </code>\n   in your header\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Voil√†! The program now calls your custom function in A.DLL while everything else is passed to Z.DLL.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you need to call the original function, you should be able to do that using\n  <code>\n   LoadLibrary\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   GetProcAddress\n  </code>\n  , but I haven't done this before.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
