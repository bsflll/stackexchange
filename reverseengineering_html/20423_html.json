And I have no clue what tool obfuscated this file.\n  \n\n  And I'm also curious about how can this dylib overwrite exisiting functions?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note: I've read\n  <a href=\"https://alexomara.com/blog/a-silly-anti-disassembly-trick/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://alexomara.com/blog/a-silly-anti-disassembly-trick/\n  </a>\n  , however this dylib isn't that trick, but is really obfuscated XD\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
