If we do perhaps we can include it in the Wireshark decoding.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  My research\n </h2>\n <p>\n  Doing a trace of my iPhone with Wireshark I see:\n </p>\n <pre><code>  Tag: Vendor Specific: Apple, Inc.\n    Tag Number: Vendor Specific (221)\n    Tag length: 10\n    OUI: 00:17:f2 (Apple, Inc.)\n    Vendor Specific OUI Type: 6\n    Vendor Specific Data: 06010103030000\n\nHex:  dd 0a 00 17 f2 06 01 01 03 03 00 00\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  A guide about making OpenWRT appear as a personal hotspot they used\n  <code>\n   vendor_elements=DD0A0017F206010103010000'\n  </code>\n  and it worked (ref\n  <a href=\"https://www.yichya.dev/configure-access-point-as-personal-hotspot/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   yichya.dev\n  </a>\n  ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some additional info that can help. If you run\n  <code>\n   airport -s --xml\n  </code>\n  on MacOS you can see both the IE and what appears to be some parsing of the element:\n </p>\n <pre><code>      <key>IE</key>\n      <data>\n      AA9hcF9taXNoYXJlX2NmNjABCIwSmCSwSGBsIAEAOwUAU1R9gTAUAQAAD6wE\n      AQAAD6wEAQAAD6wCDAAtGu8AE///AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAPRaV\n      BREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA3RgAUPICAQGBAAIyAAAiMgAAQjJeAGIy\n      LwC/DLIAgDP6/2ID+v9iA8AFAZsA+v9/CAUACAAAAABA/xYjAAAAAAAAAAAA\n      AAAAAAAAAADw//D//wok9H8AD/z/AZsA3QoAF/IGAQEDAQAA\n      </data>\n      <key>IOS_IE</key>\n      <dict>\n         <key>IOS_IE_FEATURES</key>\n         <data>AQAA</data>\n         <key>IOS_IE_FEATURE_VERSION</key>\n         <integer>1</integer>\n         <key>IOS_IE_FEATURE_WOW_DISALLOWED</key>\n         <true />\n      </dict>\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  User\n  <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/19756/hewigovens\">\n   @hewigovens\n  </a>\n  found a private method determine if it is a personal hotspot based on the IOS_IE (\n  <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/206770/342719\">\n   ref\n  </a>\n  ):\n </p>\n <pre><code>char -[CWNetwork(Private) isPersonalHotspot](void * self, void * _cmd) {\n    eax = [*(self + 0x4) objectForKey:@\"IOS_IE\"];\n    eax = LOBYTE(eax != 0x0 ? 0x1 : 0x0) & 0xff;\n    return eax;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  At minimum I think this should be enough for us to determine which bit(s) encode if it is hotspot.\n </p>\n <h3>\n  Unanswered questions\n </h3>\n <p>\n  What do IOS_IE_FEATURES / IOS_IE_FEATURE_VERSION / IOS_IE_FEATURE_WOW_DISALLOWED represent? How do they map to the vendor tag?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I had a different vendor tag then yichya.dev\n  <code>\n   06 01 01 03 03 00 00\n  </code>\n  vs.\n  <code>\n   06 01 01 03 01 00 00\n  </code>\n  but the decoded XML elements were the same.\n </p>\n <p>\n  IOS_IE_FEATURE_WOW_DISALLOWED might represent Woke on Wireless, but not sure if that is configurable to test.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also can we get more insight from the CoreWLAN implementation?\n </p>\n <p>\n  This same vendor tag might be used for CarPlay networks, what does it look like in a trace?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Was this tag used with AirPort routers? Do we have examples?\n </p>\n <p>\n  For iPhone and personal hotspot are there any settings I can change to see if results in any changes?\n </p>\n <h3>\n  Attempting to decode\n </h3>\n <p>\n  <s>\n   The first octet is probably the length: 06\n  </s>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Edit: The first octet is the Vendor Specific OUI Type. In this case 06. For the same OUI (00:17:f2) iOS devices also uses OUI Type 10 in the Probe Request and Associate Request (\n   <a href=\"https://gfiber.googlesource.com/vendor/google/platform/+/1516fa85d2a80505f70f7b224033c3c2c7f493c1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    ref\n   </a>\n   )\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Decoding IOS_IE_FEATURES value AQAA from base64 gives us 01 00 00 which doesn't directly map the vendor tag for either example, but it might just be the first octet that matters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of the octets is probably IOS_IE_FEATURE_VERSION: 01\n </p>\n <p>\n  The next octet matches for both, but unsure the meaning: 03\n </p>\n <p>\n  The final octet is 01 for them and 03 for me.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
