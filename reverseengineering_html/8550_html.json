If the attributes contain unexpected values (e.g.\n  <em>\n   PAGE_NOACCESS\n  </em>\n  ), chances are that someone messed with your pages (possibly a debugger setting a memory breakpoint).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This trick can easily detect memory breakpoints. It relies on the fact\n  that the \"\n   <strong>\n    ReadProcessMemory\n   </strong>\n   \" function returns false if you try to read\n  guarded or no-access memory. To use this trick, all you have to do is\n  call the \"\n   <strong>\n    ReadProcessMemory\n   </strong>\n   \" function with the \"\n   <strong>\n    Handle\n   </strong>\n   \" parameter set\n  to\n   <strong>\n    0xFFFFFFFF\n   </strong>\n   , the \"\n   <strong>\n    lpBaseAddress\n   </strong>\n   \" parameter set to the image base,\n  and the \"\n   <strong>\n    nSize\n   </strong>\n   \" parameter set to the size of image. If it returns\n  false, then at least one memory breakpoint is present.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  As for your other question -- \"How can i avoid detection?\" -- that is answered here:\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/8510/1562\">\n   https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/8510/1562\n  </a>\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   You can't know how to avoid getting detected if you don't know how the\n  detection works.

However this poses a problem since several compilers insert 0xCC bytes between functions (as kind of a trap in case of memory overwrite, I guess)\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"INT3 padding between functions shown in IDA\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DG56X.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, you would have to do is to know how many of those \"innocent\" INT3 was there before and check for anomalies.
