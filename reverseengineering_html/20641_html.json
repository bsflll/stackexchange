Something I would recommend though is trying kernel debugging with Windbg.  It's excellent because it has far more capability than ollydbg, albeit with a steeper learning curve.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Specifically you can have Windbg break on thread creation.  No thread can begin without going through the operating system, and windbg catches that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note: you are going to need to set up kernel debugging with Windbg which means you will need a VM.  You should probably be doing your dynamic analysis in a VM anyways...\n </p>\n <pre><code>SXE ct\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/controlling-exceptions-and-events\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/controlling-exceptions-and-events\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
