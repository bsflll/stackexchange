My initial approach is to look at the\n  <code>\n   msg()\n  </code>\n  calls and the strings they use. I can dump the strings, and most of the strings in the binary are also in the C code. However, Ghidra shows only one or two strings as being referenced anywhere.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Disassembly seems to be working since it's matching relatively closely between the binary and the repository code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Binary\n  </strong>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n8AKp.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"disassembly\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n8AKp.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Repository Code\n  </strong>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UIjH4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"repository code\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UIjH4.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note that the file in question isn't an ELF or PE/COFF. It's a boot loader image where the very first address is the first instruction (that jumps down past some header info to 00000338). Supposedly it gets loaded into SRAM at address 0x00000000. I believe that since the jump at address 0x00 does seem to go to the correct location (0x00000338).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I suppose as part of the setup code, the strings could get copied elsewhere...\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So that means the code can access data based at 0x0 and also the same data starting at offset 0x20000 (which it does for strings). So I added an entry, \"SRAM A\", to my Memory Map:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/z62hE.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"memory map\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/z62hE.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  As you can see, the source of the data comes from the same binary file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then I went hunting for all the pointers to the strings which pointed out past 0x20000 and converted them to string pointers. Here's one:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3muIv.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"pointer to SRAM\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3muIv.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's the string in SRAM (it's referenced):\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Z6gza.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"SRAM string\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Z6gza.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's the same string based at 0x0 (it has no references):\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1DV6G.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"0x0 string\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1DV6G.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I suspect there are many other reasons that strings won't show up as referenced in Ghidra--this is just one possible reason.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
