How can I force curl to not verify SSL certificates for fiddler to intercept? I am using the environment variable \"all_proxy\" for cURL to make it use the fiddler proxy, but it won't accept the self-signed cert from fiddler. I have the fiddler cert trusted in my certificate store.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
