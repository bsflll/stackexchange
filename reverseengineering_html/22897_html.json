When I tried extracting it, I got an empty output.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KdmVp.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KdmVp.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I then found a\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/12267/firmware-extraction-problems-binwalk-is-blank/12269\">\n   post\n  </a>\n  which I thought would help me but when I tried using binvis.io, this is what I got:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3iSgT.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3iSgT.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm a newbie so that means it's empty right?\n </p>\n <p>\n  So my question is, what could've cause this to happened? Because when I extract it from a nRf51 chip using OpenOCD and ST-Link V2, it does show that what I extracted is 256kB.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My guess right now is that it is encrypted? Or could it be because im using Windows to execute this? If so, I can try using Kali Linux since I run dual boot. Or maybe I did something wrong when extracting the bin file with OpenOCD? Below is the command used.\n </p>\n <pre><code>dump_image stock_nrf51.bin 0x0 0x40000\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Sorry if I sound silly. Newbie here. Please let me know if I'm not being specific enough or not providing enough information. Would gladly provide them if you need them such as bin file etc.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
