    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am trying to retrieve text from another program. I used\n  <em>\n   Ollydbg\n  </em>\n  to find the address for the function I need to hook to get the info. I used\n  <strong>\n   <em>\n    EasyHook\n   </em>\n  </strong>\n  to inject the code below.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The hook works fine until I call the original function. It crashes each time I do. I think it may have something to do with the return type of the function. Since I am new to reversing, I am having trouble determining the correct return type. I tried several different return types ranging from void to int. After the function returns,\n  <code>\n   EAX\n  </code>\n  points to a unicode string but the value isn't used. From what I read,\n  <code>\n   EAX\n  </code>\n  is where a returned variable would be stored.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Update:\n  </strong>\n  \n\n  I now see that this exception is occurring.\n </p>\n <pre><code>System.AccessViolationException: Attempted to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt.\n   at ServerDLL.Injector.DoSomeThingDelegate.Invoke(Int32 argument1, Int32 argument2)\n   at ServerDLL.Injector.DoSomeThing(Int32 argument1, Int32 argument2)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Calling the function:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Address   Hex dump          Command                                  Comments\n00425373  |.  894424 04     MOV DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+4],EAX             ; /Arg2\n00425377  |.  8B45 A8       MOV EAX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-58]            ; |\n0042537A  |.  890424        MOV DWORD PTR SS:[ESP],EAX               ; |Arg1\n0042537D  |.
