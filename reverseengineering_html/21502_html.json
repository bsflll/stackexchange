    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to reverse engineer an ECU / GSU protocol from a model airplane jet turbine, in order to make a telemetry adapter.\nI have decoded several other protocols in the past with good success but this one is especially tough, so I thought I would ask for assistance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have an Arduino Nano as the GSU emulator, with a LIN transceiver and verifying communication on a Saleae logic analyser.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ECU uses a LIN interface but on a proprietary protocol unknown to me. In order to read it I am using an Arduino with a level shifter, and I verified that the incoming data is correct.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When ECU is stand alone, it sends several strings which appear to be interrogations for bus nodes, but nobody is replying obviously.\n </p>\n <pre><code>0x0A 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x0A\n0x14 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x14\n0x1E 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x1E\n0x28 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x28\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  When the GSU is connected to the ECU, it responds immediately (\n  <code>\n   0.2\n  </code>\n  ms) after the first string (\n  <code>\n   0x0A 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x0A\n  </code>\n  ), with a\n  <code>\n   6\n  </code>\n  byte reply. Each time it is a slightly different reply.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Such a reply is followed by the ECU sending a stream of data, which is the data I need to read.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried emulating some of these GSU replies with Arduino, but the ECU never sends the stream of data back on the bus if the arduino is interrogating it; it just ignores it and continues interrogating as if nothing happened. With the GSU interrogating, the ECU replies.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have attached an Excel table that shows some of the replies and a bit of data processing I played with. It appears that the reply is a\n  <code>\n   6\n  </code>\n  byte stream, where the MSB (most significant BIT) of each byte is either\n  <code>\n   0\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   1\n  </code>\n  . I'm not sure about the rules here and why it's changing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does this make sense to anyone? \nAny reverse engineering experts can share some ideas?\nSo far haven't been able to get the ECU to answer to Arduino.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks for your help.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3meVR.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"ECU / GSU init process\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3meVR.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

My guess is it's either a challenge-response scheme, or the ECU is possibly broadcasting a key of some sorts which is in turn used immediately by the GSU to encrypt its replies. If you have such pairings one could spot a pattern. Also, the fact that just replaying data the GSU sent before isn't working supports that theory (crypto, challenge-response).\n</span>\n</body></html>",
