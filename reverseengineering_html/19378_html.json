I saw a strange block. It seems  that the\n  <code>\n   PC\n  </code>\n  , program counter register, is set to\n  <code>\n   0\n  </code>\n  . Did I miss something or do something wrong?\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  The process goes into\n  <code>\n   0x1708\n  </code>\n  in ARM mode. Below is the strange block of asm code I disassembled from the ELF file.\n </p>\n <pre><code>; section: .plt\n; function: function_1708 at 0x1708 -- 0x1718\n0x1708:   04 e0 2d e5       str lr, [sp, #-4]!\n0x170c:   04 e0 9f e5       ldr lr, [pc, #4]\n0x1710:   0e e0 8f e0       add lr, pc, lr\n0x1714:   08 f0 be e5       ldr pc, [lr, #8]!\n; data inside code section at 0x1718 -- 0x171c\n0x1718:   b4 77 00 00                                        |.w..            |\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  After executing line\n  <code>\n   0x170c\n  </code>\n  , the\n  <code>\n   LR\n  </code>\n  register should be set as the value at the address\n  <code>\n   0x1718\n  </code>\n  .

They are used to dynamically link the program calls to shared libraries functions at runtime.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In fact, a shared library can be loaded at any place in the process memory, there is no way to predict statically where it will pop up. So, the GOT/PLT load the address of each library's function dynamically at runtime and cache it for further use.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The way it works is pretty simple, the PLT (\n  <strong>\n   Procedure Linkage Table\n  </strong>\n  ) is just a bunch of small code gadgets (one for each library's function called in the program, plus one generic code located at the beginning of the PLT section).\n </p>\n <p>\n  And, the GOT (\n  <strong>\n   Global Offset Table\n  </strong>\n  ) is just a table used to store (and cache) the addresses of the library's functions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At first, the GOT is all set to zero because no function address has been resolved yet. The GOT get filled all along the program is executed and call new functions (some functions may be called only rarely and their address may be only rarely filled in the GOT).\n </p>\n <p>\n  When a library function get called the program counter goes to the PLT (see the figure below) and executes the code specifically written for this function (each of the code gadget has its own offsets to get the proper address from the GOT). But, at first, the GOT contains only zeroes, so you need to initialize it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To initialize it, you jump at the very beginning of the PLT and find the address of library's function the program want to call. You execute this code and, then, you write the address of the function in the GOT.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/m4Yl3.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"PLT/GOT Schema (before)\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/m4Yl3.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once you cached the address of the function, you do not need anymore to recompute the address if you call your function and you jump directly to it (as in the following picture).\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/sQuX8.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"PLT/GOT Schema (after)\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/sQuX8.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the case of ARM, you have two types of GOT/PLT schemas:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dai0242a/ch07s05s01.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    Direct PLTs\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dai0242a/BCGHGBDH.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    Indirect PLTs\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  In your case, this is a direct PLT (but it seems to be quite old code, I would suspect an old compiler or so, because new ones better use\n  <code>\n   ip\n  </code>\n  in place of\n  <code>\n   lr\n  </code>\n  for that).\n </p>\n <pre><code>; section: .plt\n; function: function_1708 at 0x1708 -- 0x1718\n0x1708:   04 e0 2d e5     str lr, [sp, #-4]! <-- Save lr on the stack\n0x170c:   04 e0 9f e5     ldr lr, [pc, #4] <-- Get a point of reference in memory\n0x1710:   0e e0 8f e0     add lr, pc, lr <-- Load offset to the next step\n0x1714:   08 f0 be e5     ldr pc, [lr, #8]! <-- Jump to the next step\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Note that the PLT is a static section, therefore the\n  <code>\n   0x170c\n  </code>\n  will always stay the same (and, therefore, the\n  <code>\n   pc\n  </code>\n  will always be loaded with the same value at\n  <code>\n   0x170c\n  </code>\n  ).\n </p>\n <h3>\n  References\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <a href=\"https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/11/03/position-independent-code-pic-in-shared-libraries/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n     Position Independent Code (PIC) in shared libraries\n    </a>\n    , by Eli Bendersky.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <a href=\"https://thinkingeek.com/2017/04/17/arm-assembler-raspberry-pi-chapter-27/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n     ARM assembler in Raspberry Pi – Chapter 27\n    </a>\n    , by Roger Ferrer Ibáñez.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/linaroorg/sfo15406-arm-fdpic-toolset-kernel-libraries-for-cortexm-cortexr-mmuless-cores\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n     ARM FDPIC toolset, kernel & libraries for Cortex-M & Cortex-R\n    </a>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

See the\n    <a href=\"http://www.sco.com/developers/gabi/latest/ch5.dynamic.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n     ELF specification\n    </a>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <code>\n     GOT[1]\n    </code>\n    is populated\n    <em>\n     at runtime\n    </em>\n    with the pointer to the\n    <code>\n     link_map\n    </code>\n    structure containing the list of all dynamic images present in the process. This list resides in the dynamic linker (\n    <code>\n     ld.so\n    </code>\n    on Linux systems and\n    <code>\n     linker\n    </code>\n    binary on Android).\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <code>\n     GOT[2]\n    </code>\n    is also filled in by the dynamic linker and points to the\n    <em>\n     resolver function\n    </em>\n    (\n    <code>\n     _dl_runtime_resolve\n    </code>\n    in glibc, not sure on Android).\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  The snippet you quoted is the\n  <em>\n   resolver stub\n  </em>\n  which is called on first call of an external symbol (you can see that all GOT entries are initialized to its address,\n  <code>\n   1708\n  </code>\n  ).

I would suggest you to step through this code in a debugger to see what actually happens, and match it against the source code. In addition to links from @\n  <strong>\n   perror\n  </strong>\n  , I found\n  <a href=\"http://uaf.io/exploitation/misc/2016/04/02/Finding-Functions.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   this post\n  </a>\n  which explains some of the reserved GOT entries (although for x64 Linux and not ARM Android).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
