The executable file first gets the address of\n  <code>\n   ntdll.NtContinue\n  </code>\n  and stores it in the EAX register.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After I step over the following assembly line,\n </p>\n <pre><code>  CALL EAX      ; ntdll.ZwContinue\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  then OllyDbg (v1.10) terminates the process.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have found out that this is a kind of anti-debugging mechanism but I could not figure out how to defeat it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there any plugin which I can use or any other helpful trick?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
