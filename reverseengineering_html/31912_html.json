If you're researching a C++ binary, this is easiest done by finding the constructor(s) of the structure or its parent and then following all usage of the data across the binary.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Static analysis\n </h2>\n <p>\n  To define a new structure type, open\n  <code>\n   Local Types\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   Structures\n  </code>\n  view and press\n  <code>\n   Insert\n  </code>\n  to add the structure definition.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can also create them from pseudocode view by right-clicking the desired variable name and choosing\n  <code>\n   Create new struct type\n  </code>\n  or apply an existing type with\n  <code>\n   Convert to struct *\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  This could be automated using\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idapython_docs/ida_struct.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   ida_struct\n  </a>\n  and/or\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idapython_docs/ida_typeinf.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   ida_typeinf\n  </a>\n  modules.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Debugging\n </h2>\n <p>\n  I don't think IDA has any utilities to help you identify or create structures at runtime, but there exist 3rd party tools such as\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/ajkhoury/ReClassEx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   ReClassEx\n  </a>\n  designed to help with raw memory dump structuring if you need it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
