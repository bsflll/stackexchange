I want to remote debug an application in this VM using IDA pro, I already tried these:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Copied linux_server form IDApro into this VM and tried to run it, but it gives this error: linux_server : /lib/libc.so.6 : version 'GLIBC_2.7' not foundn (required by ./linux_server)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Downloaded and extracted glibc2.7 near linux_server and modified Library search path (environment value) and then tried to run linux_server, but it failed with another error.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  I think the problem is that linux_server has been compiled using newer versions of glibc, but that version of suse is using older versions.\nso I think the question is: How can I remote debug an application in old-linux machines? Is there exists an older version of debugger that runs is such scenarios?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
