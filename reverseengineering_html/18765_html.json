However especially with ASLR enabled, different versions, RVA vs file offsets and other nuances it may be more useful to reference an instruction relative to the function start address.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the case of\n  <code>\n   CRYPTSP.CryptDuplicateHash+0C\n  </code>\n  , we can easily see the address is at offset\n  <code>\n   0x0C\n  </code>\n  within the\n  <code>\n   CryptDuplicateHash\n  </code>\n  function inside a module called\n  <code>\n   CRYPTSP\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
