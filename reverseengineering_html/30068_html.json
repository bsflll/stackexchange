    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have an (obfuscated) app with a certain class from which I would like to hook the constructor. The class has only 1 constructor defined and so I hooked the class as follows:\n </p>\n <pre><code>var Aclass = Java.use('com.Aclass');\nAclass.$init.implementation =\nfunction(argument) {\n    console.log(\"class instance made! \" + String(argument));\n    return this.$init(argument);\n};\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But no console logs get printed but also no errors so it seems no objects of the class are being made.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Though if I implement the following and call checkinstances() when the app is loaded I get several instances.\n </p>\n <pre><code>\nfunction checkinstances() {\n    Java.perform(function () { \n        Java.choose(\"com.Aclass\", {\n            onMatch: function (instance) {\n               console.log(\"Found instance: \" + instance);\n            },\n            onComplete: function () { }\n        });\n    });\n}\n\n// exporting the function to python so we can call it whenever we want...\nrpc.exports = {\n    checkinstances: checkinstances,\n};\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  How is this possible?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maybe relevant: I think the app initiates some object by using java reflection because I see classnames and functionnames in string format as argument for some obfuscated functions. Would this result in a normal constructor hook not working?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
