The 'last error' label shows me this error :\n  <code>\n   00000008 (ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY)\n  </code>\n  . When I run the executable without any debugger I always have enough memory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ollydbg breaks before I can even debug.\nx64dbg breaks while debugging.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With ollydbg I have used the 32bit executable of the program.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The OPc looks like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>00007FF6A179B097 | int3                                    |\n00007FF6A179B098 | sub rsp,48                              |\n00007FF6A179B09C | lea rcx,qword ptr ss:[rsp+20]           |\n00007FF6A179B0A1 | call <executable>.7FF6A0C58980          |\n00007FF6A179B0A6 | lea rdx,qword ptr ds:[7FF6A230CE80]     |\n00007FF6A179B0AD | lea rcx,qword ptr ss:[rsp+20]           |\n00007FF6A179B0B2 | call <executable>.7FF6A17CC4EC          |\n00007FF6A179B0B7 | int3                                    | <-\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But I guess this isn't any help.

You have a few options to deal with it:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Find and disable (NOP / jump-over / etc.) the anti-debugging code.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Try to hide your debugger (manually or by using a stealthing plugin).\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Run your program without a debugger, and then after it's up and running, attach to it with your debugger.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Option #1 requires the most effort, but is guaranteed to work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Option #2 can save time over Option #1, but can involve a lot of trial-and-error.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Option #3 is the easiest option, IMHO, as long as you don't need to debug your target from its entry point. It assumes that the anti-debugging code only executes at the very beginning of the program, which is typically a safe assumption.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
