For instance, this sequence could involve UI events and actions using the MS Windows UI Automation accessibility framework. I was also interested in an answer along the lines of using a zero-day like you pointed out. Thanks\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Therefore I'd keep my answer short.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This\n  <em>\n   should\n  </em>\n  not be possible. Simply as malware would abuse this, what you could do if you want this is find a 0day in kernel space and get SYSTEM privileges. Back in 2010 there was someone from China who has posted a method on the code project(if I recall correctly). It's now hosted on the exploit-db..\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://www.exploit-db.com/bypassing-uac-with-user-privilege-under-windows-vista7-mirror/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://www.exploit-db.com/bypassing-uac-with-user-privilege-under-windows-vista7-mirror/\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Goodluck on your research.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
