Also they don't seem to be addresses in the text segment. I'd like to be able to view the addresses at which the system calls are made.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Why does this happen? The code for the strace pintool can be found\n  <a href=\"https://svn.mcs.anl.gov/repos/performance/Gwalp/gwalpsite/pin/source/tools/ManualExamples/strace.cpp\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  [EDIT]\nChecking in gdb I understand that this happens because the call goes via a common \"int 0x80\" instruction. As a result, multiple system calls seem to be made from the same address. Hence, it seems like I'd have to read the 4 bytes from the top of the stack to find out which instruction is trying to make the system call. Are there any better ways to do this?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This is done so that the application binary does not need to know anything about the host CPU, and what mechanism is best or fastest for the CPU.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This can be seen from within GDB or via\n  <code>\n   ldd\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <pre><code>ldd /bin/bash\n    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fff07fc3000)\n    libtinfo.so.5 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5 (0x00007f65e336e000)\n    libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f65e316a000)\n    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f65e2da3000)\n    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f65e35b6000)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  You can easily dump out the instruction being executed with Pin via printing the return value of\n  <code>\n   INS_Disassemble\n  </code>\n  .

This will be a few bytes\n  <em>\n   after\n  </em>\n  the\n  <code>\n   call\n  </code>\n  instruction.  Additionally, you'd have to whitelist the explicit address which is in the\n  <code>\n   vdso\n  </code>\n  , as not all\n  <code>\n   int 0x80\n  </code>\n  instructions will be immediately after a call.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
