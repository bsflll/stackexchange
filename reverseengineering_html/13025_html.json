    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have been sorting through disassembled code for a couple of days and I have a few questions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note: This is my first reverse engineering side project and I apologize if these are rather newbie questions...\n </p>\n <p>\n  1) I wrote a simple program that blinks an LED on a STM32F4 board (this is not the board I am rev eng), compiled the code, and looked at the hex file in IDA. When in hex view, I saw some clear text like so:\n </p>\n <pre><code>..Q..<...8pG../s\nystem/src/stm32f\n4-hal/stm32f4xx_\nhal_cortex.c....\n../system/src/st\nm32f4-hal/stm32f\n4xx_hal_gpio.c..\n................\n../system/src/st\nm32f4-hal/stm32f\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  When I look at my disassembled binary from the STM32L151 board in IDA's hex view, I do not seen any trace of readable characters. Does this mean the firmware was obfuscated (the programmed board sells for $60 so I wouldn't be surprised if it is)?\n </p>\n <p>\n  2) IDA cannot recognize an entry point, so I am sifting though the disassembled file looking for anything interesting (like functions). I have programmed in assembly before, but\n  <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/Mee1r5RP\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   the first line of the firmware\n  </a>\n  does not make any sense to me. It consists of consecutive STR operations... what is it storing? It pretty much did the same operation 50 times!? Additionally, it has the EQ condition but I don't see what it's comparing. The starting code that I linked is not unique to the board, the STM32F4 hex file started in a similar fashion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  3) When I am looking over the disassembled firmware in \"IDA View-A\", I am hitting the down arrow follow by the \"C\" key to see the assembly code but some of the code stays as a DCB operation. Why is that? Example\n  <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/7uM9P4WL\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  4) Are there any guides dedicated to finding an entry point? I am getting overwhelmed by the sheer amount of assembly code.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If its value is zero, then\n the ARM mode is used, otherwise the THUMB mode is used.\n You can change the value of the register T using\n the 'change segment register value' command\n (the canonical hotkey is Alt-G)\n\n---------------------------\nOK   \n---------------------------\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  In your case the whole file is Thumb, so you can just set T to 1 at the top. Then you need to follow the second dword (the reset vector) to find the initial entrypoint.

If I leave it as is and click okay, it disassembles into Intel syntax. If I choose \"ARM Little-endian\" as the processor type, I get the \"ARM AND THUMB MODE...\" prompt that you wrote above and it disassembles into ARM assembly which is what we want.
