    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  IDA Pro allows plugins to receive notifications for a number of events. These are defined in the\n  <code>\n   hook_type_t\n  </code>\n  enumeration inside\n  <code>\n   loader.hpp\n  </code>\n  in the SDK from what I saw. If I subscribe to\n  <code>\n   HT_IDB\n  </code>\n  events, I have a host of options for notifications I can subscribe to (\n  <code>\n   event_code_t\n  </code>\n  in\n  <code>\n   idp.hpp\n  </code>\n  ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, if I wanted to patch up\n  <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/collabreate/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   collabREate\n  </a>\n  by Chris Eagle to support anterior and posterior comments - how would I go about that?\n </p>\n <p>\n  colleabREate is a very useful piece of software, but in real collaboration scenarios these issues turn out to be real shortcomings.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   In short: how can I receive notifications to events in my plugin which Hex-Rays doesn't make available through the SDK as of yet?\n  </strong>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

As far as I know, this is impossible to do within the SDK.  It is simply the case that some events do not trigger notifications and hence can not be responded to.  This is not the fault of collabREate, but rather, a built-in limitation of IDA.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
