    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  When I load most windows NE/PE executables, IDA first warns me about the file being possibly packed, then it warns me with this dialog: \"\n  <em>\n   The input file has extra information at the end (tail < hex >, loaded < hex >), continue?\n  </em>\n  \". It loads the file, but only shows the \"\n  <em>\n   This program cannot be run in DOS mode.\n  </em>\n  \" DOS stub and that's it. No import/export tables, structs, etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How can I force IDA to recognize the PE header and load that instead of the DOS stub?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
