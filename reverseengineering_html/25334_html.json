The\n  <code>\n   method_4\n  </code>\n  has a type of\n  <code>\n   data_struct *(__thiscall *method_4)(void *not_sure, data_struct *data_struct, int a3)\n  </code>\n  . It looks like this:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n7zDr.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n7zDr.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way to actually click on\n  <code>\n   method_4\n  </code>\n  here and go to the pointer in the vftable/the underlaying\n  <code>\n   sub_<something>\n  </code>\n  ? I seem to be stuck just having to go back to the vftable manually when I want to see what that function does.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It feels like I need to somehow link the instance of\n  <code>\n   some_object\n  </code>\n  or rather its\n  <code>\n   _vftable\n  </code>\n  to the actual vftable memory location but not sure if that's a thing? Do I want too much? :)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
