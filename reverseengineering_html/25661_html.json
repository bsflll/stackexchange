I suppose both reverse engineers and lawyers alike have too much to do to dabble in the other domain. It'd be like winning the lottery for some lawyer to dabble in RCE\n <i>\n  and\n </i>\n be literate in law\n <i>\n  and\n </i>\n be literate in law of the jurisdiction you're asking about\n <i>\n  and\n </i>\n hang out here. That said: to my knowledge you have a lot of leeway when it comes to RCE and interop within the EU. However, interop precludes creation of a functional clone of your target. In any case you should consult a lawyer for your specific jurisdiction ðŸ˜‰\n</span>\n</body></html>",

These were reverse-engineered (\n <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  clean room RCE\n </a>\n , though) and there is evidently no issue that LibreOffice, OpenOffice and other programs providing the ability to read/write those formats are FLOSS.
