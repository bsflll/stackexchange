    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am researching an embedded device which runs QNX. I can login via telnet as a user but don't have the root password (in parallel I am running oclHashCat with the hash from the shadow file but it takes a lot of time).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can get access via GDB and can execute commands in root context so I was thinking that\n  <code>\n   netcat\n  </code>\n  would be an easy way to get a root shell (\n  <code>\n   shell\n  </code>\n  command in GDB doesn't appear to work).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I found netcat binaries from netbsd for armle but when I try to run it I get the error\n  <code>\n   can't access shared library\n  </code>\n  . Not sure what it's missing but my guess is glibc (searching for .so with hex editor shows libc.so libdl.so).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Am I correct that it's looking for\n  <code>\n   libc.so\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   libdl.so\n  </code>\n  ? Where to find these for QNX armle?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
