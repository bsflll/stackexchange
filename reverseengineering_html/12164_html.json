I downloaded it on Windows 10, launch it as administrator, and the GUI opens for about half a second and then it exits, no errors or messages. I have python installed, I reinstalled immunity multiple times, and I tried running it in Windows 7 compatibility mode. Nothing seems to work. My theory is that some dll is missing or changed. Any ideas or is it just my computer? Also, Ollydbg does work on 10, but I find Immunity debugger more useful.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The problem is with the environment variables regarding your Python installation. I am using Python 2.7.11 which is the currently latest release for the 2.x series.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, to make Immunity Debugger work on Windows 10 modify(and ADD if necessary) the following environment variables(assuming Python is installed at\n  <code>\n   C:\\Python27\n  </code>\n  ):\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    PATH=\"C:\\python27;%PATH%\"\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    PYTHONHOME=\"C:\\python27\"\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    PYTHONPATH=\"C:\\Python27\\DLLs;C:\\Python27\\Lib;C:\\Python27\\Lib\\site-packages\"\n   </code>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  The following changes made it work for me.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
