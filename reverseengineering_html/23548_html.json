    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to make my first DLL calling game functions\n </p>\n <p>\n  What I need is tracing functions that call\n  <code>\n   WSASend\n  </code>\n  , so it will be easy for me to get all functions address to call them from my DLL.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What I want is to call game functions, so if I can trace when WSASend is called, then return to the function that called it, I will be able to get all functions I need.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My final goal is getting all functions addressess like SendWalk, ChangeLookDir, Attack, Follow, MoveItem, DropItem, etc... all of them are calling WSASend\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is how the game module is calling the\n  <code>\n   WSASend\n  </code>\n  function:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Qtc0G.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Qtc0G.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is what I get from logging calls to WSASend:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VD5VT.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VD5VT.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The problem is that the game is sending packets all time, so if I put a breakpoint in that call it will pause everytime and I won't be able to make anything in game.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After reading the\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsasend\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <code>\n    WSASend\n   </code>\n   documentation\n  </a>\n  , I understand that maybe what I need is the buffer, so I can filter the parameter\n  <code>\n   lpBuffers\n  </code>\n  maybe setting a conditional breakpoint and hopefully the buffer will be the same in that packets that are sent every 1 sec (I'm not sure about what I'm saying)\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm a beginner so if I can improve in any way this question let me know, maybe I'm missing any detail that would help you to help me :)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
