    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I wanted to look at how does the Windows API get the size of a file, so I opened kernel32.dll in a disassembler. I searched for GetFileSizeEx, and it seems to call a stub(?), but the disassembler cannot find the body of that function. Can you shed some light on what am I looking at?\n </p>\n <p>\n  GetFileSizeEx\n </p>\n <pre><code>.text:0000000180024D90 GetFileSizeEx   proc near          \n.text:0000000180024D90                                     \n.text:0000000180024D90                 jmp     cs:GetFileSizeEx_0\n.text:0000000180024D90 GetFileSizeEx   endp\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Navigating to GetFileSizeEx_0 looks like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>.idata:0000000180082078 ; BOOL __stdcall GetFileSizeEx_0(HANDLE hFile, PLARGE_INTEGER lpFileSize)\n.idata:0000000180082078                 extrn GetFileSizeEx_0:qword\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  There is no function body whatsoever. Where can I find the functionality regarding this, or where does it call forward to?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit:\nThe idata section seems to be for imports, but it is still uncreal where does it import the GetFileSizeEx_0 function.\nI have found the library it gets the import from, but the function body is not there.\n </p>\n <pre><code>.rdata:0000000180001A27 GetFileSizeEx   db 'kernel32.GetFileSizeEx',0\n.rdata:0000000180001088 off_180001088   rva GetFileSizeEx\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  What is this RVA part of the rdata section?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I found the actual function body in KernelBase.dll, but I don't understand from the above, how should I have come to this conclusion.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
