But analyzing the disassembly Ghidra sees that only 4 bytes are being set to 0 in this line (for example a 32 bit register is used).\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of the fix you can apply is by correcting the type of\n  <code>\n   local_res8\n  </code>\n  (\n  <kbd>\n   CTRL+L\n  </kbd>\n  ) but it might be the case that the type is ok, and in fact only lower 32-bits are being set..\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
