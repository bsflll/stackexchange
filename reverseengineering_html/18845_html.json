I restart the debugger alot and preserving environment would be very helpful.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I start with\n  <code>\n   r2 -d binary -r myenv.rr2 -i myscript.r2s\n  </code>\n  , create some flags, comments and such and then exit with\n  <code>\n   q\n  </code>\n  .\n  <code>\n   ood\n  </code>\n  usually is not enough (weird errors about fds and such. I quit completely most of the time). But if i try to load my project (\n  <code>\n   Po\n  </code>\n  ) its asks me to restart the session and then i'm in a wrong context/process or something.\n </p>\n <pre><code>[0x7f7d020fb2c0]> Po myproject\nClose current session?
