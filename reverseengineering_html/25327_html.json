If you don't know how to set conditional breakpoints take a look\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/25215/x64dbg-breakpoint-on-write-in-memory-with-specific-value\">\n   here\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The condition you need to set depends if you are debugging 32 (EIP register) or 64 (RIP register) bit program.\nSo for example let's say you don't want to stop at address 0xDEADBEEF for 32 bit program, you can set the break condition to\n  <code>\n   EIP != DEADBEEF\n  </code>\n  . You can add multiple addresses like this:\n  <code>\n   EIP != addy1 && EIP != addy2\n  </code>\n  and so on.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
