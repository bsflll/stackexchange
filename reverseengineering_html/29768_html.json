    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm reverse engineering a binary and I'm confused, because my theoretical knowledge is currently clashing with what's actually happening.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I thought that this instruction writes the value 0xdeadbeef into edx:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov edx, DWORD PTR ds:0xdeadbeef\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And I thought that this instruction dereferences that address 0xdeadbeef and writes whatever DWORD value is stored at that address into edx:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov edx, DWORD PTR ds:[0xdeadbeef]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However, in reality, running this instruction:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov edx, DWORD PTR ds:0x804bdf4\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Results in the value of edx being:\n </p>\n <pre><code>edx = 0xb73fc115\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   0xb73fc115\n  </code>\n  is the value that's stored at the address\n  <code>\n   0x804bdf4\n  </code>\n  :\n </p>\n <pre><code>x 0x804bdf4\n0x804bdf4 <gContents>: 0xb73fc115\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So that means that the address was dereferenced, even though the assembly didn't contain any square brackets. I thought thatsquare brackets signified a dereferencing operation. What have I misunderstood?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm using GDB\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Update: I just tested it on radare2, and it shows the instruction in the format that I would expect\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov edx, dword [obj.gContents]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I also tested it with objdump, and the result was the same as with GDB. I assume it's some sort of syntax I don't currently understand?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
