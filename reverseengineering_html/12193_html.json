    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I use Backblaze to back up my computer. You restore files from your backups by selecting files to restore, which are then packed into large zip files. Of course, it's fairly rare to be able to download a 500GB zip file without a connection interruption, so a sane developer would implement support for the HTTP Range header to allow users to resume downloads.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They have not done so. Instead, they have a boutique download utility that specifies the requested byte ranges by emulating a POSTed HTML form. This utility does all the stuff you'd expect a normal download manager to do, like downloading with multiple connections at a time and resuming partially completed downloads, but due to some dodgy design issues (like opening a fully-fledged process, not a thread, for each 40MB block) it is rather inefficient on fast (>100 Mbps) connections. It also is Windows-exclusive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm trying to write an open source replacement in Node.js that removes some of the suck, but I'm up against a roadblock: one of the fields the utility sends in its POST requests is called \"bzsanity\" and is a 16-bit checksum over the account email address. Unfortunately, I can't figure out what the algorithm is. Maybe I'm just dumb, but I'm hoping you guys can help me out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here are some checksum values:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"2b5f4e585f6b5f4e585f05484446\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">\n    [email protected]\n   </a>\n   : 028a\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"7c28190f083c08190f08521f1311\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">\n    [email protected]\n   </a>\n   : 4152\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"e094859394d2a094859394ce838f8d\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">\n    [email protected]\n   </a>\n   : 3d0f\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   test: 494c\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   aa: acf2\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   ab: aaad\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   ac: 8e4d\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   ad: 0436\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   \"\" (empty string): a93e\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   a: ce7f\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   b: 1a1e\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   c: 1540\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   d: 6c57\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  If you want more test vectors, I can probably deliver. I've tried adding the bytes in an accumulator and a few variants of CRC-16, and those approaches don't work.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
