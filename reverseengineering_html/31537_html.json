    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  As a part of college project, I have to showcase how I can get ios app from jailbroken devices and reverse-engineer it. In the first part of slide, I am showing how we can get the IPA file from jailbroken device, also can decrypt the iOS app (either through clutch2 or ipainstaller). I am showing how attacker can use class-dump-z and enumerate classnames and method names.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am also trying to add a scenario, where I not only get the decrypted app from jailbroken iPhone but also can change few things in it. I am trying to change parameters in Info.plist file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Below are the steps I performed:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <ol>\n   <li>\n    Unzip the decrypted iOS app (.ipa file) into directory named\n    <code>\n     unzipped_app\n    </code>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Go to Payload -> Appname.app -> Info.plist\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Change app name\n   </li>\n  </ol>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Question:\nNow, how do I recompile the\n  <code>\n   unzipped_app\n  </code>\n  directory back to .ipa file?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I came across this question\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2814/disassemble-edit-and-re-assembly-ios-ipa-apps\">\n   Disassemble, edit and re-assembly iOS ipa apps\n  </a>\n  but this is not providing solution to my question.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

For the correct directory structure just see the original IPA file (can be downloaded using old iTunes versions).\n</span>\n</body></html>",
