But, when analyzing a program, you may encounter more than once the same instruction. In order to make it '\n  <em>\n   unique\n  </em>\n  ' in the program (and, thus, understand the role it plays in the program), you have to link it to the address it has in the program.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Somehow, it is very similar to line numbers associated to a program you write in a programming language. The\n  <code>\n   if (test)\n  </code>\n  line 10 is not the same than the\n  <code>\n   if (test)\n  </code>\n  of line 25.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
