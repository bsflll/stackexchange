The link LED suggests that I do have a wired ethernet link.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I want to find out the IP (v4) and subnet that the router responds to.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have tried using a netmask of 0.0.0.0 and pinging the broadcast address but no response has been received from the router.\n </p>\n <p>\n  nmap scanning would probably take a very long time as I don't have any idea what subnet the router is on - it could be 10.x.x.x or 172.x.x.x or 192.168.x.x\n </p>\n <p>\n  Are there any other ways to discover hosts' IP addresses when very little is known about the network topology and the subnet could be anything?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
