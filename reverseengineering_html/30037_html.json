I have a decryption routine that is used to display useful strings. It takes one integer value as a parameter and uses it in the decryption process, I wrote a script to decrypt one string per value.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This routine is called many times. I want to retrieve all integer values passed to this function to decrypt all strings.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How to automate this process using python for example?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
