    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I was able to connect to the chip via SWD/openocd, but I can't figure out what chip it is (says SM9PQ1 2322-52 on chip, googled but cant find anything). I'm hoping to download the firmware after I connect to the chip using the correct config file for openocd. Is there any way I can find out what chip it is? The chip does video compression by the way.\n </p>\n <pre><code>Info : SWD DPIDR 0x2ba01477\n\n> dap info\nAP # 0x0\n        AP ID register 0x24770011\n        Type is MEM-AP AHB3\nMEM-AP BASE 0xe00ff003\n        Valid ROM table present\n        Component base address 0xe00ff000\n        Peripheral ID 0x04000bb4c4\n        Designer is 0x23b, ARM Ltd\n        Part is 0x4c4, Cortex-M4 ROM (ROM Table)\n        Component class is 0x1, ROM table\n        MEMTYPE system memory present on bus\n    ROMTABLE[0x0] = 0xfff0f003\n        Component base address 0xe000e000\n        Peripheral ID 0x04000bb00c\n        Designer is 0x23b, ARM Ltd\n        Part is 0x00c, Cortex-M4 SCS (System Control Space)\n        Component class is 0xe, Generic IP component\n    ROMTABLE[0x4] = 0xfff02003\n        Component base address 0xe0001000\n        Peripheral ID 0x04003bb002\n        Designer is 0x23b, ARM Ltd\n        Part is 0x002, Cortex-M3 DWT (Data Watchpoint and Trace)\n        Component class is 0xe, Generic IP component\n    ROMTABLE[0x8] = 0xfff03003\n        Component base address 0xe0002000\n        Peripheral ID 0x04002bb003\n        Designer is 0x23b, ARM Ltd\n        Part is 0x003, Cortex-M3 FPB (Flash Patch and Breakpoint)\n        Component class is 0xe, Generic IP component\n    ROMTABLE[0xc] = 0xfff01003\n        Component base address 0xe0000000\n        Peripheral ID 0x04003bb001\n        Designer is 0x23b, ARM Ltd\n        Part is 0x001, Cortex-M3 ITM (Instrumentation Trace Module)\n        Component class is 0xe, Generic IP component\n    ROMTABLE[0x10] = 0xfff41003\n        Component base address 0xe0040000\n        Peripheral ID 0x04000bb9a1\n        Designer is 0x23b, ARM Ltd\n        Part is 0x9a1, Cortex-M4 TPIU (Trace Port Interface Unit)\n        Component class is 0x9, CoreSight component\n        Type is 0x11, Trace Sink, Port\n    ROMTABLE[0x14] = 0xfff42002\n        Component not present\n    ROMTABLE[0x18] = 0x00000000\n        End of ROM table\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/C00Ze.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"chip\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/C00Ze.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
