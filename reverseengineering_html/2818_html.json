They vary both according to the processor features (for example, on processors with floating point registers (VFP), it's more efficient to pass floats around in them, but you lose compatibility with processors without VFP) and according to the operating system.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A given installation of an operating system defines one calling convention that all programs must use: the calling convention used by the standard library. Occasionally there may be more than one calling convention on a given system; this requires copies of all libraries for each calling convention.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Android\n  <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html\">\n   NDK\n  </a>\n  comes with a toolchain including a C compiler (a version of GCC). This version of GCC is set up for Android's calling convention. There is a separate toolchain for the kernels (the kernel doesn't need to use the same conventions since there are no direct function calls between userland programs and the kernel).\n </p>\n <p>\n  iOS has several calling conventions for different processor versions. They are described in the\n  <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Xcode/Conceptual/iPhoneOSABIReference/iPhoneOSABIReference.pdf\">\n   iOS ABI function call guide\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
