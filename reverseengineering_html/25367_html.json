    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  In C++ binaries, I find Qt methods like\n  <code>\n   ??4QString@@QEAAAEAV0@AEBV0@@Z\n  </code>\n  which demangle to\n </p>\n <pre><code>public: class QString & __ptr64 __cdecl QString::operator=(class QString const & __ptr64) __ptr64\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  or in shorter form,\n  <code>\n   QString& QString::operator=(QString const&)\n  </code>\n  . The return value does not appear to be used. What is the purpose of this \"unary equals\", given that it does not seem to be a construct people write in the original code?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Edit\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I found the source of my confusion. I'm perfectly award of the calling convention with\n  <code>\n   this\n  </code>\n  , and what\n  <code>\n   operator=\n  </code>\n  is supposed to do. It's common, in my experience, for people to indicate\n  <code>\n   this\n  </code>\n  as a direct argument when reversing software. This is, for instance, what IDA does. It was what I was intending to do as well. So, it\n  <em>\n   would\n  </em>\n  have been considered unary, as I wrote it only take on argument (\n  <code>\n   this\n  </code>\n  ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  It turns out that IDA somehow incorrectly assigned the type, and gave it the signature\n  <code>\n   __int64 __fastcall QString__operator_(_QWORD)\n  </code>\n  instead of\n  <code>\n   QString* __fastcall QString__operator_(QString *, QString const *)\n  </code>\n  . I don't know what caused this. The output from [demangler.com], which I put in the first half of my post, did not include the implicit\n  <code>\n   this\n  </code>\n  , contrary to my expectations.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This is why it's good practice to continue to return the assigned reference from the assignment overload operator.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Because of this behavior, there's a well-used idiom in C (and to C++ by extension) regarding checking the return value of a function upon assignment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, consider an invocation of realloc:\n </p>\n <pre><code>// int *ptr;\n// size_t size;\n\nsize *= 2;\nint *nptr = realloc(ptr, size);\nif (nptr)\n    ptr = nptr;\nelse\n    return ERROR;\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  We can simplify the code by moving assignment expressions inside the if condition. Here, we take advantage of two assignment expressions,\n  <code>\n   size *= 2\n  </code>\n  , which returns the value of the variable after doubling, and the assignment to\n  <code>\n   nptr\n  </code>\n  , which will be\n  <code>\n   NULL\n  </code>\n  (\n  <code>\n   0\n  </code>\n  ) on failure.\n </p>\n <pre><code>// int *ptr;\n// size_t size;\n\nint *nptr;\nif (nptr = realloc(ptr, size *= 2))\n    ptr = nptr;\nelse\n    return ERROR;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
