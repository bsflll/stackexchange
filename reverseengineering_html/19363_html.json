The second one,\n  <code>\n   0x400c60\n  </code>\n  is what is located in that memory location. r2 is giving you hints about the actual result might be in the comments. It also informs you that 8 byte will be used for the operation with the\n  <code>\n   :8\n  </code>\n  suffix.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So it looks like that at address\n  <code>\n   0x602090\n  </code>\n  there's a 8-byte value stored that constitutes as an address\n  <code>\n   0x400c60\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
