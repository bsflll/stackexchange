I think that in Windows operating system the most popular combo for reading files is probably\n  <code>\n   CreateFile\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   ReadFile\n  </code>\n  api calls. If you track every operation performed on the buffer filled using\n  <code>\n   ReadFile\n  </code>\n  call, you can reconstruct the algorithm that is used to make sense of the bytes stored in the file. You can do it using any debugger like\n  <code>\n   x64dbg\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   windbg\n  </code>\n  etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Answer to your case:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sometimes it is worth to check if particular format was already reversed by someone. There is a community around a program called\n  <a href=\"https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   QuickBMS\n  </a>\n  that targets unpacking game files. If you open your\n  <code>\n   fonts.pak\n  </code>\n  using hex editor, you can notice the very first bytes equal to\n  <code>\n   PKTB\n  </code>\n  . If you search for a script that can unpack\n  <code>\n   PKTB\n  </code>\n  files on the website, there is one result for a game called\n  <a href=\"https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/pit_people.bms\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Pit People\n  </a>\n  . The game is created by the same manufacturer as your Alien Hominid Invasion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Quick look on the script:\n  <code>\n   fonts.pak\n  </code>\n  contains 5 files (2 png, 2 bmf(?) and 1 txt). Unfortunately, this quick bms script can't read encrypted filenames (that are probably stored at the very end of\n  <code>\n   fonts.pak\n  </code>\n  , (but you can reverse it by yourself of course) what is funnier the header of the file is xored via key which is scrambled form of string\n  <code>\n   securitythroughobscurity\n  </code>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
