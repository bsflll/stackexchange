Ive figured out tons of stuff already, but I came to the point, where I just need some little explanation whats going on in the constructor of a specific class.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know, that this specific class (Class A) inherits 3 other Classes (lets say: class B, class C, class D).\nClass A calls the constructors of B,C,D. Everything up to here is clear for me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Class D has a method \"addListener\" which points to an attribute (this + 0x34).\n </p>\n <p>\n  (this + 0x34) is assigned in the constructor to a address..\n </p>\n <pre><code>int A::A(void *someObject) {\n    B::B();\n    C::C();\n\n    *this = 0x1f18e8;\n    *(this + 0x28) = 0x1f190c;         // whats going here?\n    *(this + 0x34) = 0x1f193c;         // and here?\n\n    // Ive seen, that those addressees are inside of the vtable of Class A\n    // \n    //     __ZTV12A:        // vtable for A\n    // ...\n    // 001f18e8         db  0xc6\n    // 001f193c         db  0xb0\n    // 001f190c         db  0xba\n    // ...\n\n    D::D();\n\n    // Some other attributes, but these are clear for me (just \n    // have to name them right, by figuring out where these attributes are used):\n\n    *(this + 0x38) = someObject;\n    *(this + 0x3c) = 0x0;\n    *(this + 0x50) = 0x0;\n    *(this + 0x54) = 0x0;\n    *(this + 0x40) = 0xffffffff;\n    *(this + 0x44) = 0xffffffff;\n    *(this + 0x48) = 0xffffffff;\n    *(this + 0x4c) = 0x0;\n\n    D::addListener(this + 0x34);\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Am I right with my conclusion, that D::addListener() adds the class it self to the listener?\n </p>\n <p>\n  In fact I just want to figure out what kind of object is added to the \"listener\":\n </p>\n <pre><code>    D::addListener(this + 0x34);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I hope my question is clear enough :)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Typo?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, you should read about (typical) implementations of multiple inheritance. Assume your classes B, C, D have methods\n  <code>\n   b\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   c\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   d\n  </code>\n  respectively. A will inherit all of them. Now, if A does\n  <em>\n   not\n  </em>\n  override these methods, and anything calls them, they have to be delegated to the correct superclass - the original methods. But these original methods will expect a class layout that corresponds to the original classes. Which means, A needs to \"embed\" all 3 classes into itself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Which means A will be laid out like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>+-----+-------------------+\n|  00 | vtable of A       |\n+-----+-------------------+\n|  04 | member 1 of A     |\n|  08 | member 2 of A     |\n|     | ...               |\n+-----+-------------------+\n|  28 | vtable of B       |\n+-----+-------------------+\n|  2c | member 1 of B     |\n|  30 | member 2 of B     |\n|     | ...               |\n+-----+-------------------+\n|  34 | vtable of C       |\n+-----+-------------------+\n|  38 | member 1 of C     |\n|  3c | member 2 of C     |\n|     | ...               |\n+-----+-------------------+\n|  ?? | vtable of D       |\n+-----+-------------------+\n|  ?? | member 1 of D     |\n|  ?? | member 2 of D     |\n|     | ...               |\n+-----+-------------------+\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So, yes, your conclusion is correct:\n  <code>\n   D::addListener()\n  </code>\n  adds the class itself to the listener. But because\n  <code>\n   D::addListener()\n  </code>\n  expects a\n  <code>\n   D\n  </code>\n  , not an\n  <code>\n   A\n  </code>\n  , the thing that's passed isn't the complete\n  <code>\n   A\n  </code>\n  , it's just the part of\n  <code>\n   A\n  </code>\n  that makes\n  <code>\n   D\n  </code>\n  . To make this look exactly like a\n  <code>\n   D\n  </code>\n  , it needs its own vtable that looks like a\n  <code>\n   D\n  </code>\n  vtable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But of course, parts of these vtables can be shared.\n  <code>\n   A\n  </code>\n  needs all methods in its vtable, so the vtable pointers of the partial classes\n  <code>\n   B\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   C\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   D\n  </code>\n  can point to the appropriate part of the\n  <code>\n   A\n  </code>\n  s vtable, they don't need their complete own copies.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As to your \"what's going on here\" questions - these initialize the vtables of the partial classes. (In your assembly listing, you should treat those addresses as arrays of words, not bytes). What i wonder is why there's only 3 of them, there should be 4 for\n  <code>\n   A\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   B\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   C\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   D\n  </code>\n  . Something seems to be confused or omitted here, just like you said \"Class C has\" first, then used\n  <code>\n   D::addListener\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Unless one of your classes is really a struct, not a class, that has no methods, not even a constructor.
