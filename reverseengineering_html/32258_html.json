I have also studied the ipa extraction process for a jailbroken iphone, but given that my I am on an A14 chip iphone 12 pro max running ios 16.0.3, it is almost impossible to downgrade to ios 15 for a jailbreak, and a PPL bypass has not been discovered yet for A12+ ios 16+ iphones. Due to these unfortunate limitations, I am trying to set up a proper debugging environment in a non-jailbroken iphone if possible using this approach:\n  <a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/05/fuzzing-ios-code-on-macos-at-native.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/05/fuzzing-ios-code-on-macos-at-native.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The question is whether a jailbroken iphone is necessary to extract the ipa file of a pre-installed app, such as imessage. The ultimate goal is to extract the compiled ios binary executable from the corresponding ipa->app bundle to run it as a macos process for debugging.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
