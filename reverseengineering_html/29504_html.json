Say you have two binaries with different versions. First, you need to analyze those binaries and save the analysis results (you can manually patch binary before or during this stage). Then click on version tracking symbol and create new version tracking session. Here, you can track and apply changes over from source to destination binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qLA9o.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qLA9o.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Please check their documentation in the help section, as shown in the image.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JyYIW.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JyYIW.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Please also checkout the complete video tutorial\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83T7iVla5s\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
