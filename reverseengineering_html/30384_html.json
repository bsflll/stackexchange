    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm currently practicing with WinDBG by playing around with a notepad trace. During recording the trace I have opened notepad, typed in \"AAAABBBB\" waited a few secs and then stopped the recording.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now I'm trying to find this string or byte pattern x41 x41 x41 x41 x42 ... in the memory trace.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does anyone know if this it is possible to search the whole trace (instead current memory image)? I looked at the commands using dx @$curprocess.TTD  but there wasn't something useful, so maybe I can modify a query like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>dx @$curprocess.TTD.Events.Where(t => t.Type == \"ModuleLoaded\").Where(t => t.Module.Name.Contains(\"bcrypt\"))\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But there aren't any helpful commands at first sight. So in the end I would like to search for pattern which appears at any time in the memory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I would be grateful for any suggestions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
