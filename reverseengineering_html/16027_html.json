Is it be possible, with the help of a software or something like that, to change what IP an executable uses to access the Internet? Without the need to change/mask all my system's IP at once. The solution should be able to change a single executable IP, maybe a pack of executables would also work for me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have an executable that sends information to a host, and I need to open 2 or more instances of that executable and need they to reach the host with different IPs.\n </p>\n <pre><code>My IP -> qqq.qqq.qqq\nExecutable 1 -> xxx.xxx.xxx\nExecutable 2 -> yyy.yyy.yyy\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Where Executable 1 and 2 can use proxy, IP that change all the time, doesn't matter -- they just need to reach the host with different IPs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Possible easy solution I read once:\n  </strong>\n  \n\n  Create a virtual machine and use a proxy software  on it, programs from my main computer would use my IP, programs from virtual machine would use proxy software IP\n </p>\n <p>\n  But if i could avoid this solution, would be nicer.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
