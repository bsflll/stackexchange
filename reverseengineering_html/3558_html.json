The 128-bit key to the container can be found in /data/misc/systemkeys but this file requires root access for reading. You can read exactly how the encryption works\n  <a href=\"http://nelenkov.blogspot.com.br/2012/07/using-app-encryption-in-jelly-bean.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  . Moving on, the mounted volume will contain an unencrypted apk of the application. In order to change the desired data, it's necessary to understand where the data is stored and how it is done. For that, the application will have to be reverse-engineered by either decompilation -\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/42/decompiling-android-application/46#46\">\n   list of tools\n  </a>\n  - or by disassembly to smali and posterior debugging using tools such as\n  <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/android-apktool/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   apktool\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/androguard/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   androguard\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sometimes, these steps can be bypassed as the app uses a database file in it's directory (usually /data/data//) that you can edit with any SQLite editor, such as\n  <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=oliver.ehrenmueller.dbadmin\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   SQLite Debugger\n  </a>\n  or using the sqlite3 set included by default in Android, or keeps the relevant information in memory in a way that is trivial to change it with a memory editor such as\n  <a href=\"http://gameguardian.net/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   GameGuardian\n  </a>\n  . However, the data can be stored server-side and transmitted through the network when app is started and then kept in memory in a not easily modifiable way so that in order to be able to change it, you will need to not only reverse-engineer the application but also to intercept and modify the traffic it receives in order to transmit the new information to the application.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I am sure that this the only file is changing all the time i have taken backup 2 times like when i wans haveing 10 money and 8 money file so how i can compare this 2 files to findout changing factor to modifiy it?
