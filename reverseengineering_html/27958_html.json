You can then auto analyse it (or run only the DWARF debug analyses), and export a GDT archive via \"Capture Function Signatures\", either as a file archive or project archive, and then load this in your desired binary and apply it.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Ghidra searches some folders for libraries when a binary is imported, I already described the details in\n    <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/27871/31435\">\n     this answer\n    </a>\n    (with screenshots)\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
