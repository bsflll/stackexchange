This variable is located on the stack where you would expect it, at\n  <code>\n   ebp-4\n  </code>\n  . IDA is getting confused because this particular function, instead of pushing variables onto the stack before calling a function, is moving them instead.

Every function needs to clean up its own local variable area.

When you write\n  <code>\n   scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n  </code>\n  , GCC knows that it will need to pass two 4-byte variables to that function on the stack, so it pre-emptively reserves enough room for them upon entering the function. This way, it doesn't need to\n  <code>\n   push\n  </code>\n  anything onto the stack (which might be problematic if there's no stack space left...), it just needs to\n  <code>\n   mov\n  </code>\n  the arguments into that preallocated space.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That doesn't explain why there's a gap between the two allocations, though.
