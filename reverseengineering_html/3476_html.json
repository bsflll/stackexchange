    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  According to my knowledge, several obfuscation strategies are widely used(or at least described in academic) like:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    complicating control flow\n   </p>\n   <ol>\n    <li>\n     inserting bogus control-flow\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     control-flow flattening\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     jump through branch functions\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     opaque values from array aliasing\n    </li>\n   </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Opaque Predicates\n   </p>\n   <ol>\n    <li>\n     opaque predicates from pointer aliasing\n    </li>\n   </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    dynamic obfuscation\n   </p>\n   <ol>\n    <li>\n     self-modifying state machine\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     code as key material\n    </li>\n   </ol>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  From the examples they give when introducing these obfuscation ways, multi-thread program has not been talked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I am wondering whether these strategies are feasible(or even feasible, but not very practical) in multi-thread programs?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
