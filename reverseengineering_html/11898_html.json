So it's obviously some WOW64 code).\n </p>\n <p>\n  The question is, where did the code in\n  <code>\n   (*)\n  </code>\n  came from? Who's responsible for it? Why isn't it mapped to any module?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It might be a form of obfuscation, or if the file was packed, then the unpacker code might be in that page.  If you're able to step into the code, then it can't be\n  <code>\n   PAGE_NOACCESS\n  </code>\n  , so perhaps the debugger is confused.  The call through\n  <code>\n   fs[0c0h]\n  </code>\n  is the interface for 32-bit code to call kernel code in a 64-bit environment.  Depending on the version of Windows, there is either a far jump at that location (pre-Win10), or some stack manipulation followed by a\n  <code>\n   retf\n  </code>\n  (Win10).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
