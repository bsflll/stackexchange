I have tried using TrID but no result from it. I have also tried using software like WinRAR, 7-zip etc, which cannot recognise the file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I do not think this is a known file extension since I have never seen it anywhere before, and the internet has no idea what it is when I try to search about it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd also love to ideally create an extraction tool so I can extract content from other file types ending in this .xbd format.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I will really appreciate any help given, thank you :)\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiEcsvCdfJY5g-557PGxRmGtbWKpfw?e=RdfW0D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   .xbd file download (OneDrive)\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This is in 'assets_p.dat' which is where the game files are. This is the link to the assets [link] (\n <a href=\"https://mega.nz/file/WVpHBK7K#XWjSZwxqdL4EdjXftVt91r96dad7JSXz97qsLr3N1cY\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  mega.nz/file/â€¦\n </a>\n ) The xbd file is located in audio.
