    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I know it is a very newbie question and sorry about that, but I can't really find any way how to make IDA analyze the code after the unpacking was done. What I mean is that when I unpack an exe and dump it to a new exe file (using another software, not IDA), and then load the unpacked exe in IDA, everything works fine (all the API calls are recognized etc). But when I load the unpacked exe in IDA and put a bp on OEP, I just finish with \"unscanned\" code and don't know how to ask IDA to scan it and recognize the API calls. Thank you in advance for any help and tips.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It's quite annoying, OllyDbg doesn't have any problems to comment the code after reaching the OEP, so why couldn't Ida automatically do this? Btw. I don't need any unpacking support/plugins, just would like to make Ida reanalyzing the code..</span>",
