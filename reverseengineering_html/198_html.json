However until that point I only was aware of\n  <a href=\"http://upx.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   plain UPX\n  </a>\n  . So my question is:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   What versions/modifications of UPX exist?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   How do they differ? What features do they have?\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It's not very effective at counteracting reverse engineering.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

For example, an ELF \n - can be decompressed directly into memory\n - can be decompressed into /tmp and executed from there\n </p>\n <p>\n  By default the first option is preferred, but I don't think it's mandatory.
