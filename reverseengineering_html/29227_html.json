    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  While looking at\n  <em>\n   that\n  </em>\n  old game I've found a class\n  <code>\n   CStr\n  </code>\n  that is used in an unusual (to me) manner. Most of the times a member of\n  <code>\n   CStr\n  </code>\n  is used, it's done as follows. In both cases,\n  <code>\n   this\n  </code>\n  is a\n  <code>\n   CStr *\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Decompilation:\n </p>\n <pre><code>pcVar6 = *(char **)(*(int *)(this + 4) + 8);\n// pcVar6 is then used\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Disassembly\n </p>\n <pre><code>// since the func is a __thiscall, ECX contains \"this\"\nMOV  ESI ,ECX\nMOV  EAX ,dword ptr [ESI  + 0x4]\nMOV  EDI ,dword ptr [EAX  + 0x8]\n// EDI is then used\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This strikes me as odd. If one of the members of\n  <code>\n   CStr\n  </code>\n  is a char array, why isn't it just a single offset? I'm thinking that this has something to do with inheritance, but I'm lacking experience with that to be certain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For context, this particular member seems to be a C string. The code comes from a Win32 DLL.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How do I interpret this correctly? And how do I tell Ghidra how to interpret this?\n </p>\n <h2>\n  EDIT: More examples\n </h2>\n <p>\n  I put a lot more here at first, but deleted everything that isn't a case where the CStr object itself is used. It's just a lot more of the line already posted and I doubt that it'll clear anything up. Also, I'm yet to make significat progress in determining what the fields of the objects are, sadly :(\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Example of CStr being used in constructor.\n  <code>\n   this\n  </code>\n  is a CMachineController here.\n </p>\n <pre><code>// CMachineController::CMachineController\nCStr::CStr((CStr *)&this->field_0x4); // could be labeled as \"cstring\"?\n</code></pre>\n <hr/>\n Part of a longer function. It seems to acquire an instance by reading a config object, then does some manipulation and destroys the CStr.    \n  \nVar types as follows:\n - bool bVar3;\n - CConfig* pcVar8;\n - CStr aCStack20[8];\n - undefined4 local4; (a 4-byte-wide number of some kind)\n - stack0xff... is created by (`MOV this, ESP / MOV dword ptr [ESP+0x3c], ESP`)\n - CMachineController* this;\n <pre><code>// CMachineController::Init()\n...\nbVar3 = CConfig::HasValue(pCVar8,s_AutoStart_10056dc4);\nif (bVar3 != false) {\n  CConfig::GetValue(this->config,(char *)aCStack20);\n  CStr::CStr((CStr *)&stack0xffffffd0,aCStack20);\n  (**(code **)(**(int **)&this->field_0x18 + 0x14))();\n  CStr::~CStr(aCStack20);\n}\n...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Without any more info on what would be considered useful, this is the best I can think of atm.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This should be how it looks like from the data I can see.\n </p>\n <pre><code>class CStr {\n    int placeholder[2]; // unknown 0x8 bytes\n    char* somestring;\n}\nclass some1 {\n   int placeholder; // unknown 0x4 bytes\n   CStr* cstr;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   char* ptr = &(some1->cstr->somestring)\n  </code>\n  would result in the pseudocode you see generated\n </p>\n <pre><code>*(char **)(*(int *)(this + 4) + 8);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  EDIT : update after OP posted new pseudocode\nI should say first that I don't actually use Ghidra, so I am not very familiar with its pseudocode syntax and reliability(in how accurately it translated the asm code to pseudocode). I would suggest that you dont always trust what you see in the pseudocode, because it won't always be accurate, especially when it comes to the handling of registers and stack (frames).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's my take based on the information you gave. Not sure how helpful it is to what your finding exactly, but i'll just write my analysis based on what I see.\n </p>\n <pre><code>CStr::CStr((CStr *)&this->field_0x4); // could be labeled as \"cstring\"?\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  If Ghirda accurately converted the type, then yes you can just take\n  <code>\n   field_0x4\n  </code>\n  to be\n  <code>\n   CStr\n  </code>\n  . Its hard to say that based on just one line of code though, so lets look further.\n </p>\n <pre><code>// CMachineController::Init()\n...\nbVar3 = CConfig::HasValue(pCVar8,s_AutoStart_10056dc4);\nif (bVar3 != false) {\n  CConfig::GetValue(this->config,(char *)aCStack20);\n  CStr::CStr((CStr *)&stack0xffffffd0,aCStack20);\n  (**(code **)(**(int **)&this->field_0x18 + 0x14))();\n  CStr::~CStr(aCStack20);\n}\n...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This line is retrieving some sort of config value ? or config string, before storing it into\n  <code>\n   aCStack20\n  </code>\n </p>\n <pre><code>CConfig::GetValue(this->config,(char *)aCStack20);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Take a look at the code below.\n </p>\n <pre><code>  CStr::CStr((CStr *)&stack0xffffffd0,aCStack20);\n  (**(code **)(**(int **)&this->field_0x18 + 0x14))();\n  CStr::~CStr(aCStack20);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Notice how the function call doesn't have any parameters? Although the line before seems to manipulate/create a CStr instance and destroys it right after?\n </p>\n <pre><code> (**(code **)(**(int **)&this->field_0x18 + 0x14))();\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  If a data is manipulated, it is meant to be used. Otherwise, there is no need to manipulate the data. Hence, it is likely that\n </p>\n <pre><code>  CStr::CStr((CStr *)&stack0xffffffd0,aCStack20);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Is copying\n  <code>\n   aCStack20\n  </code>\n  into\n  <code>\n   stack0xffffffd0\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Currently we see that there are to ways to initialize a\n  <code>\n   CStr\n  </code>\n  class\n </p>\n <pre><code>CStr::CStr((CStr *)&this->field_0x4); // CStr(CStr* callervar) - perhaps initialize with some default values? \nCStr::Cstr((CStr *)&stack0xffffffd0,aCStack20); // CStr(CStr* copyto, CStr* copyfrom) - initialize copyto with copyfrom ?\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  When you said\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   make significat progress in determining what the fields of the\nobjects are, sadly :(\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Are you referring to the\n  <code>\n   CStr\n  </code>\n  class? Or\n  <code>\n   &this->field_0xOFFSET\n  </code>\n  ? At this point we still do not actually know what the\n  <code>\n   int placeholder[2] // unknown 0x8 bytes\n  </code>\n  is. But my guess is probably data relating to the string, e.g size of string, type of string, what the string is used for / what does it represent and so on.\nIt may just be easier to debug the program and see what values are at the first 8 bytes of the\n  <code>\n   CStr\n  </code>\n  instance.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
