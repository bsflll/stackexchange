I will give u some things that i think it has: -First, debug protection obviously, also, -it detects what program are we using or something like that and closes the program, i tried dnspy and Olly and it kills those processes. -It wont work if trying to deobfuscate with de4dot - [link]\n <a href=\"https://www.mediafire.com/file/1e0ua9jt3ajpju9/UnpackMe.exe/file\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  mediafire.com/file/1e0ua9jt3ajpju9/UnpackMe.exe/file\n </a>\n - Please lmk if u find out the way to patch it.

For ScyllaHide, grab the latest from the releases and follow the instructions in the ScyllaHide.pdf document.  Then you can try the various techniques simply through a set of checkboxes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Generally, if you suspect that a particular anti-analysis technique is being used but your mitigation technique is not working, then you should check for that anti-analysis technique manually.  To do this with IsDebuggerPresent, or any other API call, go to the function (in Ollydbg, ctrl-g and enter \"IsDebuggerPresent\" without the quotes) and set a breakpoint (F2 for software BP, or right-click -> breakpoint -> hardware) on the first instruction or any instruction before the first branch (e.g. jmp, conditional jump, call).  Sometimes the program will check for a change to certain APIs or skip over the first few instructions.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I've already installed ScyllaHide and i tried it on x64dbg and i did too in Olly, the program anyways will end up closing, i've tried different profiles from scylla, i've patched IsDebuggerPresent too but that's not enough, the program will still close. Looks like there are lots of protections on the file. If you want i can give you the .exe so u check it out.</span>",
