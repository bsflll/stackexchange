This func changes of address at every updates of the app I am working on. So this string is the only \"stable\" point I can rely on to access to func.\n </p>\n <pre><code>                     aOpensslCertVer:\n00000000047fef1d         db         \"openssl cert verify error: \", 0            ; DATA XREF=sub_342df4+412\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So I'd like to obtain the XREF pointer with a Frida script, how can I do that ? Is it even possible to do ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I found out\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/4276/ida-xrefs-from-how-to\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  that it seems you can do it with IDA in python, but I use something else than IDA, and I'd like to do it dynamically from Frida JS.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How can I do it ? Is it even possible to do ? Thanks !\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You can first analyze the binary offline in IDA/Ghidra, extract the xref and send this data to Frida for a dynamic analysis (e.g. write the value into a Frida script before loading it).\n</span>\n</body></html>",
