I guess when we click the arrow button it'll compare the value again with 3, am i right?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So, if the address, where this counter is located at stays permanent for lifetime of the game, you can use a memory breakpoint to find these other occurences. You can verify, that the address is semi-permanent by writing the address down, playing a round and comparing it.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
