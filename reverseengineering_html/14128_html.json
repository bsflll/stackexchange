    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am analyzing a sequence of\n  <code>\n   x86\n  </code>\n  instructions, and become confused with the following code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>135328495: sbb edx, edx\n135328497: neg edx\n135328499: test edx, edx\n135328503: jz 0x810f31c\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I understand that\n  <code>\n   sbb\n  </code>\n  equals to\n  <code>\n   des = des - (src + CF)\n  </code>\n  , in other words, the first instruction somehow put\n  <code>\n   -CF\n  </code>\n  into\n  <code>\n   edx\n  </code>\n  . Then it\n  <code>\n   negtive\n  </code>\n  <code>\n   -CF\n  </code>\n  into\n  <code>\n   CF\n  </code>\n  , and\n  <code>\n   test\n  </code>\n  whether\n  <code>\n   CF\n  </code>\n  equals to zero??\n </p>\n <p>\n  But note that\n  <code>\n   jz\n  </code>\n  checks flag\n  <code>\n   ZF\n  </code>\n  , not\n  <code>\n   CF\n  </code>\n  ! So basically what is the above code sequence trying to do? This is a legal\n  <code>\n   x86\n  </code>\n  instruction sequence, produced by\n  <code>\n   g++\n  </code>\n  version\n  <code>\n   4.6.3\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The following neg edx simply reflects the value of the initial carry flag. Thus the jz in your sequence is nothing else than a jnc statement (jmp on non-carry).\nHowever, this sequence might be found with an additional, preceding neg eax. The neg statement clears the carry in the zero case, otherwise sets it. This sequence might be used as a test for true or false, depending whether edx has some arbitrary nonzero value (true) or zero value (false). The sequence with the additional neg would then look like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>neg edx          ; clears the carry flag in the zero case, otherwise sets it\nsbb edx, edx     ; if (cf == 0) then edx == 0, else edx == -1\nneg edx          ; remains zero if initially edx has been zero, else 1\ntest edx, edx    ;\njz toSomewhere   ; jmp on edx having been zero initially\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  btw, this is one of the questions I am planning for a reversing quiz.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Have fun!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The <code>C++</code> code is actually from the <a href=\"https://botan.randombit.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">botan</a> project. I will try to find the corresponding source code for this instruction sequence and provide to you later. At the mean while, you can find the overall assembly code (the Botan RSA decryption example) at <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/yy1d388x7ox9az3/botan_rsa_dec.dis?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. There are quite a lot of such instruction sequence in the disassembled code.</span>",
