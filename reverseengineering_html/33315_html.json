I also have a MAP file in which the addressing of program memory and data is painted, this file indicates the offset from the beginning for each variable and label, as I understand it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The question is, how to find the placement of program memory and data memory blocks in the firmware image, how to determine the beginning of these blocks? Are there any methods or signatures to identify these parts of firmware?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
