In the debugger I can of course see all the function calls, but in IDA all I have are calls to immediate addresses that don't exist.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd like to be able to dump the referenced section and somehow bluntly attach it to the same .idb so IDA would be able to resolve the references for me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I couldn't find anything about it on google or when digging around the menus.\nDid I miss something or is this impossible or requires an addon? It's also possible for me to write an idapython script that defines and copies the section over, but I don't see any relevant API calls.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Debugging via IDA and taking a full memory snapshot is a solution I'd like to not have to use; I enjoy using olly.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
