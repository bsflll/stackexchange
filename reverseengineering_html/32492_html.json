The emulated (ARM) process also has a stack, the stack keeps the return address, and if you overflow the buffer and overrun the return address - the process will jump to that modified address address (2) It worked for a 32-bit ARM binary with QEMU emulation on an Intel CPU (3)\n <code>\n  -fPIE -pie\n </code>\n did not help\n</span>\n</body></html>",

I presume it's the 0x55000008e0 entry in your second screenshot. This means that you won't be able to overwrite the return address via the buffer overflow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  See\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68774522/arm64-buffer-overflow-cannot-overwrite-pc\">\n   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68774522/arm64-buffer-overflow-cannot-overwrite-pc\n  </a>\n  for a more detailed explanation.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
