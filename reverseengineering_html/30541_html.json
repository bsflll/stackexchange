    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm editing an exe which has a function that is used in multiple places with completely different meanings for the return type (a getter that wasn't inlined). I had assigned it a return type to make it easier to reverse a function, but I'm now having a problem where this type was propagated to ALL calls to the function (so a lot of places have now inferred the wrong type) it's quite tedious fixing it manually as the function has thousands of xrefs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there any way to remove a type and all references to it in the database?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
