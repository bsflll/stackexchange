I believe the root folder structure should be similar, if not the same as the other firmware dump I CAN open.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is this a case of non-standard compression? How should I go about opening up these file systems?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can upload the firmware, but they are 128MB each so kind of large files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's a beyond compare between the two.

If so, they could be the spare or OOB(out of band) bytes which are present in most NAND chips for error checking or housekeeping (bad block management etc.) in most cases you can discard them and analyze just the “useful” data.
