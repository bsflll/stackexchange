How much do certifications help me in for my resume and which one(s) should I get? Will experience ultimately be better than a cert? And finally, when should I get certified? I'm currently a sophomore studying information assurance, should I wait until I graduate to get certified?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sorry for the abundance of questions, and thanks for helping.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Get malware, reverse engineer it yourself and publish your results in your blog. This is, certainly, going to help more than any certification on earth. Indeed, some people may take a bad impression of your resume if it makes emphasis in certifications and I know tech-people, not recruiters, that will not even bother to read your resume if you put certifications on it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
