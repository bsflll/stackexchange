As a result, the\n  <code>\n   .dynsym\n  </code>\n  <em>\n   section\n  </em>\n  is mapped to a loadable\n  <em>\n   segment\n  </em>\n  (specifically, the\n  <code>\n   text\n  </code>\n  segment) and therefore included in the runtime process image in virtual memory when the kernel loads the program segments. As a reflection of this, the Sys V ABI actually requires the\n  <em>\n   dynamic linking array\n  </em>\n  to contain a dynamic symbol hash table, a string table for symbols and library names, and the dynamic symbol table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the other hand, the\n  <code>\n   .symtab\n  </code>\n  section is not needed for process creation, is not mapped to a loadable segment and therefore is not loaded into memory when the program is executed, and so can be removed, along with section information.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Dynamic linking and its requirements are discussed in much greater detail in the following articles:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <a href=\"http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/somewhat.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n     A Whirlwind Tutorial on Creating Somewhat Teensy ELF Executables for Linux (or, \"Okay Maybe Size Isn't Quite Everything\")\n    </a>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Here the author set about creating the smallest possible dynamically-linked ELF binary, which contains only that which is required for the program to successfully  load and execute.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <a href=\"https://grugq.github.io/docs/subversiveld.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n     Cheating the ELF\n    </a>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The process of dynamic linking and its requirements are discussed in order to explain how it is possible for code inserted into a code cave to make calls to library functions.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <a href=\"http://michalmalik.github.io/elf-dynamic-segment-struggles\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n     ELF: dynamic struggles\n    </a>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Process creation via cooperation between the kernel and dynamic linker is explored using r2 and binaries that have had all section information removed via\n    <code>\n     sstrip\n    </code>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  For more information, see chapter 5 of the Sys V ABI - \"Program Loading and Dynamic Linking\", as well as the LWN article\n  <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/631631/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   How programs get run: ELF binaries\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
