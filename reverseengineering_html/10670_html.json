    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm working on a Linux x86_64 ELF binary using IDA 6.6.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I run the Hex-Rays Decompiler on a function (by pressing F5) it always shows me the pseudocode for the\n  <code>\n   _init_proc\n  </code>\n  function, no matter what I run it on. It's stuck on that function and won't show me anything else in the pseudocode view. No errors are displayed or printed to the log.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If I produce the C file (Ctrl+F5) the full pseudocode is generated, so it's just an interface issue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is driving me mad. Things I've tried:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Restarting IDA\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Recreating the database\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Deleting all decompiler information for\n   <code>\n    _init_proc\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Deleting all decompiler information for the function I'm trying to decompile\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Has anyone encountered this behaviour before? Any suggestions?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I'm on Windows, so I removed the\n  <code>\n   HKCU\\Software\\Hex-Rays\n  </code>\n  key. On Linux you should probably try removing\n  <code>\n   ~/.idapro/ida.reg\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
