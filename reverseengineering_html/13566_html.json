    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Hex-Rays\n  </a>\n  , providers of IDA Disassembler, offers a companion product called\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/decompiler\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Hex-Rays Decompiler\n  </a>\n  (not to be confused with\n  <em>\n   HexRaysCodeXplorer\n  </em>\n  , a plugin for the Decompiler plugin rather than for IDA itself).  I would like to evaluate Hex-Rays Decompiler, but have found no means of doing so without purchasing a license for IDA Disassembler.  And the lowest price I can find for that is $589 or $1129 for 64 bit support.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hex-Rays states that\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   IDA is also the solid foundation on which our second product, the Hex-Rays decompiler, is built\n  </a>\n  . But while Hex-Rays offers both\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_demo.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   a demo version of IDA\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   IDA 5.0 Freeware\n  </a>\n  , neither comes with the Decompiler, and I haven't found the Hex-Rays Decompiler available for sale or download separately.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Much of what attracts me to Hex-Rays is its decompiler, but it's difficult to justify purchasing IDA Disassembler just to evaluate Hex-Rays Decompiler.  So,\n  <em>\n   how do I evaluate Hex-Rays Decompiler without purchasing IDA Disassembler for $589?\n  </em>\n  Thanks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

That should give you a good indication of the decompiler's capabilities.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can interactively decompile. Or also decompile in bulk. It decompiles a 22M binary containing 57k functions, totalling about 4.3M lines of code in about 1 hour. The decompilation can also be modified using pytbon scripts.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With some tweaking of variable and function types you can get very readable code. Also of c++ or objective-c with lots of virtual function calls.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
