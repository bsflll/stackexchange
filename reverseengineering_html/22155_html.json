    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Using the New Vegas Script Extender C++ API for Fallout New Vegas, I am able to write to the process' memory directly at runtime through a .dll plugin that's loaded by the NVSE injector. But it is not a debugger, like CheatEngine, so there's no automatic handling of inserting new code to an existing assembly function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Beginning of the assembly function,\n  <code>\n   TryOpenPipboy\n  </code>\n  , I want to inject code into:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xIqmA.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://i.sstatic.net/xIqmA.png\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   EquipPlayerPipboy()\n  </code>\n  function I want to inject:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Gaujf.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://i.sstatic.net/Gaujf.png\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The game has a loop called\n  <code>\n   MainUILoop\n  </code>\n  which runs every frame, and when the player presses tab without holding it down,\n  <code>\n   TryOpenPipboy\n  </code>\n  is called.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My guess is that I need to somehow create a new empty block of memory, edit a copy of the original\n  <code>\n   TryOpenPipboy\n  </code>\n  function, then replace all\n  <code>\n   TryOpenPipboy\n  </code>\n  calls with my modified variant. But that would make a hard incompatibility with any other NVSE plugins that also modify the MainUILoop in any way, as well as any that edit\n  <code>\n   TryOpenPipboy\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit: Another possible way would be to change the jmp assembly to my C++ function, then call\n  <code>\n   TryOpenPipboy\n  </code>\n  from my function. That would mean\n  <code>\n   TryOpenPipboy\n  </code>\n  is still called, but is unmodified, increasing potential compatibility.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So how should I go about doing this?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I'm happy to explain the details of how it works if you want, but I suggest just using an existing library like MinHook either way. Note that if this game is online then it's very likely you'll be kicked or banned, CRC hashes on code sections is about the simplest detection of unwanted modifications you can have.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Before you overwrite it, copy the instructions in the prologue to a new memory buffer, and add a jump to the rest of the function on the end, this is called a trampoline.

When they commit it, the first thing it does is suspends all other threads, this is to prevent race conditions and is why you need to tell it what thread you're running on.
