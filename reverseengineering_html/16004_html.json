This often includes IP addresses and ports used for existing connections. If you want to list existing connections and their owning processes on linux, running the\n  <code>\n   netstat\n  </code>\n  command.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By providing it some command line arguments you can get the desired information, consulting man pages is always recommended but for your specific case running\n  <code>\n   netstat -ape\n  </code>\n  to list all connections with their pid and username.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
