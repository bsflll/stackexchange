I want this FCG to include API calls as well, so function x of class y will be a node, and if that function calls something like WriteConsole, I want that node to connect to WriteConsole API node (preferably with a distinctive coloring).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Basically I want to generate something similar to the following, but for .NET executables:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Q4hBR.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Q4hBR.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
