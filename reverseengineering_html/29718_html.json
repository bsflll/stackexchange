Does it need to be something you're exporting?  if you use\n <code>\n  readelf -s <target>\n </code>\n does the symbol table contain the functions you want to find, or are you just looking for anything reached by a 'call' instruction during execution?  (I ask because the optimizer can do funny things to functions, including merging the tail of several similar functions into a single set of instructions shared by all.)\n</span>\n</body></html>",
