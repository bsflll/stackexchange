It's very convenient - you can save the state of all your bytes, function names, comments and so on. If something went wrong you can just restore a snapshot in snapshot manager.\nYou can find the it in\n  <em>\n   View --> Database Snapshot Manager\n  </em>\n  in IDA Pro 6.5\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
