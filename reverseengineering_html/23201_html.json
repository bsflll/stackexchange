    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am performing a security assessment on a .NET application. dnSpy is a great tool to do this. However, I've reached a module which is not in the \"main\" section of the program... It is\n  <em>\n   loaded\n  </em>\n  by the program (it's a DLL). I need to find out which code calls a class/method from the DLL and one way I thought of doing this is to debug the program. However, I would have to discover manually which functionality I need to perform in the program in order to get it to call this particular class.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a better way to do this? I also tried to search for the text call to the method in the source code but haven't found anything significant. Lastly, in OllyDbg, a user can manually load a DLL using its DLL loader. Is this possible to do in dnSpy or another .NET tool?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
