    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm reverse engineering a router, I'm fairly new to embedded devices and how Linux boots up, but I have a root UART shell, there's already a password hash in the\n  <code>\n   /etc/shadow\n  </code>\n  file, these passwords/hashes must be set somewhere right? How do devices like this usually do it, is there a script that is run during boot, or would it be in a binary in the /lib folder or something? I'm guessing it does this on the first boot up only?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Would it also be as simple as searching for a\n  <code>\n   mkpasswd\n  </code>\n  string in all the above? I really want to see if I can find what/how the password hash is generated, or hopefully some plaintext hardcoded string somewhere, but not really sure of where to start looking.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The modem is running OpenWrt. I've searched in\n  <code>\n   /etc\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   /lib\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   /sbin\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   /sbin/lib\n  </code>\n  , checked in other partitions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any tips or guidance on this stuff would be great, thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I've heard it can be a checksum of something to do with the firmware, but I don't really know how to check that. I've tried an\n  <code>\n   md5sum\n  </code>\n  on most firmware/device details I can find but no luck.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've also searched the filesystem for\n  <code>\n   md5sum\n  </code>\n  and the name of the custom binary, as well as the actual md5 hash itself, but no luck with any of those either. Last resort is now reverse engineering the custom binary that displays the md5 hash, figured maybe it was doing the hashing in that binary.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
