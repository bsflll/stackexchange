    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I used Ollydbg 2.01 back in 2014 when Olly was working to create a 64-bit version.  I was very eager to see the 64-bit version, but sadly that never came to pass.  I abandoned reverse engineering for a while, but now I would like to pick it up again and continue learning.  So my question to the experts is whether there is a 64-bit successor to the 32-bit Ollydbg.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Alternatively, what tools do you all use to reverse engineer 64-bit programs?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

However by tagging you pretty much\n <a href=\"https://x64dbg.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  gave the answer yourself\n </a>\n , even if you perhaps did it unknowingly. By and large x64dbg is what I'd consider a successor to OllyDbg. On the other hand, other folks may have a different opinion. You could also give WinDbgX (available as \"WinDbg Preview\" in Windows Store) a try.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Debuggers are for dynamic analysis, other tools exist for static analysis. Both are ways to reverse engineer code.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
