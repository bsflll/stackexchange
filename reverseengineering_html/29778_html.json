However, IDA did not have a\n  <code>\n   struct\n  </code>\n  declaration for it, so it created an empty\n  <code>\n   struct\n  </code>\n  -- you can tell this because the Description field for that entry simply says\n  <code>\n   struct\n  </code>\n  . If IDA had had access to a\n  <code>\n   struct\n  </code>\n  declaration, you would see it in your second screenshot.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So the short answer is: no, it does not appear that you have access to the\n  <code>\n   struct\n  </code>\n  declaration (e.g. from a PDB file with full type information), otherwise IDA would have already created it. You're going to have to reconstruct it yourself. However, you might also want to see\n  <a href=\"https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/Ghidra_10.0_build/Ghidra/Configurations/Public_Release/src/global/docs/ChangeHistory.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Ghidra 10.0's new features for exactly this type of situation\n  </a>\n  :\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Scripting.

Follow that pointer around through the assembly and see what offsets are used and how. If you can find where it's created, you can know it's total size. If you can debug the program live you can set watch points and see what data actually gets put into each offset. The size of the 'objects' manipulated at each offset and how they're used can clue you in to what they are. If you're really lucky some will get passed to system calls, OS APIs, or other well documented functions so you can just look up the expected arguments.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you're going to do that, you'll need to refresh\n  <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/esr/structure-packing/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   structure padding/packing\n  </a>\n  . You might be able to locate the\n  <a href=\"https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html#rtti\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   RTTI\n  </a>\n  if its a virtual class or ever used as part of an exception which would give you more hints.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
