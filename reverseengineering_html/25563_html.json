The classical examples of alloc-free-use are too simple, (at least for me), in order to deeply understand how use-after-free mechanims is actually identified. I've been reading about the subject for quite a lot in the past few weeks but I do not seem to find good examples, (bugs/writeups), on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What are good examples, (bugs/writeups), or methodologies in order to properly identify use-after-frees in code?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
