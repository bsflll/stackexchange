Besides, the readme mentions that it does not support format changes in Beta 9 and later so it probably won’t work with the final release.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The dyld cache format is highly optimized and a lot of information is shared by multiple libraries so it’s not easy to extract just the information used by the one you need (and put it back in correct locations). You can try opening an issue on GitHub but I expect you’ll have to implement it yourself if you really want to get this working.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
