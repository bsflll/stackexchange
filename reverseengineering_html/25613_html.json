    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have been using Ghidra, along with VoidWarranty's N64 loader to figure out analyze some unused functionality in an obscure title. however, it does  not recognize valid instructions with the default selected MIPS CPU, such as\n  <code>\n   0xdf410328\n  </code>\n  (\n  <code>\n   LD AT,0x0328(K0)\n  </code>\n  ),\n  <code>\n   0xff410328\n  </code>\n  (\n  <code>\n   SD AT,0x0328(K0)\n  </code>\n  ),\n  <code>\n   0xfcb00098\n  </code>\n  (\n  <code>\n   SD S0,0x0098(A1)\n  </code>\n  ). is this an issue with ghidra's definition, or am i just using the wrong processor for the job (MIPS:BE:32:default (1.5))?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You should probably also give an example full 4 byte instruction and not just 1 1/2 bytes\n</span>\n</body></html>",
