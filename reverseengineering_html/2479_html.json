Instructions have to be consecutive starting at offset 0, and you can't jump into the middle of an instruction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However\n  <a href=\"http://www.dexlabs.org/blog/bytecode-obfuscation\">\n   this post\n  </a>\n  implies that Dalvik does not do such bytecode verification. The authors do all the usual x86 shenanigans like jumping into the middle of an instruction, which is apparently allowed. Is this true? Do Android VMs actually perform any kind of loadtime bytecode verification? If not, why?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Dalvik bytecode will also be verified on the device, but this happens during installation time, not runtime. A verified and optimized version of the dex file will be stored on the system, protected by file system permission (you cannot change it afterwards unless you have rooted your device).\n </p>\n <p>\n  The trick that was used in the blog post is that you can set a specific flag within the class header which tells the verifier to skip this class.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
