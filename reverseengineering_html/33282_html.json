    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Example file:\n  <a href=\"https://imagej.net/nih-image/download/user-macros/Inclusion%20Counter/Inclusion%20Counter%20Manual%20v1.0.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://imagej.net/nih-image/download/user-macros/Inclusion%20Counter/Inclusion%20Counter%20Manual%20v1.0.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Needless to say, it is not an HTML file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  First byte is 0x04, which it shares with several other files I have in this format. Otherwise there appears to be no common signature other than perhaps\n  <code>\n   0039 0039 0039 0039 0039 0039\n  </code>\n  at offset 22 and\n  <code>\n   0002001C58B1000A\n  </code>\n  at offset 88.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It appears to be a composite or container format that can include data in blocks, for example it can include plain text or image data in a variety of formats, such as GIF.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I see many four-byte human-readable tags such as\n  <code>\n   MLIP\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   DSET\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   FNTM\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   CUTS\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   DSUM\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   HDNI\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   STYL\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   8BIM\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   HASH\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   LKUP\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   NAME\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   CELL\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   RULR\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   GRPH\n  </code>\n  , but I am unsure of their purpose, as they do not all seem to introduce blocks of embedded data. At the end of the file are two font names in plain text,\n  <code>\n   Helvetica\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   Geneva\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The files are from a Macintosh environment in 2001 and 2002. Unfortunately their resource forks have not survived. I found them alongside Microsoft Excel files (Compound Documents format) and FileMaker Pro 5.x (or 6) files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried opening these files in Excel (also Word and PowerPoint) from MS Office 98 for Mac on a G3 running OS 9.2. No luck - \"unknown file format\" or something like that.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

My other files in this format replace the\n  <code>\n   BOBO\n  </code>\n  string with\n  <code>\n   CWKJ\n  </code>\n  which threw me off. Maybe I should have known that\n  <code>\n   CWKJ\n  </code>\n  stands for the Japanese version of ClarisWorks. I was able to open these\n  <code>\n   CWKJ\n  </code>\n  files in the Japanese version of AppleWorks 6 (running under the Japanese version of Mac OS 9.2 in a SheepShaver VM) and save them as AppleWorks 6 documents, then open them in LibreOffice as suggested by matja.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
