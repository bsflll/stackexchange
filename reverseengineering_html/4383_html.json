    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I would like to ask if anyone knows how to solve the above mentioned problem I encounter. I was reverse engineering an apk, and met a part where static analysis with IDA Pro is not enough, so I thought that I could use the android_server provided by IDA Pro to debug the .so library during runtime. However, I kept getting an error from IDA Pro when trying to attach to any process within my emulator: 'The debugger could not attach to the selected process. This can perhaps indicate the process was just terminated, or that you don't have the necessary privileges.' I used adb to push the android_server to my emulator, and then used adb shell and executed the script as root, but I'm still having this error. Any ideas on what am I doing wrong? Thanks in advance!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So I guess you may forget forward your data from your development machine to your emulator.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As you executed the\n  <em>\n   android_server\n  </em>\n  , you can see\n  <code>\n   Listening on 0.0.0.0:23946...\n  </code>\n  in your emulator, which means\n  <em>\n   android_server\n  </em>\n  could kown what it should do by getting information from the\n  <strong>\n   emulator's\n  </strong>\n  port 23946.\nNow, you need transfer the information from IDA to your emulator.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To do this, you need:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    In IDA, click\n    <code>\n     Debugger\n    </code>\n    ->\n    <code>\n     Select Debugger\n    </code>\n    , choose a debugger accroding to your condition. For me, I choose\n    <em>\n     Remote Linux Debugger\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Click\n    <code>\n     Debugger\n    </code>\n    ->\n    <code>\n     Process Options\n    </code>\n    , and set\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      hostname\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n    to\n    <strong>\n     127.0.0.1\n    </strong>\n    , then set\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      port\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n    to\n    <strong>\n     23946\n    </strong>\n    or some other port you want, which your IDA could use to send information.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    In your development machine, as Windows, open cmd or powershell, enter\n    <code>\n     adb forward tcp:23946 tcp:23946\n    </code>\n    , so that your IDA can send data to your\n    <em>\n     android_server\n    </em>\n    . For more details for adb forward, please see\n    <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#forwardports\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#forwardports\n    </a>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    If fortunately, now, in IDA, click\n    <code>\n     Debugger\n    </code>\n    ->\n    <code>\n     Attach to process\n    </code>\n    , you may see the processes list, which means success.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
