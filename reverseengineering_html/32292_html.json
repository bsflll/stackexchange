Which means its not connected via USB. Through some digging around, I found out that this specific device connects via SPI. I've seen some tutorials on the internet about reverse engineering windows USB drivers for linux but not for something like this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My device is an ELAN\n  <code>\n   04f3:3104\n  </code>\n  embedded fingerprint reader that works with the windows WBF fingerprint reader driver. Any pointers much appreciated!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It managed to detect my device but taking an actual image of my fingerprint doesnt work. He did say in that repo that there was some special case logic implemented in the windows driver for this specific device. That's why im looking for way to implement the rest of it myself\n</span>\n</body></html>",

I think without knowing at least some basics from the WDK docs and Windows KM concepts there's only a slim chance you'll be able to make sense of such a driver. Is the driver perhaps publicly downloadable somewhere so one could have a look?\n</span>\n</body></html>",
