Hex Rays found that there's a variable which is set to specific value, thus there's no need to display the branches where the code will never be run, so it warns me about the optimizations:\n </p>\n <pre><code>conditional instruction was optimized away because of '%var_8.1==0'\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Is there any way to make it show all the code branches and stop optimizing it?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

See the image bellow:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lVJKO.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"hexrays optimization\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lVJKO.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Either\n  <code>\n   code_compress_magic\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   Signature\n  </code>\n  must be set as a\n  <code>\n   volatile\n  </code>\n  type. This will make Hexrays decompiler happy.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
