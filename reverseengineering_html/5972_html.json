So either normal WinAPI functions or just plain junkcode like in old-timey polymorph engines (with the pointless math and stack movments). And the latter one has it's problems like: <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1104/1104.3228.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1104/1104.3228.pdf</a>  So, it isn't strictly mandatory but it is the most sensible and IMO only worthwhile approach</span>",
