Furthermore, I get the same pfns for both outputs, and those pfns change to a new set every time I reopen the debugger, which suggests that it is using the debuggers context. Is this a limitation with local debugging? I would have thought that a kernel driver would be able to do this correctly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   process /p\n  </code>\n  does nothing, and\n  <code>\n   !peb\n  </code>\n  correctly shows the different PEBs of the 2 different processes, but\n  <code>\n   !pte\n  </code>\n  still appears to be using the context of\n  <code>\n   kd\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   !vtop\n  </code>\n  appears to be working correctly:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8pfr3.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8pfr3.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The problem is reproducible also on\n  <code>\n   windbg\n  </code>\n  (version 6.12) and also I tried version 10.\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52972057/windows-10-x64-unable-to-get-pxe-on-windbg\">\n   This\n  </a>\n  seems to be related.

All memory accesses are performed in the context of debugger's process. Kernel memory which is valid in any process context (pool, system PTE mappings etc.) will be displayed correctly, everything else (user memory, session space, page tables etc.) will not.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   .process /p: User addresses are translated using the page directory of the specified process, so commands like !peb should work correctly. Kernel addresses are not translated, so things like session space and page tables may still be displayed incorrectly.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   .process /P: All addresses, user and kernel, are translated. Use this option if you need to look at session space, page tables or other process-specific data in the kernel space.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  I did not think it would be a bug -- the functionality to do it was clearly available.
