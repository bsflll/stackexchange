The definition is this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>[CompilerGenerated]\nprivate sealed class Class106 : IDisposable, IEnumerable<Guid>, IEnumerator<Guid>, IEnumerable, IEnumerator\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I read in many forums that Enumerators are decompiled as inner classes and no decompiler can produce usable code. It seems the case, since the Class106 implements IEnumerable and IEnumerator interfaces.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does anyone have any clue on how I could patch this manually?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
