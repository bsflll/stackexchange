Or, how I should go about trying to reverse engineering it?\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  An example is:\n  \n\n  Input: 1D8HB58D04F177301\nOutput:-2|-72|-11|-2|18|100|-69|15|93|120|15|-97|-35|52|85|-114|53|-123|-1|-101|-38|125|-100|113\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have access to a dataset mapping the inputs to outputs and also a tool that converts an encoding (24 integers) into a VIN\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Inexperienced with this so any help is greatly appreciated!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
