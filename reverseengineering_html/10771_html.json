Either you should specify a function that causes you problems, or you should add some specifics. Currently, your question looks like this : \"How to reverse something ?\". Meanwhile, I suggest you take a look at this website\n <a href=\"http://www.binary-auditing.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  binary-auditing.com\n </a>\n introducing basic HLL (High Level Language) in ASM.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Error return cases gives clues about come chunks of code of the function.\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Look code around calls to the function to try to figure out what the function is about.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    analyze the content of the function isolating chunks of code, each chunk corresponding to a line of C for example. To identify chunks :\n   </p>\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     look the graph of function to figure out the different paths and the complexity level of the function. Try to identify patterns like switch, imbricated if, loops, etc.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     look for calls to another functions, library calls or API calls. For a non obfuscated code this is usually easy to do.\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    this step is simultaneous to the precedent. Look the use of local variables and try to name them. For each local variable :\n   </p>\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     is the variable re-used in the function for different purposes ? if so rename it with a generic type name.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     if the variable is used for a single purpose, try to understand what it is and name the variable in consequence.\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Don't expect to understand all the function with a single pass of analyze. Repeat the process. If a chunk of code is not clear, go to the next one and return later to the hard one. Each time you understand a chunk, review your previous work to see if your guessed are consistent with your new findings.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    If the function calls another functions, proceed with a bottom-up method like leafs are usually simples than branches and understanding leafs help to understand branches.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Try to look at mixed source code C/asm for example, with a debugger or with  the good compiler switch (/FAs or /FAcs for example in Visual Studio).\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Hope that helps.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
