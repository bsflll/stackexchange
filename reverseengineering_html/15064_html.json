    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  When a C++ subclass object is being passed to a function which accepts base class objects, the C++ compiler implementation is so the subclass object pointer gets shifted down to point to the corresponding virtual table. So, the object may be passed to a function starting from the offset of that virtual table.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm trying to find a way how to pass the pointer to an offset within an object to a function in IDA decompiled view.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried to set the type of the function argument something like struct->field * or struct.field * but that doesn't work.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
