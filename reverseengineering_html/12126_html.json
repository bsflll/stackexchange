And I am thinking to use\n  <code>\n   dynamic analysis\n  </code>\n  (say,\n  <code>\n   PIN\n  </code>\n  ) to obtain an execution trace of each malware sample.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, I am afraid such activity would crash my computer. So am I asking, how to dynamically analysis malware samples\n  <strong>\n   safely\n  </strong>\n  ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know somehow I need to run it in a\n  <code>\n   VM\n  </code>\n  , but isn't it possible that the VM can be crashed as well? Should I reinstall the\n  <code>\n   VM\n  </code>\n  at that time? basically What's the best practice to do so?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you a lot.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Once the execution is complete revert the snapshot. Repeat that till you finish. (probably wanna automate it)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The guest OS or the environment inside the VM can be crashed though. In the event that it happens, you don't have to reinstall VM. Just follow SnakeByte instructions.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
