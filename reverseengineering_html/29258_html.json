    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am using Ida Pro 7.0 and working with a binary (firmware) written in C++ .Fortunately there are  symbols in the firmware and I know function names but Ida didn't manage to demangle all function names. I saw in the firmware ASCII string\n  <strong>\n   gcc2\n  </strong>\n  . Likely the binary was compiled using gcc2 compiler. There are a lot of important funcitons in the mangled form.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Help me out please. How Can I resolve this problem???\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried to use idc.Demangle() func but unfortunately It can't demangle correctly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  P.S.\nI found that\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    c++filt\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  utility works correctly\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Can you describe the ways to do to resolve my problem. Maybe I need to play with Compiler submenu (Options->Compiler) or Demangled names. The only thing I remember that my device works under vxworks os.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
