    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have downloaded a sample of a malware to analyze it. First, I opened it with PEiD to look if it is packed. \nPEiD gives me the following information:\n </p>\n <pre><code>   Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0/6.0\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So, I assumed that it is not packed. \nWhen I opened it using ollydbg shows me the following lines:\n </p>\n <pre><code>   PUSH malware.00401F8C\n   CALL <JMP.&MSVBVM60.#100>\n   ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],AL\n   ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],AL\n   ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],AL\n   ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],AL\n   ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],AL\n   INC EAX\n   ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],AL\n   ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],AL\n   ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],AL\n   DB 00\n   DB 1D\n   ....\n   ....\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So, normally it should start with a function prologue(the typical beginning line with PUSH EBP and so on) but although it is not packed, obviously the program tries to make the analyzing process harder (for me). \nWhen I step to the second line( CALL <...>), then the process begins to run and does not stop. In my previous cases, I have only unpacked malware samples that were packed with UPX. So, a piece of code like that above is completely new for me. So:\n </p>\n <p>\n  How should I solve this? Can someone give me an advice how I can handle that?\n </p>\n <p>\n  best regards,\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
