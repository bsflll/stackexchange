Because the stack of the current process is displayed by <code>peda</code> (look at the <code>stack</code> section of the display). And, in fact, each time you hit the <code>nexti</code> or <code>stepi</code> function, the new stack is displayed. So, I guess this is exactly you are looking for.</span>",

You have to understand that setting a first breakpoint should be prior to the <code>run</code> command. Because, if you don't, you will never be given the opportunity to interact with <code>gdb</code> and your program.</span>",
