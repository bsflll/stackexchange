But i'd read out a few more cards first to get more examples.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

But unless the vending machine was designed in the 1990s, it will have an online connection to a server that knows how much money should be on the card, and\n <i>\n  maybe\n </i>\n use the card values as fallback when the online connection doesn't work. In that case, it'll update transactions to the server later. So, cheating won't work in most cases, and if/when it does, you'll be found out later.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

But that's to easy, I want to \"hack\" it completely. I already checked Reveng and tried something but due lack of knowledge in CRC it was hard to make anything useful.  I made a python scripts which tries to brute force the crc by doing XOR. Didn't succeed.  Now I am making a C program which will bruteforce many CRC16's with the values on the card. Any help for Reveng would be welcome ofcourse.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
