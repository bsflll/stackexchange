Because of this, you should make a backup of the original file before your first patch, and copy it back before every subsequent patch you make.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, i recommend you to check into\n  <a href=\"https://thesprawl.org/projects/ida-patcher/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   idapatcher\n  </a>\n  which will make it a bit easier to make and check your patches.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
