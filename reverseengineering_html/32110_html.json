    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am trying to disassemble a few Arm Cortex-M3 .elf binaries and run a custom IDAPython script (script.py) from the command line (in batch mode). I have been able to do that with the following command:\n </p>\n <pre><code>/path_to_idapro/idat -B -parm:ARMv7-M -logfile.log -S\"/path_to_script/script.py arg1\" elf_to_disassemble\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However, I need to load an SVD file before running script.py so that my analysis will be complete. In IDA Pro GUI, I do the following:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Edit > Plugins > SVD file management\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Select the SVD file\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  How can I pass the SVD file (e.g., /path_to_SVD/STM32F103.svd) as an argument to my previous command?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have already searched the command line switches of IDA Pro\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/417.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/417.shtml\n  </a>\n  , and to my understanding, there isnâ€™t such an option.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am currently using IDA Pro v7.6 in Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
