My be a different system may suite better: e.g. a scriptable hooking system like\n <a href=\"https://frida.re\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  frida.re\n </a>\n which allows to hook functions, print arguments and later unload the hook.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

I mean synchronization with the main tab (assembler), not just a list. It is just a feature which works in OllyDbg. It seems to be missing in x64dbg.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
