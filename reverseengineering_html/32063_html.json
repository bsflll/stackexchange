If you for example decompile the APK with Jadx you will find certain Java methods are marked as\n  <code>\n   native\n  </code>\n  and that doe not have a Java method body.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For each native method there should be a corresponding function in one of the loaded .so files. The common way is to export Java Native (JNI) functions, so loading the .so file in a tool like Ghidra or IDA Pro and check the exported functions list. The JNI methods have a special naming scheme that includes the full package name,  class name, method name. For more details see e.g.\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/32473938/150978\">\n   this answer\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  For identifying called methods on Java and native level\n  <a href=\"https://frida.re/docs/frida-trace/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   frida-trace\n  </a>\n  (requires rooted Android device) is a very helpful tool. You can mark certain Java or native methods to be traced. Using wildcards you can mark a large list of methods to be traced. This way you can identify if methods that may sound interesting based on their name are really called when you execute a certain function.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
