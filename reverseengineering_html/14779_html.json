    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am in Linux, and I have seen this question a few times but never, nobody answered how to really make this work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I need to add a section to an already compiled binary. Lets say for a moment is an\n  <strong>\n   ELF\n  </strong>\n  file. I'm using\n  <strong>\n   objcopy\n  </strong>\n  so this should be generic for any format because\n  <strong>\n   objcopy\n  </strong>\n  uses\n  <strong>\n   libbfd\n  </strong>\n  that handles many formats.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My process is as follows.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I create the bytecode for a section I want to append to an already compiled ELF file. Let's name this file bytecode.bin\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then I do:\n </p>\n <pre><code>objcopy --add-section .mysection=bytecode.bin \\\n--set-section-flags .mysection=code,contents,alloc,load,readonly \\\nmyprogram myprogram_edited\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Then I adjust the VMA of the secition:\n </p>\n <pre><code>objcopy --adjust-section-vma .mysection=$((16#XXXXX)) myprogram_edited myprogram_edited\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Where XXXXXX is the new VMA address for the section.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I get the warning:\n </p>\n <pre><code>objcopy: stIbZt3t: warning: allocated section `.mysection' not in segment\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  When I do:\n </p>\n <pre><code>objdump -d myprogram_edited\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I see:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Disassembly of section .mysection:\n\n0000000000201011 <.mysection>:\n...\n...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So I see the section is created OK and the VMA adjusted. But the section is not mapped to segments, so it can't be loaded at runtime.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How can I solve this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  EDIT:\n </p>\n <p>\n  I opted for using Intel's\n  <a href=\"https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   PIN\n  </a>\n  tool. Very useful and powerful for RI and binary injection.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In particular,\n  <code>\n   objcopy\n  </code>\n  won't add PHT entries for you, so you will have to extend or adjust the PHT manually. You can either do it manually with a hex editor or try using a library such as\n  <code>\n   libelf\n  </code>\n  (it gives you necessary primitives but you'll need to implement the logic yourself).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
