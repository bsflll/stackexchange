Do the PC and the keyboard actually share that information? If you can change some settings on the PC, and these settings are truly stored on the keyboard (are they unchanged if you attach the keyboard to a different PC?), then it should be possible to continue with your, er, quest, by learning USB protocols, and monitoring the communication between PC and keyboard by something like\n <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/usbsnoop/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  sourceforge.net/projects/usbsnoop\n </a>\n .\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Especially if the driver need any frameworks like ATI ... If the test confirms the OnBoard memory is used then post more info like connection type (USB,PS2?) IC's onboard, driver info etc ...\n</span>\n</body></html>",

You can absolutely store arbitrary data in those sectors, and even have the data recallable on button click (actually using it as a macro) or otherwise dumping the data via USB.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've come across this through reverse engineering the windows driver for this mouse making a\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/pzl/mx2000drv\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   linux port\n  </a>\n  . An extremely quick way to accomplish what you want with this mouse is using this driver, and using the\n  <strong>\n   dump\n  </strong>\n  and\n  <strong>\n   load\n  </strong>\n  commands. The dump command creates a 1285-byte binary file with the memory contents of the mouse. Opening this with a hex editor, the first 1024 bytes should be easily seen to be all\n  <code>\n   0xFF\n  </code>\n  . Feel free to put any arbitrary data there, it doesn't cause adverse effects to the mouse until macros are enabled. After editing the file, you can update the mouse memory using the load command. Of course, you can read it back with another dump.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
