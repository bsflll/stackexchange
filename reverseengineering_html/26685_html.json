    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  My college has its ERP platform in a Flash interface, accessible only via Internet Explorer. I am looking into ways I can interface with it via things like\n  <a href=\"https://ruffle.rs/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   ruffle\n  </a>\n  . So I can write my own frontend using modern frameworks. Thing is, accessing the ERP from anything other Internet Explorer results in the browser download a Flash file\n  <code>\n   campus-lynx.swf\n  </code>\n  . This means the platform is locked to Windows only. Flashfox on Android works as well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ERP is available directly at erp.nitdelhi.ac.in or clicking \"internet\" at the top of nitdelhi.ac.in.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Even site itself state \"Best Peformed With Mozilla FireFox Version 2 and above\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  Most recent Firefox versions start dropping Flash support, that may be the case. But you always can install portable version of Firefox 52 without this issue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Judging by controls look and feel the application was build with Adobe Flex Builder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was several commercial Flash decompilers such as\n  <a href=\"https://www.eltima.com/products/flashdecompiler/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.eltima.com/products/flashdecompiler/\n  </a>\n  You can try to decompile SWF file to figure out protocols being used.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Most probably there is something standard such as XML or\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Message_Format\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Action Message Format\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  UPD: Network activity tab in browser clearly indicate usage of AMF protocol. There is a plenty of AMF support libraries for various programming languages. Google it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
