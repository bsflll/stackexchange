    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I was just debugging something in IDA and it told me that the instruction pointer was pointing into the middle of an instruction, and asked if I would like to have it disassemble the middle of the instruction. In my particular case I never want to do that, so I checked \"don't ask me again\", but then I clicked yes accidentally, so now it's redefining my code and throwing away my carefully written comments every time I step. How do I reset this?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
