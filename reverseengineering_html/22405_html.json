Another thing is i executed the program line by line, it somehow jump back to the entry point at\n  <strong>\n   0x00043b33\n  </strong>\n  and then go back to the address\n  <strong>\n   0x770B0D54\n  </strong>\n  later again. Can someone guide me on this？\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The address\n  <code>\n   0x770B0D54\n  </code>\n  is in kernel code and it's probably before kernel starts executing user code. Useful if there's some magic happening before\n  <code>\n   main\n  </code>\n  is executed and you want to step through that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the other hand\n  <code>\n   0x00043b33\n  </code>\n  is int user code and it's probably the address of the\n  <code>\n   main\n  </code>\n  function so that is the real code of the application.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In OllyDbg you can control the initial breakpoint in Options->Debugging, Startup and exit\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/M3sx8.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/M3sx8.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
