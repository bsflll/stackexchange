So it looks like it is not hard to bypass this, however I am curious and never tried it before. How do you do it guys? (at least some examples on some simple program).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks in advance.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Testing\n <code>\n  ptrace\n </code>\n can only be done with a test which will be localized in the code. And, I am not sure that attaching to a running software will cause a\n <code>\n  0xcc\n </code>\n to be written (does it?). So, self-check routine to detect modification of the source code will fail as wel.. My guess is that you just need to be lucky when you attach you debugger to the program and to stop it in a safe mode.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

On windows, a common trick is to patch certain routines (in ntdll) that are invoked by the kernel as soon as the debugger is attached. A solution to this is to simply restore ntdll in memory right before attaching. I think this question is pretty borad, can you be more specific?\n</span>\n</body></html>",
