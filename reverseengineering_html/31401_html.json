I can say I am able to connect to\n  <strong>\n   process (0)\n  </strong>\n  and start the machine (by using IDA 32bit,  IMO it has something to do with bios! or I don't know at all!).\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   But after starting it I cannot get data back to IDA. when I try to suspend the machine via IDA it won't work at all and takes so long time without any chance.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   I also tried connecting to the machine via another IDA instance by a 64bit version of IDA and I can only connect to\n   <strong>\n    process (1)\n   </strong>\n   which breaks the line to debug processes already running!\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Could someone help a bit on this tricky thing?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
