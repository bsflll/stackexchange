But this may change as soon as you\n  <em>\n   create\n  </em>\n  a function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Concretely, right click on\n  <code>\n   1006750f0\n  </code>\n  and select \"Create Function\" from the context menu. This should give you both a disassembly and a decompiled function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another general remark: Function identification is a hard problem and there are a lot of different algorithms and heuristics used by different tools (IDA, radare2, Hopper, Ghidra, ...) to approach it. None of those is perfect and sometimes some of those tools perform better then others.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
