    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am trying to\n  <code>\n   ptrace_attach\n  </code>\n  the main process and its threads (\n  <code>\n   /proc/<pid>/task\n  </code>\n  ) of an android unity app to avoid malicious users debugging the app(which is a game).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I developed a ndk library that forks from main process and\n  <code>\n   ptrace_attach\n  </code>\n  the parent process(being the main process) inside the\n  <code>\n   JNI_OnLoad()\n  </code>\n  function. After that periodically checks the\n  <code>\n   /proc/<pid>/task\n  </code>\n  folder to attach newly created threads.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The problem is, \nthis works well in normal apps but when I try to run this inside an app made with unity, the main process stops and screen becomes black or white not responding. But if you delay attaching a few seconds just enough to see the animation working on the screen, attaching works fine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Code is roughly something like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>if(!fork())\n{\n     parentPid = getppid();\n\n     // attach parent process\n     if(ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH,parentPid,0,0)<0)\n          exit(-1);\n     ptrace(PTRACE_SETOPTIONS, parentPid, 0, PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC| PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORKDONE|PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD |PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK |PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORK |PTRACE_O_TRACECLONE );\n\n     while(true)\n     {\n          // get signal from processes\n          stoppedPid = waitpid(-1,&stat_loc, 0);\n\n          ...\n\n          // check if stoppedPid need to be attached\n          // if so, attach\n          ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH,stoppedPid,0,0);\n\n          ...\n\n          // else, just continue the stopped process\n          ptrace(PTRACE_CONT,stoppedPid,0,0);\n     }\n }\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Maybe I should adjust the\n  <code>\n   ptrace_setoptions\n  </code>\n  ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks in advance :)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In the java code, it seems SIGSEGV occurs while calling View related functions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I guess UnityPlayer or Android app loader handles SIGSEGV smoothly while app loading time. Therefore, if you get a SIGSEGV, simply detaching it and attaching again does not hang the app.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
