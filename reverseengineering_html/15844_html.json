My thoughts are to obfuscate the source, build the executable, compress the executable (using a compressor), and then protect the executable (using a compressor).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I understand that RE is\n  <em>\n   always possible\n  </em>\n  with enough time by a skilled adversary.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
