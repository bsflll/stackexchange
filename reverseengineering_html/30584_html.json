    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I was working with an old ios game, and found that it saved most of its data (players, worlds, anything in-between) in\n  <code>\n   MDB\n  </code>\n  files.. titled\n  <code>\n   data.mdb\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   lock.mdb\n  </code>\n  . There is a pair for every object type (A players save data, world settings and config, world data (terrain))\n </p>\n <p>\n  At first I thought it was some strange microsoft database thing, but apparently they are\n  <code>\n   PSI\n  </code>\n  binary files after doing some more digging. I could be wrong.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am trying to understand how these formats work and if there is a particular known way to decompile them into something readable? Or are these a type of cryptographically sealed binary file, where they are compiled with a hash / password / key?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I honestly have no clue where to start.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is a sample from \"world_db\" which I assume represents the save data of the entire worlds terrain and items:\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/MisterSirCode/world_db\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/MisterSirCode/world_db\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  If anyone could give me some clues or potentially has any information about these\n  <code>\n   MDB\n  </code>\n  files or\n  <code>\n   PSI v1\n  </code>\n  binary files I would appreciate it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All I can assume is that\n  <code>\n   lock.db\n  </code>\n  is the binary passcode / hash if it is a sealed binary file, since its so much smaller than the\n  <code>\n   data.db\n  </code>\n  file\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YACAb.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"overview of mdb files\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YACAb.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The\n  <code>\n   lock.db\n  </code>\n  file just looks like a 4 letter term repeated randomly\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ADjur.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"mdb file hex dump\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ADjur.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Something else that might be related?\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/LMDB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/LMDB\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
