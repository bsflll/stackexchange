    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have installed Ubuntu 20.04 under Windows Subsystem Linux 2 and I want to perform some remote debugging with IDA Pro.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As with other VMs I have used, I can perform remote debugging when send the executable\n  <code>\n   linux_server\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   linux_server64\n  </code>\n  to the VM and execute them. However, in WSL instance, when I run the server and use correct port and IP, there is still connection from IDA Pro to the VM, however, I kept receive this error:\n </p>\n <p>\n  In WSL instance:\n </p>\n <pre><code>IDA Linux 64-bit remote debug server(ST) v7.7.27.
