Pardon my naive knowledge.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Currently, I'm trying to\n  <strong>\n   reverse a DLL file of a certain EXE\n  </strong>\n  . \nThe EXE makes calls to functions of this DLL for looking up certain values which I plan to patch eventually.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How do I go about debugging the DLL while the application is running?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   I would like to be able to place a break point in my DLL and get a hit in IDA Pro while the call is made from the application.\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Right now, I patch the DLL by simply hoping for it to work, but I'm pretty sure that there exists a much productive method.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm using\n  <strong>\n   IDA Pro\n  </strong>\n  as my flavor of tool.\nYou could suggest me if some other disassembler can help me achieve the same.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Could someone be kind enough to guide me around this task?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
