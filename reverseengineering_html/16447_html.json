I have no idea how it works or how to use it in reverse. I have attached the file below.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2FK8VIu6fm2S0NZbkVnMTEwbms\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   pass.out\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Apologies in advance if I've made any wrong assumptions or used wrong terminology. Any help, explanations, or pointers to learning resources would be much appreciated!\n </p>\n <p>\n  EDIT: Sorry for the confusion! The files are from the .apk of an Android app. My aim is to decrypt them to common file formats e.g. .png and .mp3. From inspecting the .apk, I believe files are processed in the following ways:\n1) Sound files (.wav, .mp3, .mov) in specific folders have their extension changed to .png. I can play them by changing the extension back to the original.\n2) All other files are XOR encrypted by running them through the pass.out file. I want to know how to reverse this process.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
