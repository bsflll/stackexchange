            "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  The brown text is called as single instruction because the function, prologue of which we see in brown color, was not recognized by IDA as function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There are many possible reasons for that, for example this function may be never called directly, or there is unrecognized instruction inside. In order to make this code a function (which will make it black) by defining it as a function yourself, you can press\n  <kbd>\n   P\n  </kbd>\n  when the cursor is located on address\n  <code>\n   0x00405fd0\n  </code>\n  where the function prologue starts, or select all the functions' instructions and press\n  <kbd>\n   P\n  </kbd>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  When this code becomes function, the graphs and decompilation should start working.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
