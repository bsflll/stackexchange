I have opened .dll (x86) in IDA Pro and I have noticed few exported functions. The issue is that all of them looks like this:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KQavy.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"screenshot\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KQavy.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  IDA pseudocode:\n </p>\n <pre><code>int __stdcall GameLauncher_StartGameW(int a1, int a2, int a3, int a4, int a5, int a6, int a7)\n{\n  return (*(int (__stdcall **)(int, int, int, int, int, int))(*(_DWORD *)a1 + 8))(a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7);\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  If I understand this correctly I need to get a1 object (eax) to actually get the function that I want to reverse engineer. Am I right? Is there any easy way to get this object to get the function offset?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Notice that  just before\n  <code>\n   call [eax+8]\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  contains\n  <code>\n   *arg0\n  </code>\n  value. If you know the arguments' values, you will also get the address of the function being called.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
