You can also see\n  <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/10168/setting-up-a-honeypot\">\n   this\n  </a>\n  thread as the accepted answer here provides a lot of detail and perspective about what you should think about when you're setting up a honeypot.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any time you're doing any kind of analysis or interaction with malware you should be running it inside of a Virtual Machine. Security procedures aside you never know what you're going to run into when you're doing analysis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That being said, there is plenty of malware that operates differently if it detects it's running inside of a virtual machine vs. a real system but if you're just getting started I would recommend doing your analysis inside of a VM.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
