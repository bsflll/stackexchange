You'd also need to update all the code referencing\n  <code>\n   \"blueColor\"\n  </code>\n  to use your new space address. One such candidate space could be strings describing segment and sections for\n  <code>\n   __TEXT\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   __text\n  </code>\n  respectively in the Mach-O header. Both of them will be exactly 16 bytes (padded with zeroes).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
