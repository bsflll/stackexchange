There was nothing to be found at the usual suspect like\n  <code>\n   init.d\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   .bashrc\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   crontab\n  </code>\n  . I found where the binary was located, renamed it, and put a script it its place. The script displayed and passed through all the received arguments and recorded the time and the duration of the binary execution, as well as some\n  <code>\n   /proc\n  </code>\n  information. I was able to figure out what called it, when, and what were the arguments. What is the name of this\n  <code>\n   honeypotting\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   MITM\n  </code>\n  technique?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
