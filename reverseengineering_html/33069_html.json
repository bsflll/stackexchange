    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I need help to\n  <strong>\n   unpack\n  </strong>\n  or create python script to unpack automatically the type of this firmware, someone already unpacked this firmware, and it contains: boot.bin, aboot.bin and system.bin files. (possible to have\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    others partitions\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  in other firmware).\nI analyse the firmware.bin with Hex Editor and i see on the Header the information of: size, offset and name of the partition.  I compare it with the extracted partiton files and i get this information:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   \"aboot\"  size: 00 47 10 00 / offst partition address start : 00 00 8B 00\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   \"boot\"   size: 00 47 10 00 / partition address start offset: 00 07 6B 00\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   \"system\" size: 02 0A 00 00 / partition address start offset:\n   <strong>\n    00 4E FB 00\n   </strong>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  i make some analyse and verification also that next offset or next partition address 'start' is getting on:  hex address inverse on\n  <strong>\n   black color\n  </strong>\n  ( + ) the offset of preview partition.\n </p>\n <p>\n  ex: to get the start partition of \"system\" : 00 4E FB 00 =\n  <strong>\n   00 47 90 00\n  </strong>\n  + 00 07 6B 00\n </p>\n <p>\n  _ partition size:\n  <strong>\n   red color\n  </strong>\n  / length of byte who contains infos is:\n  <strong>\n   1C\n  </strong>\n  , which starts with\n  <strong>\n   01\n  </strong>\n  for other partitions except the first or start of partition\n  <strong>\n   (aboot is 08)\n  </strong>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FXHQ4cVo.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FXHQ4cVo.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, i want to understand, where or how to\n  <strong>\n   know the offset of partition address start\n  </strong>\n  because it needed to calculate the offset of next partition ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you very much.\n </p>\n <p>\n  (there is some  byte also in start of aboot 03 00 00 00)\n </p>\n <p>\n  sorry, if my explanation is not clear.\n  <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OY0A5U5IRtuZLtzMraLOv_FlLON_B0j4/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   firmware link\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
