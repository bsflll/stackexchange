    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Is there a way letting IDA scan all the database and reset all stack pointers values to it's default state that were previously modified? i.e like it was when I first started the analyzing the binary?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm asking because I used to change the stack pointers for some functions I couldn't read due to having\n  <code>\n   negative sp value\n  </code>\n  and I didn't know that it's going to affect all it's caller functions. So I would like to reset all stack pointers in all the database(Using IDA Pro 7.0).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
