That being said c++ we can infer isn't or shouldn't be a 1 to 1 map to assembly. Some c syntax can't be exactly mapped.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example a jump statement progresses the code to any other byte. So a jump can act like a conditional branch or a function call, etc. All very different statements in c++ yet they use the key part, jump instruction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I think a better approach would be to ask how a c++ basic statements compile to assembly. If you understand and know thoughs it then is a simple thing to find those blocks in assembly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   note\n  </strong>\n  In modern setting most high level languages don't compile to x86 assembly but byte code or some operating specific format, often not far from assembly, however different enough that it requires the operating system to run. This is to abstract the underlying hardware so software doesn't have to get recompiled.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
