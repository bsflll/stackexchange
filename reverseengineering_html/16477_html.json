I saw his pins and saw that it uses jtag to perform debug, so I'm trying to use it JTAG interface to read its flash content.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I read the MPC's flash content using a tool (UPA) and a PC, however, I want to do it by my own, using my own embedded hardware without the PC's tool. I read about JTAG standard( JTAG_IEEE-Std-1149.1-2001 ), and some videos and explanations on the internet. I read about TAP controller state diagram and read about some instructions too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In order to better understand the JTAG reading, I Used the PC's tool to read the MCP's flash and an osciloscope to see how the communication is performed, however, the communication has almost 10s of duration. So, I filled the entire flash with zeros and read the memory, in this way, I was able identify the reading of memory using the osciloscope. However, although I can identify the reading of memory using the osciloscope, I can't determine yet the exact sequence of commands to perform the reading. The time of reading is too big, almost 10s.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, before to go more deep, I would like to know if there is some kind of protection to access the flash memory. I tried to understand the beginning of the communication, I can identify the progress in the TAP controller's state machine, but I was not able to understand what this steps means and why it is done. So, I would like to know:\n </p>\n <p>\n  1) Can I determine if the communication has some kind of protection ? I really need to know it before to go further in the task because I need to know the task's complexity level before to go more deep\n </p>\n <p>\n  2) Although I read  about the JTAG standard and the TAP controller state machine, I was not able to say what sequence of comands I need to read the flahs content.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Abaixo está a leitura do flash do MPC5606B realizada pela ferramenta com o auxílio do PC. The image is composed of a sequence of images. The first is the image of the communication in full, the second is the beginning of the communication, there is an arrow indicating where it was withdrawn.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SLq5T.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SLq5T.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  This was my interpretation until now\n </p>\n <p>\n  FIGURE 1:\n </p>\n <p>\n  1.1 - (TMS = 1) Test-Logic-Resset\n </p>\n <p>\n  1.2 - (CLK wide pulse) I do not know why.\n </p>\n <p>\n  1.3 - (8 pulses of CLK, TMS = 1)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since TMS did not came out to 1 I understand that it did not quit Test-logic-Reset\n </p>\n <p>\n  1.4 - (TMS = 0, 1 pulse clock) enters Run-Test-Idle\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  FIGURE 2:\n </p>\n <p>\n  2.1 - (TMS = 1, 2 clock pulses) Goes to the \"Select IR-Scan\" state\n </p>\n <p>\n  2.2 - (TMS = 0, 2 pulses of clock) Go to the state \"Shif-IR\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  2.3 - (TMS = 0, 4 clock pulses) Remains in \"Shift-IR\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  TDI: 1000\nTDO: 1000\n2.4 - (TMS = 1, 1 clock pulse) Goes to the \"Exit1-IR\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  2.5 - (TMS = 1, 1 clock pulse) Goes to the status \"Update-IR\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  2.6 - (TMS = 0, 1 clock pulse) Goes to the \"Run-Test-Idle\"\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  FIGURE 3:\n </p>\n <p>\n  3.1 - (TMS = 1, 1 clock pulse) goes to the \"Select DR-Scan\" state\n </p>\n <p>\n  3.2 - (TMS = 0, 2 clock pulses) Go to the status \"Shif-DR\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  3.3 - (TMS = 0, 31 clock pulses) Go to the \"Shif-DR\" state\n </p>\n <p>\n  The 32 clock cycles are equivalent to 4 bytes:\n </p>\n <p>\n  TDI: 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00\nTDO: 0xB8 0x0C 0x27 0x54 (10111000 00001100 00100111 01010100)\n </p>\n <p>\n  3.4 - (TMS = 1, 1 clock pulse) Goes to the \"Exit1-DR\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  3.5 - (TMS = 1, 1 clock pulse) Goes to the status \"Update-DR\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  3.6 - (TMS = 0, 1 clock pulse) Goes to the \"Run-Test-Idle\"\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you can export your data to a more or less universal data format, like VCD or even a CSV file, you can use\n  <a href=\"http://sigrok.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   Sigrok and Pulseview\n  </a>\n  to decode your data. This will decode the low-level JTAG data; if you know the specifics of the controller like TAP register layout and command set, you can extend Sigrok with a decoder that runs on top of the existing IEEE-1149 decoder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/g63XS.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"jtag\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/g63XS.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

However, this is very low-level view, you need to bring it back to the higher level, at least IR/DR. For example, the whole exchange 1-3 can be summarized as:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Write IR=0b100 (8), read DR=0x2AE4301D\n </p>\n <p>\n  (DR bits are shifted in from the lowest one, so you need to swap the bit string)\n </p>\n <p>\n  This IR value is very close to the standard IDCODE(4), so I think there is an off-by-one in your interpretation and this exchange is reading the device ID. In fact, the value 0x2AE4301D  matches the one for MPC5606BF I found in\n  <a href=\"https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN4477.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   this document\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  As for actual flash reading, I doubt it's done using raw JTAG commands. AFAIK the common ways of reading flash are the following:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   using boundary scan, set and read the CPU pins connected to the flash chip; basically turning the CPU into a bit-bang flash programmer. This obviously only works with external flash so probably not your case\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   using custom chip-specific debugging commands, read and write the flash device I/O registers in the CPU memory space.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   using custom chip-specific debugging commands, upload a small flasher program into the CPU's RAM and let it execute. The program would chunks of flash into a RAM area which can then be fetched via JTAG back to the host. by setting the register state before each execution, different parts of flash could be accessed.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  I would recommend you to use a program like urJTAG or OpenOCD to perform high-level JTAG manipulations (like sending IR and reading DR) if you want to reproduce what the flasher program is doing. urJTAG also has a mode to brute-force possible IR values which may let you discover the vendor-specific commands.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
