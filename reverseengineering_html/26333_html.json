    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've download recaf jar file and install JDK 8. When I execute it/start it, it all works fine with\n  <code>\n   java -jar recaf-2.12.0-J8-jar-with-dependencies.jar\n  </code>\n  . I open a class file also no problem. The issue is when I try to edit it is disabled saying:\n </p>\n <pre><code>// =============================================== //\n// Recompile disabled. Please run Recaf with a JDK //\n// =============================================== //\n\n// Decompiled with: CFR 0.150\n...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Any idea why and how to solve this issue? This is my first time using recaf as well so it might be a newbie question.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Most of Recaf is based on the assembler, which you can find documentation on here:\n    <a href=\"https://www.coley.software/Recaf/doc-edit-modes.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     \"Class editing modes\"\n    </a>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    This problem may still persist after a basic installation of Java 8 because the required platform tools are not added to the classpath. There is documentation on what files are required, where they are, and where you need to place them here:\n    <a href=\"https://www.coley.software/Recaf/doc-setup-8.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     \"Java 8 setup\"\n    </a>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Alternatively you can update to Java 11 or higher where none of this configuration is necessary.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
