Then, you connect with\n  <code>\n   target extended-remote\n  </code>\n  in gdb, and then run the\n  <code>\n   attach <pid>\n  </code>\n  in gdb.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You could also instead use a wrapper on the debugee to not start\n  <code>\n   gdbserver\n  </code>\n  until a connection is made:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ socat tcp-l:<port>,reuseaddr,fork exec:\"gdbserver --once --attach <pid>\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Statically compiled builds of\n  <code>\n   socat\n  </code>\n  can be made by you or often found online.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
