    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have been reading through the API documentation\n  <a href=\"https://hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idapython_docs/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  and As far as I can tell there are three ways to wait for the analysis to finish.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   get_auto_state\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   auto_wait\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   auto_is_ok\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Looking at the API if get_auto_state() == AU_NONE then Analysis should be completed and if auto_is_ok() == 1 then analysis is completed. Also, from what I read auto_wait() should move forward when analysis is completed . I have tried all of these and none appear to work like I want. And I noticed that these events will be met when the IDA is pausing in part of analysis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I mean, if there is no way to accomplish this, then I would settle for a way to sort of activate the plugin when run is called normally and then have another part run from an event listener. Both of which appear to be documented poorly.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
