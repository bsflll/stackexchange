I'm trying to extract these numbers from the payload. I've narrowed the frames down to these examples below.\n </p>\n <pre><code>00-02-7B-02-9E-00-0F-3B-84-DD-30\n00-02-7C-02-A8-00-0F-3B-84-DD-30\n00-02-7C-02-A9-00-0F-3B-84-DD-30\n00-02-7B-02-A2-00-0F-3B-85-60-42\n00-02-7C-02-AD-00-0F-3B-85-1E-B9\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The 2 numbers I'm trying to extract should be a PSI/bar/other pressure value of around 50psi/339bar and the other should be between 1 and 5ish.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It looks like the values are split on the\n  <code>\n   00\n  </code>\n  in the hex.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've been using this tool\n  <a href=\"http://www.scadacore.com/field-tools/programming-calculators/online-hex-converter/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   hex to int converter\n  </a>\n  to try and split the hex up, but I can't get the values I'm expecting.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
