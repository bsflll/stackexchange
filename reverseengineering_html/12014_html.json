I still use an old IDA Pro demo in a Mac Terminal - so 'plain characters only' - , and for me it's as good as any new-fangled Windows version. Plus, it has a delightful retro 90s MS-DOS look and feel.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Not  Windbg is accessible albeit a little cumbersome to use, but I hvae used it successfully in a classroom situation. A text-based version of IDA might be exactly what I am looking for. Something that does a real good job of disassembling and/or decompiling would be helpful.all gui applications are inaccessible, in fact many of the gui programs are very accessible. Unfortunately, anything written using the QT or GTK+ development kits are for the most part inaccessible.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Courses such as\n  <a href=\"http://opensecuritytraining.info/IntroX86.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://opensecuritytraining.info/IntroX86.html\n  </a>\n  use Visual Studio for code analysis exclusively. I understand the videos for this course are not narrated well from a point of view of a blind person, but they are still useful even if you cannot see what is happening.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, Windbg is a very good debugger these days. You will be priceless if you master Windbg. Ollie is for wussies :) Immunity is essentially a few years' old version of Ollie with some plugins for exploit development.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So I suggest you to try\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_demo.shtml\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   the demo version\n  </a>\n  to see how it works with your screen reader.
