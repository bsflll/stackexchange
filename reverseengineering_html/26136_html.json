    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have been investigating some routers by desoldering their nand flash and dumping them using a flash programmer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However when I use binwalk on these dumps I end up with fragments of files mixed in with corrupted JFFS2 file systems. I have done this on 2 different routers so far. Anyone have any ideas what might be happening here?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is an example of the binwalk output on one of the dumps:\n </p>\n <pre><code>❯ binwalk NAND512W3A@TSOP48_5603.BIN\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n64084         0xFA54          JFFS2 filesystem, big endian\n227856        0x37A10         HTML document header\n227956        0x37A74         JFFS2 filesystem, big endian\n503556        0x7AF04         JFFS2 filesystem, big endian\n1970268       0x1E105C        JFFS2 filesystem, big endian\n3057708       0x2EA82C        Zlib compressed data, compressed\n3136556       0x2FDC2C        JFFS2 filesystem, big endian\n3380404       0x3394B4        JFFS2 filesystem, big endian\n3405000       0x33F4C8        JFFS2 filesystem, big endian\n4878860       0x4A720C        JFFS2 filesystem, big endian\n5263164       0x504F3C        Zlib compressed data, compressed\n5263228       0x504F7C        JFFS2 filesystem, big endian\n5555588       0x54C584        JFFS2 filesystem, big endian\n6068892       0x5C9A9C        Zlib compressed data, compressed\n6069200       0x5C9BD0        JFFS2 filesystem, big endian\n6086316       0x5CDEAC        Unix path: /var/wlansrom/bcm4331_map.bin\n6086348       0x5CDECC        JFFS2 filesystem, big endian\n6316000       0x605FE0        Zlib compressed data, compressed\n6316412       0x60617C        JFFS2 filesystem, big endian\n7022464       0x6B2780        Zlib compressed data, compressed\n-- SNIP --\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Some of the zlib compressed data does compress to fragments of actual files on the router. The HTML documents are also fragments of the router's HTML webpages but truncated The JFFS2 filesystems are all corrupted and yield nothing no matter what I try.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I would love to be able to extract the file system/s present on this thing, but I just cant see a way to do it. Any help would be very much appreciated :D\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
