It will, however, export a .1337 patch file that contains all 20.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What am I getting wrong?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In rare cases it could be that there is a bug in converting the virtual addresses to file offsets. If you think that is the case, provide the relevant binary and patch location and open an issue at\n  <a href=\"http://issues.x64dbg.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   http://issues.x64dbg.com\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
