Take the following example code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid foo() {\n    printf(\"hello world\");\n    // ignore the fact that this does not return control to the original ELF entry point\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  If I were to compile this with\n  <code>\n   gcc -fPIC -c -o hello.o\n  </code>\n  and then yank the .text section from the generated object file with\n  <code>\n   objcopy -O binary -j .text hello.o hello.bin\n  </code>\n  and try to use that as a new section, it simply won't work.\n  <code>\n   hello.bin\n  </code>\n  will contain the following instructions when inspected with\n  <code>\n   objdump\n  </code>\n  :\n </p>\n <pre><code>Disassembly of section .data:\n\n00000000 <.data>:\n   0:   55                      push   %rbp\n   1:   48 89 e5                mov    %rsp,%rbp\n   4:   48 8d 3d 00 00 00 00    lea    0x0(%rip),%rdi        # 0xb\n   b:   b8 00 00 00 00          mov    $0x0,%eax\n  10:   e8 00 00 00 00          callq  0x15\n  15:   90                      nop\n  16:   5d                      pop    %rbp\n  17:   c3                      retq\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The above code has a couple of issues. It was yanked from an object file that expects to be linked and relocated into an executable binary that will have\n  <code>\n   .plt\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   .got\n  </code>\n  sections. Through these PLT stubs it will be able to call\n  <code>\n   printf\n  </code>\n  that will be located in the standard shared library loaded by\n  <code>\n   ld\n  </code>\n  somewhere in memory.\n </p>\n <h1>\n  What I suppose it boils down to\n </h1>\n <p>\n  I want GCC to produce an entirely self-contained object file that has a\n  <code>\n   .text\n  </code>\n  section that does not expect to be relocated, already contains\n  <code>\n   libc\n  </code>\n  statically and is position independent. So that it can just be put anywhere and do its thing.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

GCC will produce an object file, but it's not going to be self-contained. This is because certain symbol types it can emit literally requre knowing the address of a segment. Your linker (ld), however, is directly responsible for performing these calculations, determining the layout, and putting segments together. You can use a linker script to get most of the way there (applying relos and an elf), but some crt's require rt linking and you'll want a static crt/libc that's more compartmentalized.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

It'll likely be far easier for your needs and for your libc (depending on which one you're using). If you really want to do it the other way, you'll need to be aware of the segment address and stripping the relocations when copying out your segments.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
