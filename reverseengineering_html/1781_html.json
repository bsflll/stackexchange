Choosing to disassemble as a Mac binary causes the start function to be discovered wrongly and hence affect the rest of the disassembly. I was reading the analysis of the malware\n  <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/crisis_the_advanced_malware.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  , and am curious about how I can go about finding the correct entry point address.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I believe it can be figured out using the\n  <code>\n   LC_UNIXTHREAD\n  </code>\n  command eip value. In this case, should my approach be to disassemble the file within IDA as a \"binary\"(rather than a mach-o binary), navigate to 0x409c and press \"C\" ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
