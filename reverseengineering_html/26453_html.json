(some other bytes that are the same for each packet)\n </p>\n <p>\n  7e =\n  <strong>\n   start framing\n  </strong>\n  (Does not change)\n </p>\n <p>\n  20 =\n  <strong>\n   length of packet\n  </strong>\n  (Does not change)\n </p>\n <p>\n  10 75 =\n  <strong>\n   packet type\n  </strong>\n  (Does not change)\n </p>\n <p>\n  00 00 00 07 =\n  <strong>\n   incremental number\n  </strong>\n  , when it reach 00 00 00 FF, the next is 00 00 01 00\nwhen checksum is failed the appliance retries with same number.\n </p>\n <p>\n  5F C7 6F 4F\n  <strong>\n   hex timestamp\n  </strong>\n  (unix timestamp converted in hexadecimal)\n </p>\n <p>\n  01\n  <strong>\n   ALTERNATING VALUE\n  </strong>\n  01 or 21 (this value alternate on each received packet)\n </p>\n <p>\n  05\n  <strong>\n   MISTERY BYTE\n  </strong>\n  , i'll explain later\n </p>\n <p>\n  C8 checksum calculated with the sum of incremental number plus hex timestamp, then mod 256 and subtracted with 0x03 when the alternating value is 21 or 0x23 when alternating value is set to 01. When the resulting value is negative you have to discard all FF FF and take the last byte.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The problem is the mistery byte.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At first glance seems to be:\n </p>\n <p>\n  When last byte of timestamp is greather than checksum, the mistery byte is: 06, else is 05.\nBut sometimes this value is \"07\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here another example:\n </p>\n <p>\n  7E 00 20 10 75 00 00 00 08 5F C7 71 73 21\n  <strong>\n   06\n  </strong>\n  0F .. .. ..\n </p>\n <p>\n  checksum calculation method:\n00 + 00 + 00  + 08 + 5F + C7 + 71 = 0x212 (decimal 530)\n </p>\n <p>\n  530 mod 256 = 18\n </p>\n <p>\n  decimal 18 to hex = 12\n </p>\n <p>\n  because the alternating value is 21, i have to subtract 0x3 -> 12 - 0x03  = checksum = 0F\n </p>\n <p>\n  now the last byte of checksum 73 is greather than 0F so the result of mistery byte seems correct to be 06\n </p>\n <p>\n  the problem comes when mistery field is sometimes 07. I think that this value is not merely a comparing with last byte of timestamp with checksum, but i missed something.\n </p>\n <p>\n  7E 00 20 10 75 00 00 00 87 5F C7 7B ED 21\n  <strong>\n   07\n  </strong>\n  12\n </p>\n <p>\n  7E 00 20 10 75 00 00 00 88 5F C7 7B FF 01\n  <strong>\n   07\n  </strong>\n  05\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here some other example that seems 06 alternate with 07:\n </p>\n <p>\n  7E 00 20 10 75 00 00 00 D0 5F C7 80 89 01\n  <strong>\n   06\n  </strong>\n  DC\n </p>\n <p>\n  7E 00 20 10 75 00 00 00 D1 5F C7 80 8F 21\n  <strong>\n   07\n  </strong>\n  03\n </p>\n <p>\n  7E 00 20 10 75 00 00 00 D2 5F C7 80 95 01\n  <strong>\n   06\n  </strong>\n  EA\n </p>\n <p>\n  7E 00 20 10 75 00 00 00 D3 5F C7 80 96 21\n  <strong>\n   07\n  </strong>\n  0C\n </p>\n <p>\n  7E 00 20 10 75 00 00 00 D4 5F C7 80 9B 01\n  <strong>\n   06\n  </strong>\n  F2\n </p>\n <p>\n  but soon there are 07 for a lot of rows\n </p>\n <p>\n  7E 00 20 10 75 00 00 00 D9 5F C7 80 A9 21\n  <strong>\n   07\n  </strong>\n  25\n </p>\n <p>\n  7E 00 20 10 75 00 00 00 DA 5F C7 80 AA 01\n  <strong>\n   07\n  </strong>\n  07\n </p>\n <p>\n  7E 00 20 10 75 00 00 00 DB 5F C7 80 AA 21\n  <strong>\n   07\n  </strong>\n  28\n </p>\n <p>\n  some examples with \"05\" mistery byte.\n </p>\n <p>\n  7E 00 20 10 75 00 00 01 09 5F C7 82 00 21\n  <strong>\n   05\n  </strong>\n  AF\n </p>\n <p>\n  7E 00 20 10 75 00 00 01 0A 5F C7 82 05 01\n  <strong>\n   05\n  </strong>\n  95\n </p>\n <p>\n  7E 00 20 10 75 00 00 01 0B 5F C7 82 26 21\n  <strong>\n   05\n  </strong>\n  D7\n </p>\n <p>\n  7E 00 20 10 75 00 00 01 0C 5F C7 82 2C 01\n  <strong>\n   05\n  </strong>\n  BE\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any clue of what this mistery byte is used for?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
