In the shellcode, I can issue the syscall for mprotect however it's not working.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Per the sys_mprotect definition, it takes the parameters as shown below:\n </p>\n <pre><code>rdi -> start_address\nrsi -> length\nrdx -> protection\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Note:\n  </strong>\n  I have corrected the parameters above. The issue is not related to the parameter sequence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  so, I'm issuing the syscall as shown below:\n </p>\n <pre><code>push 0xA\npop rax\npush 0x7\npop rdx\nmov rdi, start_address\nmov rsi, 0x1000\nsyscall\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  At the time of syscall, I verified that the registers are set properly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  start_address points to the main() subroutine inside the .text section which I want to modify.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, the syscall does not modify the protection to RWX after execution. I verified the protection by viewing segments in IDA Pro.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Per the syscall_mprotect definition, the other registers don't have to be configured specifically for this syscall. So, I am not sure why this syscall is not working?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Update:\n  </strong>\n  I modified the start_address so that it's page aligned.\n </p>\n <pre><code>start_address = start_address - (start_address % 4096)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now, syscall_mprotect does not return a negative value. It returns 0. However, the .text segment still doesn't show the writable flag.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

And in my case, the shellcode is not executing in the .text section. It is executing in another mapped region of the process. I'll check again. As I mentioned in the update of my post, if I align start address to page boundary, then mprotect returns 0x0 (success) instead of an error. However, the \"W\" flag for the .text segment is still not shown enabled in the program segments section of IDA Pro.</span>",
