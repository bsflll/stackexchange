Typically,\n  <em>\n   d\n  </em>\n  will be about the same size as\n  <em>\n   m\n  </em>\n  or slightly shorter.  (Alternatively, it's possible to instead store the primes\n  <em>\n   p\n  </em>\n  and\n  <em>\n   q\n  </em>\n  , from which, together with\n  <em>\n   e\n  </em>\n  , the modulus\n  <em>\n   m\n  </em>\n  and the private exponent\n  <em>\n   d\n  </em>\n  may be calculated.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyway, your 1024-bit number looks like it\n  <em>\n   might\n  </em>\n  be the modulus (although, if so, it certainly shouldn't have any small factors).  Are you sure there isn't\n  <em>\n   another\n  </em>\n  number stored in the hardware that could be the private exponent?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, are you sure the device is actually doing RSA encryption, and not, say,\n  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28algorithm%29#Signing_messages\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   RSA signing\n  </a>\n  , which looks superficially like \"encrypting with the private key\" (although the the details of the padding schemes needed to make the two operations secure differ considerably)?\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Edit:\n  </strong>\n  My French is kind of rusty, but based on the extra information you've given and what I could gather from the Vigik site at a glance, it looks like what they're doing is\n  <em>\n   probably\n  </em>\n  something like this:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    The charging service holds the private key, while the access control device has the corresponding public key.  The card probably doesn't hold either key, and may or may not actually do any crypto at all.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    When the card is charged, the charging service creates a message stating that this particular card is authorized access to particular locations until a particular time.  It then signs this message using the private key and sends the signed message to the card.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    When the card is used to request access, it transmits the signed message to the access control device, which verifies that the authorization is valid for the location, has not expired, and that the signature is correct.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  At least, this is more or less how\n  <em>\n   I\n  </em>\n  would design a system like this.  One advantage of this design is that neither the card nor the access control device need to know the private key, so it cannot be compromised even if either of them is stolen and analyzed.  (The charging service does need the private key, but presumably it can be secured better than the cards and access control devices, possibly even by doing the actual signing on a remote server.)  It also doesn't require the card itself to do any crypto, which makes them much easier and cheaper to implement.\n </p>\n <p>\n  (Actually, though, if I\n  <em>\n   were\n  </em>\n  designing such a system and had a card that\n  <em>\n   could\n  </em>\n  do RSA signing, I'd also give each card its own private key, include the corresponding public key in the authorization message, and have the access control device request a zero-knowledge proof that the card really knows the private key it claims to have.  This would make the cards truly uncloneable, even temporarily, without some serious reverse engineering effort to extract the key.)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So in theory, if I have the public key (from the access control unit) - and the the 1024bit signature on the card, I should, in theory, be able to verify the card signature w/ the public key - which would prove your theory? In this case, I guess it all comes full circle - how would I go about doing that exactly? Thanks again.</span>",

The public exponent might be hardcoded into the RSA implementation; if you can't find something that looks like one, I'd suggest just trying the most common values (65537 = 0x10001 and 3). You'll also need to figure out how the modulus is encoded; it could be big- or little-endian or some funny mixed-endian format, or it might be something like BER. You can check by trying to factor it -- a valid RSA modulus should not have any small factors.</span>",
