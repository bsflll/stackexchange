Now the issue is that I need to load my newly created DLL before anything else which means using a different method other than simply injecting it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I hope this makes sense, what would be the best method to achieve this?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

One method of injecting a DLL is to create a process yourself, which means you typically have all required rights to do whatever you like with it. Combine that with starting said process suspended and you have a recipe for injecting DLLs before the main entry point of the executable gets to run ... what am I missing? (duh, only saw the answer after I commented ... that answer embodies all I described)\n</span>\n</body></html>",
