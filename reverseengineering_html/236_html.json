I know that this website is built with a CMS. How can I get to know which CMS was used?\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I'm looking for basic, general typicals of common CMSs, so that we can get to know the working power behind any informational website or blog.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, a typical might be that WordPress adds such a line to the HTML:\n </p>\n <pre><code><meta name=\"generator\" content=\"WordPress 3.5.1\" />\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
