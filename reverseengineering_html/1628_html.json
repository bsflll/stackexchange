The first would be to use a network packet analyzer on the actual client running the application. Some well known packet analyzers are\n  <a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">\n   Wireshark\n  </a>\n  ,\n  <a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org/\">\n   tcpdump\n  </a>\n  , and even\n  <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4865\">\n   Microsoft Network Monitor\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another alternative would be to intercept the traffic via man-in-the-middle (M. The easiest way to do this (if you control the client) is to turn your Linux based laptop into a wireless access point, and intercept the client's traffic, analyze it, and route it to the internet. This will require 2 network cards, at least one of them being a wireless card.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's a tutorial to get you started on performing a mitm attack in this manner:\n  <a href=\"http://www.backtrack-linux.org/forums/showthread.php?t=1939\">\n   http://www.backtrack-linux.org/forums/showthread.php?t=1939\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or\n  <a href=\"http://mitmproxy.org/\">\n   mitmproxy\n  </a>\n  is another great tool to accomplish this (and they support SSL), and have lots of examples on their website.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
