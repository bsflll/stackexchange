    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I recently work on Tricore Processor, but I have some problems.\nWith reading memory value. I do not know if I am right or not, but I think a part of flash memory copied to RAM and now in my algorithm used of RAM cell.\nI have shown Code in below:\n </p>\n <pre><code>ld32.a          a15, [a0]-0x7BA4 ; a0 = 0xD00032E0\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  As you see, a15 is an address that point to a constant value(store in RAM or FLASH) and\n  <code>\n   a0\n  </code>\n  is the base address of RAM memory. To calculate\n  <code>\n   a15\n  </code>\n  , I subtract\n  <code>\n   a0\n  </code>\n  from\n  <code>\n   0x7BA4\n  </code>\n  but the result is 0xCFFFB73C. This Address is not a valid address of RAM.\n  \n\n  <strong>\n   EDITED:\n  </strong>\n  \n\n  I saw a freaky sentence in Tricore document.(I have shown in below)\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/dKIMH.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/dKIMH.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n  \n\n  As you see,\n  <code>\n   A[0]\n  </code>\n  can be protected by user application.\n  \n\n  <strong>\n   Could it be protected in this case as well?\n  </strong>\n  \n\n  <strong>\n   What is my wrong? What should I do? How can I get the correct value of\n   <code>\n    a15\n   </code>\n   ?\n  </strong>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Try to look for references to C4000000 or C8000000, or other occurrences of\n  <code>\n   -0x7BA4\n  </code>\n  - maybe you’ll find the place where the variable is written to.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pulFC.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Scratchpad RAM memory map\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pulFC.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
