    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  According to Radare2 documentation, this is the command to find paths:\n </p>\n <pre><code>agt [addr]            find paths from current offset to given address\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But when I try the command, after running\n  <code>\n   aaaaa\n  </code>\n  analysis, I get the following error:\n </p>\n <pre><code>[0x00430044]> agt 0x0042aa98 > agtoutput.dot\nUnable to find source or destination basic block\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I can confirm that the two addresses are functions and I can graph each function individually.  Also,\n  <code>\n   0x00430044\n  </code>\n  does lead to\n  <code>\n   0x0042aa98\n  </code>\n  . I can see that from the gdb trace.  I looked at the\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/radare/radare2/blob/master/libr/core/canal.c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   radare2 canal.c code\n  </a>\n  and found that it's looking through the\n  <code>\n   RAnalFunction->bbs\n  </code>\n  for the provided addresses. I tried ensuring that bbs was populated with those addressings by running\n  <code>\n   abb $s\n  </code>\n </p>\n <pre><code>abb [length]         analyze N bytes and extract basic blocks \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and feeding the output back into r2.  I ran\n  <code>\n   abb $s\n  </code>\n  from various locations to see if it would add the basic blocks to the bbs list. The various locations were\n  <code>\n   0x0\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   0x00430044\n  </code>\n  , and\n  <code>\n   0x0042aa98\n  </code>\n  .  But nothing worked, I always get the \"Unable to find source or destination basic block\" error message.  I could be way off and going down rabbit holes, but the \"find paths\" feature would be so useful, and I'd really like to get it working? Any help on using the\n  <code>\n   agt\n  </code>\n  feature as documented would be appreciated.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I looked through the code (canal.c) and found a \"bug\" which would make the agt call never work.  I fixed the bug locally, so I got past the initial error, but the \"r_core_anal_graph_to\" function then basically returns no results.  So sad :-(, this would be a great feature.  Not sure why this option is in the help menu since it doesn't seem to work at all.  Unless, I'm missing something.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
