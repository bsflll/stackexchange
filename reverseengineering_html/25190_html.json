    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm reverse-engineering some code I wrote in the middle-90s for which the source is long-lost and I'm a bit baffled by some VGA code I've encountered. I think it's\n  <em>\n   probably\n  </em>\n  from library or 3rd party code as I was just learning computers then and, while I did include some assembly to interact with VGA, it wasn't this informed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If it's helpful, the app is a 16-bit DOS real-mode exe and the original source was compiled by the Turbo Pascal compiler (either version 6 or 7).\n </p>\n <pre><code>    ; function boilerplate\n    push bp\n    mov  bp,sp\n    call 0EE2:0530  ; stack bounds check function\n\n    ; probe vga port 03CCh\n    sub  sp,0002    ; why?\n    mov  dx,03CC\n    in   al,dx\n    and  al,0C      ; mask bits 3 & 2\n    cmp  al,04      ; al == 00000100b\n    mov  al,00      ; pre return value\n    jne  jump_label ; return 0\n    inc  ax         ; return 1\njump_label:\n    ; store return value in [bp-01] as well, for.. reasons.\n    mov  [bp-01],al\n    mov  al,[bp-01]\n\n    ; function boilerplate    \n    mov  sp,bp\n    pop  bp\n    retf 0004 ; instance pointer?\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So the question is, what is the intent here? Two parts are confusing to me:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   First\n  </strong>\n  , bits 2 and 3 denote\n  <em>\n   clock select\n  </em>\n  according to the VGA docs I've read, but those docs are light on information about what that means when bit 3 is involved. For example,\n  <a href=\"http://www.osdever.net/FreeVGA/vga/extreg.htm#3CCR3C2W\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   http://www.osdever.net/FreeVGA/vga/extreg.htm#3CCR3C2W\n  </a>\n  declares the two values with the bit 3 set as\n  <em>\n   undefined\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  This function seems to return 0 when bit 3 is set and bit 2 isn't. But, why? What is it trying to determine about the hardware?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Second\n  </strong>\n  , and this is an aside, but what is the intent of\n  <code>\n   mov [bp-01],al\n  </code>\n  followed by\n  <code>\n   mov al,[bp-01]\n  </code>\n  ? This seems redundant!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

                    "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">Ah yes, you're right. This function returns 1 only when the clock select bits are 01 (thus 28MHz or 360/720 width). It makes sense, if the bits were 11 then that would not be true so bit 3 must be preserved. I bet it's testing for the 9-pixel-wide-char VGA mode. Thank you!</span>",
