However, if you're willing to implement a minimal windbg backend, you could extend\n  <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/uberstealth\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   uberstealth\n  </a>\n  , which unfortunately I've never come to finish as a project (actually I think anti-debugging is a dead anyway, but that's another story ;-)).\nIt's essentially IDAStealth, but with all debugger specific functionality factored out (there's a backend for IDA and Olly2). All you'd have to do is write a backend for Windbg (and fix the remaining bugs, I could help you with that though), all other code is debugger independent.\nShould be less than a few dozen lines of code.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Anyway, see my \"Ultimate\" Anti-Debugging Reference (pferrie.host22.com/papers/unp2011.htm) for a long list of tricks that you'd need to support (and some that you can't because they are direct kernel-returned data).</span>",
