    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I just started working my way to reversing Windows binaries and I stumbled upon the Import Address Table. When reversing a particular DLL I encountered many thunk-functions which all supposedly referenced the IAT.\nFrom my experience on Linux I guessed that this is somewhat similar to the procedure linkage table (or rather the global offset table I suppose).\nBased on that I would assume that the linking process is similar, though I cannot seem to find detailed information on that. Any help would be appreciated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Furthermore I was wondering whether you could resolve these thunks without ever running the binary. In particular because it is in fact a DLL that I am analyzing the information to resolve these should be available already?\nThough I cannot really make sense out of the information available.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Just to be sure I am not completely off, here is an example of what I am talking about:\n </p>\n <pre><code>void THUNK_FUN_18002d97a(void)\n\n{\n  (*_DAT_18005ba68)();\n  return;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Memory at the address (in section\n  <code>\n   .data\n  </code>\n  ):\n </p>\n <pre><code>0x18005ba68: 94 00 00 06 00 00 00 00\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Edit:\nThanks for the input. I now feel like I misunderstood the purpose of the IAT. So consider the following scenario:\nWe have a PE executable A which imports symbols from a DLL B.\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   The\n   <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#import-directory-table\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    import directory table\n   </a>\n   is used in A, whereas in B a corresponding entry has to be found in the\n   <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#export-directory-table\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    export directory table\n   </a>\n   . Is that correct?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   In the DLL (B) I am investigating the thunks mentioned are neither imported nor exported symbols. So what may I be witnessing?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The overall process must be looking something like this:\n   <ol>\n    <li>\n     A is executed. All needed DLLs are searched and linked (this is called binding in this context?)\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     This causes B to be actually loaded at some address. Now symbols from B in A can be resolved (using the import directory table). Is B necessarily position independent? I read about preferred base addresses and conditional re-location of the whole binary if it cannot be matched. Is this still correct?\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     I still do not see a point why the second layer jump table I encountered is needed.\n    </li>\n   </ol>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

There is no dynamic resolver invoked on the first call but all import pointers are resolved at the process startup ahead of time (similar to\n  <code>\n   LD_BIND_NOW\n  </code>\n  ). The pointers are grouped in a GOT-like Import Address Table (IAT) and the metadata with the details about the DLLs and symbols imported is stored in the Import Directory which is referred to by the PE header.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To recover the symbols you need to parse the import directory.
