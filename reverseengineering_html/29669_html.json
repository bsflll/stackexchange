Although it's reasonably well-designed once you understand how to use it, there is likely to be a lot of difficulty in your near future. You probably want to start by ignoring the part of the header that your question asks about, and instead look at the class\n  <code>\n   tinfo_t\n  </code>\n  , which is the primary data structure that IDA uses to represent types. From there, look at its member functions. For example, here are a number of member functions:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    bool tinfo_t::is_ptr()\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    bool tinfo_t::is_array()\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    bool tinfo_t::is_func()\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    bool tinfo_t::is_complex()\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    bool tinfo_t::is_struct()\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    bool tinfo_t::is_union()\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    bool tinfo_t::is_udt()\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    bool tinfo_t::is_enum()\n   </code>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  That should get you started. Good luck! You'll need it!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

                    "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">I can't fully answer this, unfortunately. <code>tinfo_t</code> has a notion of a \"declared type\" (<code>decltype</code>) and a \"real type\" <code>realtype</code>). The <code>tinfo_t</code> holds the <code>decltype</code> inside of it, so doing things with it is very fast. As for the <code>realtype</code>, operations have to ask IDA about it, which is slower. Speed aside, the difference has something to do with <code>typedefs</code>, \"type references\", and \"ordinals\". For example, the declared type of a <code>typedef</code> is <code>BTF_TYPEDEF</code>, but if you want information about the type that the <code>typedef</code> refers to, you'll need to use the <code>realtype</code> functions. Sorry my answer is bad!</span>",
