    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I try to use a simple hook on different memory allocation functions in Immunity. But the hook doesn't react at all (no logging).\n </p>\n <p>\n  First of all my hook class:\n </p>\n <pre><code>class AllocHook(LogBpHook):\n    def __init__(self):\n        LogBpHook.__init__(self)\n\n    def run(self, regs):\n        imm = immlib.Debugger()\n        imm.log(\"     ++++++++++++++++++ HOOOKED\")\n        imm.log(str(regs))\n        imm.log(\"     ++++++++++++++++++ HOOOKED\")\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The function to init and add the hook.\n </p>\n <pre><code>def hookAlloc(imm):\n    global vAllocHo\n    # Retrieve address of Allocs\n    # Create hook object and add hook\n    va1 = imm.getAddress(\"kernel32.LocalAlloc\")\n    vAllocHo = AllocHook()\n    vAllocHo.add(\"va alloc\",va1)\n    vAllocHo.enable()\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So the\n  <code>\n   log\n  </code>\n  appears in the breakpoint window, but the\n  <code>\n   run()\n  </code>\n  function actually never gets called.\n </p>\n <pre><code>Breakpoints, item 26\nAddress=76C91668 kernel32.LocalAlloc\nModule=kernel32\nActive=Log\nDisassembly=MOV EDI,EDI\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The log messages of the breakpoints are at least disappearing when the hook is activated. For example, after activating the hook, the following logging messages are not displayed anymore:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Log data, item 40\nAddress=76C91668 \nMessage=[19:12:51] Breakpoint at kernel32.LocalAlloc\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Are there special settings in the options left, which I have to consider first?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
