In order to reach the process-defined routine, you need to set a breakpoint on NTDLL.NtQueryInformationProcess(), and check for these parameters on the stack: -1, 7, a pointer, 4, 0.  When you see it, you can step over the function, change the return value to -1, and resume execution.  Then the filter function will be called.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
