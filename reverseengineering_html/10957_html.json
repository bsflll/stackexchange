Maybe I'm asking the wrong question.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, supposing I have a DLL that change base VA among different execution because of ASLR, in windows I can set DLLCharacteristic to make sure is loaded every time at the same address (losing eventually the signature). But what for generic code?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Suppose that a program allocate a buffer, copy some data, decrypt it then run it. In IDA, of course I can take a snapshot of memory, analyze it, put label and so on, but if I run the program the second time chances are the address are changed, so I can't benefit of my previous analysis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way map an arbiratry address with a previous analyzed section in the database?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
