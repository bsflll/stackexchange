But according to HexRay's command line switches for IDA Pro, there is supposed to be an .exe for command line interface. I'm not sure if it's just because I am using the free version.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Some of the switches (like\n  <code>\n   -A\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   -T\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   -L\n  </code>\n  ) also work, but for example\n  <code>\n   -B\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   -S\n  </code>\n  are disabled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you want the text-mode\n  <code>\n   idat\n  </code>\n  executable, you need the full version (Pro or Starter).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
