However, when loading this binary to IDA, I get an error says:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <pre><code>Binary data is incorrect, maximum possible value is xxxxxx\n</code></pre>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  I tried to do the same thing by pulling this modem.b* from the device itself. The same behavior.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I opened up this binary into 010 Editor and check the section size, and it seems like the sections have a size bigger than the binary size.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How could I fix the binary? Assuming that the first sections are valid, could I use that information to calculate the further section sizes?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
