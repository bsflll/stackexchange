    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm going through through Challenge 3 (Task 4) of Basic Malware RE:\n  <a href=\"https://tryhackme.com/room/basicmalwarere\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://tryhackme.com/room/basicmalwarere\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  And in Ghidra after I do analysis, I can view the .rsrc area and it shows me all the strings laid out nicely with their uID's right next to them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In IDA, the closest thing I've gotten is going to the Strings menu -> right click -> Setup and checking\n  <code>\n   C-Style\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   Unicode C-Style (16 bits)\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   C-Style (32 bits)\n  </code>\n  . After that, I start to see some of the strings show up in the strings menu (whereas before I didn't see any strings from the resource side), but they don't look anywhere near as nice to search through, and I can't seem to find any references to the\n  <code>\n   uID\n  </code>\n  property as seen in Ghidra. (and referenced in the MSDN docs here:\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-loadstringa?redirectedfrom=MSDN\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-loadstringa?redirectedfrom=MSDN\n  </a>\n  )\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've read online at various places, like here:\n  <a href=\"https://medium.com/@obikag/tryhackme-basic-malware-re-room-writeup-8183730100b2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://medium.com/@obikag/tryhackme-basic-malware-re-room-writeup-8183730100b2\n  </a>\n  that you'd usually use something like Resource Hacker to load\n  <code>\n   user32.dll\n  </code>\n  and view the memory that way, however I'm on MacOS and can't run Resource Hacker.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am wondering if there's any way to view these resource String ID's in IDA like I can in Ghidra.
