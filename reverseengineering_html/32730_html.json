How we can read truncated file? i.e. file opened with O_TRUNC flag? If file is truncated, it has set zero data. What we read- zero data? And moreover this file we open - hmidrv.386 - it is music driver to play sound. It driver plays sound in this app, it is needed to reproduce sound in this app, why need truncate this file?</span>",

Early versions of Windows use *.386 files for this purpose. If this is the case then the truncate flag has no effect, but should there be a regular file by that name it will be truncated. It may have been added by a compiler: calling <code>fopen</code> with \"w\" mode implies <code>O_TRUNC</code> on the underlying <code>open</code> call</span>",
