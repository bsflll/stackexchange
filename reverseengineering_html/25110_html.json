    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am trying to reverse engineer my routers firmware. So as the first step I took uart pins and I could login to the router through serial console. I need to export the binary files to my host system. My host PC is running ubuntu. I have tried SSH login but I am not able to login as the username and password is unknown. Also username and password is required for SCP too. So how can I copy files to host? Please suggest any method. How should I approach this situation?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
