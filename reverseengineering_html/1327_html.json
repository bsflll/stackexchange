I'd like to add PDB support to\n  <a href=\"http://www.hopperapp.com/\">\n   Hopper\n  </a>\n  using\n  <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/pdbparse/\">\n   pdbparse\n  </a>\n  , but I haven't been able to get it to use external libraries.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Alternatively, I suppose one could just dump the debug symbol offsets to a text file and read that, but it seems like a clunkier solution (since you wouldn't be able to, e.g., auto-download symbols from the MS Symbol Server).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
