Nevertheless, I believe that anti-debugging is responsible for the constant crashing of the program whenever the breakpoint is hit but I am not sure.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have tried to use other debugging tools but still the same trouble I am getting. So I believe whatever is going on is specific to the way the program is working. So any ideas as to what is responsible for this and how do I go around it\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
