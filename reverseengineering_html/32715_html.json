I'm quite familiar with the ELF format, and so I made a simple ELF parser just to try something else, but obviously it wasn't able to find the symbol either.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So now I just want to understand how IDA can get this symbol when it appears isn't contained in the binary. The only thing I can think of is that maybe IDA sees through other symbols the class this method belongs to and also the types of the arguments it receives, and thus can guess the symbol.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
