Similar problems are bound to crop up more and more, with the new crop of compilers which create huge binaries bloated by excessive inlining and unrolling. One side effect - compounded by global register allocation and optimisation (LTCG) - is that such binaries can become near unFLIRTable with IDA's current technology. That increases our analysis workload and makes removal of noise even more important.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
