    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've been trying to reverse engineer a paid android app that writes out some binary data so that I can export that data into other programs (it's a run/walk timer app, if anyone's curious, and I'm trying to get its GPS traces out). However, it looks like the apk is encrypted and stored in\n  <code>\n   /data/app-asec/[app_id].asec\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  There's a nice\n  <a href=\"http://nelenkov.blogspot.com/2012/07/using-app-encryption-in-jelly-bean.html\">\n   blog post\n  </a>\n  that says the encryption used is TwoFish, with a key stored in\n  <code>\n   /data/misc/systemkeys/AppsOnSD.sks\n  </code>\n  , but I haven't been able to decrypt the file using the na√Øve strategy of just using that key directly with TwoFish on the\n  <code>\n   .asec\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  How can I decrypt this to get an apk I can actually analyze?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note: I realize that this information is considered somewhat delicate in places like xda-developers, since it could be used to enable piracy. I have no such intentions, I just want to examine the serialization code.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
