It should be far more focused, at the very least restricted to a particular topic and preferably to a particular compiler or platform (e.g. stack manipulations in Visual C++). Because there has already been\n <a href=\"http://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/111\">\n  one answer\n </a>\n , I've proposed an edit that focuses on that answer's topic: register manipulations.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
