I don't think that it's related to the heap in any way. It looks like the pointer address that is resolved by\n  <code>\n   ptr [rcx+200h]\n  </code>\n  is in fact points to\n  <code>\n   0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\n  </code>\n  address, and when trying to access this memory, the application crashes, because this page is not allocated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In order to investigate the issue, try to understand what is the origin of the bad\n  <code>\n   ecx\n  </code>\n  register value that is used at\n  <code>\n   00007FF9ED373847\n  </code>\n  - just follow in the disassembly where is it defined, and what goes wrong in your specific scenario - for example, maybe it's origin a function call, that returned an error, but the return value wasn't checked against error codes.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
