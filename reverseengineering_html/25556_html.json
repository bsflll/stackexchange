    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  So i've been trying to write a pintool that monitors call/ret instructions but i've noticed that threre was a significant inconsistency between the two. For example ret instructions without previous call.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've run the tool in a console application from which a number of inconsistencies can be observed. Below are the first 3 log entries showing this inconsistency:\n </p>\n <pre><code>1. Call from ntdll!LdrpCallInitRoutine+0x69, expected to return to 7ff88f00502a\n2. RETURN to 7ff88f00502a\n//call from ntdll!LdrpInitializeNode+0x1ac which is supposed to return at 7ff88f049385 is missing (the previous instruction)\n3. RETURN to 7ff88f049385 (ntdll!LdrpInitializeNode+0x1b1)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The above are the first 3 log entries for the call/ret instructions. As one can see, the monitoring appears to start a bit late, at the call found at\n  <code>\n   ntdll!LdrpCallInitRoutine+0x69\n  </code>\n  , after which it returned to the expected address but then returned to 7ff88f049385 without first tracking the call found in the previous instruction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any ideas of what could be the fault?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The program is traced with\n  <code>\n   INS_AddInstrumentFunction\n  </code>\n  with a callback that more or less does:\n </p>\n <pre><code>if INS_IsCall(ins) INS_InsertCall(ins,...\nif INS_IsRet(ins) INS_InsertCall(ins,...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I've tried the same program on Linux which worked as expected, without any mismatch.\nAny ideas of the reason behind this behavior?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

For example, for some of those \"inconsistencies\" i have checked, there was always a call instruction before the return address, which makes me believe that they are actually called.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
