    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I hope this is permitted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Back story: As a video professional I paid for many expensive licenses years ago for some specific Video encoding software. Sadly, the company abandoned the software and in fact later made it open source and also had a free version for the public. In my humble opinion the original 'paid for' version had distinct advantages over the free version. The workflow was better and I perceive it was more stable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In any case I believe the paid for version was protected by Armadillo software which is now also abandoned. So I have a dilemma here. I invested a lot of money on licenses - thousands of dollars and I have only one last computer that is licensed and that will die eventually but I still love the software.\nWith no way to authorize any new computers going forward is there a legit way to authorise this software? Original software division of the company is now defunct.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I hope that some clever people may help me in my trouble. Happy to offer something for anyone's time as well if successful.\nMany thanks for any responses\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
