All i got are ads traffics.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have ensure that I have enabled proxy on Android system, have certificate installed, filtered target process and check if https decryption is working. All fine. I have reseted cert and fiddler 2 but it doesn't help\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have heard it uses socket system, i don't know excatly what he meant.\nThis online game requests a lot of data. I checked logcat and i see that the game retrieved some json data but there is not enough infomation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm missing something there?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/phWHj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/phWHj.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
