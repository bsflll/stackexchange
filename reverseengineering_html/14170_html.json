I believe the 11 or so crackmes included in the challenges.zip file are similar to the IOLI crackme files, for which there are many tutorials available.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of the binaries in the bombs.zip file is called \"cmubomb\" which is Carnegie Mellon University's binary bomb,\n  <strike>\n   also available at their student lab site\n   <a href=\"http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/2e/labs.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/2e/labs.html\n   </a>\n   ,\n  </strike>\n  for which there are also many tutorials across the web.\n </p>\n <p>\n  NYU also has some reverse engineering \"challenge applications\" to analyze at\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/isislab/Hack-Night#workshop-materials-5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/isislab/Hack-Night#workshop-materials-5\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note: The binaries from the aforementioned sources are Linux ELF 32-bit executables. Almost all are unstripped. If you would like to analyze Windows binaries, you can get Win32 versions of the IOLI crackmes from\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/radare/radare2book/tree/master/crackmes/ioli\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/radare/radare2book/tree/master/crackmes/ioli\n  </a>\n  . The IOLI-crackme.tar.gz file available for download there contains 10 Windows PE32 executable files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Update: The CMU labs, including the binary bomb, now require an Instructor account to download.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
