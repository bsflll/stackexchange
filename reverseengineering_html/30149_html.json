From my understanding this is something akin to PDB. While IDA loads it automatically, it fails to process it.

It also gives you the two options to explicitly run the analysis nonetheless:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Running the Auto Analysis Step with custom configuration\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Running a separate script.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  The first option specifically means:\nIn the CodeBrowser view of the specific binary, click\n  <code>\n   Analysis\n  </code>\n  in the top bar, then\n  <code>\n   Auto Analyze '$binaryname'\n  </code>\n  . In the resulting list of analyzers scroll down to DWARF which should then look like this screenshot\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GogSI.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GogSI.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  change the\n  <code>\n   2000000\n  </code>\n  highlighted to anything higher than\n  <code>\n   2018267\n  </code>\n  , hit analyze, and Ghidra should now rerun the auto analysis but properly import the DWARF information and not skip it like before.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
