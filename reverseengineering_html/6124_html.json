    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am currently battling this protection on an 32-bit executable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At some point during it's runtime, the protection gets the address of\n  <code>\n   DbgUiRemoteBreakin\n  </code>\n  and writes a\n  <code>\n   JMP\n  </code>\n  to\n  <code>\n   ExitProcess\n  </code>\n  as an anti-attach technique. I decided to place a memory breakpoint on write(I also tried access) on that location figuring at the very least I'd find out what piece of code alters the code. Upon setting the breakpoint I hit\n  <kbd>\n   F9\n  </kbd>\n  only for my memory bp to never be triggered, I tried multiple times. The code was altered, but my memory bp was not triggered. This is the first time that a memory breakpoint was not triggered for me. I am puzzled as to why this has happened. My only guess is that\n  <code>\n   DbgUiRemoteBreakin\n  </code>\n  is located in\n  <em>\n   ntdll.dll\n  </em>\n  and that is why guard pages don't work there.\nThere were also instances where I had a crash when I set a memory bp on that function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However I am hoping somebody has encountered this and can explain more in depth. My ollydbg version is 1.10.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you have a Mac or Linux machine you could also try Hopper disassembler; very user friendly and powerful. By the way, have you tried setting a hardware rather than software BP?\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Try using the hardware break-on-write instead.  If that doesn't work, then it's because the protected file removed it.</span>",
