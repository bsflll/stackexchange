    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have an android application that uses a shared library which I would like to step through with a debugger.  I've had success using IDA 6.3 to debug executables with the\n  <code>\n   android_server\n  </code>\n  debug server included with IDA but haven't gotten it to work with shared objects yet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a specific example, suppose I have the following Java code (This comes from the hellojni example in the Android NDK):\n </p>\n <pre><code>System.loadLibrary(\"hello-jni\");\ntv.setText( stringFromJNI() );\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  With the JNI C code as:\n </p>\n <pre><code>jstring\nJava_com_example_hellojni_HelloJni_stringFromJNI( JNIEnv* env, jobject thiz )\n{\n        return (*env)->NewStringUTF(env, \"Hello from JNI !\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  If the java code is run only when the application starts up, how can I break in the function\n  <code>\n   Java_com_example_hellojni_HelloJni_stringFromJNI\n  </code>\n  ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
