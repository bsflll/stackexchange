So, you could install IDA Pro in a Virtualized Environment such as VMWare Work Station and load the binary in IDA Pro.\n </p>\n <p>\n  IDA Pro by default will only perform disassembly of the binary. It means, static analysis or in other words, the code of the binary won't be executed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, there are several scenarios to consider while analyzing malicious binaries with IDA Pro:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    The binary could exploit an unknown vulnerability in IDA Pro in such a way that when it is loaded by IDA Pro, the malicious code can execute. I haven't seen such a vulnerability yet however we must consider it while analyzing malicious binaries.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    If you are using IDA Pro for debugging the binary, then it means the code will execute and so you should perform the analysis in a virtualized environment.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
