If you have a supported (purchased or renewed within the last year) version of IDA Pro, then you can purchase one of the ARM decompiler plugins.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have not tried the following, but have heard of them (so add a comment about how well it works if you do try one!)...\n </p>\n <p>\n  There's the opensource\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/yegord/snowman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   snowman decompiler\n  </a>\n  .  It has been around for a few years now.  Its website says it supports ARM and is available for radare2, x64dbg, multiple versions of IDA Pro, and as a standalone application.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another opensource one is\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   RetDec\n  </a>\n  .  Looks like it was just released late last year, but is from a well regarded AV company (Avast) and supposedly has been in development and use privately for several years.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've also heard of the commercial\n  <a href=\"https://www.hopperapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Hopper\n  </a>\n  product, which specializes in macOS executables, but not sure how good the built-in decompiler is.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
