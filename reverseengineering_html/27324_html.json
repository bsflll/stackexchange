No malicious intentions, just wanted to do it work and use it once.\nI used \"nop\" as temporally asm code to inject, so I will sure that I do something wrong in my inject method and not in asm code I'm trying to inject. To my surprise is the single \"nop\" been the reason the game crashed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My question is why? How can I break something by doing nothing?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then after \"nop\" I added \"ret\" as Google said me.\nand game didn't crash, tried this on function I was tried to call and also worked fine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Injector code(c#):\n </p>\n <pre><code>        [DllImport(\"kernel32.dll\", EntryPoint = \"CloseHandle\")]\n        public static extern int CloseHandle(int hObject);\n\n        [DllImport(\"kernel32.dll\")]\n        public static extern Int32 WriteProcessMemory(int hProcess, int lpBaseAddress, byte[] buffer, int size, int lpNumberOfBytesWritten);\n\n\n        [DllImport(\"kernel32\", EntryPoint = \"CreateRemoteThread\")]\n        public static extern int CreateRemoteThread(int hProcess, int lpThreadAttributes, int dwStackSize, int lpStartAddress, int lpParameter, int dwCreationFlags, ref int lpThreadId);\n\n\n        [DllImport(\"kernel32\", EntryPoint = \"WaitForSingleObject\")]\n        public static extern int WaitForSingleObject(int hHandle, int dwMilliseconds);\n\n\n        [DllImport(\"Kernel32.dll\")]\n        public static extern System.Int32 VirtualAllocEx(int hProcess, int lpAddress, int dwSize, int flAllocationType, int flProtect);\n\n        [DllImport(\"Kernel32.dll\")]\n        public static extern System.Int32 VirtualFreeEx(int hProcess, int lpAddress, int dwSize, int flAllocationType);\n\n        [DllImport(\"kernel32.dll\", EntryPoint = \"OpenProcess\")]\n        public static extern int OpenProcess(int dwDesiredAccess, int bInheritHandle, int dwProcessId);\n\n        private const int PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE = 0x4;\n        private const int MEM_COMMIT = 4096;\n        private const int MEM_RELEASE = 0x8000;\n        private const int MEM_DECOMMIT = 0x4000;\n        private const int PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS = 0x1f0fff;\n        private const int PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD = 0x2;\n        private const int PROCESS_VM_OPERATION = 0x8;\n        private const int PROCESS_VM_WRITE = 0x20;\n\n\n        public void Inject(byte[] data,int pid)\n        {\n            int hwnd = 0;\n            int addre = 0;\n            int threadhwnd = 0;\n            if (pid != 0)\n            {\n                hwnd = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS | PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD | PROCESS_VM_WRITE, 0, pid);\n                if (hwnd != 0)\n                {\n                    addre = VirtualAllocEx(hwnd, 0, data.Length, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);\n                    WriteProcessMemory(hwnd, addre, data, data.Length, 0);\n                    int threadid = 0;\n                    threadhwnd = CreateRemoteThread(hwnd, 0, 0, addre, 0, 0, ref threadid);\n                    int res = WaitForSingleObject(threadhwnd,3000);\n                    VirtualFreeEx(hwnd, addre, data.Length, MEM_RELEASE);\n                    CloseHandle(threadhwnd);\n                    CloseHandle(hwnd);\n\n                }\n            }\n        }\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Thank you in advance!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The function must exist in the remote process. For more information, see ThreadProc.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  So as you see your parameter\n  <code>\n   addre\n  </code>\n  has to point to some function in remote process. Functions in assembly (\n  <code>\n   x86/x64\n  </code>\n  ) look like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>FUNCTION_NAME:\nFUNCTION_BODY\nret\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And you call them like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>call FUNCTION_NAME\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The\n  <code>\n   ret\n  </code>\n  instruction in the end takes the return address from the stack, which was saved by the call instruction, when\n  <code>\n   call FUNCTION_NAME\n  </code>\n  was executed - it points to the next instruction after that\n  <code>\n   call\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  But what happens when you inject only\n  <code>\n   nop\n  </code>\n  ? Since you didn't inject\n  <code>\n   ret\n  </code>\n  , your injected function looks like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>INJECTED_FUNCTION:\nnop\nSOME_GARBAGE_BYTES\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  As you see, the program you inject the code into will try to execute the instruction just after\n  <code>\n   nop\n  </code>\n  (since it didn't encounter\n  <code>\n   ret\n  </code>\n  ), which may be either some garbage bytes or may even lie outside process virtual memory and may cause access violation - in both cases the program will crash.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
