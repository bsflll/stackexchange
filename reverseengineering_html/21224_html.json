Given that I've a full range of elements to monitor I was trying to find a way to programmatically add such breakpoints.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To achieve a similar result I've used to instrument the\n  <code>\n   setAttribute()\n  </code>\n  function of such DOM elements replacing it with a wrapper that uses the\n  <code>\n   debugger;\n  </code>\n  instruction to trigger the debugger. Anyway this approach fails when dealing with innerHTML or innerText assignments given that there is no way of achieving operator overloading in js.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can someone suggest me a practical solution?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
