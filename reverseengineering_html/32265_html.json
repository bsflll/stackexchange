    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am a person interested of old games (MS DOS and 16 bit Windows only) and programming. In 2020, I saw an article about hacking SkiFree somewhere on the internet and soon as I followed the instructions, it was so easy that I made many games with changed graphics and added sound effects (the later 32 bit executable has a hidden ability to do so). Later I tried to go to different lengths after being impressed with my previous stuff mentioned above. Like adding new objects (referred as things in the code). I have explored the original executable using a hex editor and found this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>ski2.c\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I have heard of old Windows applications being leaked by hackers, causing mass controversy and a big problem for Microsoft. They say they extracted the c files and headers from the executable file. Sometimes without a decompiler. I have been working on a SkiFree project for nearly 3 years only for my own enjoyment and I want to know which software do they use to do this. Can anyone help me?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks!\nPicaboo3\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

That string likely appears in the binary due to some sort of debug print (something like the\n  <code>\n   __FILE__\n  </code>\n  macro in C). If you really want to know what purpose that string is serving in the binary, you should use a static reverse engineering tool like IDA, Ghidra, Binary Ninja, or radare2 to investigate where it is being used. If it's nearby a call to\n  <code>\n   printf\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   OutputDebugString\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   fwrite\n  </code>\n  , etc., you are likely looking at a dead end.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
