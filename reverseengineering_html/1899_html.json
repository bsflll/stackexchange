    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Are there any good resources for developing debugger plugins in IDA Pro using the SDK that describe the IDA debugger API? An example of this is the\n  <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/idaproarmdebug/\">\n   IDA Pro ARM debugger plugin\n  </a>\n  on Sourceforge. There seem to be few projects that have accomplished this. Specifically, how do you make a plugin in IDA which registers itself as one of the available debuggers and allows stepping through the IDA database while controlling a target?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Other than that maybe reading the source of other plugins that are doing this such as the ARM debugger plugin referenced in the question and digging through dbg.hpp in the SDK to see what it exposes. It also appears the source for IDA's debugger plugins is available in plugins/debugger in the SDK. I haven't seen writing a debugger plugin specifically documented.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
