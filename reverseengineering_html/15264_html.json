And looking at the string output it shows that it prolly is U-boot\n  <code>\n   U-Boot 2011.12 (Nov 04 2016 - 12:13:11)\n  </code>\n  and the platform is running android 4.4.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CtDt1.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Start of image\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CtDt1.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The image starts with\n  <code>\n   0x19034\n  </code>\n  and then zero's until\n  <code>\n   0x200\n  </code>\n  which seem to contain some sort of checksum.Then at\n  <code>\n   0x600\n  </code>\n  certain address appear all starting with\n  <code>\n   0xE004xxxx\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  At\n  <code>\n   0x660\n  </code>\n  the first opcodes seem to placed and just before that\n  <code>\n   0xBACODE\n  </code>\n  is shown 3 times.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have tried to drop the image file until\n  <code>\n   0x600\n  </code>\n  and several different base addresses. But I don't seem to be able to get all offset correctly in IDA. There are a lot of strings at the bottom which could be matched.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The image file can be downloaded\n  <a href=\"https://ufile.io/18rbo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hopefully someone can help me finding the correct offset and base address.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
