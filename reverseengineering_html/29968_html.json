I did a couple of projects. now I was doing another project and faced kind of a problem.\n </p>\n <p>\n  at the start of the program, there is a label that points to an address of memory but when going to that address there is only hex data instead of instruction.\nhow I can convert those to the instruction. I used \"C (convert to code)\" which was nonsense.\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZAyw3.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZAyw3.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  thanks in advance\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
