    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am trying to learn actually how to get to the PEB inside of TEB. I have tried this with\n  <code>\n   windbg\n  </code>\n  but could not manage to dump the PEB with stuff like:\n </p>\n <pre><code>!peb\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  or\n </p>\n <pre><code>dt nt!_PEB_LDR_DATA\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And others. But, I could not manage to get the PEB dumped. So also my favorite debugger is still\n  <code>\n   immunitydbg\n  </code>\n  . So, I was trying to get to the information using\n  <code>\n   immunitydbg\n  </code>\n  CLI. But the nearest thing I have managed to get to PEB is dumping the TEB.\n </p>\n <pre><code>d fs:[0]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So, I there anyhow someway inside of immunity do get the contents of TEB/PEB? I also tried to use the\n  <code>\n   Ollysdbg\n  </code>\n  PE Dump plugin but that only gave me another exe file with different contents. And also i am not sure if the PE Plugin does the right thing for me.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
