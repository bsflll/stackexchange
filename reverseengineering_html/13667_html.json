Use VirtualAllocEx to allocate memory in the remote process, WriteProcessMemory to write the DLL filename to that buffer, then CreateRemoteThread with the address of the LoadLibrary function, and passing the address of the buffer.  Windows will create a thread which loads the DLL and runs your code.</span>",
