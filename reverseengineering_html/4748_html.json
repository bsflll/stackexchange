Then from your ActiveX control you'd expose methods that manipulate the variable, say:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Method #1: Allocate the test object and keep the pointer in a static variable\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Method #2: Call the virtual methods provided by the test object\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Method #3: Free the test object instance,\n   <strong>\n    without setting the pointer to NULL\n   </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Some means to allocate other things that would reuse the memory freed in the previous method\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Then whip up a basic script exercising the given methods: allocate, call the methods to make sure it works as designed, free the instance, allocate something else, call virtual methods again and crash the IE instance. ;-) Should do the trick.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In your example, there is no chance for that. It would be better to expose an ActiveX method to solely do the <code>nuser-&gt;GetUserNameW();</code> call, thus splitting the <code>CATLActivexControl::CreateUser</code> method in two. This way, you actually get a chance to overwrite freed memory.</span>",
