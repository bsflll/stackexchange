I need to identify a diode in a PCB that i'm currently working on. Do you guys have any idea or advise on how to identify the diode. The diode which I need to identify is D1 on the picture below.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/y8zVh.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"the diode which i want to identify is D1\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/y8zVh.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

These devices are typically packaged\nin tiny\n   <strong>\n    glass cylinders\n   </strong>\n   with a connecting lead at each end. A\n   <strong>\n    stripe\n   </strong>\n   on the cylinder marks the diode’s cathode, making the opposite side\nthe anode. With some diodes, you may need a magnifying glass to see\nthe stripe clearly.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  (emphasis mine)\n </p>\n <p>\n  IF you need more help with the circuit, I'd suggest asking on\n  <a href=\"https://electronics.stackexchange.com/\">\n   https://electronics.stackexchange.com/\n  </a>\n  where there are many more experts on this topic.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
