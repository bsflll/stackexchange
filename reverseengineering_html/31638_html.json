I had to look up solutions and found that some involved buffer overflow and bruteforcing algorithms. It took me around 30 minutes to finally look up for a solution, and I feel like I'm so stupid :(\n </p>\n <p>\n  If possible, can you give a rough roadmap for reverse engineering along with some great resources?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
