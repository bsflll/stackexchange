    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  There's a piece of software, for which I only have the binary, not the source code. It's:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   unobfuscated (so, not polymorphic or anything. It is optimized a bit, though)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   unstripped\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   x86 32 bit\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   trustworthy (not suspected malware)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   compiled from C++ (based on contents of symbol table)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   probably uses JNI (a couple reasons; partly because it has a fair number of its strings in UTF-16)\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I don't need the full call graph, just the call graph / control flow when given certain arguments. The only reverse engineering I've done has been relatively basic stuff with binutils + gdb + strace. Essentially, I just need a piece of software to match up 'call' and 'ret' pairs, and translate 'call' instruction destinations to their human-readable symbol names. Hopefully generate a readable 2D graph image to give me a feel for app execution.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, something to map control flow. It is just a single binary (with some dynamic library dependencies), but it's large enough that manual traces would be prohibitively labor-intensive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   EDIT:\n  </strong>\n  I don't want to have to pay for anything or run windows to do this. If at all possible, I'd like to be able to run something natively on Linux.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
