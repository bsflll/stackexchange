While I am stepping through the program (on windows7) radare2 prints some lines which can be seen on the picture. It seems to me as if the tracing is enabled but in configuration variables tracing is disabled. I would like to turn off this printing but don't know how.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fDLI0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fDLI0.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
