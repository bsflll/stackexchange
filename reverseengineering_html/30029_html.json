    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Let's say I have this code in the decompiler of IDA pro:\n </p>\n <pre><code>var1 = var2; \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And assume the type of\n  <code>\n   var1\n  </code>\n  is\n  <code>\n   X\n  </code>\n  (for example\n  <code>\n   X\n  </code>\n  could be char array with size 5). Is there anyway that I can tell IDA that whenever you see such assignments, change the type of\n  <code>\n   var2\n  </code>\n  to\n  <code>\n   X\n  </code>\n  as well?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Considering that\n  <code>\n   var1\n  </code>\n  is type\n  <code>\n   X\n  </code>\n  , then obviously\n  <code>\n   var2\n  </code>\n  should be type\n  <code>\n   X\n  </code>\n  as well, but right now I have to manually change the type every timeâ€¦ The problem is this is happening inside a large function thousands of times and I can't manually change every time, I need to somehow force IDA to do it. But how?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
