Suppose\n <code>\n  SeedEncrypt\n </code>\n has a type such as\n <code>\n  unsigned int*\n </code>\n then\n <code>\n  +1\n </code>\n means the same as\n <code>\n  SeedEncrypt[1]\n </code>\n . But the argument itself is passed as\n <code>\n  void*\n </code>\n , which doesn't allow for this sort of pointer arithmetic. So you need to give more context.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

ARM processors support two instruction sets: the ARM instruction set, and the Thumb instruction set. In the ARM instruction set every instruction is 4 bytes long, and in the Thumb instruction set every instruction is 2 bytes long.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In instructions that jump, the least significant bit of the supposed jump target is actually cleared out of the jump target, and instead chooses whether to decode the instructions over there as ARM or as Thumb.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, suppose we have an instruction to jump to the address which\n  <code>\n   r3\n  </code>\n  holds:\n </p>\n <pre><code>bx r3\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  If\n  <code>\n   r3\n  </code>\n  is even, then it means that the instructions at where\n  <code>\n   r3\n  </code>\n  points to are ARM instructions, which are 4 bytes wide. In particular, in this case,\n  <code>\n   r3\n  </code>\n  must be divisible by 4.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the other hand, if\n  <code>\n   r3\n  </code>\n  is odd, then the real jump target is\n  <code>\n   r3 & ~1\n  </code>\n  (equivalently\n  <code>\n   r3 - 1\n  </code>\n  ) and the instructions over there would be decoded as Thumb instructions, which are 2 bytes wide. In this case,\n  <code>\n   r3 - 1\n  </code>\n  does not have to be divisible by 4, but only by 2 (which is automatic assuming\n  <code>\n   r3\n  </code>\n  is odd)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Therefore, for any function which is written using the Thumb instruction set, a function pointer that points to it will have a\n  <code>\n   +1\n  </code>\n  to signify that the function is written as Thumb.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In your case,\n  <code>\n   SendEncrypt\n  </code>\n  is apparently written in Thumb, and therefore the function pointer that is passed to\n  <code>\n   SecurityAccess\n  </code>\n  has a\n  <code>\n   +1\n  </code>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
