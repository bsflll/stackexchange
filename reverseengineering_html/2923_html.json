It is compiled with Visual C++ (probably 6.0).\n </p>\n <p>\n  First question would be, where can I find more information what the thread-local storage contains? I haven't quite understood it yet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is the assembler code where the application reads a value from the thread-local storage.\n </p>\n <pre><code>MOV EAX,0\nMOV ECX,DWORD PTR FS:[0x2C]\nMOV EDX,DWORD PTR DS:[ECX + EAX * 4]\nMOV EAX,DWORD PTR DS:[EDX+4]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  EAX is a pointer which points on the following memory area which has a special pattern.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"memory pattern\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/cCZqc.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  It basically looks like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>52\nP->...\nP->...\n5\n\n52\nP->...\nP->...\n5\n\n52\nP->...\nP->...\n5\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I was wondering if this is some kind of standard data structure.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Here's how a typical TLS access to a\n  <code>\n   __declspec(thread)\n  </code>\n  variable looks like:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov eax, DWORD PTR __tls_index    ; load TLS index for current thread\nmov ecx, DWORD PTR fs:__tls_array ; load the TLS array pointer (FS:[2Ch])\nmov edx, DWORD PTR [ecx+eax*4]    ; fetch the pointer to the TLS block for current thread\nmov eax, DWORD PTR [edx+4h]       ; load the thread variable at offset 4 in the TLS block\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  (The\n  <code>\n   __tls_index\n  </code>\n  variable is pointed to by the\n  <code>\n   TlsIndex\n  </code>\n  (aka\n  <code>\n   AddressOfIndex\n  </code>\n  ) field of the PE TLS directory.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  The actual content of the TLS block is up to the program - the OS only makes sure that every thread gets a separate copy of the initial TLS template, and puts a pointer to it in the TLS array. So, to figure out what's in that memory chunk, you'll have to see how the program is using it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
