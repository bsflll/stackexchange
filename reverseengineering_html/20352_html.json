You are asking\n  <code>\n   angr\n  </code>\n  to figure out everything on it's own which may be feasible for simple and uncomplicated C programs but not for something like Go binaries.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, the\n  <code>\n   fmt.Scanln\n  </code>\n  function will call multiple Go functions before you reach\n  <code>\n   libc.read\n  </code>\n  . Angr has SimProcedures for\n  <code>\n   read\n  </code>\n  but not for\n  <code>\n   fmt.Scanln\n  </code>\n  . To figure out what\n  <code>\n   fmt.Scanln\n  </code>\n  does it has to symbolically execute after which only it may able to discover the dependency between\n  <code>\n   stdin\n  </code>\n  and the program output. Symbolically executing\n  <code>\n   Scanln\n  </code>\n  is by no way a simple task.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Instead, you should break down the problem in parts which you can ask\n  <code>\n   angr\n  </code>\n  to solve. Like if you have identified the buffer where the user input is stored you can mark that as symbolic and instruct\n  <code>\n   angr\n  </code>\n  to find the path to the \"good password\" branch.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Further resources on Go reversing:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://r3xnation.wordpress.com/2018/01/11/reversing-go-binaries-part-1/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    https://r3xnation.wordpress.com/2018/01/11/reversing-go-binaries-part-1/\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://2016.zeronights.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/GO_Zaytsev.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    https://2016.zeronights.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/GO_Zaytsev.pdf\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://rednaga.io/2016/09/21/reversing_go_binaries_like_a_pro/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    https://rednaga.io/2016/09/21/reversing_go_binaries_like_a_pro/\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
