When I'm in the game main menu, I can debug and set breakpoint without problem and when I open the game process using Cheat Engine, I can view the memory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"Attach to the game before entering the game map\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VRSUF.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  But when I start to play the game and enter the game map, the game crash when the breakpoint triggered. And also, when I try to reattach the Cheat Engine, the memory cannot be read.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"Attach to the game after entering the game map\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FRx99.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  And when I go back to the main menu again, the protection is being turn off... I can view the memory, and debug again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any idea which on which function should add bp in order to trace this memory protection? I already add bp on the\n  <code>\n   IsDebuggerPresent\n  </code>\n  , but it doesn't trigger, so I'm pretty sure it's not the one..\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If I attach to the game right after it run, I can access and edit the memory even when I'm playing it. But only memory editing, debugging will crash the game.   But if I attach the game after the game starts, not only debugging, I can't even view the memory.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

You might want to try breaking once you hit start, and then doing some static analysis to figure out what's going on from that point. Best of luck!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
