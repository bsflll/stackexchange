    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Okay. So I've just come up with the most amazing program for java developers and reverse-engineerers and I was wondering if something like the following program already exists:\n </p>\n <p>\n  What I'm thinking of is like a middle-ground between something like\n  <a href=\"http://dirty-joe.com/\">\n   DirtyJOE\n  </a>\n  and a Java Decompiler.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I already know that:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   It's possible to inject and manipulate code in a compiled class using\n   <a href=\"http://asm.ow2.org\">\n    ASM\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   You can decompile an unobfuscated jar into a readable and understandable state\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   It's practical to explore and edit a class using a GUI because DirtyJOE can do that amazingly well\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  So is there some sort of program that can show me a decompiled class and allow me to manipulate/inject into different parts of it individually?\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, I would like replace one method with my own or change a field's access within a compiled class file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So basically I'm looking for a frontend for ASM built with an interface based on decompiled source code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does this exist? If not, what's the closest thing I'm going to get to it?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

However note that\n  <em>\n   none\n  </em>\n  of them has the ability to recompile classes, i.e you cannot decompile a single class to source, modify it, and then recompile back. It may be possible using\n  <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/\">\n   Reflection API\n  </a>\n  but then you need to do a lot of modification on the decompiled source itself.

The user interface tries to display as\n  much detail as possible and tries to present a structure as close as\n  the actual Java class file structure. At the same time ease of use and\n  class file consistency while doing modifications is also stressed. For\n  example, when a method is deleted, the associated constant pool entry\n  will also be deleted if it is no longer referenced. In built verifier\n  checks changes before saving the file.
