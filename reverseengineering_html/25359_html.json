As I can understand it connected through i8042 ps/2\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've tried to capture /dev/input/event but there are only usual keys, Fn keys don't generate any output. I've checked every /dev/input/event and /dev/hidraw for any output on Fn keys press and none of them gived me any events or signals. So linux don't know anything about this keys, I suppose the only way to know what is happening - load into windows.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can run Windows natively or in virtual box, but I have no guess how to capture signals from keyboard to windows and vice versa. Can anyone give me advice on this?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
