That shows that there most likely are 256 symbols, which would make the row of symbols contain 96 = 12 * 8 bits.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/81attendees/current/msg00986.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/81attendees/current/msg00986.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Checking the Unicode charts, almost all of the symbols are on the page U+22xx, \"Mathematical symbols\".  I haven't tracked down the rest, some of which are seriously obscure, but some seem to be sans-serif Hebrew letters. I am guessing that the symbols not in U+22xx are to replace some symbols on that page that are too much like others.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There doesn't seem to be any ordinary data processing purpose that the symbols could serve, since any information you wanted to be machine processable you'd put in the barcode.  My guess is that the symbols are a hash, summary, or subset of the information in the barcode and function as a \"receipt number\" that the\n  <em>\n   recipient\n  </em>\n  can read, so that if two buyers purchase the same thing, the establishment cannot give them two copies of one (recorded) receipt but rather has to record two receipts to give to each of them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This explanation accounts for why the symbols are easily human recognizable.  It is also based on an experience in the Musée de la civilisation à Québec:  I purchased a tea from the cafe, and my companion purchased a tea as well, immediately after me, from the same cashier.  Our receipts had the same line of symbols, a surpasingly unlikely event, which suggests that we received duplicate copies of one recorded receipt.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
