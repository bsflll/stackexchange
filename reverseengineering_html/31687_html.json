I am using the new WinDbg Preview (only thing that is available to download now). After letting the malware call VirtualAlloc I am trying to search the memory now but I am getting 0 results. I have been on Google and Microsoft docs about the range operator trying to get this to work but I cant get it to find anything. I am on a Windows 11 vm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   s -a 0 L?4ffffff \"This Program\"\n  </code>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
