When I try to run the binary with the proper static version of qemu, i get an error with FPU mode ex:\n </p>\n <pre><code> chroot . ./qemu-mips-static bin/busybox\n qemu: Unexpected FPU mode \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I can't find anything on this error.  I have tried this on several different firmwares and i keep getting the same error.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The OS is Kali linux with qemu-user-static installed and the qemu-mips-static static binary place in the root directory of the unpacked firmware.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
