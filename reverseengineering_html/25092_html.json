What function causes the overflow to occur (read, strcpy, memcpy), etc.? What type of application; does it fork for each attempt? The more detail you can add, the more likely it will be solved.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

If what you are overwriting already ends with two zeros, it may not matter that you can't send them. Although, this will only let you jump once, which may be enough depending on the stack/register setup (e.g. call\n <code>\n  system\n </code>\n ).\n</span>\n</body></html>",
