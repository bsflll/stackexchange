The easiest way to get the url is probably using\n    <a href=\"http://www.telerik.com/fiddler\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n     Fiddler\n    </a>\n    , as you're on windows. Listening to network communication with\n    <a href=\"https://www.wireshark.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n     wireshark\n    </a>\n    or a similar program might work as well, but if the application uses TLS, encryption will get in the way, which fiddler can usually work around.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    This is where it becomes complicated. Adding a new button to a dialog box might work with a\n    <a href=\"http://www.resedit.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n     resource editor\n    </a>\n    , if the application uses standard windows gui elements. If the application uses a different GUI framework, you're out of luck. Once you have the button, you need to change the button handler of the dialog box to recognize your new button id and react accordingly. This includes writing a new routine, finding a bunch of unused bytes in the code segment of your .exe to place it in, or enlarging the code segment or creating a new segment for your code, patching the original button handler to call your routine if the new button ID is detected, and hoping you don't break anything in the process. Considerable experience is required for this to work, so if you're a beginner with RE, you probably have to learn a lot before attempting this.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

There is a good chance in this case it's either using an open source, or commercial setup. Look for strings in the target that indicate what library/system it might be using, and, or, look for relevant DLL's (like \"awesomium\", etc.) in the targets path. You might be able to find matching libs that you can use; again making some general assumptions that you are going to facilitate your mod/hack via a DLL.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You got to do more RE'ing to find out how it's doing things and the answer(s) will reveal it's self.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
