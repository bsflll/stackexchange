You can take a look at the Mach-O parsing functions on Apple's site\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/xar/xar-45/xar/lib/macho.c\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/xar/xar-45/xar/lib/macho.c\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  What you're seeing is that FAT Header part of the Mach-O file, which is telling you where to find the rest of the of the Mach-O file. This is used to have one file, with two separate architectures inside of it. The FAT header describes where the to find the rest of the data needed by the system running it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While doing some reversing and forensics work, I created a 010Editor template for parsing through Mach-O files - it might be useful in conjunction with the source from Apple for understanding what is coming after the 0xCAFEBABE and loading you're actual dylib files;\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/strazzere/010Editor-stuff/blob/master/Templates/MachOTemplate.bt\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   https://github.com/strazzere/010Editor-stuff/blob/master/Templates/MachOTemplate.bt\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
