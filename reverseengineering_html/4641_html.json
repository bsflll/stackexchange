I'd guess it's an artifact of postincrement, where the value of the expression is the unchanged value. When the compiler compiles the\n <code>\n  i++\n </code>\n expression, it puts the old value into ecx in case some outer expression needs it; without optimizations, it never realizes there is no outer expression.

The original value of\n  <code>\n   i\n  </code>\n  is stored into\n  <code>\n   ecx\n  </code>\n  for a possible later use.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   ISO/IEC 9899:TC3\n  </a>\n  (C99) ---\n6.5.2.4 Postfix increment and decrement operators:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   The result of the postfix ++ operator is the value of the operand.\n  After the result is obtained, the value of the operand is incremented.\n  (That is, the value 1 of the appropriate type is added to it.) See\n  the discussions of additive operators and compound assignment for\n  information on constraints, types, and conversions and the effects of\n  operations on pointers. The side effect of updating the stored value\n  of the operand shall occur between the previous and the next sequence\n  point.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  The sequence points are described in Annex C of the document.\n </p>\n <p>\n  TCC performs only few optimizations, the code is generated in a single pass and every C statement is compiled on its own. It seems that the compiler is almost as simple as possible so it does not store any state during the compilation if it is not necessary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When TCC encountered the sequence point before\n  <code>\n   ++\n  </code>\n  it did not know about the\n  <code>\n   ++\n  </code>\n  operation. Performing the side-effect of the\n  <code>\n   ++\n  </code>\n  operator later after evaluating the\n  <code>\n   ++\n  </code>\n  operation would mean to store a state information. It seems that the author of TCC selected the simplest approach - to perform the side-effect together with the evaluation of the\n  <code>\n   ++\n  </code>\n  operator.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The original value of the\n  <code>\n   i\n  </code>\n  variable (before incrementing) can possibly be used again in the same expression so it is saved to the\n  <code>\n   ecx\n  </code>\n  register and the result of the postfix increment operation is stored to the variable on the stack immediately (\n  <code>\n   mov [ebp+var_4], eax\n  </code>\n  ). It does not matter that the value in\n  <code>\n   ecx\n  </code>\n  is not used later. This is the disadvantage due to the simplicity of TCC. For example you can notice that the code loads the value of\n  <code>\n   i\n  </code>\n  from stack to\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  even if the value is in\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  already.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Example of code which additionally uses the original value of\n  <code>\n   i\n  </code>\n  :\n </p>\n <pre><code>j = i++ + i * 3;\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The assembly code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>13: 8b 45 fc        mov eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]    // load i to eax\n16: 48 89 c1        mov ecx, eax                    // store the original value of i for later use\n19: 83 c0 01        add eax, 0x1                    // increment the value (the side effect of ++)\n1c: 89 45 fc        mov DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4], eax    // store it to i - everything between \"=\" and \"+\" is done at this point including the side-effect of i++\n1f: 8b 45 fc        mov eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]    // load i to eax (Now it is the incremented value.)\n22: ba 03 00 00 00  mov edx, 0x3                    // load value 3 for the multiplication\n27: 0f af c2        imul    eax, edx                // multiply\n2a: 01 c1           add ecx, eax                    // add the original value of i (the result of i++)\n2c: 89 4d f8        mov DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8], ecx    // store the result to j\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  At\n  <code>\n   1f\n  </code>\n  the incremented value of\n  <code>\n   i\n  </code>\n  is being used but it is also possible to use the original value of\n  <code>\n   i\n  </code>\n  there and still be in adherence with C99 because the sequence point after\n  <code>\n   i++\n  </code>\n  was not encountered yet.
