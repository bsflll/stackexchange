    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  IDA's default x86 assembly syntax is not very clear about pointer dereferences. One of these is dereferencing the memory operand, and one is simply moving the address to the register:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov     ecx, offset dword_130B78\nmov     eax, off_130AF8\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  You can improve this slightly by selecting\n  <code>\n   Borland TASM in Ideal Mode\n  </code>\n  in Options > General > Analysis > Target Assembler:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov     eax, [off_130AF8]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But what I would like is to make it even less ambiguous by always displaying the size qualifier with\n  <code>\n   ptr\n  </code>\n  :\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov     eax, dword ptr [off_130AF8]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Is there a way to force IDA to do this? It does it in some cases but not others, and I'd like it to always do it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

As a reverse engineer you really have to filter through a lot of information and adding this would distract from the important stuff, because the information is right there anyway. You can tell from the target operand what the size of the source must be, so there's no need for\n <code>\n  dword ptr\n </code>\n . Things are different with something like\n <code>\n  movzx   eax, word ptr [eax+esi*2]\n </code>\n where the source gets zero-expanded into the target. And\n <i>\n  then\n </i>\n it's not evident whether it's a single or two byte source ...\n</span>\n</body></html>",

What I want is to make it clearer that the pointer is being dereferenced, which as you can see from the first two instruction example can be unclear in IDA’s syntax. It’s really only a problem with x86 (as opposed to RISC machines) because mov can move between both registers and memory.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

If they aren't there, nothing gets dereferenced. And conversely if you imagine\n <code>\n  dword_130B78\n </code>\n as a C/C++ variable, you can think of\n <code>\n  offset dword_130B78\n </code>\n as\n <code>\n  &dword_130B78\n </code>\n ... on the other hand\n <code>\n  mov eax, [off_130AF8]\n </code>\n could be thought of as\n <code>\n  eax = *off_130AF8\n </code>\n (where\n <code>\n  off_130AF8\n </code>\n is clearly a 32-bit pointer). I have the issue the other way around, since I rarely read RISC assembly. But once you become accustomed to it, it's no issue.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
