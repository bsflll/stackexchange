Is it possible to do so?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have some experience to use command line ida, but that only limits to execute some IDAPython scripts.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The test is on Windows 7, with IDA-Pro 6.6 and BinDiff 4.1.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I know i've read about it somewhere. You would still have to start IDA to generate the idb file, but as far as i know that's also possible via the command line.\n <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/417.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/417.shtml\n </a>\n seems to cover this, check the -B parameter.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
