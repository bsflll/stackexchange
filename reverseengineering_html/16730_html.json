The \"Sources\" tab will show you files that are being loaded and from where. This can help you avoid keeping junk/irrelevant files, like analytics JS files, etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you click on the \"Network\" tab and refresh the page, you can see the order and timing of everything loading.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Reversing functionality from dynamic pages\n  <em>\n   can\n  </em>\n  be exponentially more difficult (see: impossible). Implementations like\n  <a href=\"https://angular.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Angular\n  </a>\n  create a black box that stores a lot of functionality server-side, so if you wanted to save, say, the functionality of the live-update notification icon from YouTube, you won't be able to do that using just what's rendered on the client side.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is where reverse engineering really does come into play. You can learn a lot about\n  <em>\n   how\n  </em>\n  a page/site works via the browser's developer tools, but taking it to the next step, you're going to want to use tools like\n  <a href=\"https://www.wireshark.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Wireshark\n  </a>\n  or\n  <a href=\"https://www.telerik.com/fiddler\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Fiddler\n  </a>\n  to capture packets and inspect data more thoroughly (if you can; the data may be encrypted).\n </p>\n <p>\n  If a site is based on a platform like WordPress, then there are likely breadcrumbs in the code that will hint at either the theme the site is based on, plugins being utilized, etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Conclusion\n  </strong>\n  : Your question is far more broad than you think (which isn't your fault because you don't know any better), but if the page you're interested in has no dynamically-updating content and its static form is truly enough for you, then saving the complete page via your browser should be sufficient. That, or use an application like\n  <a href=\"https://www.httrack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   HTTrack\n  </a>\n  or\n  <a href=\"http://www.web2disk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Web2Disk\n  </a>\n  for something a bit more thorough that can crawl a page/site and nab more resources than a browser will render.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
