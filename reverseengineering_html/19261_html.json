If you're talking about something in a data section, you could manually save the data as a binary file and then do a binary diff after each. (You could even do this with an entire data section.) If you're talking about heap-allocated data, your life is going to be harder.  Nevertheless, the question really can't be answered until you be more specific about what the data is.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
