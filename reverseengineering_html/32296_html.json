For example, I've tried to use the following function declaration to reflect the fact that the function returns result in register %o0:\n </p>\n <pre><code>int __usercall sub@<%o0>()\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But it doesn't work, IDA says \"Syntax error near: %\". Removing the percent sign from register name also doesn't help.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does anybody know if that's possible to use __usercall with non-x86 architectures at all?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Have you tried without the\n <code>\n  %\n </code>\n or with an alternative characters such as\n <code>\n  $\n </code>\n ? Also, have you tried starting the debugger to inspect what the register names are? Perhaps that gives clues as to what should go there. I haven't used IDA with SPARC, but it's also possible you need to adjust the settings for the target processor to support a given register  representation.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Using \"$\" also doesn't work (and that would be strange if that worked. SPARC specification uses \"%\" in register names, and IDA SPARC module follows that convention). \"Also, have you tried starting the debugger to inspect what the register names are?\" - I can't do that. That's a firmware of specific embedded SPARC-based SoC, and I don't know how to connect to the device with debugger.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

That's only references to registers via __usercall what fails.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

As for the rest, apologies. As I wrote I have not used IDA with SPARC and my last developer adventures with SPARC are also by now >10 years ago.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
