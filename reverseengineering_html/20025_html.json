I have already the code that parses a binary and disassembles it (x86/x64) and creates Basic Blocks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now what I would like to do is, for any Basic Block, analyze the effect of each instruction and compose all these effects to derive information\nat basic block boundaries.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also I would like to perform Variable Tracking and Live Variable Analysis. Last, CFG (Control Flow Graph) to see all these effects across basic blocks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there any available C/C+ Lib or subset of any Open Source Project that can help me achieve this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
