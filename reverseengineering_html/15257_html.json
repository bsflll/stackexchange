    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a program written in c++, it's compiled with Visual Studio.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have a mini dump file of a running process (process generates it using winapi MiniDumpWriteDump function).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I also have several memory addresses - they should correspond to addresses of my c++ functions/methods.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I also have *.pdb file - debug information generated by Visual Studio during compilation of my program.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now I need to find out which functions correspond to the addresses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Question 1: Do I have enough data? Is minidump, *.pdb file and address is enough to find out function name (and it's location in source code)?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Question 2: I need to automate this process. I will have to write a script (hope it will be a python script) which will do the job. Can anyone suggest appropriate python tools?\n </p>\n <p>\n  (Originally I posted this question on stackoverflow, but looks like it's better suited here)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
