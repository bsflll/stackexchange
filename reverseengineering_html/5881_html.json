    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have been looking all around for an answer to this, so I am hoping I find an answer here.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am working in Ollydbg 2.1 and every time I patch an exe it makes a foo.bak (backup) which is ok. However, I must reload the program to make more patches and often I am making multiple patches in multiple stubs at a time. Olly wont allow me to patch multiple times unless I rename the file cause there is a .bak already there and it wont over write that. I keep all my own backups so I am wondering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  1 Is there a way to have olly not make backups?\n  \n\n  2 Is there a way to have olly allow forover writing the .bak files or some way to have multiple saves in a session?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Please let me know .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
