There are many disassemblers that can be used for this function including:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/gallery/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     IDA Pro\n    </a>\n    (Commercial)\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <a href=\"https://ghidra-sre.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     Ghidra\n    </a>\n    (Open Source)\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.radare.org/n/radare2.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     Radare2\n    </a>\n    (Open Source)\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To use these tools you will usually just load the binary into the software and it will present you with the assembly representation of the binary using various algorithms such as Linear Sweep and Recursive traversal.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Alternatively you can always open the binaries within a hex editor and extract the OP codes from HEX. However the challenge would be to locate your target location in the binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hope this helps!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
