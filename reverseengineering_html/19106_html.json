It annotates the code blocks referenced in the table with the try comments, and also annotates the exception handling code with a comment like \"exception handler for try block at XXX\". I tend to not use graph view, so I can only guess that the extra edges in the flow graph point from the try block to exception handling blocks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
