There is memory mapped file, I found with help of Process Explorer. Properties windows says:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Type: Section\nDescription: A memory mapped file or paging-file...\nAddress: 0xFFFFF8A002D8A080\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But when I look into x64dbg Memory Map tab, there is no such addresses. I see only range\n  <code>\n   0000000000010000-000007FFFFFE0000\n  </code>\n  . How I can find memory mapped file? I want to place memory breakpoint on it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
