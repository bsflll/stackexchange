I assume this could be done through drilling holes in the circuit, and having a separate device bridge a new connection.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Would this be possible?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

There is also a device out there for breaking BIOS passwords on certain thinkpads by connecting to an IC of some sort but I can't find the article.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Although those methods probably differ in some aspects from a MITM attack, the way you describe would seem perfectly valid based on those devices.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
