Which compiler are you interested in?\" See\n <a href=\"http://www.kegel.com/mangle.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  kegel.com/mangle.html\n </a>\n for a good introduction.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Besides, you didn't mention you were looking for a\n <i>\n  pure Python\n </i>\n solution. Especially since the provided links give clues how to implement it in pure Python, if that's what you absolutely want. This site isn't for recommendations about software and I can't see what's wrong with Dominik's links for example.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
