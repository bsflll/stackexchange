However the\n  <code>\n   BFC.W\n  </code>\n  instruction seems to clear the most significant 2 bits. So, the sign bit and the bit to its immediate right are cleared. Why is that done?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The author himself does not comment on the strange BFC.W statement. This very statement has been commented in another blog\n  <a href=\"http://johannesbader.ch/2014/06/practical-reverse-engineering-solutions-page-78-part-iii/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  , as \"I don’t understand the purpose of setting the two most significant bits of the difference to zero. Those bits shouldn’t be set in the first place for any reasonable strings.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maybe that statement serves some purpose. If yes it might be rather obscure.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
