It's usually below the return address in textbook stack overflow, because it causes your total payload to be smaller.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Small illustration: you're overflowing a 256 bytes buffer on the stack. Your payload would look like this in classical overflow:\n </p>\n <p>\n  NOP * (256 - len(shellcode)) + shellcode + padding + returnaddress\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you put the payload after:\n </p>\n <p>\n  padding * 256 + padding + returnaddress + nop * (as much as needed) + shellcode.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pro: you can sometimes add much more space for your nops or bigger shellcode. If you're doing ROP you'll need to use that space after the return address anyway.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cons: your payload is bigger and may not fit in your buffer.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
