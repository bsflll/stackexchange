My intention is to replace the sounds with my own. However, I have been unable to identify the chip and therefore cannot interface with it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is a picture and schematic of the board, developed using a multimeter in continuity mode.\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wTIYJ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"circuit board\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wTIYJ.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NLEWH.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"board schematic\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NLEWH.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is a closeup of the chip.\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YePfS.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"chip\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YePfS.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I believe the markings are as follows:\n </p>\n <pre><code>JFK8-4\nP04003\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  There is also a \"triforce\" logo, for a company which I have not identified yet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pins 1 and 8 are particularly interesting, as they are not connected to anything. I assume they were used to program the chip, but am not able to identify a protocol if any exists.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It would be appreciated if anyone can locate a datasheet. I would also be happy with advice on identifying the function of the unconnected pins.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
