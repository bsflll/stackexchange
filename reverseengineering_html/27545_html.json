    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Where is the legacy BIOS (the 16 bit reset code that jumps to the POST entry point at F000:E05B and indeed POST itself and all the BIOS routines) originally stored on a UEFI system before it's shadowed to 0xF0000? And the embedded option ROMs before they're shadowed to 0xC0000? And what shadows the legacy BIOS to 0xF000: ME, the Startup ACM, SEC or the legacy BIOS itself?\n </p>\n <p>\n  It doesn't appear to be in the SPI flash BIOS region (I've searched byte sequences in the dump on IDA). I thought it might be on the LPC or EC flash but my laptop\n  <a href=\"https://notebookschematics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dell-Inspiron-15-7577-CKA50-CKF50-Schematic-LA-E992P.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   doesn't appear to have one\n  </a>\n  (and neither does my flash descriptor show an EC region so don't ask me where the EC ROM is stored either, but it's\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FZKC8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   supposed to be on the SPI flash\n  </a>\n  , and the schematic doesn't appear to show it having a private SPI flash, but it must do; maybe that's where the legacy BIOS is?); plus it looks like you can only configure the\n  <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/chipsets/100-c230-series-chipset-pch-datasheet-vol-2.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   PCH\n  </a>\n  to send all BIOS ranges to either LPC/eSPI or SPI and not 0xF0000 to one and 0xFFFF0000 to another. My laptop is booted into legacy BIOS and has EA at 0xFFFF0 (so obviously a legacy BIOS shadow) and 90 90 E9 at 0xFFFFFFF0. I can't find anything on this and I've been searching all sorts of combinations on verbatim search for hours, hundreds of manuals, UEFI papers, specifications, and not one mentions it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
