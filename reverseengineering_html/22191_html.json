    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've been a bit stumped recently on my decomp work. I've not dealt with C in depth nor have I dealt with IDA's pseudocode system very much at all. I understand asm, but because of how IDA merges instructions together in its pseudocode system, I'm having some trouble finding out how this translates.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In my pseudocode I have the following line:\n </p>\n <pre><code>// v1 is a pointer to RDI (stored as a single in pseudocode)\n// v7 is a pointer to R8 (stored as a single in pseudocode)\n// v10 is XMM1 (single)\n\nv1[1818] = (float)(v10 * (float)(*v7 - v7[1])) + v7[1];\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I'm having trouble understanding what the square brackets do. I was thinking that it was an offset (e.g. \"set the data at the location of v1 in memory + 1818i64 bytes to...\") but the asm doesn't match up with that addr. What's the difference between setting\n  <code>\n   v1 =\n  </code>\n  vs setting\n  <code>\n   v1[1818] =\n  </code>\n  ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I forgot to multiply 1818 by the size of the value (4 in this case, since it's a single). Suppose I'm just too used to the asm usage of [], yeah? I found the line\n <code>\n  movss dword ptr [rdi+1C68h], xmm1\n </code>\n --\n <code>\n  rdi+1C68h\n </code>\n is indeed the right location after doing RDI+(4*1818i16).\n</span>\n</body></html>",

I had the right idea, but I had made the mistake of assuming it was\n  <em>\n   n\n  </em>\n  bytes ahead, failing to factor in the size of the actual value at hand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since the specific type of\n  <code>\n   v1\n  </code>\n  was a single, this means I had to multiply the\n  <code>\n   1818\n  </code>\n  by\n  <code>\n   4\n  </code>\n  bytes. Looking at the corresponding ASM,\n  <code>\n   movss   dword ptr [rdi+1C68h], xmm1\n  </code>\n  , I can see that\n  <code>\n   rdi+1C68h\n  </code>\n  comes out to\n  <code>\n   v1\n  </code>\n  (rdi) +\n  <code>\n   7272i64\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   rdi+1C68h\n  </code>\n  - it checks out.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
