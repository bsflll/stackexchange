    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  The program I'm messing with has builtin logging. Using a proxy DLL, I managed to activate it by calling the right functions from the real DLL. However, I got stuck at using the actual logging functions, as the program crashes with Error 0xC0000142 whenever I get close to using them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's what I'm doing in my proxy DLL:\n </p>\n <pre><code>typedef void (*FDLAddr_t)(void);\nFDLAddr_t ForceDebugLog;\n\ntypedef void (*LIAddr_t)(char const *, ...);\nLIAddr_t LogInfo;\n\nvoid setupFuncs() {\n    HMODULE trueDll= GetModuleHandleA(\".\\\\trueDll.dll\");\n    ForceDebugLog = (FDLAddr_t)GetProcAddress(trueDll, \"?ForceDebugLog@@YAXXZ\");\n    // LogInfo = (LIAddr_t)GetProcAddress(trueDll, \"?LogInfo@@YAXPBDZZ\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now, I can just do\n  <code>\n   ForceDebugLog();\n  </code>\n  and logging gets enabled. However, as soon as I uncomment the\n  <code>\n   LogInfo\n  </code>\n  line, the program crashes on startup with Windows showing the error 0xc0000142.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Further experimentation shows that\n  <code>\n   GetProcAddress\n  </code>\n  returns the address of\n  <code>\n   LogInfo\n  </code>\n  in the DLL. Also, the line appears to be fine if\n  <code>\n   LogInfo\n  </code>\n  was a\n  <code>\n   FARPROC\n  </code>\n  , as that works without a problem. As soon as I add the cast to\n  <code>\n   LIAddr_t\n  </code>\n  , the error comes back.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How can I work around this issue? Or do I need to take a different approach? All binaries involved are 32 bit.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

As it turns out, some old object files from earlier experiments were accidentally linked into the DLL. One of the experiments was a reimplementation of LogInfo which caused the compiler/linker to produce an incorrect result.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
