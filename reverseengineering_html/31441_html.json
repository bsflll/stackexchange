I have a\n  <strong>\n   HEX\n  </strong>\n  file that has been patched with minor changes and new code appended (e.g. the hex from the ELF was exported and then had changes made to it manually effectively via a hex editor).\n </p>\n <p>\n  How can I \"\n  <strong>\n   replace\n  </strong>\n  \" the hex within the ELF file but not lose all the other metadata in the elf file for processing?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there any way to import a HEX into an existing ELF project and have it override the binary it has already extracted?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm sure a tool could be written to do this, I'm just trying to save time and see if there is any existing functionality to do this. I am fairly inexperienced with\n  <strong>\n   Ghidra\n  </strong>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The goal is to get all the function names/variables annotated in the new modified HEX file.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
