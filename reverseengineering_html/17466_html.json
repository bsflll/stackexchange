    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm just learning to use IDA and according to the book, when using\n  <code>\n   Search\n  </code>\n  function (\n  <code>\n   Search>text...\n  </code>\n  , for example) I should see a window with the found results, like this:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/A50N6.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"screenshot from the book\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/A50N6.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, when the search is over, if something is found, I only see in the bottom Search completed text and if I scroll the IDA View-A window, I can see that the text is highlighted. Text string\n  <code>\n   gethostbyname\n  </code>\n  was searched here:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kgNYx.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"screenshot of IDA in use\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kgNYx.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  I cannot see all the instances at the same time as expected.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The version I use is IDA 5.0, free version; it's the same version that the book was based on. How can I get the results to show?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
