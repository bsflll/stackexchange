Process Monitor operations do not necessarily map directly to Native symbols, however,\n  <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2c0w1f/registrywhat_does_regsetinfokey_do/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   it seems\n  </a>\n  that this operation uses\n  <a href=\"https://undocumented.ntinternals.net/index.html?page=UserMode%2FUndocumented%20Functions%2FNT%20Objects%2FKey%2FNtSetInformationKey.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   NtSetInformationKey\n  </a>\n  . When we examine that function though, we see that it has a parameter:\n  <code>\n   IN KEY_SET_INFORMATION_CLASS InformationClass\n  </code>\n  . Finally, undocumented.ntinternals.net states:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Currently only KEY_WRITE_TIME_INFORMATION is supported.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  When we look up\n  <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff554226(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   KEY_WRITE_TIME_INFORMATION\n  </a>\n  , the definition is just a simple data structure which stores the last write time to the registry key. So the question then becomes, when ProcMon displays a last write time, but no RegSetKey or other write occurs, what is the purpose for setting this value and is a simple write to this member what is actually occurring?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
