    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a contactless card which I'd like to know the capabilities. I assume the card works with NFC. However standard tools (\n  <em>\n   nfc-list\n  </em>\n  ) do not seem to be able to retrieve regular informations from it (not even the UID), the phone can't detect it either. This may be because the chip may have a not common NFC type.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now my question is: how can I know what kind of chip technology this is so I can begin working on understanding how data is stored and what is the protocol ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  What kind of additional hardware other than a simple reader (e.g ACR122U) may come handy to identify the card ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
