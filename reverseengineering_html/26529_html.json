I think there must be other signals as well and I wish to detect them. In particular, may there be other user-defined signals or only 2\n  <code>\n   SIGUSR\n  </code>\n  s are available no matter what? Since signals are being sent to the binary during runtime I wanted to know if there are signature functions in Golang's runtime that may be imported in the binary and represent signal handling functionalities in the binary.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
