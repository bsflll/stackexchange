Once you set the hardware breakpoint you can go to\n  <code>\n   Breakpoints\n  </code>\n  tab, right click the breakpoint on which you want to set condition, and select\n  <code>\n   Edit\n  </code>\n  . Now you can set the break condition.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Let's say your value is written to the memory in such way\n  <code>\n   mov dword ptr ds:[edx],eax\n  </code>\n  , so you can set the\n  <code>\n   Break condition\n  </code>\n  to\n  <code>\n   EAX==2F\n  </code>\n  , and then the program will be interrupted only when the value to write is equal to 2F.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
