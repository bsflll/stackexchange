Sometimes, however, simple binary searching (Search-->Sequence of bytes, or\n  <kbd>\n   Alt B\n  </kbd>\n  ) is enough, and if you check \"Find all occurrences\" in the search  dialog IDA will open a window with, correspondingly, all occurrences. You also can try text search with the command mnemonics, such as searching for \"\n  <code>\n   ADD\n  </code>\n  \" in the main IDA window in same manner.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If this is not enough, you'll probably need to write IDC or IDAPython script that does one of the following things:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Passes over all the instructions (for example with\n   <code>\n    idautils.Heads()\n   </code>\n   IDAPython function) and outputs everything where the command mnemonics fits to what you need (\n   <code>\n    idc.print_insn_mnem\n   </code>\n   DAPython function)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Passes over all the instructions (for example with\n   <code>\n    idautils.Heads()\n   </code>\n   IDAPython function), extracts the opcode from the instruction data (\n   <code>\n    idc.Byte(address)\n   </code>\n   IDAPython function ) in the mode and order you need and checks if it fits.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
