I want to write a VLC module to view the video, rather than the supplied DxClient.exe. I have captured traffic in wireshark and attempted to reverse engineer the client with IDA Pro, from what I can tell the client does some kind of handshake authentication, the DVR then sends 2 network packets (always 1514 bytes long), the client sends a TCP ACK and 2 more packets are transmitted, etc.etc... forever. From what I can tell the client uses Microsoft's AVIFIL32 library to decompress the packets to what essentially become AVI file frames.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The problem is I don't understand how these frames are encoded or if they even are AVI frames. Can anyone help me, here is the data payload from 2 packets:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/2VDu2Tc2\">\n   http://pastebin.com/2VDu2Tc2\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/L3Zi3VqU\">\n   http://pastebin.com/L3Zi3VqU\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The protocol seems quite poorly designed (in my opinion) using TCP instead of UDP for streaming media seems like a poor decision.

Just by looking at functionality of the DxClient, it is clear that it is more then just binary transfer of AVI formatted stream. I think, it is safe to assume, that rather proprietary transfer and control protocol is used. 2 frames that you provided is just not enough to get you some help on it. I think you should try to to focus on reversing the client.  With enough time spent, you should be able to drill down to how each frame is constructed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I would recommend you getting familiar with general principals of network protocol reverse engineering.

As far as I could tell, functionality of the client is pretty broad. The best thing is to set breakpoints on send() and recv() and see what it does with the message data: how it puts it together and takes it apart. That way you will be able to identify key components of the custom frame.</span>",
