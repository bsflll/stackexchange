Can anyone tell me what the reason for this is? Can I get a plugin? Or is there some setting that is the reason? I've done some googling but haven't really found anything.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks in advance for any help.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

However, most of the binaries shipped with Windows do have separate symbols available on Microsoft's public symbol servers. So in cases where such symbols exist on the symbol server, IDA may be able to download them and recover names. If this is a non-Microsoft program or the symbols are missing for whatever reason, you won't get names and will have to reverse-engineer the functionality of the program by studying its code.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So is it just that the author didn't include it? I also tried what you said but IDA can't find the pdb so it asks for me to locate the file, which I don't believe is included. So I'm basically out of luck? Thanks again.</span>",
