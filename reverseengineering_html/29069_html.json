    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have following intel processor\n  <code>\n   4th Generation Core Processor (Haswell U/Y)\n  </code>\n  .\nI want to check the value of\n  <code>\n   PMBASE\n  </code>\n  register in the processor. For that I have downloaded the processor datasheet, where I found that\n  <code>\n   PMBASE\n  </code>\n  is present at B:D:F\n  <code>\n   0:1:0\n  </code>\n  . Here is the screenshot\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ET0ns.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ET0ns.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The VID and DID of the device are mentioned below (from the same datasheet)\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/z0U7J.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/z0U7J.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  But, now when I am doing\n  <code>\n   lspci\n  </code>\n  from my linux machine, I am not seeing device\n  <code>\n   0:1:0\n  </code>\n  . I have even checked with chipsec tool. Even there I am not seeing any device with device id\n  <code>\n   0x0c01\n  </code>\n  .\n  \n\n  Any reason why such discrepancy is there?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
