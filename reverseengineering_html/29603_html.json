Note that at that point the change was only made to the IDB you're working on and not to the actual binary you loaded.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Before applying the patches made to the original binary, I recommend you review them using the\n  <code>\n   Edit -> Patch program -> Patched bytes\n  </code>\n  option. To apply the changes, you need to use the\n  <code>\n   Edit -> Patch program -> Apply patches to input file...\n  </code>\n  . You should probably create a backup (the option's available in the dialog).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note that this is only possible if the segment you're trying to edit is not a\n  <code>\n   BSS\n  </code>\n  segment. Executables don't\n  <em>\n   contain data\n  </em>\n  for\n  <code>\n   BSS\n  </code>\n  segments because\n  <code>\n   BSS\n  </code>\n  segments are completely initialized to all zeroes by the executable loader.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note that in earlier versions of IDA the\n  <code>\n   Patch program\n  </code>\n  submenu was hidden by default and you had to set the\n  <code>\n   DISPLAY_PATCH_SUBMENU\n  </code>\n  configuration in\n  <code>\n   idagui.cfg\n  </code>\n  to\n  <code>\n   YES\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
