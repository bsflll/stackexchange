    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a Toyota ECU from 2005 with an NEC 76F0004GD micro controller on it, I have already read the full 512k dump from the chip using a K-Tag. However, when I tried to put it into IDA, there weren't any options for this architecture! I checked Ghidra as well, no luck. I don't have a problem adding a new processor to IDA using the SDK, but I can't seem to find ANY information about this chip online!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyone have any clues?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Many thanks,\n </p>\n <p>\n  Zephurah\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You need to find out what CPU core it’s using (e.g.  V850) and look for that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There may be hundreds or thousands of different chips using the same instruction set, it would not make sense to list them all as separate processor entries.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   EDIT\n  </strong>\n  : I could find a datasheet for a NEC\n  <strong>\n   µPD76F0018\n  </strong>\n  which says it uses a\n  <strong>\n   V850E\n  </strong>\n  Family core, so I suspect yours is a V850 too (E or non-E).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
