So for example if I wanted to run multiple compare commands could I have them all saved to different output files?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The way it works presently is that they would get saved as compare.txt, compare.txt.old, compare.txt.old2 etc. I basically want to know if its possible to set them to output as compare.txt, compare1.txt etc so I dont need to go around deleting all the .old extensions.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
