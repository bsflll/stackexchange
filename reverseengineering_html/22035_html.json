    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've been tinkering with Fallout New Vegas, and have focused on modifying a very simple record that's hardcoded in the game engine. It's called an Imagespace Modifier, which is a very basic shader that can only have a select number of variables adjusted. It can be modified in the editor, but cannot be stopped from being applied to the screen. So even with it's values set to zero, it's still being calculated by the game.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I decided to try and find the hardcoded function that calls the imagespace modifier. I think I've got it, but I've hit a problem. It uses a JNZ to determine whether or not to process the record, which is a two byte opcode instruction (0F 85). But JMP Near is a single opcode instruction (E9). So I can't just simply patch that word in memory and always skip past the code calling the imagespace modifier.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What would I need to do in order to fix that, and use JMP instead of JNZ? Note, the framework I'm using to modify the process at runtime uses C++, so it needs to be doable in that language.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Screenshot:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/T9xw4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://i.sstatic.net/T9xw4.png\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
