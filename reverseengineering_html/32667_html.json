Is it based on IP ? Does it use some kind of fingerprint like the user-agent of the browser ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I for one use an extension called \"User Agent Switcher\" with Firefox. I use it only on select websites, but sometimes it's the only way to convince stubborn sites that my browser is just as fine as those browsers it would like me to install (but which I avoid for one reason or another). What is your exact problem? At which point do you get stuck with your research into the topic?\n</span>\n</body></html>",
