    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n \n\n I have a shellcode and want to inject my shellcode into a PE file (a simple compiled c program that prints Hello World on the screen) . My shellcode size is 0x2a1 and the .text section of my PE file has enough space to hold it . So i opened my PE file in PE-Bear and find the .text section RawOffset in file :\n \n\n \n\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"RawOffset of .text section\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2n9tD.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \n\n  \n\n  then i patch .text section bytes using HxD . I set AddressOfEntryPoint in OptionalHeader to start of .text section where my shellcode is :\n  \n\n  \n\n  <img alt=\"AddressOfEntryPoint in PE-Bear\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EcZOV.png\"/>\n  \n\n  \n\n </p>\n <p>\n  So now execution must be started from my shellcode bytes . but i ran PE file and got error :\n  \n\n  \n\n  <img alt=\"ERROR\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MBoKB.png\"/>\n  \n\n  \n\n  I opened PE file using OllyDbg and execution wasn't at position that i expected :\n  \n\n  \n\n  <img alt=\"OllyDbg\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FGrM7.png\"/>\n  \n\n  \n\n </p>\n <p>\n  AddressOfEntryPoint was 1000 . it's RVA so the execution must be started at 0x00401000 since the ImageBase is 0x00401000 (PE file is not dynamic base) but it isn't that and we got Access Violation .\n </p>\n <p>\n  i use Windows XP . what is going on ? why does this happen ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
