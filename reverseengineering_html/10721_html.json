The architecture is mainly x86/x86_64, but also ARM.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I used it on a daily basis when analyzing Delphi binaries since it contains IDA signatures that can be applied to a file being analyzed in Ollydbg. I believe it is not limited on only Delphi binaries, but based on my work so far that is the area where I used it the most. It saves me quite a lot of time with its function discovery functionality.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
