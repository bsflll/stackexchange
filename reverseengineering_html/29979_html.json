This type of preamble or similar may be what you have captured here.  As the posted answer says it's highly likely that your picture is far from the full transmitted message.  Perhaps share the captured file ?\n</span>\n</body></html>",

You can see digital code in the FCC document.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What system have been used to capture the signal?\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   RTL_433\n  </a>\n  might have the code implemented for your remote, otherwise\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/jopohl/urh\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   URH\n  </a>\n  might be good if you need to reverse it by yourself.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
