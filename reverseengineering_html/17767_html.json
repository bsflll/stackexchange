Instead there are bunch of char comparisons spread across this binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Like this one:\n </p>\n <pre><code>CMP BYTE PTR SS:[ESP+25], 40\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Gather those together (there should be some above the part that you've pased) and sort by the index (ESP+\n  <strong>\n   xx\n  </strong>\n  ). Converting the values after the comma (in this case 40) to ascii and printing them should give you the 'X'.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For the image we have:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   hac__h___rad_$E\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
