Fileless malware is still stored on disk just not directly on the filesystem. For example on windows systems most of the time fileless malware is stored in the registry which is not apart of the filesystem proper. You can get those types of samples from the same sources you cited.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The malware still exists, but hides its tracks differently and doesn't write to disk.
