    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to reverse engineer a Windows program. Using PE Editor, I find that the string in question - which I'm interested in - has got id 2820. The string is in this format: \"Some text, some text: %s\". Whenever this string appear in the program, about once per minute, five bytes (ASCII letters) appear where \"%s\" is. The letters seems to be random, but I think they are not and I'm interested to see what they are exactly. Hence the reverse engineering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, I have a hard time finding in the disassembly exactly where resource id 2820 is fetched. There's a lot of functions/procedures involving LoadResource() / LockResource() but there is no obvious constant of 2820 anywhere.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Question:\n  </strong>\n  Is it possible, using whatever debugger, to put a breakpoint on resource ID 2820 that will halt execution as soon as the resource value is fetched?\n </p>\n <p>\n  If not, what other approach can I use to find where in the code the resource is fetched, so I can dig deeper to see how the five bytes are created?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The larger the number, the fewer false positives one tends to see in the output.
