    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've been trying to modify a data file within an app which has random lines of readable text but is mostly incomprehensible, it has no file extension.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I think its compressed because I was able to find an older version of the same data file [same name, same location in game files] which has a much larger file size and is in plain text.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By default in the game files, the encrypted/compressed version is used but if I replace it with the older version it still works[all changes between them are however not present], this makes me think that the game does some sort of check to see if the file is compressed then decompresses it if appropriate.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What can potentially be done to decompress the current data file, or if its not compressed to convert it to plain text.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit 1:\nHere are links to the original data files:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ThunlNtdfwK_hiFpG6ioTkrTpd62E5KR/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   compressed\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mVU-gtYXglSCs6kX-fYWa5yu-neO-Nlo/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   uncompressed older version\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks Gordon Freeman.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
