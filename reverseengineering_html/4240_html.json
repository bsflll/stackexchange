The task of calling\n  <code>\n   gas\n  </code>\n  is usually left to the compiler, and most of the assembly that\n  <code>\n   gas\n  </code>\n  has to handle in real life is either\n  <code>\n   inlined\n  </code>\n  inside\n  <code>\n   C\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   C++\n  </code>\n  code or comes from a compiler. But, I believe\n  <a href=\"https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~prabal/teaching/eecs373-f11/readings/Assembler.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   this\n  </a>\n  document by\n  <strong>\n   Dean Elsner\n  </strong>\n  ,\n  <strong>\n   Jay Fenlanson\n  </strong>\n  &\n  <strong>\n   friends\n  </strong>\n  is by far the best reference I managed to rely on for quite sometime. It has been updated many times and it covers the 2.19.51 version.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The easy way would be to use\n  <strong>\n   GCC\n  </strong>\n  I would say :\n </p>\n <pre><code>  //Just to avoid make a point :]\n  typedef unsigned char byte;\n\n  //\n  byte lbl1[] = { 0x03, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, ... }, \n       lbl2[] = { 0x01, 0x00, 0x02, 0x00, ... };\n\n  //I prefer Intel syntax rather than AT&T, it's somehow cleaner !\n  __asm__(\"intel_syntax noprefix                 ;\"\n          \"mov eax, %0                           ;\"\n          \"mov ebx, %1                           ;\"\n          \"att_syntax prefix                     ;\"\n          :                        //output\n          : \"r\" (lbl1), \"r\" (lbl2) //input\n          : \"%eax\", \"%ebx\");       //clobber\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Well, this is a nice way if you want to concentrate on the assembly code (which is how I do it when I optimize code by hand).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, let me explain it a bit. First, you have two arrays containing the retrieved data, nothing fancy. Then you get the assembly code. If you're not familiar with\n  <code>\n   inlined\n  </code>\n  assembly I would recommend you\n  <a href=\"http://www.ibiblio.org/gferg/ldp/GCC-Inline-Assembly-HOWTO.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   this\n  </a>\n  link, though I'll briefly go over my code.\nThe\n  <code>\n   __asm__\n  </code>\n  directive lets you insert assembly instructions anywhere in a code. At first I tell the assembler that I'll be using Intel's syntax (no % prefix for registers, ...), then I move the content of the register %0 in\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  , and then the content of %1 in\n  <code>\n   ebx\n  </code>\n  (%0 is the pointer for\n  <strong>\n   lbl1\n  </strong>\n  , %1 is the pointer for\n  <strong>\n   lbl2\n  </strong>\n  ). Then, I switch to AT&T syntax for the rest of the parameters. After the first\n  <strong>\n   :\n  </strong>\n  you can specify output variables. After the second\n  <strong>\n   :\n  </strong>\n  you can specify inputs. In here I passed\n  <strong>\n   lbl1\n  </strong>\n  &\n  <strong>\n   lbl2\n  </strong>\n  and I used\n  <strong>\n   \"r\"\n  </strong>\n  to let the compiler handle register allocation. You can specify the registers if you know what you're doing. After the last\n  <strong>\n   :\n  </strong>\n  you have to declare the registers used inside the code so that the compiler frees them & uses them for the remaining code generation steps.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Especially if data is mixed up with instructions (shellcodes for example). You should trust none of tools you're using blindly, cross-reference their output if you want to efficient. Each one has its flaws &amp; its strengths. I can assure you that using <code>NASM</code> with <code>GNU</code> tools wouldn't affect your work, though it your final choice.
