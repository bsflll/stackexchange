Once you resume the process, type the command you want (which should trigger one of your breakpoints). If you traverse up the callstack some number of frames, you should find a function that contains the scope for the \"processing of the commands\". If you're looking for the parser, specifically, there's another (similar) pattern you can use.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
