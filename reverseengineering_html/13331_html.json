    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  This is a korean MMORPG released back in 2001. The game and the company no longer exists. I've been analyzing the file formats as a personal project for awhile now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have already decoded the textures and script files. I only have 2 more files left to decode:\n  <code>\n   .ani\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   .obj\n  </code>\n  . With the extensions, I would guess that the\n  <code>\n   .ani\n  </code>\n  contains the animation and\n  <code>\n   .obj\n  </code>\n  contains the 3d models. As the title of my question would suggest. I'm currently working on the\n  <code>\n   .obj\n  </code>\n  file.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  What I Know\n </h2>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   .obj\n  </code>\n  files are actually archives that contains one or more models. But exclusively 3D models (biped) because the textures are found on another archive with the extension\n  <code>\n   .t16\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   .tex\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'll take the 22nd model inside the file\n  <code>\n   def.obj\n  </code>\n  as an example. I have also taken it out of the archive and saved it as a file called `def_022.obj.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From here on, I'll call the 22nd model\n  <code>\n   Armor of Eagle\n  </code>\n  . The next image is the texture for the\n  <code>\n   Armor of Eagle\n  </code>\n  found on\n  <code>\n   def.t16\n  </code>\n  :\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OXODV.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OXODV.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Armor of Eagle in-game:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8ttpa.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8ttpa.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  A\n  <code>\n   def_inf.txt\n  </code>\n  file has this related line:\n </p>\n <pre><code>filename    LODstep polycnt\narmor_eagle 0       313     // eagle = index 22\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  In general, the structure of\n  <code>\n   .obj\n  </code>\n  is:\n </p>\n <pre><code>06 00 00 00 03 00     // don't know what\n3C 00                 // total number of models in this list\n01 00 9E 00 00 00 9E 00 00 00 78 00 00 00 78 00 00 00 // the first model on the list with 0x9E polygons and 0x78 verticies\n01 00 64 00 00 00 64 00 00 00 61 00 00 00 61 00 00 00 // the 2nd model\n....... // continues until you reach the end of the headers\n....... // then the bodies start, actual 3d data\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This is how the headers looks:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/duJ5J.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/duJ5J.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Cyan:\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     39 01 00 00 = 313 polygon count\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     18 01 00 00 = 280 vertex count\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     AD 00 6B 00 = unknown\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <h2>\n  About def_022.obj\n </h2>\n <p>\n  The face indices start at\n  <code>\n   0x4C [00 00 01 00...]\n  </code>\n  \n\n  and by the looks of it ends at\n  <code>\n   0x7A2 [...A2 00 A3 00]\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was using the tool called\n  <code>\n   hex2obj 0.24c\n  </code>\n  but didn't have any luck in guessing the starting points of the vertices and uv list.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xiRGV.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xiRGV.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Yellow: seems to me that it is the chunk marker.

Clearly, the numbers at the end are floating point numbers. Also, they are not\n  <em>\n   all\n  </em>\n  floating point; the sequence\n  <code>\n   0C 00 00 00\n  </code>\n  a few bytes in is\n  <em>\n   not\n  </em>\n  a reasonable floating point number. Counting off to the next \"unreasonable\" value (which happened to be\n  <code>\n   0C 00 00 00\n  </code>\n  again, but there are other values as well) told me the\n  <em>\n   stride\n  </em>\n  of this data was\n  <code>\n   28\n  </code>\n  bytes. (Which is 40 in decimal, but for documentation I strongly prefer hex.) If you have a capable hex viewer of which you can adjust the view width, you can see that this is correct if you set its view width to 40 characters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Counting back from the end in 40-byte steps gave me the most likely starting point of this sequence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The digits right before it are clearly at least 2-byte (unsigned short), and sort of increase from the start to the end. As this is a 3D model, I had a strong hunch they form\n  <em>\n   triangle data\n  </em>\n  , so at least they should contain\n  <code>\n   a\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   b\n  </code>\n  , and\n  <code>\n   c\n  </code>\n  vertex indices, and possibly additional triangle attributes. This turned out, by trial and error, to be not the case. (The \"trial and error\" consisted of dumping them into a display program. As that worked straight away, further numerical investigations were unnecessary.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since this information is (1) enough to display an object, and (2) covers all of the data in the file apart from the few bytes at the start â€“ which can be anything â€“ I went on writing a full display program.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  The first\n  <code>\n   004A\n  </code>\n  bytes are unknown. They contain some floating point numbers (\n  <code>\n   00 00 80 3F\n  </code>\n  is\n  <code>\n   1.0\n  </code>\n  , as a little endian 4 byte floating point number), and they could be anything. (A scale is likely.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  The next 2 bytes form the number\n  <code>\n   0016\n  </code>\n  , which is in decimals\n  <code>\n   22\n  </code>\n  . This could be the internal 'object number'.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, starting at\n  <code>\n   004C\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   113h\n  </code>\n  (313, in decimal)\n  <em>\n   triangle definitions\n  </em>\n  follow. A single triangle definition consists of 3 unsigned short indices\n  <code>\n   a\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   b\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   c\n  </code>\n  , which point to 3\n  <em>\n   coordinates\n  </em>\n  . The largest index in this list is\n  <code>\n   0117\n  </code>\n  , a significant number!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Right after this,\n  <code>\n   0118\n  </code>\n  <em>\n   3D points\n  </em>\n  follow. Each 3D point has the following structure:\n </p>\n <pre><code>float x\nfloat y\nfloat z\nfloat unknown (usually 1.0?)\nunsigned int unknown\nfloat normal_x\nfloat normal_y\nfloat normal_z\nfloat u   \\\nfloat v   / correct; see bottom update\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Affirming that the 3\n  <code>\n   normal_*\n  </code>\n  variables indeed form a normal can be done by adding their squares together; they should hover around a value of\n  <code>\n   1.0\n  </code>\n  . That is correct for the first hundred or so of these coordinates, up to 3 decimals of accuracy:\n </p>\n <pre><code>1.000004\n1.000080\n0.999935\n1.000076\n0.999936\n(and so on)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Adding up the sizes of all coordinate elements leads to a total size of\n  <code>\n   28\n  </code>\n  bytes (40, in decimal), and:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   the remaining part of the file is a multiple of this;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   dividing the size of the remaining part by\n   <code>\n    28\n   </code>\n   results in\n   <code>\n    118\n   </code>\n   (280, in decimal).\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  The significance of the 'highest index' in the triangle list is therefore proven :) They are indeed coordinate indices.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Where do these numbers\n  <code>\n   139h\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   118h\n  </code>\n  come from? They appear in the header part of the entire file!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is the proof that the first 3 elements are indeed\n  <em>\n   x\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <em>\n   y\n  </em>\n  , and\n  <em>\n   z\n  </em>\n  . I plotted\n  <em>\n   x\n  </em>\n  and\n  <em>\n   y\n  </em>\n  only, with\n  <em>\n   y\n  </em>\n  inverted (negative towards the bottom of the screen). You can clearly recognize the 'body' part of your in-game image.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kJQgG.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"a wireframe body\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kJQgG.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Not\n  <em>\n   all\n  </em>\n  coordinates are quite the same. The\n  <code>\n   unknown_1\n  </code>\n  float value is\n  <code>\n   1.000\n  </code>\n  for the first 173 coordinates, then jumps to other values for the remainders. Similarly, the integer\n  <code>\n   unknown_2\n  </code>\n  hovers between values from\n  <code>\n   4\n  </code>\n  to\n  <code>\n   43\n  </code>\n  for these, and then jumps to a much higher value. This needs some further investigation.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  The\n  <code>\n   u\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   v\n  </code>\n  values can be mapped onto the source image directly. They are expressed in a floating point range from\n  <code>\n   0..1\n  </code>\n  so you need to multiply them by the source image's width and height. Here is an image of that:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pVv4j.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"texture coordinates\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pVv4j.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The unused parts of the image are presumably used by other 3D models.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
