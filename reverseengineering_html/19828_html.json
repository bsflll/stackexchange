If yes could someone please direct me towards it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am glad my friend asked me this question since it was something which I didn't notice earlier because there had not been a time where there was any need of the address where the registers are located.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Registers are named locations of a dedicated size residing in the CPU (as pointed out by Paweł). That is, while the registers comprise a big part of the state of a CPU, they are not on the stack (which is usually in memory). However, you may want to edit your question to explain better what you need. I have a hunch you may be interested in stuff like the return address on the stack or the\n <code>\n  push\n </code>\n -ed\n <i>\n  register values\n </i>\n (\n <b>\n  not\n </b>\n <i>\n  registers\n </i>\n ). You really need to edit your question to make clear what you want.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Which states that it is usually stored in memory and not on the stack.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was a doubt and I am glad that I got a clarification.
