But SQL server data traffic is encrypted. So I downloaded Microsoft Tools like\n  <code>\n   Microsoft SQL server manager\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   Microsoft Message Analyzer\n  </code>\n  and starting out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Question\n  </strong>\n  \n\n  Are there ways to figure out \"which data is where\" in a DB?\n  \n\n  What must be my approach to understand the database?\n  \n\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Once you have the db schema, this will give you an insight into its structure, and how the tables cooperate.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
