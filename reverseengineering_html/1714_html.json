Ideally, a solution equivalent to\n  <code>\n   strace\n  </code>\n  or e.g. a manipulated javaVM\n </p>\n <p>\n  The same applies on Android - Is there a way to trace all Android framework API calls (or other essentially DalvikVM functions) an application makes without any editing at all of the APK file? All other editing of the environment/system is fine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In my ideal world, the analyst would get the following output, while running an UNEDITED application (\n  <code>\n   .jar\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   .apk\n  </code>\n  ):\n </p>\n <pre><code>timestamp1: java.security.SecureRandom.getSeed() called. Arguments: (Number) \ntimestamp2: javax.security.cert.X509Certificate.checkValidity() called. Arguments: (null)\n...\ntimestamp3: java.sql.Connection.prepareStatement() called. Arguments: (\"SELECT * FROM X WHERE Y = W\")\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
