I pretty sure this is continuously function of that dll but this line show up. So what is this line and can i remove it for my static reverse stage ?\nThanks all\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

For example, you can see another one after the unconditional\n  <code>\n   jmp\n  </code>\n  , and there should be one after each\n  <code>\n   retn\n  </code>\n  instruction. In graph view they correspond to the end of function graph nodes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The most probable cause for the one after call is that the called function has been detected as\n  <em>\n   non-returning\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can go inside the call and see if \"Attributes: noreturn\" is printed in the function header. If the function does, in fact, return, you can clear the flag by editing the function properties (\n  <kbd>\n   Alt-P\n  </kbd>\n  ).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
