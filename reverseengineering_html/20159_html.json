So arr[0] = 0x1134,arr[1] = 0x4567. That's what i want!\nSo,i'm wondering how can i do that with IDAPython,or IDC?\nThe only thing i have known so far about IDC or IDAPython is writing a script to dump memory to a file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is the Link from where i learned to dump memory:\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42744445/how-in-ida-can-save-memory-dump-with-command-or-script\">\n   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42744445/how-in-ida-can-save-memory-dump-with-command-or-script\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I would appreciate if someone could give me a hint or walk me through with basic ideas on how to solve this problem.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
