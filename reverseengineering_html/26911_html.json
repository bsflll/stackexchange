    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <pre><code>#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\n\n    int number1, number2, sum;\n\n    printf(\"Enter two integers: \");\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &number1, &number2);\n\n    \n    sum = number1 + number2;\n\n    \n    printf(\"%d + %d = %d\", number1, number2, sum);\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So this is my simple C code and it has only three variables only but when I'm debugging it in disassembly the value of\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  is also copying in other 'variable looked' like r/m32 addresses, I can't figure out why it is doing this. It can't be compiler generated code because I've switched off those options.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Ba6XC.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's the starting disassembly see the value of\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  is going to variables (\n  <code>\n   sum\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   number2\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   number1\n  </code>\n  ) but why it is going to\n  <code>\n   [ebp-18h]\n  </code>\n  and so on. Also these\n  <code>\n   [ebp-18h]\n  </code>\n  is not used in any other place in disassembly. It's just shown here.\nAnd other question is why\n  <code>\n   0CCCCCCCCC\n  </code>\n  is moved into\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
