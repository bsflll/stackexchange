Thanks to this\n  <a href=\"https://tuts4you.com/download.php?list.9\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   site\n  </a>\n  , I have an idea of the capabilities of the plugins for OllyDbg.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As I have only a very basic idea of how plugins work, I was wondering, do plugins interfere with each other? For example, if I use multiple plugins that deals with the same anti-debugging techniques, is it possible that they may conflict with each other and mess with what I would ideally want, which is to hide my debugger? Thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Generally you should only keep plugins that you use.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The best anti-debugging plugins for Ollydbg as of now are\n  <em>\n   <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/NtQuery/scyllahide\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    ScyllaHide\n   </a>\n  </em>\n  for user-mode and\n  <em>\n   <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/mrexodia/titanhide\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    TitanHide\n   </a>\n  </em>\n  for kernel mode. Both of them are open source and well maintained.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
