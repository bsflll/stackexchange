I could imagine that the Java runtime on Windows uses the Internet API or WinHttp or something comparable, or brings its own SSL implementation (I couldn't find out what njssl is with a quick search).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Assuming it's the Internet API, you'd be able to read unencrypted data by hooking\n  <code>\n   HttpSendRequest(Ex)[A/W]\n  </code>\n  for example, and the SSL stuff then is handled from there and finally it uses regular sockets but at this point the data is encrypted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd try to run the application, attach to the right Java runtime (I guess some java.exe will be running somewhere) and either look through loaded DLLs, or maybe put a breakpoint on standard low-level socket calls (\n  <code>\n   socket\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   send\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   recv\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   WSASend\n  </code>\n  etc.) and look at the call stack to maybe figure out what upper layers the call came from.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Implementing some kind of Man-in-the-Middle-attack (either before or after the encrypted packet leaves the network interface) is only possible if server certificates are not validated by the client program, which is why the question rather was about hooking code BEFORE the encryption occurs to begin with. Thanks anyway though.</span>",
