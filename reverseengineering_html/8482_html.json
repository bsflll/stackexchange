    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am totally new to reverse engineering science and does not know much about the assembly language. By the way, I am working on a data set of disassembled malicious files available at\n  <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   kaggle\n  </a>\n  . These files are generated by IDA Pro and I do not have access to executable files or IDA Pro.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In addition, I have read several papers on this topic and tried to implement one of them,\n  <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1653662.1653736\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   this one\n  </a>\n  . However, I need to generate a\n  <strong>\n   Function Call Graph\n  </strong>\n  from these codes. I have googled for hours, but could not find any open source tool to\n  <strong>\n   statically\n  </strong>\n  generate this graph from disassembled files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am a computer science student, hence, as is expected, I am willing to implement one if there are no ones out there, however, I do not know how or where to begin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To sum it up, I have the following questions:\n </p>\n <pre><code>1- How to generate function call graphs from disassembled files, statically?\n2- Are there any algorithms, tools, or libraries to do this task or similar ones?\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Regards\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You can do that looking for the\n  <code>\n   ============= S U B R O U T I N E ============\n  </code>\n  comments that IDA emits, or checking the\n  <code>\n   sub_XXXX proc [near|far]\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   sub_XXXX endp\n  </code>\n  markers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then, to find your connections, look for the\n  <code>\n   call\n  </code>\n  statements in each of these procedures.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Last, you need to layout the boxes and draw connections. You could use\n  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphviz\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Graphviz\n  </a>\n  to do that (you need to write a definition file in a syntax they call \"dot language\"), or check the Wikipedia\n  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_drawing\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Graph drawing\n  </a>\n  page, which has explanations of the algorithms used, as well as links to various other software packages which might fit your need better.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
