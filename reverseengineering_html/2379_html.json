    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this but I'm stumped. I'm looking at iOS code as follows.\n </p>\n <pre><code>- (NSString *)currentE6Location {\n    CLLocationCoordinate2D loc = [AppDelegate instance].mapView.centerCoordinate;\n    return [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%08x,%08x\", (int)(loc.latitude*1E6), (int)(loc.longitude*1E6)];\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So it's pretty simple.. From my understanding is they are taking a lat/lon and changing it from a float to an int then converting the int to a hex that is 0 padded in the front. So the hex value is 8 chars in length. The issue I'm having is do the same thing in python..\n </p>\n <p>\n  So the iOS app sends hex values like\n </p>\n <pre><code>36.968772,-122.013498   \"0234194f,f8ba38ae\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The first set are lat/long and the 2nd are roughly their hex values\n </p>\n <p>\n  The lat works just fine\n </p>\n <pre><code>0234194f = 36968783\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So \n    36968783 / 1e6 = 36.968783 (like I said its a rough estimate between the two)\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the 2nd one is odd\n </p>\n <pre><code>f8ba38ae = 4172953774\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The seem to use a 4 there if it's a - value for lon since you can't have a negative int has a hex value. So dropping the 4\n </p>\n <pre><code>172953774 / 1e6 = 172.953774 (so knowing the 4 is there it would be -172.953774)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So I'm a bit stumped on why it works fine for the lat but not the lon..\n </p>\n <p>\n  Again sorry if this is the wrong site for this.. please close if it is.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Essentially the issue is that\n  <code>\n   %x\n  </code>\n  treats the argument as an unsigned int. So the value\n  <code>\n   f8ba38ae\n  </code>\n  is the two's complement representation of the original signed int.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can convert it back easily, though, for example with this Python snippet:\n </p>\n <pre><code>>>> import struct\n>>> struct.unpack('>i', 'f8ba38ae'.decode('hex'))[0]\n-122013522\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
