Static analysis by itself can be difficult if the binary is obfuscated and packed. There is a risk where the file could exploit a vulnerability in the program doing the analysis, but this is fairly uncommon, though you should still keep you systems up to date and run as an unprivileged user.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some disassemblers you could try:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    objdump\n   </code>\n   . You can use the\n   <code>\n    objdump\n   </code>\n   disassembler to dump the disassembly of the binary. The command\n   <code>\n    objdump -D yourbin\n   </code>\n   will disassemble all sections.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    IDA Pro\n   </code>\n   . You can grab a free trial of IDA Pro from their website.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    Hopper\n   </code>\n   . Hopper also has a free trial you can use. Its cost is much cheaper than IDA Pro if you do decide to purchase.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://www.backerstreet.com/decompiler/decompilers.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   This page\n  </a>\n  lists some decompilers you could try. I haven't tried any of them (except for IDA Decompiler, which is expensive), so I can't vouche for how well they work.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
