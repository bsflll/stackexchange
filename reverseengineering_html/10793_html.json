Normally, the start and end address are determined from the disassembly - the start address is the target address of\n  <code>\n   call\n  </code>\n  instructions, the end address is where the code has a\n  <code>\n   ret\n  </code>\n  instruction (*).\n </p>\n <p>\n  In your case, IDA failed to make a function from your code, probably because there is no call to\n  <code>\n   start\n  </code>\n  , and maybe there's not even a\n  <code>\n   ret\n  </code>\n  at the end. You can try to fix that by moving the cursor to the\n  <code>\n   start\n  </code>\n  label and pressing the\n  <code>\n   P\n  </code>\n  key. Once your code is defined as a function, the space key should switch between graphical view and assembly view just like your tutorial says.\n </p>\n <p>\n  (*) Actually, it's a bit more complicated; some parts of the function may be behind the\n  <code>\n   ret\n  </code>\n  ; but IDA detects this from jumps within the function.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
