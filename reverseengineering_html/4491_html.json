It did the exact same thing but just differently.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

According to\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/1407.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   the IDA debugger documentation\n  </a>\n  , the action is supposed to be a test. It's unclear if it explicitly allows assignments or if it's just a side effect that sometimes works.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Try something like this instead:\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/170.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   SetRegValue(al-1, \"al\")\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I don't have IDA on hand to test this out, but the function returns true so it might avoid the problem you're seeing.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
