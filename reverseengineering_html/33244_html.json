Anyway your post is too short to understand what you are trying to do, especially as you don't describe anything about the run-time environment, thus the app this code belongs to.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

If you decompile and recompile + resign it with apktool does the recompiled app work at all? If that isn't the case you don't have to start modifying it.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
