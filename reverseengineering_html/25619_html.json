This can be opened with View -> Open Subviews -> Hex Dump. If necessary right click \"Synchronize with ...\" and specify view to sync with.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can right click to select option to \"Edit...\" in this view. Once done editing right click again and you can select option to \"Apply Changes\" or hit F2.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
