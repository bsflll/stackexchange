    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a floppy disk image which I am trying to load with Bochs Emulator.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is from a CTF challenge and can be downloaded from here:\n  <a href=\"http://squarectf.com/2017/floppy.img\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   http://squarectf.com/2017/floppy.img\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am using Bochs version 2.3.9 on Windows 7 x64\n </p>\n <p>\n  I started Bochs.exe and configured the memory and disk settings as shown below:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Memory options:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HjvEp.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HjvEp.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Disk and Boot options:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4dYKf.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4dYKf.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, when I start the emulator, it gives the following error:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1xUyl.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1xUyl.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have seen a writeup online for this CTF that describes the same method for loading the disk image and it worked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Please let me know why it does not work for me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note: I am able to load the disk image using qemu-system-x86_64 or qemu-system-i386 on Linux already. However, I want to understand why I cannot load it with Bochs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I even tried the method of creating a bochsrc file and loading it using bochsdbg.exe as shown below:\n </p>\n <pre><code>bochsdbg.exe -f bochsrc -q\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However, I still get an error while loading it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Update:\n  </strong>\n  I am able to load the image in Bochs emulator by selecting floppy as the boot device under Boot options.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, I cannot load the image using bochsdbg.exe. Below is my bochsrc.txt file:\n </p>\n <pre><code>romimage: file=$BXSHARE/BIOS-bochs-latest\nvgaromimage: file=$BXSHARE/VGABIOS-lgpl-latest\nmegs: 16\nata0: enabled=1, ioaddr1=0x1f0, ioaddr2=0x3f0, irq=14\nata0-master: type=disk, path=\"floppy.img\", mode=flat, cylinders=2, heads=16, spt=63\nboot: floppy\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And I get the following error message:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Bochs is exiting with the following message:\n[      ] bochsrc.txt:5: ataX-master/slave: unknown type 'floppy'\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The reason I want to have a proper bochsrc file is because I want to use IDA Pro to debug the boot sector.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

When I renamed it to something else, it worked. In your example, you're naming it to\n  <code>\n   floppy.img\n  </code>\n  , so you could try something else.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It's a bit of a guess, but seems like bochs doesn't like files with reserved words, like disk or floppy.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
