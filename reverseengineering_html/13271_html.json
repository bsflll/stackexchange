Try to get any other python plugins available on hex-rays\n <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download.shtml\n </a>\n and put it in the same directory. Check if IDA is able to see it after restart. Of so - your plugin is not formatted well. If not - possibly this is a wrong folder.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
