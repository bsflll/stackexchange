    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I want to find and edit the values for the motion blur effect in Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 on PC (Windows, DX11) to be more in line with the PS3 version (and the other Storm games on PC as well). The PS3 version uses a very nice per-object motion blur while the PC version uses a crappy camera blur. The ultimate goal of this is to transfer this motion blur over to Storm 4 on PC which uses the same engine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All of my findings are documented here:\n  <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xxqOxLJwt04sgnIKqHHlfr8Gu6V_4toOFHv52P1FYEY/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xxqOxLJwt04sgnIKqHHlfr8Gu6V_4toOFHv52P1FYEY/edit?usp=sharing\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
