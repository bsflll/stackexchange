As per IDA documentation:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   This command allows you to specify how the stack pointer (SP) is modified by the current instruction.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   You cannot use this command if the current instruction does not belong to any function.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   You will need to use this command only if IDA was not able to trace the value of the SP register.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Usually IDA can handle it but in some special cases it fails. An example of such a situation is an indirect call of a function that purges its parameters from the stack. In this case, IDA has no information about the function and cannot properly trace the value of SP.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Please note that you need to specify the difference between the old and new values of SP.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The value of SP is used if the current function accesses local variables by [ESP+xxx] notation.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  This can also be verified by removing the call rcx instruction and confirming it removes the SP Analysis failed error in IDA.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Based on the 2nd version with uploaded ELF the problem is IDA hasn't detected the end of the function correctly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/t02bN.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/t02bN.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Right clicking the function\n  <strong>\n   foo\n  </strong>\n  in Functions view and selecting Edit function and changing the end address to 0:000000000000006C fixes the SP analysis problem.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When trouble shooting SP Analysis failures also enabling Stack Pointer in\n  <strong>\n   Options\n  </strong>\n  | General and selecting\n  <strong>\n   Stack Pointer\n  </strong>\n  can help you determine cause of problems, this will show the stack pointer value in green text to the left of instructions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KDiqP.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KDiqP.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The 3rd sample provided it's the same issue. To find the end of function, switch to Text view find the offset of retn and add one, for example the end of function in the last sample provided is 5D5.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The root cause of the problem is the redundant REX prefix (0x40) at the start. Normal 64-bit function prologs start with 55 48 89 E5 so IDA tries to create a function at address 1 which interferes with the actual function at 0 and makes it stop after one instruction. This planned to be fixed in future releases of IDA.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
