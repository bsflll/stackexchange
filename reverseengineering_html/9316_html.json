    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to locate the function that handles the Enter key press event from a dialog box in a very simple game (no directx afaik, game has a spashscreen that says \"Made with Macromedia\"). I think I've found the WndProc function (by xrefing RegisterClass calls and looking at the struct argument), but when I set a breakpoint at the top of the WndProc function, its never getting triggered?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any tips? thanks\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
