    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  In Ollydbg's hex dump window (lower left quadrant of CPU window) one can interpret data as structures, you can right-click on one or more bytes and see the options \"Decode as structure\" or \"Decode as pointer to structure\" (if more than one byte selected).  It then opens a new window with the data laid out vertically, with each data element shown as a row.  You can decode more than one instance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, I'd like to add my own structure types.  Imagine I have this structure:\n </p>\n <pre><code>typedef struct {\n           double x,y,z;   \n           unsigned char id;\n           int label;\n           char *name_string;\n           anotherStructType *struct;       \n           } model_type;\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Below are some images showing the steps, with the fixed structure type \"COORD\" chosen.  Imagine I want to decode it instead with the above 'model_type' structure type.  Perhaps the answer lies in some command line or .ini manual setting?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, it would be nice if this could be used along with labels to identify struct elements in the disassembly window, for example [EAX+1C] could be interpreted as 'player.id' if one could somehow tell Olly EAX is the base pointer.  But perhaps I'm getting carried away...\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YBsmI.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YBsmI.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EIXAu.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EIXAu.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tUIyb.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tUIyb.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

But I can't repeat it in my system, the compiler is optimizing it away and I get a much shorter program with hardcoded values fed to _printf.  I am using Visual Studio 6, compiling for Release with default flags.  I need to find my correct compiler or linker setting to make the full code appear that you have.</span>",

I found Blabb's answer worked with Ollydbg 2.01.   I found I could change the .ARG file and simply restart (ctrl-F2) to reload the defn's without having to stop and start Ollydbg like I feared (I thought it might only look at them when I launched Ollydbg).  Sadly in Olldbg when you spawn a structure, list, or other dump window from the main hex dump, it doesn't have the same capabiliites.  I can't spawn another decoded window from the *foo pointer to the 2nd struct type.</span>",

The <code>0x</code> prefix is optional, but required for numbers starting with alpha characters. The <code>.</code> suffix can be used for unsigned decimal numbers: <code>10.</code> Also <code>TBYTE</code> is 10 bytes in size (which is required for fields using the <code>LDOUBLE</code> type). But it was awkward to figure this out before learning everything was in hex. For character arrays, the <code>ATEXT</code> type can be used. I've written up more in-depth documentation on the format, there's a lot to it, but it's definitely experimental: <a href=\"https://github.com/trigger-segfault/Ollydbg-Argfile-Docs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">github.com/trigger-segfault/Ollydbg-Argfile-Docs</a></span>",
