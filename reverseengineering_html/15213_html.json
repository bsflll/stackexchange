    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm using\n  <code>\n   otool\n  </code>\n  on macOS to disassemble some simple C programs I built in order to gain a better understanding of assembly language.  I disassembled three programs, all of which consist of a single\n  <code>\n   printf\n  </code>\n  statement.  One prints the string\n  <code>\n   \"Hello, World!\n\"\n  </code>\n  , one prints a single integer formatted as a decimal, and the other prints two integers formatted as decimals.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My question regards the instruction\n  <code>\n   call _printf\n  </code>\n  .  The disassembly doesn't show\n  <code>\n   _printf\n  </code>\n  ; it shows the address of the\n  <code>\n   _printf\n  </code>\n  symbol.  I get a different address each time.  At first I thought this was because\n  <code>\n   gcc\n  </code>\n  converts any\n  <code>\n   printf\n  </code>\n  that doesn't use additional parameters to\n  <code>\n   puts\n  </code>\n  , but when I disassembled the third program I got still another address for printf.  The code looks like this:\n </p>\n <p>\n  First program:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0000000100000f76        callq   0x100000f82\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Second program:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0000000100000f7e        callq   0x100000f8a\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Third program:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0000000100000f7a        callq   0x100000f86\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I would like to gain a better understanding of how the glibc symbols are laid out in the executable.  I am of course using the Mach-O format, but I have a feeling this variation in addresses is more universal.  Also, given that the address is more or less random, how can one tell from the disassembly what function is being called?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In a relative call in 32-bit assembly, the operand is added to the address of the next instruction (instruction right after the call). Keep in mind the the operand would be signed in this case.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unfortunately, I don't know 64-bit assembly, but it seems to be similar.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you look at the addresses for program one and program two, you can see that the difference is 8. This is the same with their operands, so it isn't random.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://x86.renejeschke.de/html/file_module_x86_id_26.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Hear is a link describing calls in more detail.\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I couldn't find as good of an example for 64-bit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Try searching around for relative calls if that doesn't clear it up.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
