Why is there no clearly discernible separation of code and data? The answer seems to involve ARM literal pools.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm including information about ARM literal pools here because it seems relevant and because it took forever for me to find out about them on my own, so hopefully this saves others some time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  According to\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/15311/running-a-binary-identified-as-an-arm-excutable-by-binwalk-disasm/15317#15317\">\n   Ian Cook\n  </a>\n  (emphasis mine),\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   ...mixing of code and data is actually very common with ARM code.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   ARM instructions are fixed sizes (4 bytes on ARM, 2 bytes for THUMB) and have insufficient space to encode an 32 bit immediate value. Instead, ARM compilers usually do two things -\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    <p>\n     <strong>\n      they place 32 bit immediate constants straight after the instructions for the function\n     </strong>\n     in which the constants are needed, and\n    </p>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    <p>\n     they use PC-relative load instructions in the function to put these constants into registers.\n    </p>\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  This is similar to the information I found in the article\n  <a href=\"http://benno.id.au/blog/2009/01/02/literal-pools\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <strong>\n    The trouble with literal pools\n   </strong>\n  </a>\n  :\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   So, what is a literal pool? I’m glad you asked. The literal pool is an area of memory (in the text segment), which is used to store constants. These constants could be plain numerical constants, but their main use is to store the address of variables in the system. These addresses are needed because the ARM instruction does not have any instructions for directly loading (or storing) an address in memory. Instead ldr and str can only store at a ±12-bit offset from a register. Now there are lots of ways you could generate code with this restriction, for example, you could ensure your data section is less than 8KiB in size, and reserve a register to be used as a base for all data lookups. But such approach only works if you have a limited data section size. The standard approach that is taken is that when a variable is used its address is written out into a literal pool. The compiler then generates two instructions, first to read the address from this literal pool, and the second is the instruction to access the variable.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   So, how exactly does this literal pool work? Well, so that a special register is not needed to point at the literal pool, the compiler uses the program counter (PC) register as the base register. The generated codes looks something like:\n   <code>\n    ldr r3, [pc, #28]\n   </code>\n   . That codes loads a value at a 28-byte offset from the current value of PC into the register r3. r3 then contains the address of the variable we want to access, and can be used like:\n   <code>\n    ldr r1, [r3, #0]\n   </code>\n   , which loads the value of the variable (rather than the address) into r1. Now, as the PC is used as the base for the literal pool access, it should be clear that the literal pool is stored close enough to the code that needs to use it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    To ensure that the literal pool is close enough to the code using it, the compiler stores a literal pool at the end of each function\n   </strong>\n   . This approach works pretty well (unless you have a 4KiB+ function, which would be silly anyway), but can be a bit of a waste.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  However, in the\n  <a href=\"http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0473f/Bgbccbdi.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   ARM documentation for literal pools\n  </a>\n  , it is stated that\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   The assembler uses literal pools to hold certain constant values that are to be loaded into registers.\n   <strong>\n    The assembler places a literal pool at the end of each section\n   </strong>\n   . The end of a section is defined either by the END directive at the end of the assembly or by the AREA directive at the start of the following section. The END directive at the end of an included file does not signal the end of a section.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  I don't know jack about ARM, so this is confusing. I might make this a separate question. Anyway, the point is that literal pools appear to be the reason why code and data are mixed together in the ARM firmware visualized earlier. There is also something called\n  <a href=\"http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0474f/Cegbbcjj.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   scatterloading\n  </a>\n  , but I don't know if this has anything to do with the problem described here.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Question\n </h2>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   How can the problem posed for disassembly by the admixture of executable code and literal pools in ARM firmware be overcome?\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  According to\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/15311/running-a-binary-identified-as-an-arm-excutable-by-binwalk-disasm/15317#15317\">\n   Ian Cook (from the same answer as before)\n  </a>\n  (emphasis mine),\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   It's usual to see the immediate constants stored after the function in order of the addresses of the functions that access them. So, in this case, the function ends with the instruction at 0x00000F5C and the immediate constants would appear to span the address range 0x00000F60 to 0x00000FFF and I would usually expect the following function to begin at address 0x00001000.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Knowing this it would be possible for a disassembler to identify this pattern and automatically skip the associated data.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Yes, how? I tried disassembling both the ARM 32-bit Panasonic picture frame firmware and the ARM Thumb-2 SMOK-X Cube contraption firmware with\n  <code>\n   radare2\n  </code>\n  but it seemed like data was being disassembled along with code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since the location of literal pools after functions seems to be a common feature of ARM binaries, are existing disassemblers able to differentiate between code in functions and the data in their adjoining literal pools even when there aren't any symbols in the binary? This isn't the case with Capstone as far as I know.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
