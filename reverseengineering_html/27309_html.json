To see it, I checked the assembly of the test file that I made. I understood the passing of first four arguments through the register, the left arguments were passed through the stack but I didn't understood the assembly of the instruction. It looked like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov DWORD PTR 40[rsp], 6\nmov DWORD PTR 32[rsp], 5\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I don't know what does 40[rsp] means, maybe rsp+40 .\nIf anyone knows, please explain to me\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The first syntax makes a lot more sense in cases where the constant is the base address of an array, and the register contains a byte offset into that array. That's the use case the syntax was designed for.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
