I downloaded the file, opened it with\n  <code>\n   PEStudio\n  </code>\n  and it turned out to contain very many strings that were email addresses, one of which was the string I looked for in VT:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mgbDc.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mgbDc.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Please note, the number of extracted strings is pretty high.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, when I opened the executable in\n  <code>\n   IDA\n  </code>\n  , none of these email strings were found. The number of strings was much lower too. But, instead I found, for example, these strings:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ipq4G.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ipq4G.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does this possibly mean that the emails do not come from a pre-existing list but are generated by the executable?\n </p>\n <p>\n  In addition, I noticed some text file names in the\n  <code>\n   PEStudio\n  </code>\n  's string list, but they were also nowhere to be found in\n  <code>\n   IDA\n  </code>\n  's list. Is there any difference between\n  <code>\n   IDA\n  </code>\n  's and\n  <code>\n   PEStudio\n  </code>\n  (and similar tools') string extraction?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So this is only (marginally) useful when you are\n  <em>\n   interpreting\n  </em>\n  parts of the disassembly that use resources.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As Ida PRO does not parse common resource formats, it may not be able to show your strings in its \"Strings\" window, and always list them as raw data.
