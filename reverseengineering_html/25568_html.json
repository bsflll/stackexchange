These functions return the\n <i>\n  string address\n </i>\n for some internal variables -- presumably you want to set their\n <i>\n  value\n </i>\n to 0, right? Not the string contents? Then you need to trace back where these functions are called from and get their value assigned.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
