    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've been pointed here from the Cryptography Stack Exchange so hopefully you can help me here!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Long version of the story at the end....the short version is...\n </p>\n <p>\n  I want to identify this CRC/cipher/crypto and then I'll code it in C.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It's a challenge and response based exchange; a 4 byte challenge, and 4 byte response. They both change each time the exchange is carried out. Here's a real example\n </p>\n <pre><code>    12   35   5B   74\n    00010010    00110101    01011011    01110100    Challenge\n    00111000    10010000    00001001    10110101    Response\n    38 90 09 B5\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I'm able to feed it challenges and observe the responses without penalty - so I have this data too\n </p>\n <pre><code>    00  00  00  00\n    00000000    00000000    00000000    00000000    Challenge\n    10110101    00100000    01100011    10111011    Response\n    B5  20  63  BB\n\n\n    FF  FF  FF  FF\n    11111111    11111111    11111111    11111111    Challenge\n    11010101    00010000    10100001    00011110    Response\n    D5  10  A1  1E\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  If anyone can break/hack this for me I'll love you forever etc etc\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks Joe\n </p>\n <p>\n  Long version The exchange happens between the engine control module, the instrument pack, and the body control module in my car...it takes place over the CAN networks and authorises the engine control module to start the engine. I really want to use this engine in a project car but need to get rid of this immobilisation issue (and body controller and instrument pack too) first.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
