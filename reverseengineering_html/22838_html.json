    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've been researching on how to modify the textures of Crazy Taxi 3 for a while now and I have pretty much hit a brick wall.\n  \n\n  The game stores its texture assets in\n  <code>\n   .art\n  </code>\n  files, which, from what I understand, contain several textures in each of them, due to there being many banks of textures. There is also a\n  <code>\n   Sprites\n  </code>\n  folder containing these files that indicate the same.\n  \n\n  A quick Google search led me to believe that this may be the\n  <a href=\"http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/ART_(AOL_compressed_image)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   AOL Image Format\n  </a>\n  used in its software, however AOL 9.0 kept throwing errors when trying to open the files. No dice.\n  \n\n  After searching more I found that\n  <a href=\"http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/ART_(PFS:_First_Publisher)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   PFS: First Publisher used this extension as well for its clip art\n  </a>\n  . The files do not exactly match\n  <a href=\"http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/ART_(PFS:_First_Publisher)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   the structure documented in this wiki\n  </a>\n  , but every .art file has something that looks like a table of information\n  <em>\n   in that structure\n  </em>\n  at the start, and then possibly image data. I have also observed that the string\n  <code>\n   GXTX\n  </code>\n  is repeated many times, may suggest that it might be a pointer of the beginning of a new image.\n  \n\n  Other than that, I have no idea how this file format may work. It seems like it is uncompressed image data, however after opening it in many programs I have given up and need help.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   UPDATE 1\n  </strong>\n  :\n  \n\n  I have found a great tool called\n  <a href=\"https://forum.xentax.com/blog/?p=821\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Texturefinder\n  </a>\n  that helped me figure out that these textures are compressed with DXT, however I am unsure which version, as half of a certain texture bank may look great in DXT1, while another half looks jumbled until I switch to DXT3 or 5. The container format possibly has information on which algorithm to use in a table before the images, as at the start of each texture file there is plenty of non-image data, or at least data that this tool can not decide. Here are a few examples of this working in one algorithm vs the other:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Ukd5l.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"DXT1a @ 512px width\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Ukd5l.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jhI9l.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"DXT3 @ 256px width\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jhI9l.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, here is an updated list of what I have gathered:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    .art\n   </code>\n   files contain the string\n   <code>\n    GXTX\n   </code>\n   many times, usually followed by about 12 bytes that have small values (something like\n   <code>\n    80 00 80 00 00 80 00 00 01 00 05 00\n   </code>\n   ), likely an image separator\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"http://wiki.polycount.com/wiki/DXT\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    The files contain many textures compressed with DXT\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Textures may be compressed with differing forms of DXT (possibly DXT1 and DXT3)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Textures in banks may have differing widths/heights\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Every texture bank has a sizeable amount of non-image data at the start\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The textures are upside down\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://anonfiles.com/35E491Jcn5/samples_zip\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Here are some more samples for comparison.\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
