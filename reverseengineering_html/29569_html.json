You realize certain PE files that, for example, Windows 95 would have swallowed, or NT 4 or XP, will not work on latest Windows 10 or vice versa. Look for the corkami zoo of\n <code>\n  .exe\n </code>\n file samples (many of which are PE) and you will notice that some will be considered valid even by modern Windows, while others won't (but were in older Windows versions). That is: as it stands your question is far too vague to answer meaningfully. Please edit your question and add some context.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
