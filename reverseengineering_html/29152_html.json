However, in my scenario, I don't have an access to the GUI and I want to deploy\n  <code>\n   Ghidra\n  </code>\n  for Headless Analysis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For some reason, just copying the plugin files to\n  <code>\n   <ghidra_home>\\Ghidra\\Extensions\n  </code>\n  doesn't do the trick, and it looks like it only partially installs the plugin, and only the GUI way does the complete job.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any idea how can I programmatically install plugins for Ghidra?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Would you like to configure them?\"\n  </code>\n  dialog on starting the Ghidra GUI.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This dialog is part of the method\n  <code>\n   ghidra.framework.project.tool.GhidraTool#checkForNewExtensions\n  </code>\n  and the actual install process happens\n  <code>\n   ghidra.framework.project.tool.GhidraTool#addInstalledExtensions\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The problem is that during the headless processing there is no tool available, i.e.\n  <code>\n   state.tool\n  </code>\n  is\n  <code>\n   null\n  </code>\n  and these methods don't seem to be intended to be run in a headless context. I don't quite understand what specifically makes it work afterwards, but overall I am reasonably confident that this is an issue with the specific plugin, and the fact that it requires the\n  <code>\n   ServiceManager\n  </code>\n  to provide the service even for the analyzers (which should be available in headless mode after unzipping).\n </p>\n <p>\n  So this is an issue with this specific plugin which is somewhat hinted at in an already\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/astrelsky/Ghidra-Cpp-Class-Analyzer/issues/18#issuecomment-753588038\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   existing issue\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
