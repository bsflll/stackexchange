For example, I can not see the output of my hello world program, i can only see the registers and disassembled instructions...\n </p>\n <p>\n  anyone have a clue what key sequence to press to view the console output of the binary i am debugging?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you want to debug it, you'll have to start radare2 in debugger mode, with the\n  <code>\n   -d\n  </code>\n  flag, or reopen the binary in this mode with the\n  <code>\n   ood\n  </code>\n  command.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Your program's output will be display as usual, on the console:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ r2 -d /usr/bin/uptime\nProcess with PID 25656 started...\n= attach 25656 25656\nbin.baddr 0x557d50ca7000\nUSING 557d50ca7000\nAssuming filepath /usr/bin/uptime\nasm.bits 64\n -- Press 'C' in visual mode to toggle colors\n[0x7f016bfd4ca0]> dc\nSelecting and continuing: 25656\n 22:02:48 up  4:26,  6 users,  load average: 0.18, 0.25, 0.29\nPTRACE_EVENT_EXIT pid=25656, status=0x0\n[0x7f016bab5b68]> \n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
