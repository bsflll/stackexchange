How can I instruct IDA that the first element is a relative offset pointer?\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I mark the first element as being a 32-bit integer, the its simply the value 0x4AD2A, which IDA does not recognize as being an xref that I can follow. I cannot mark this 32-bit element as an offset (by pressing\n  <code>\n   O\n  </code>\n  ), since the address 0x4AD2A is not valid in this executable.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you are doing 32 bit stuff, I am officially clueless, and the only relative offsets in the 64 bit work I do are the RIP relative type.    However, I did notice the other day while browsing the configuration options of IDA that there's a tremendous list of things you can assign to keyboard shortcuts -- so you might be able to figure something.   Otherwise, I could write a quick Python based hotkey for you if I understood your crazy 32bit world.</span>",
