Sometimes I run a lot of commands and I would like to re-draw the current program state the way gef displays it when I step through the program (registers + stack + list view, etc...). Yes, I am able to get much of the same info with the\n  <code>\n   info registers\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   info frame\n  </code>\n  , etc... But I have not found a way to do this and it would be helpful.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
