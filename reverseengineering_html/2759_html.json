The documentation for using sos is a bit tricky to sort out IMO. This link is helpful for learning the sos commands:\n  <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb190764(v=vs.110).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb190764(v=vs.110).aspx\n  </a>\n  . To load SOS I use:\n </p>\n <pre><code>.loadby sos clr ; for .NET 4 and higher\n.loadby sos mscorwks ; for .NET 2\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However you have to wait until the .NET DLLs have been loaded before those commands work, so you either have to set a breakpoint or make sure the managed code has some kind of wait (for input or something else) to allow the process to load the .NET DLLs.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
