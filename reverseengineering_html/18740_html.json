So, is it moving an integer to a float register at\n  <code>\n   0x171\n  </code>\n  using\n  <code>\n   movups\n  </code>\n  ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I searched on Internet, but\n  <code>\n   movups\n  </code>\n  usually moves float to float, not integer to float...\n </p>\n <p>\n  Could someone tell me how we usually moves integer to\n  <code>\n   xmm\n  </code>\n  registers ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Data is data until it's interpreted however it needs to be interpreted at some point before it's used for something, so whether it's for optimization, faster calculation, or otherwise, data can be moved around however for any number of reasons. You'd have to reverse at least some part of the sub-routine you're in (and possibly other routines related to your value) to fully understand why the value is being transported as it is before finally being interpreted as an integer.</span>",
