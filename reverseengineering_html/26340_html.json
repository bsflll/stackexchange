You can basically iterate through the code and define undefined functions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  ExampleScipts:\n  <a href=\"https://www.programcreek.com/python/example/102513/idc.MakeFunction\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   IDA MakeFunction\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  However If you ask this question specifically for Ghidra then I believe there's a plugin to run idapython scipts in Ghidra.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/daenerys-sre/source\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Run IDAPython scripts in Ghidra\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hope this helps.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
