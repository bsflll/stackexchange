A hacky way to do it is to break before the function call and manually change my_password to the string that you wanted to test with. A more automated solution is the Binary Ninja plugin\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/pbiernat/ripr\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   ripr\n  </a>\n  . From its github page:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   ripr attempts to automatically generate a python class that is functionally identical to a selected piece of code by statically gathering sufficient information and wrapping it all into a \"harness\" for the unicorn emulator\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
