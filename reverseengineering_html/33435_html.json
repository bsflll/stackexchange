    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm currently analyzing a video file that has been wrapped in a .exe and protected using ThunderSoft Video Password Protect / DRM Protection v4.1. I'm trying to understand how the protection works and if there's a way to play the video on a different machine where the original credentials fail.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Details:\nThe original video is in .wmv format.\nIt's wrapped into an EXE built with Borland Delphi 6.0 â€“ 2010.\nThe DRM uses AES encryption.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The \"Play Password\" is generated based on:\nAn encryption key\nThe machine ID\n </p>\n <p>\n  If run on another device (even with the same password), it shows:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   \"Illegal password, inconsistent with the current machine code!\"\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  My questions:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   How can I bypass the machine ID check (e.g., patching JNZ to JMP)?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Is it possible to extract the WMV video from inside the EXE, or is it likely fully encrypted until runtime?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Are there known unpacking strategies/tools for ThunderSoft-protected files?\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   I own the file and password and just want to be able to run it on a secondary machine.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Attached is a sample of the encrypted file from the link provided, for analysis purposes only\n   <a href=\"https://pixeldrain.com/u/wRJfvCAg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    https://pixeldrain.com/u/wRJfvCAg\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Thanks in advance for any help, suggestions, or tools you recommend!\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
