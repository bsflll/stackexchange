    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a problem using IDA SDK function\n  <code>\n   del_struc_member(struc_t *sptr, ea_t offset)\n  </code>\n  ,\n </p>\n <p>\n  If i use it on a member, it creates a gap[4] on the offset ( for dword type), it doesn't recalc the struct and it doesn't shrink it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If i use another function from SDK,\n  <code>\n   expand_struc(struc_t *sptr, ea_t offset, adiff_t delta, bool recalc=true);\n  </code>\n  like so\n  <code>\n   expand_struc(struc, 4, -4, true)\n  </code>\n  ;\n </p>\n <p>\n  It does delete the member and shrink it, but it deletes other gap's that goes after (that are needed)plus it change the type of other members , for example:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   before\n  </em>\n  :\n </p>\n <pre><code>  int field_1204;\n  _BYTE gap4B8[4];\n  int field_1212;\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   after\n  </em>\n  :\n </p>\n <pre><code>  int field_1204;\n  __declspec(align(8)) int field_1212;\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  If i delete member manually by CTRL+E, it does shrink and doesn't create this problems with removing gap's.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What is correct way of removing a struct member and shrinking it ?\nP.S.\nMaybe i should set new type for all other gap's that are correct and only after that remove the member i don't need and shrink the struct . Or it would create same problems if its array ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
