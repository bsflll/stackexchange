My question revolves on what happens in the loop.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Let me explain what I exactly don't understand in the loop: Above the little loop\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  is set to be\n  <code>\n   FFFFFFFFh\n  </code>\n  , which is basically \"1\" in all the 32 bits in\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  (?). In the little loop\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  is incremented. But\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  is at max value? What happens when I increment\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  ? Will it go back to 0?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Nvjpq.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Nvjpq.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

However, by converting it into a do-while loop you can get rid of the unconditional jump and have only the conditional one at the end:\n </p>\n <pre><code>int pos = -1;\ndo\n{\n  pos++;\n} while (buf[pos]==0);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  While a minor optimization, it can improve branch prediction and over a bug binary result in substantial performance improvements. \nThis is most likely why you see the initial value of -1 which is represented as 0FFFFFFFFh.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
