I have almost no knowledge how they are done. I'm currently debugging an application which uses it's own custom FONT files to drawn letters, however I can only trace the drawing at a very high-level and can't connect it with DirectX API for example. I'm also curios if it is possible to use the VS new\n  <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh708963.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Graphics Debugger\n  </a>\n  to attach into a running process.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any clues about how to achieve this? I have no source code of the target application and I'm using IDA Pro + API Monitor.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm especially interested in drawing letters.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
