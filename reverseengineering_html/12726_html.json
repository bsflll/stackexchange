    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have made a plugin (using IDA Python) that requires the Hex-Rays plugin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As per the instructions in the\n  <code>\n   hexrays_sdk\n  </code>\n  folder, I've named my plugin starting with\n  <code>\n   hexrays_\n  </code>\n  to make sure it loads after Hex-Rays is done loading. However, IDA decides to load my plugin earlier, and hence, it never is able to get\n  <code>\n   True\n  </code>\n  for\n  <code>\n   idaapi.init_hexrays_plugin()\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've tried renaming my plugin in multiple ways, but still cannot seem to get the plugin to load after Hex-Rays.\n </p>\n <p>\n  BTW, I think the issue might be related to the fact that I am storing my plugin in\n  <code>\n   %IDAUSR%/plugins\n  </code>\n  rather than\n  <code>\n   %IDADIR%/plugins\n  </code>\n  since I do not want to modify\n  <code>\n   %IDADIR%\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there any kind of workaround to make the plugin load later? Or can I force IDA to load Hex-Rays earlier?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

            "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  When loading plugins, IDA goes through them alphabetically, and tries to load all the plugins.\nWhen loading a plugin, the loader check the plugin flags (\n  <code>\n   idaapi.PLUGIN_PROC\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   idaapi.PLUGIN_FIX\n  </code>\n  , and so on) to determine if the plugin should be loaded at the current time.\nIf it is to be loaded, the\n  <code>\n   init\n  </code>\n  method is called. A plugin can return\n  <code>\n   PLUGIN_KEEP\n  </code>\n  to remain loaded, or\n  <code>\n   PLUGIN_SKIP\n  </code>\n  to avoid loading.\nAs long as a plugin is not in memory (not yet loaded, or already unloaded,) IDA will try and load it again and again. This is how my\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/tmr232/Sark/blob/master/plugins/plugin_loader.py\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   plugin loader\n  </a>\n  works.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So the first thing you need to be sure of, is that you flag your plugin\n  <code>\n   idaapi.PLUGIN_PROC\n  </code>\n  , as this is when Hex-Rays loads (only when a processor module is active.)\nHopefully, this will solve it. If not - you can use\n  <code>\n   idaapi.load_plugin('hexrays')\n  </code>\n  to explicitly load the Hex-Rays plugin. Again, this can only be done when a processor module is active, so be sure to use\n  <code>\n   PLUGIN_PROC\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
