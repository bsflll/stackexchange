Now I want to transfer all knowledge to a new database for the new version of PE. How can I do this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  It seems that I need to compare all the functions and move the information if their contents match (the addresses may be different). How to do this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is clear that I need to calculate the hash from each function, find the intersections, and then compare the matched functions byte-to-byte. It's about whether there are ready-made tools for this?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
