It's Android 5.1 Lollipop which brought the change from Dalvik to ART and is a bit mistified.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As far as I understand, modifying boot.oat is not easy, and permanent, as this file is regenerated whenever a package installation is happening.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, I have a class which I need to modify (just a very tiny bit of it), which resides in\n  <code>\n   framework.dex\n  </code>\n  which was the part of\n  <code>\n   boot.oat\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have two questions:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   How can I repack\n   <code>\n    boot.oat\n   </code>\n   ? Taking into account that I haven't touch\n   <code>\n    boot.art\n   </code>\n   ?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   How can I make my change in\n   <code>\n    boot.oat\n   </code>\n   permanent? It's very well possible that I will install some new packages onto this system later, which will (might?) ruin my modification.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
