As am new to dbg i googled a lot as i wanted to make dbg work similar for me. As seen below this customisation would help me a lot with my work with all the data displayed instantaneously. I tried voltron from the below link but was unable to get it working with many errors.\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/snare/voltron\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/snare/voltron\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there any extension other than voltron so that i can get the output as shown in the link below? Would editing the .dbginit file help in any way?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Pg9JH.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://i.sstatic.net/Pg9JH.jpg\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  TIA\n </p>\n <p>\n  Regards\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Although PEDA is very good, it looks like it is not being actively developed anymore.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A newer incarnation of this idea is GEF (GDB Enhanced Features) (\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/hugsy/gef\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   GEF Github repo\n  </a>\n  ). It is written in Python as well and it has the advantage of bein\n  <em>\n   multi-architecture\n  </em>\n  (Intel, ARM, MIPS, etc.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Both require a minimal change in your .gdbinit to work, no tedious installation, dependencies or anything like that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Have fun debugging!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
