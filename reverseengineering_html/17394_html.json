Also, most likely, having 2 people working on the same\n  <em>\n   database\n  </em>\n  will slow down it instead of speeding up. It might speed things up when working on different, isolated, pieces of code/binaries and, still, communication between different time zones, agreeing things, explaining what one did to the other, etc... will slow down the project.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   What systems are used in such cases? IDA pro seems to be the most\n  popular choice for this MCU\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  IDA is the de-facto tool for reverse engineering, although other tools might be used. But, in any case: reverse engineering an ECU (probably) by 2 persons within a week? Yeah, no. I don't think it will work unless you find out people that already have done that. Good luck...\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Although you can try any of several existing (not sure how good they are) tools to parallelise work on the same IDA Pro database. IMMV. I recall there were several announced in the last few years.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/12054/is-there-an-actively-maintained-collaboration-plugin-for-ida\">\n   Is there an actively maintained collaboration plugin for IDA?\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/cseagle/collabREate\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/cseagle/collabREate\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/CubicaLabs/IDASynergy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/CubicaLabs/IDASynergy\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://solidarity.re/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://solidarity.re/\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  and so on.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Yeah, you can use it with a VPN but... no. Also, such tools, IMHO, create more problems than talking and sharing scripts/databases between reversers. Why? Let's say that 2 reversers worked in the same subset of functions. Which comments and names are correct? Which ones aren't?</span>",
