Most of the idioms you are citing are used by compilers to perform a precise task in a more efficient manner than what you can see in the manuals.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The best way to learn about it is to read compiler generated assembly code and/or shellcodes. They are a great source of assembly idioms.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is a list of good readings or links to investigate all these idioms:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1502958082\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    xchg rax,rax\n   </a>\n   by xorpd;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"http://www.hackersdelight.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Hacker's Delight (2nd Edition)\n   </a>\n   by Henry S.
