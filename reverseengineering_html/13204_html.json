Now, take your favourite debugger, I recommend you\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   x64dbg\n  </a>\n  and try this:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Attach and detach to the running process to see how IsDebuggerPresent changes\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Once it's attached, try to hide the debugger\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  By doing so, you'll understand the very basics about IsDebuggerPresents.\n </p>\n <p>\n  About SetWindowsHookExA, I've seen it used on legit apps countless times so I can guarantee you is definitely not a microsoft function whose purpose is to be used on \"naughty\" apps :)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
