    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  A key tool in reverse engineering is a good disassembler, so to ensure that a disassembler is performing properly, are there any good test suites available for use to test the correctness of a disassembler?  Are these architecture specific, or can they be configured to work across multiple object architectures?  A good test should include checking the more obscure architecture instructions and malformed portable execution files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is\n  <a href=\"http://sourceware.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/src/gas/testsuite/gas/i386/?cvsroot=src\">\n   one specifically for i86\n  </a>\n  that I have seen.  Are there any that are modular across architectures?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Therefore, disassemblers\n  represent the ﬁrst link of a long chain of stages on which any\n  high-level analysis of machine code depends upon. In this paper we\n  demonstrate that many disassemblers fail to decode certain\n  instructions and thus that the ﬁrst link of the chain is very weak. We\n  present a methodology, called N-version disassembly, to verify the\n  correctness of disassemblers, based on differential analysis\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Not sure if this is slightly off topic to your question but may be of interest to you.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
