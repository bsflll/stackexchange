It should have as low overhead as possible when instrumenting, can be integrated with angr/qiling or provide similar capabilities at low/lower overhead, hopefully easy to use and understand and has decent documentation and examples, and hopefully can be extended for custom needs if functionality is not available.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I researched about them, even though their github seems quite recent, both frameworks(triton and miasm) seem to be quite old, while triton is a bit newer. I came across miasm in regards to deobfuscation and it seemed great, but I am looking for something more extensive and faster(lower overhead if such thing exists). If you know of a newer tool/framework that can aid me, please post its name as it can help me a lot instead of reviewing papers for different conventions and betting on projects \"randomly\"(without any disrespect, just hoping for practicality).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you for your help.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you can write the advantages or disadvantages for each tool, it will be help me to make a wise decision. I am sure others will fun your answers lucrative and learn a lot from them as well.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
