    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have the code below, derived from the reversed function in the original application:\n </p>\n <pre><code>gladius::world::World::create(*(gladius::world::World**)(*(char*)(this + 0x5e8) + 0x50));\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The\n  <em>\n   create\n  </em>\n  function looks like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>void __thiscall gladius::world::World::create(World *this) {\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Could someone please describe the way the function is setup and may be simplify the notation above if possible?\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, this is a\n  <em>\n   create\n  </em>\n  function call, which takes as an argument the pointer to a particular address.\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   How the pointer address is calculated in this case?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   What is the exact meaning of (this + 0x5e8) + 0x50 - 0x5e8 offset to\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   and then 12th element of the structure (i.e. structure of 4 bytes - address 48? )\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   What 0x5e8 represents in this case (apart of being an offset, I mean what this offset could possibly point to)?\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  This is how it looks further in the code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>    this_01 = GUI::getWorld(*(GUI **)(this + 0x88));\n    gladius::world::World::create(this_01);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  where\n  <code>\n   GUI::getWorld(*(GUI **)(this + 0x88));\n  </code>\n  points to the following function:\n </p>\n <pre><code>World * __thiscall gladius::gui::GUI::getWorld(GUI *this)\n\n{\n  return *(World **)(*(longlong *)(this + 0x5e8) + 0x50);\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This is where the address (this + 0x5e8) + 0x50) came from.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I still don't understand the significance of these addresses, as\n  <em>\n   create\n  </em>\n  is a member function of World and it is called with an instance of that class as a parameter?\n </p>\n <p>\n  And the address of that instance is stored in class GUI on the address: (this + 0x5e8) + 0x50)?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or I am confusing the above and this + 0x5e8 points to some structure in the World class, which must be somewhere at 58/4 or at 58/8 address and then within that structure I am looking at 50/4 member?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
