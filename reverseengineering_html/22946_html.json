So in an unpack me style. In the first stage I would unpack with de4dot.\n  <strong>\n   After\n  </strong>\n  you unpack, the running application\n  <strong>\n   stops\n  </strong>\n  working.\n </p>\n <p>\n  dump and then again when I want to do the same process again stops working.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Even when I want to\n  <strong>\n   fix\n  </strong>\n  it with\n  <strong>\n   Universal_Fix\n  </strong>\n  , a result\n  <strong>\n   doesn't\n  </strong>\n  change.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I look at the application with\n  <strong>\n   dnSpy\n  </strong>\n  , there is no problem. Codes can be read. It remains stuck in the\n  <strong>\n   main\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   function\n  </strong>\n  when I want to run it.
