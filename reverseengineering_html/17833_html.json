    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  My Macbook A1342 broke and before I throw it away I want to try and salvage the screen. I don't have much knowledge of hardware (aside from building PCs, most of my skills exist at the software level) so I have no idea how I would go about doing this. I'm guessing buying some sort of control board to interface between video input and the [serial?] port of the LCD. Anyone know how I would go about doing this, or at least lead me in the right direction?\n </p>\n <p>\n  BTW I don't know of a better stackexchange for this question, so suggestions for that are also appreciated\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Modern high resolution LCD panels use complicated LVDS interface which requires specialized controller chips and with that screen resolution a standard microcontroller will struggle to push the data to it fast enough. If you nevertheless want to pursue this path,\n  <a href=\"https://electronics.stackexchange.com\">\n   EE SE\n  </a>\n  should give you some hints.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
