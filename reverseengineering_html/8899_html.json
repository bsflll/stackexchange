To the left of the disassembly there should be a list of hex digits that form the opcode and arguments. Perhaps you switched it off. Note that searching for binary bytes may lead to false positives.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

I don't think they created the text search for this purpose. I have a feeling that IDA uses POSIX regex, thus the '?' and similar markers won't work. Also\n <a href=\"http://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2493/ida-pro-list-of-functions-with-instruction\">\n  this\n </a>\n might be somewhat related. I guess you have to stick to idapython to find multiline instructions.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Try your text search to find each separate opcode. Note down the binary codes, then use these for the combined search.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
