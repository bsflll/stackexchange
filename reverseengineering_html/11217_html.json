    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've been attempting to build my own implementation of Nvidia's Surround functionality by using their DLLs within a more reliable and automatic system. I'm pretty new to this; I've been a programmer for a while, but I've never had need to do any reverse engineering like this, so apologies if I'm being profoundly dumb.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So far I have managed the following:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Found the names and addresses of the exported functions that relate\nto what I want to do inside NVCPL.dll.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Found the only exe that seems to load in a copy of that DLL (nvcplui.exe).\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Using API monitor, I found an instance of one of the DLL's functions\nbeing called at what seems to be the right time.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Put break points in the assembly of nvcpl.dll whilst attached to\nnvcplui.exe via x64_dbg\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Where I'm stuck:\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I was using API monitor, I couldn't seem to catch any direct calls to the function I was looking at (NvCplApiDisableSpan), I only ever found it in the stack before a wndproc call. Also, the break points that I placed in and around that function never get triggered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My current thoughts are that I'll need to \"see\" the assembly of the function being called so I can get to the next step of figuring out how to shape my calls to that function correctly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I thought perhaps that the function was being called by a different process, having being triggered to do so by nvcplui.exe, but according to procexp that's not the case; nvcplui.exe is the only process using that dll.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any advise you have for me would be greatly appreciated; I'm not averse to doing my homework, but I can't see a way forward without maybe getting hold of a copy of IDA, however, that's a\n  <em>\n   little\n  </em>\n  outside my budget.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
