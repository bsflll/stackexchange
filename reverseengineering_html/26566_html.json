It would likely end up in a deadlock situation, since the debugger loop - which could conceivably be in a separate thread - would inevitably break at some point, but there is no one to act on it. Is this out of curiosity? Otherwise, could you explain what it is you're trying to achieve rather than what you're doing?!\n</span>\n</body></html>",

In theory you could implement a custom debug-like functionality using signal or exception handlers or low level APIs but this is definitely something that would require a lot of work and unlikely to be very robust.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
