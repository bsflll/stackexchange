I came across the\n  <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff556539.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   NtLoadDriver\n  </a>\n  which simply loads a specified driver from the registry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Would this driver exist in user space, or in kernel space? Is it even possible for a non kernel mode driver to exist?\n </p>\n <p>\n  If it's that simple to load a driver in kernel mode (I'm assuming it's not) then why don't we see more malware in the form of drivers?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any insight or clarification would be greatly appreciated.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Since it's rare that a malware author would need to do something that can only be done from kernel-mode, there's usually not much value in writing a malicious driver.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Modern versions of Windows have very strict driver-signing requirements with regard to allowing a driver to load. Getting a legitimate driver-signing certificate is not easy to do for a malware author, and once Microsoft discovers that said certificate is being used to sign malicious drivers, Microsoft will revoke the certificate and prevent all Windows installations from loading drivers signed with that certificate.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
