I want to understand the code and how it works to hack it and maybe load other ROMs. It has a chip covered in black epoxy resin that may be the microcontroller, and right next to it there's a flash memory, specifically the Winbond branded W25Q64 64Mbit (8 Mbyte) memory. Since I have an EEPROM/Flash reader I extracted the data from it. This is the complete .bin file:\n  <a href=\"https://www.4shared.com/s/fYlAk9898gm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   https://www.4shared.com/s/fYlAk9898gm\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/drneW.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"dinax.bin file in HxD\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/drneW.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I dont know what kind of processing I need to do to make readable-like code. The binary contains recognizable data like the index of the games, but is not much more\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Can you identify serial output on PCB itself? Maybe there are some other ports/sockets that looks familiar and may be used to solder in/connect the debug/usb/serial to observe SoC on chip under epoxy?\n</span>\n</body></html>",
