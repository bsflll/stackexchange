    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am trying to extract the sprites from Railroad Tycoon 2. Having successfully extracted the files contained in the data .paks it uses, I am now stuck at trying to extract files from the .imb files it seems to use to store the sprites. There are also .pal files, I presume these are connected somehow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have uploaded a few of the .imb files here as an example:\n  <a href=\"https://mega.nz/file/l3hxwADD#rcOwsQEUliZ3ypX95ZwW4BElLk5rPzrfr63QKXQ0dOA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://mega.nz/file/l3hxwADD#rcOwsQEUliZ3ypX95ZwW4BElLk5rPzrfr63QKXQ0dOA\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hopefully someone can help.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Perhaps include hex dumps (in text, not image format) of any headers or other interesting parts of the .imb and .pal files?
