Is there a better method?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any idea or help is welcome!\n </p>\n <p>\n  edit:\n </p>\n <p>\n  thanks @Rok Tavčar I added an image of the data points as a 3d plot.\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VAVtQ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VAVtQ.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  It looks like two linear 2d surfaces but at some point it jumps a bit.\nI guess I can divide it as two linear functions. Now, I need to figure out how I do a 2d linear regression. If somebody could give me hint that would be grateful.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nevertheless, the .so library has more complex functions, which dimensional is higher (up to 6). So I can't plot it anymore. I need a more general approach but I will also give it a try to understand the disassembled arm code as  @0xC0000022L suggested.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you already used NN you know that they can get output only if they see it in training set. For example in this case you would need to train NN on all possible outcomes. Another problem or how NN works is that they to set linear borders in each dimension of input data and try to find best match on which side of border is correct result. This is mostly usefull when output is discrete not continous.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What you could do beside disassembly is use\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   SMT\n  </a>\n  solver, but you will still need to know something about function you are trying to reverse.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another out a box idea is that with so low possible combinations you can easily (Unless your function is slow) draw graph of (almost) all combinations and try to guess function.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
