So a lot of common sense and presumably experience is required to deviate from the path outlined here when necessary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Okay, you have numerous options, and all of us probably have kind of a recipe for this.\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   I for one would start with\n   <a href=\"http://linux.die.net/man/1/file\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    <code>\n     file\n    </code>\n   </a>\n   (Windows version\n   <a href=\"http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/file.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    here\n   </a>\n   ).\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Assuming that fails, I would search the web for the hex values of the first 8 to 16 bytes to see what comes up. In addition I would throw in search terms that fit my scenario.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   That not yielding anything, I would proceed to see whether I can convince the tool\n   <a href=\"http://linux.die.net/man/1/strings\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    <code>\n     strings\n    </code>\n   </a>\n   to show me anything useful (there is a\n   <a href=\"http://live.sysinternals.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    Windows version of strings at Sysinternals\n   </a>\n   ). This may be sufficient already.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   However, if the file contains compressed or encrypted blobs, I would now bring in\n   <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/firmware-mod-kit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    firmware-mod-kit\n   </a>\n   . It'll build straight from SVN (tested it only a few days ago), comes with\n   <code>\n    binwalk\n   </code>\n   included and allows to also unpack some\n   <code>\n    initrd\n   </code>\n   s which cannot be unpacked by the vanilla\n   <code>\n    binwalk\n   </code>\n   . Alternatively you can try\n   <a href=\"https://gitorious.org/gpl-compliance-tools/gpl-compliance-scripts/blobs/master/find-firmware.pl\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    <code>\n     find-firmware.pl\n    </code>\n   </a>\n   (or in general the\n   <a href=\"https://gitorious.org/gpl-compliance-tools/gpl-compliance-scripts\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    set of scripts of which it is part\n   </a>\n   )\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Failing all that, I would open the file in a hex editor that supports some kind of binary templates (e.g.\n   <a href=\"http://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/templates.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    010 Editor\n   </a>\n   or\n   <a href=\"http://www.hhdsoftware.com/free-hex-editor\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    freeware Neo\n   </a>\n   ).\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  ... from there I would look for\n  <em>\n   patterns\n  </em>\n  . And that's where it gets really hard to describe how I tick, it's a visual thing. Basically I would be looking for offsets, but the patterns of\n  <code>\n   00\n  </code>\n  and non-\n  <code>\n   00\n  </code>\n  would also tip me off in some cases. Additionally I might use the histogram functionality, provided the hex editor has one, to see whether a particular blob of data is likely to be encrypted or compressed (which both makes for a relatively even distribution of the byte values). Knowing that the platform (PPC) is Big Endian, I would assume that the offsets will also be Big Endian. So that setting would be switched on and then I'll see whether I can decode the meaning of something like a file header. If I can, then I'll check all of the blobs that I find and see whether I can discern some kind of information from them, such as a compression algorithm. For example\n  <code>\n   gzip\n  </code>\n  has specific lead bytes, whereas raw\n  <code>\n   deflate\n  </code>\n  doesn't unless the programmer chose to use them. Failing all of that, I would have to assume this is some other compression format for the time being and would use the\n  <a href=\"http://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   LZMA SDK\n  </a>\n  as a reference to come up with a working theory which one (usually the\n  <code>\n   binwalk\n  </code>\n  step from before is responsible to do exactly that). Looking for fingerprints of these I would hopefully be able to extract the blobs that are files in their own right and can be handled by external tools.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If all of those previous methods would fail, I would set out to find a piece of software that is supposed to\n  <em>\n   know\n  </em>\n  the file format to some extent, such as a firmware flasher program which takes the firmware file as input.\n </p>\n <p>\n  NB: If your firmware blob comes from a driver, e.g. in Linux, you would of course start by looking into that driver for clues.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <h2>\n  Original answer (before it was clear that this is a firmware binary)\n </h2>\n <p>\n  I would start with the\n  <a href=\"http://linux.die.net/man/1/file\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   <code>\n    file\n   </code>\n  </a>\n  command (Windows version\n  <a href=\"http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/file.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  , thanks to amccormack - see his comment). It will usually tell you for the well-known executable formats for which OS (and kernel etc) it was built.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Example:\n </p>\n <pre><code># On an AIX 5.3 machine\n$ file python\npython: executable (RISC System/6000) or object module not stripped\n# Debian 6 on PPC64\n$ file python\npython: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, PowerPC or cisco 4500, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.18, with unknown capability 0x41000000 = 0x13676e75, with unknown capability 0x10000 = 0xb0401, stripped\n# Ubuntu 10.04, x64\n$ file python\npython: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.15, not stripped\n# Windows\n>file C:\\Python27\\python.exe\nC:\\Python27\\python.exe; PE32 executable for MS Windows (console) Intel 80386 32-bit\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Since this is a dump you obtained directly from the flash chip, there should be\n  <em>\n   some\n  </em>\n  readable strings (such as those from the bootloader for example), unless it is encrypted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You mentioned it's a PPC based device, so you can also search for common PPC opcodes (binwalk can do this, specify the -A option); you should see at least some opcodes pop out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another thing to check is the entropy of the binary data (binwalk's -E option can do this, as can many other tools). It is typical for firmware to have certain sections (such as the kernel and file system) compressed, and this will show up as separate, very high entropy sections inside the firmware image. Strings and code have a medium-ish entropy. Encrypted data has very high entropy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The hardware of the device can give you a bit of a clue as well. Devices with very little flash storage (say, 2MB or less) are unlikely to be running a large OS such as Linux for example; they are probably running a smaller RTOS of some kind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another thing to take into account is how you dumped the flash, what type of flash chip it is, and the flash chip's data bus. Parallel flash chips operating in 16-bit mode on little-endian systems for example have every two bytes flipped. So the string \"ABCD\" would be read out as \"BADC\" if you did a raw read of the chip in 16-bit mode. This would obviously mess up any signature-based analysis and cause strings to look oddly familiar yet simultaneously unreadable.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
