For all practical purposes in the scope of this site even people reverse engineering household electronics or other consumer goods are just that: reverse engineers. Malware is but one field of expertise within the niche subject of RCE.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And there are loads of fields within RCE. Heck, have a look on\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/\">\n   meta.RE.SE\n  </a>\n  to see what some want to be within the scope of this site and others don't (and participate, please!). Given that by comparison the RCE community is a relatively small one, I don't think anyone will look down on you for being a beginner or specializing in this or that. Instead, I reckon, you'll be welcomed and the only expectation is the willingness, ability and - yes -\n  <strong>\n   eagerness\n  </strong>\n  to learn.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is no clear line between the amateur and the professional, which I gather is what your question is all about. Except if you consider that someone makes a living from his reverse engineering skills as that line. But I think anyone with a high enough experience/skill level has to be considered a professional based on that experience/skill - not based on how s/he makes his/her living.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   And no, you don't\n   <em>\n    need\n   </em>\n   a blog.\n  </strong>\n  But don't let that keep you from creating one. A blog, especially if you are a student, can be a good reference for potential future employers. So if you choose a more serious nickname than I chose here on SE, if you keep the topics and language in your blog posts professional and refrain from leet-speak, you will not only gather followers within the RCE community, you'll also show what you are capable of. And that last part is what sets the professional seasoned reverse engineer apart from the amateur or beginner:\n  <strong>\n   experience, loads and loads of experience.\n  </strong>\n  Communities such as this one,\n  <a href=\"http://www.openrce.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   OpenRCE\n  </a>\n  ,\n  <a href=\"http://www.kernelmode.info/forum/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   kernelmode.info\n  </a>\n  ,\n  <a href=\"http://www.woodmann.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Woodmann\n  </a>\n  will give you a wealth of information. Crackmes and Reversemes can provide a playful incentive to improve your knowledge/skills/expertise and your blog is the shop window out into the world through which\n  <em>\n   you\n  </em>\n  show what you can offer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hint: advertise your blog on your profile here and make sure to answer and/or ask questions so that people click your profile. This should get your blog a following that knows the subject matter and will be able to comment and otherwise interact with you.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Since I work in the anti-X industry, currently AV, I thought I should perhaps add a few remarks concerning that particular field, since you mentioned the reverse engineering of\n  <a class=\"post-tag\" href=\"/questions/tagged/malware\" rel=\"tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'malware'\">\n   malware\n  </a>\n  in your question.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  If you want to work in the anti-X industry\n </h2>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/1814/245\">\n   Rolf already pointed you\n  </a>\n  to:\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/206/where-can-i-as-an-individual-get-malware-samples-to-analyze\">\n   Where can I, as an individual, get malware samples to analyze?\n  </a>\n  So I'll leave it at excellent question, excellent answers for that one. Here follow my remarks\n </p>\n <h3>\n  A career in AV\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   most AV companies will not hire anyone who\n   <em>\n    wrote\n   </em>\n   malware. Some, as far as I know, did in the past. However, this only fosters the urban myth that we're writing the malware ourselves. I can tell you that we really don't have to - the commercialized malware\n   <em>\n    industry\n   </em>\n   , yes\n   <em>\n    industry\n   </em>\n   , does a pretty good job at it and we try hard to keep up. However, there is truth in that urban myth in that one of the - if not\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   - first AV vendor (I want give names!) offered bounties for new malware. Well what's the easiest way of getting a bounty if the few available samples are all\n   <em>\n    known\n   </em>\n   ? Uh huh, writing your own and submitting it to cash the bounty ...\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     some companies will \"tone it down\" to\"\n     <em>\n      we will not hire anyone who wrote malware and is stupid enough to admit it - if s/he wrote one and we find out, we'll fire that person on the spot.\n     </em>\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   analyzing malware requires some specializations that you won't have in other RCE topics. If you specialize in kernel mode malware, you are fairly specialized but there will be demand for people with these skills. Still most of the generic methodologies in RCE are applicable for malware - after all reversing malware is a subset of RCE as a whole.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   some analysts in AV labs won't have the expertise and skills to work with\n   <a class=\"post-tag\" href=\"/questions/tagged/disassembly\" rel=\"tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'disassembly'\">\n    disassembly\n   </a>\n   , for example. Some know a few basics, for some that all stopped back in DOS times (i.e. they will be able to use good ol'\n   <code>\n    debug\n   </code>\n   on a\n   <code>\n    .com\n   </code>\n   file and that's it) and others will specialize in malicious scripts and not need that skill set at all. Also many malware families these days can be identified by traits that don't require going into the nitty gritty.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <h3>\n  Literature I find/found useful before and during my career\n </h3>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The Rootkit Arsenal\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands-On Guide to Dissecting Malicious Software\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Malware Analyst's Cookbook and DVD: Tools and Techniques for Fighting Malicious Code\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Rootkits: Subverting the Windows Kernel\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The IDA Pro Book: The Unofficial Guide to the World's Most Popular Disassembler\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Gray Hat Python: Python Programming for Hackers and Reverse Engineers\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The Art of Computer Virus Research and Defense (classic, but a bit outdated, still good reading)\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

            "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  First of all, take heart.  The skills you describe with game hacking will serve you very well in a career in reverse engineering.  If you can do what you describe, you're off to a great start, and I imagine that many jobs would be available to you merely on that basis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So now you run into the problem that confronts many hobbyist reverse engineers wanting to go professional:  your expertise is kind of dirty.  Take heart on this point too, as many hobbyists (e.g., crackers) face an even worse version of this problem.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The short version is that you need to parlay your existing skills into producing publications that won't get you sued or arrested.  Leave the dirt behind; at least, don't publish it.  I'm sure there are freeware, abandonware, and/or single-player, etc. games that you can hack that won't raise any hackles.  Publish things like this on a blog and/or at conferences using your real name, and submit them to the\n  <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Reverse Engineering reddit\n  </a>\n  to gain some exposure.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another piece of advice I can offer is to leverage your connections.  It's not impossible that some of the people you know in the game hacking scene are doing that as a hobby, whereas their professional employment is already in computer security.  Ask those people for help, and be prepared to repay favors if they can.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Furthermore, seeing as most jobs in reverse engineering don't involve hacking games explicitly (although similar skills will be utilized), it makes sense to branch out into the other parts of reverse engineering and show employers that you can in fact do those things too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the malware side, there are never legal concerns.  See\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/206/where-can-i-as-an-individual-get-malware-samples-to-analyze\">\n   this question\n  </a>\n  for places to get malware samples; bonus points if you publish your analyses in a timely fashion.  For this, I recommend following the anti-virus industry on twitter and seeing what the latest threats are, or worm your way into one of the good-old-boy anti-virus sample sharing mailing lists.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Vulnerability analysis might get you sued, but that happens infrequently.  Be judicious, practice responsible disclosure, and maybe use a service like\n  <a href=\"http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   ZDI\n  </a>\n  or\n  <a href=\"https://www.exodusintel.com/eip/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   EIP\n  </a>\n  if you're extremely concerned about the risks associated with disclosure.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally, employers in this space are more concerned with skills than they are with degrees and so on.  So if you apply for a reverse engineering position somewhere, most likely what will happen is that they will give you some sort of challenge to determine whether you have the necessary skills.  Therefore, don't be discouraged about applying to jobs if you haven't published anything; doing well on the interview challenges is looked upon very highly for obvious reasons.  Nevertheless, I still recommend publication.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In summary:  ask your game hacking buddies if they do RE professionally; publish, but don't publish dirt; diversify; and apply for jobs regardless of what the state of your published work is.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
