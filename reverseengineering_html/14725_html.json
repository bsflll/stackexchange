Basically I want to iterate through all functions in an IDB file and their instructions using ida python script. The final goal is to export the functions & their instructions from idapro. in certain format.\n </p>\n <pre><code>from idautils import *\nfrom idaapi import *\n\nea = BeginEA()\nfor funcea in Functions(SegStart(ea), SegEnd(ea)):\n    functionName = GetFunctionName(funcea)\n    print functionName\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Using above script I'm retrieving function names, now I also want to print the assembly instructions of each function. I know may I have to use GetDisasm(ea), not sure how to use the API.\n </p>\n <p>\n  TIA\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
