I have checked the channels for a few forums that I browse, but I can't seem to find an active community.  What are some active RCE related channels?  It can be about malware analysis / tools / general help / etc, anything.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hopefully this is on topic.  I can't think of anywhere else to ask.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
