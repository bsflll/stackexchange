I suspect it is the latter as there is a piece of code elsewhere that points to a\n  <code>\n   deadc0de\n  </code>\n  address.  However, When I patch to this section, the only string given is\n  <code>\n   \"Unexpected error condition. Control char is %d\n\"\n  </code>\n  which makes me wonder if this is some sort of normal compiler artifact.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My questions are\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Am I focusing on the wrong section because this\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     is\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   indeed a normal artifact?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   If\n   <code>\n    925\n   </code>\n   sets a stack address to\n   <code>\n    0\n   </code>\n   and then\n   <code>\n    92c\n   </code>\n   compares that same stack address to\n   <code>\n    0\n   </code>\n   , is there any way that this check could ever fail so that\n   <code>\n    je\n   </code>\n   at\n   <code>\n    930\n   </code>\n   is not taken?\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   27-04-2022 EDIT:\n  </strong>\n  <code>\n   readelf -x .rodata <program>\n  </code>\n  returns the \"Unexpected error condition ...\" string as part of the rodata section.  This very much leads me to believe that this is not a compiler artifact and is instead, part of the challenge\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It is not an open crackme but rather a challenge as part of a CTF that prohibits placing challenge information into public space.  That is why I have shared so little of the code here.\n <code>\n  92c\n </code>\n is not part of a loop.  '922' -\n <code>\n  930\n </code>\n marks the end of a conditional branch that gets taken if the program is supplied a proper password.  The line above [not shown here] is a call to print the \"correct password\" string.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
