    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  How do I compare in IDA PRO if constants are located in the same functions or not.. like filter from all constants if I search for 2 constants or more I want to know which function(s) contain all the constants I want to search for, to eliminate searching through all constants with other constants to find matching functions.. (this is how I do it now it's very pain staking)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Constants window looks like this\n  \n\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wnxYq.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"constants\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wnxYq.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8J7V0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"constants2\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8J7V0.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  \n\n  How I do I mark red lines for bad addresses and blue ones for good ones haha\n  \n\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4LipZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"how i do\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4LipZ.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \n\n  \n\n  Is there any script or even better a plugin that does this job easier for me?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
