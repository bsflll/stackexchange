I created an AVD based on Pixel 2. Opening the ADB shell I get:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ getprop ro.product.manufacturer\nunknown\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I would like to change the string returned as property\n  <code>\n   ro.product.manufacturer\n  </code>\n  , because I have an app the refuses to run on an \"unknown\" device. How can I do that?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The file\n  <code>\n   config.ini\n  </code>\n  for the AVD has a line\n </p>\n <pre><code>hw.device.manufacturer=Google\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  but this does not seem to be the same thing.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
