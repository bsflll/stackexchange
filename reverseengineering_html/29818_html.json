How could I extract this and analyse it further?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/2yPnjVXVxAfvxU6Ktb2sVA?si=a71e675f96664827\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Spotify Link\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mahrXWywu6M?t=280\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Youtube link at 4:40\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
