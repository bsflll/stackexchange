Are you sure the strings are available at the time?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I would recommend making a deadlisting, using whatever disassembler you're comfortable with, and having a look for the strings and xrefs to them. You tend to get a very narrow view of the logic in a debugger, and you need the wide one for this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit: x64dbg apparently only searches the module currently shown in the disassembly. Open up the symbols window, clickety-click your friend's module, and try searching again. Or you could set a breakpoint on MessageBox() and see where it's called.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
