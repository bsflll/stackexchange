    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Im using cheat engine as a beginner to getting into Disassembly and Hacking, and I want to know how to modify an address/pointer (not really sure how to term it) thats using a\n  <code>\n   movss [...],xmm#\n  </code>\n  ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Specifically, Im modifying the Health in Satisfactory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fall damage causes the\n  <code>\n   movss [rbx+00000164],xmm0\n  </code>\n  to fire,\n  <code>\n   xmm0\n  </code>\n  represents the amount of health subtracted from the damage of falling.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Then it sends\n  <code>\n   xmm0\n  </code>\n  to\n  <code>\n   rbx+000000164\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  That causes the health to go down. I want it to go Up, or not lose/gain any at all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried seeing if there were any xmm#s in the scanner that lined up with max health (100) to see if I could just send the player's max health every time they took damage (This would solve it easily)\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, it doesnt have it.\nAs seen here:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nRRcU.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nRRcU.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was following a tutorial\n  <a href=\"https://wiki.cheatengine.org/index.php?title=Tutorials:Auto_Assembler:Injection_full\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   https://wiki.cheatengine.org/index.php?title=Tutorials:Auto_Assembler:Injection_full\n  </a>\n  , but they made it super simple, mentioning only...\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Now the easiest thing to do here, since the code already adds is to just make the number positive.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Thats not very informing, they were lucky, their value is just a number that can be set to positive or negative, or just be modified.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mine cant.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   So the big question is, is there anything I can do to modify or change it? I need to make this simpler.\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  By the way, heres my script that Im using to actually \"hack\" the health. All it does right now is the default xmm0 send, basically it does nothing.\n </p>\n <pre><code>{ Game   : FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\n  Version: \n  Date   : 2020-03-15\n  Author : taylo\n\n  This script does blah blah blah\n}\n\ndefine(address,\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E3AA)\ndefine(bytes,F3 0F 11 83 64 01 00 00)\n\n[ENABLE]\n//code from here to '[DISABLE]' will be used to enable the cheat\n\n\n\nassert(address,bytes)\nalloc(newmem,$1000,\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E3AA)\n\nlabel(code)\nlabel(return)\n\nnewmem:\n\ncode:\n  movss [rbx+00000164],xmm0\n  jmp return\n\naddress:\n  jmp newmem\n  nop 3\nreturn:\n\n[DISABLE]\n//code from here till the end of the code will be used to disable the cheat\naddress:\n  db bytes\n  // movss [rbx+00000164],xmm0\n\ndealloc(newmem)\n\n{\n// ORIGINAL CODE - INJECTION POINT: \"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E3AA\n\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E376: 49 89 6B B0              -  mov [r11-50],rbp\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E37A: 4D 89 73 A8              -  mov [r11-58],r14\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E37E: E8 BD D5 FB FF           -  call FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe+8CB940\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E383: 0F 28 C8                 -  movaps xmm1,xmm0\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E386: 0F 2F 0D 53 B9 64 02     -  comiss xmm1,[FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe+2F59CE0]\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E38D: 0F 82 B9 00 00 00        -  jb FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe+90E44C\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E393: F3 0F 10 83 64 01 00 00  -  movss xmm0,[rbx+00000164]\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E39B: F3 0F 5F CE              -  maxss xmm1,xmm6\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E39F: 0F B6 83 6C 01 00 00     -  movzx eax,byte ptr [rbx+0000016C]\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E3A6: F3 0F 5C C1              -  subss xmm0,xmm1\n// ---------- INJECTING HERE ----------\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E3AA: F3 0F 11 83 64 01 00 00  -  movss [rbx+00000164],xmm0\n// ---------- DONE INJECTING  ----------\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E3B2: A8 01                    -  test al,01\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E3B4: 75 4C                    -  jne FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe+90E402\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E3B6: A8 02                    -  test al,02\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E3B8: 74 1D                    -  je FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe+90E3D7\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E3BA: 48 89 6C 24 28           -  mov [rsp+28],rbp\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E3BF: 4C 8B CF                 -  mov r9,rdi\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E3C2: 0F 28 D1                 -  movaps xmm2,xmm1\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E3C5: 4C 89 74 24 20           -  mov [rsp+20],r14\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E3CA: 48 8B D6                 -  mov rdx,rsi\n\"FactoryGame-Win64-Shipping.exe\"+90E3CD: 48 8B CB                 -  mov rcx,rbx\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It says an error in line 12, which is the instruction line. then I changed movss to mov and it worked. game didn't crash which was great, but I still curious about what's the correct way to deal with movss.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Making all creatures and players invulnerable forever using the same method.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As seen here by MY use of it:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Yes, I know it was about modifying the movss, but my value IS a float, its just stored in the \"form\" of an Integer, so it uses mov, you can use this same movss code.\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <pre><code>code:\n  mov [rbx+00000164],(float)100\n  jmp return\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   mov\n  </code>\n  is like saying\n  <code>\n   move\n  </code>\n  , it moves the value in the operand and sends it to the address.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So its as simple as moving a number. I just had bad formatting, and didnt realise you had to specify the data type via something like\n  <code>\n   (float)\n  </code>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
