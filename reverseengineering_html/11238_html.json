By\n  <em>\n   variable\n  </em>\n  , I refer to both\n  <code>\n   global\n  </code>\n  as well as\n  <code>\n   function local\n  </code>\n  variables. In other words, given a Linux ELF and a virtual address, is there any means to know programmatically what all are the variables (in terms of memory locations) live at that point?\n </p>\n <p>\n  IDA Pro seems to detect the memory locations of probable variables in a procedure.  Does IDA expose any API to collect such information?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I plan to use DynamoRIO to dynamically monitor the program at run-time. A\n  <code>\n   call-ret\n  </code>\n  pair should mark the beginning and ending of a function. Once I encounter a\n  <code>\n   call\n  </code>\n  , I monitor all the read-write accesses on stack locations referenced either by\n  <code>\n   %ebp\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   %esp\n  </code>\n  . The problem is tail-calls where compiler optimizes a\n  <code>\n   call\n  </code>\n  substituting by\n  <code>\n   jmp\n  </code>\n  , thereby detection of function virtually impossible.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

What if a signal handler (linux), or exception handler (windows) calls a function? There's just too many ways for local variables to get generated anywhere on the stack to <i>reliably</i> determine every possible location for a particular variable. There's only 2 things you can do - stop the program at a specific point and check the current stack frame, or analyze the call tree and local stacks to get a \"what happens if we omit all special cases\" list.</span>",
