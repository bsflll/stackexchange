Why ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  My guess is that during the build, function names are kept by the compilator to allow the linker to do its job. But then once the linker has finished, why not removing the function names ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

My best guess is that stripping symbols complicates that process.\n </p>\n <p>\n  References:\n  <a href=\"https://blog.zynamics.com/2010/04/27/objective-c-reversing-i/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://blog.zynamics.com/2010/04/27/objective-c-reversing-i/\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
