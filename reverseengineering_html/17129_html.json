The router is discussed on a number of\n  <a href=\"https://zedt.eu/tech/hardware/obtaining-administrator-access-huawei-hg8247h/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   blogs\n  </a>\n  and the\n  <a href=\"https://zedt.eu/storage/2016/02/aescrypt2_huawei.zip\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   aescrypt2\n  </a>\n  can be downloaded and examined. I have also found the\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/palmerc/AESCrypt2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   source code\n  </a>\n  and put it on GitHub.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So far I've found:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://github.com/coruus/nist-testvectors/blob/master/csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/documents/Examples/SHA256.txt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    NIST SHA256 Test Vector\n   </a>\n   in the source\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   inflate 1.2.5 calling code\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Identified the code path to the decrypt section\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  What I haven't found:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Any S-boxes for AES\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The key\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Running\n  <code>\n   findcrypt\n  </code>\n  in IDA Pro is also not turning up anything which leads me to believe my\n  <code>\n   findcrypt\n  </code>\n  plugin isn't working. However, I then start looking for the S-boxes sequence 0x63 0x7c which can easily be found in the source code and IDA pro doesn't find that either... I then dropped to hexdump and searched for 0x63 and it is not there. Given that I can see the S-box in the source and I just compiled the binary myself what am I doing wrong?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Shouldn't the forward S-box appear in the data segment more or less as-is?\n </p>\n <p>\n  And now that I've found the key through the debugger in the\n  <code>\n   .bss\n  </code>\n  segment why isn't the string in the data segment?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
