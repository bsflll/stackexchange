    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm currently reversing a virtualized sample  that uses a custom\n  <strong>\n   VM bytecode\n  </strong>\n  . After defeating the anti-disassembly tricks I'm finally faced with the\n  <code>\n   vm_dispatch\n  </code>\n  function. I have to figure out the custom vm opcodes in order to determine what the program actually does. Unlike most other vms, there are no\n  <code>\n   vftables\n  </code>\n  which makes it very hard for me to reverse since there are more than 100 virtual handlers which are not defined as functions (All of the handlers are defined in\n  <code>\n   loc_XXXX\n  </code>\n  code blocks. Example image is below).\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/T5U24.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/T5U24.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Trying to decompile the\n  <code>\n   vm_dispatch\n  </code>\n  function leaves me with this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>  ...\n  a lot of local variable initialization\n  ...\n  assign vm handlers\n  ...\n  bytecode_array[53] = &loc_4041A3;\n  regs->VIP = 0x6000;  // virtual ip\n  memcpy(bytecode_array + regs->VIP, bytecode, bytecode_size);\n  regs->R5 = -1;\n  vm_code = *(bytecode_array + regs->VIP++);\n  __asm { jmp     [ebp+eax*4+vm_handler_array]; jump to the appropriate handler }// switch jmp\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I know it's not fully decompiled because there are more than 100 blocks, each executing a specific vm bytecode. None of that is reflected on the decompiler output.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It's really time-consuming to go through each\n  <code>\n   loc_XXXX\n  </code>\n  without being able to define VM specific structures like\n  <code>\n   VM\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   REG\n  </code>\n  and to read the low-level assembly. My question is, is there any:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Way to convert\n   <code>\n    loc_XXXX\n   </code>\n   code blocks to functions to that I can decompile the code and create structures?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Right approach to read the assembly / make it easier?\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
