However, I can't find any documentation on what it does or how to use it. All, I've found is the source code for it in the Ghidra repo (no readme), and a single mention of it on reddit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there documentation on SleighDevTools? \nIf so, where is it? \nIf not, are there any good resources for processor development besides the official Ghidra docs?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
