    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am missing a piece of the puzzle that is the TCP protocol the Battlefield Bad Company games use to transfer dogtag records to/from the FESL backend. The general packet structure is quite clear and I know the meaning of most of the 24 character bytestring sent for each record. However, the game shows a timestamp for each record, which I so far fail to extract from the data.\n </p>\n <pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>b'MIK813\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00E\\xb0\\xeb\\xe1\\x00\\x01\\x0e\\x00'\n</code></pre>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   player name, often but not always followed by a bunch of null bytes\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   4 bytes, meaning unknown (I suspect this is the timestamp)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   2 bytes, number dogtags taken from player\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   1 byte, player rank (at time of [last?] dogtag taken)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   1 byte, meaning unknown (seems to always be \\x00, so it may just be an end marker)\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Based on this structure, the timestamp would be this\n </p>\n <pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>b'E\\xb0\\xeb\\xe1'\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However, unpacking that as an unsigned int (Big Endian) gives me\n  <code>\n   1169222625\n  </code>\n  . That would be some time in January of 2007. But I know that this was today. The game shows\n  <code>\n   July 2nd 2023, 12:38\n  </code>\n  for this record. The Unix timestamp for that would be around\n  <code>\n   1688301494\n  </code>\n  . Other records unpacked as unsigned int result in values that are not even valid as a Unix timestamp. Based on how different the values are, it also does not seem like an offset from a common timestamp.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, how is the timestamp encoded? What am I missing here?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some more examples:\n </p>\n <pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code># July 3rd 2023 12:48\nb'Brain Wrought\\x00\\x00\\x00E\\xb0\\xeb\\xef\\x00\\x01\\x19\\x00'\n# July 3rd 2023 12:48\nb'lemenkool\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00E\\xb0\\xeb\\xef\\x00\\x01\\t\\x00'\n# July 3rd 2023 12:23\nb'FauxNameless\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00E\\xb0\\xeb\\xcc\\x00\\x01\\x19\\x00'\n# July 3rd 2023 12:17\nb'Darklord90xx\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00E\\xb0\\xeb\\xc4\\x00\\x01\\x00\\x00'\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
