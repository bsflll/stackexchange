Such tool exists for x86 binaries, such as\n  <a href=\"http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool\">\n   Pin\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also i would like to know your precious input regarding tools to run static analysis by instrumenting dalvik byte code.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It's not dynamic though, although I don't see why it couldn't be used for data dependency analysis.

Now was wondering whether the same can be used in dalvik byte code, actually what I need is the execution trace of the instructions carried out by the VM.</span>",
