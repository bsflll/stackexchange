That's why when you purchase a motherboard, you need to make sure to buy one compatible with the CPU you plan to use with it. See, for example,\n  <a href=\"https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   ASUS's motherboard list\n  </a>\n  . They have motherboards meant for Intel CPUs, motherboards meant for AMD CPUs, etc. And if you drill into the\n  <a href=\"https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/X99E_WS/specifications/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   specs for a given motherboard\n  </a>\n  , you'll see which specific CPUs it's meant to work with:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kwgB6.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"CPUs\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kwgB6.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
