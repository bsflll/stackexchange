I dont have the source of CompiledCode.bin and writing from scratch is not an option.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Basically what I am trying to do is open up a setup.exe that was made via InnoSetup and edit a few text files inside, then recompile/reconstruct. I dont need to touch the Pascal script at all just change a few lines in a .txt file.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
