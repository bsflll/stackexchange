So what I was thinking is running the malware in a real environment instead and then rolling back to the clean state using a clean copy of the system.\n  <strong>\n   I just want to check the following:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Is this the proper way to analyse malware which implements\nanti-virtualisation techniques or there are other ways that usually are followed?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Is there a specific program that is widely used by\nmalware analysers to retain a copy of the clean system state, and\nre-install it? (I am interested in Windows malware only)\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

            "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  The answer is complete for the questioner's #2, but let's dig a little-deeper into #1.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There are other ways to analyze malware which implements anti-virtualization, vm-detection, sandbox detection, and sandbox evasion techniques. However, does the malware also include environmentally-keyed detection or evasion techniques, such as the ones outlined here --\n  <a href=\"https://www.vmray.com/blog/sandbox-evasion-techniques-part-4/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.vmray.com/blog/sandbox-evasion-techniques-part-4/\n  </a>\n  -- (aka context-aware malware aka environment-sensitive)?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cuckoo is an excellent sandbox for features and behavior extraction, so it's not always wise to jump to windbg or other classic bare-metal debugging (although sometimes it is wise to do this). If the built-in cloaking solution for Cuckoo,\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/jbremer/vmcloak/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   vmcloak\n  </a>\n  , can prevent the malware from detecting or evading it then you still get all of the benefits of Cuckoo.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some of these can be elicited early-on during static analysis or even during simple Yara triage. There are also advanced ways of performing Yara triage that will catch malicious processes in-the act, such as Godaddy's procfilter --\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/godaddy/yara-rules/blob/master/features/virtualbox_detection.yara\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/godaddy/yara-rules/blob/master/features/virtualbox_detection.yara\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you use dynamic analysis to elicit the sandbox detection, evasion, or context-aware malware techniques, be sure to know your limitations.\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/secrary/makin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   makin\n  </a>\n  is a good starting framework to determine those anti-debugging capabilities.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A lot of this depends on your goal with malware. What do you want to know about them; what questions do you have? Do you need to extract Proactive Threat Indicators for internal-only blacklists or will you be sharing them? Do you need to deconfig RATs that are operating on systems in your network? For example, a focus on nation-state RATs might warrant a jump to the --\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/ctxis/CAPE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/ctxis/CAPE\n  </a>\n  -- tool or similar.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you want a simple solution to scaling sandbox-based automation with stealth functionality that surpasses vmcloak, check out --\n  <a href=\"http://drakvuf.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   drakvuf.com\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am definitely interested in more of the bare-metal techniques (especially the AMT RAM cloner!) spoken to by @ekse in the primary answer. These are also very-valuable! However, just because you have bare metal doesn't mean that context-aware malware techniques such as time bombs, logic bombs, and specifically-targeted malicious logic won't be an additional problem -- you'll have to account for them!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
