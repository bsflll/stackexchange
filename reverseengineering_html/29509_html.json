I also compared the header to the compressed segments of a Pixel 2 modem firmware. Pixel 2 uses q6zip and delta (as mentioned\n  <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2021/security-probe-of-qualcomm-msm/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  and maybe\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/16330/need-help-disassembling-qualcomm-qdsp6\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  ), but not even the first bytes of those segments match.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also searched for both segments offsets in the binary, but they can't be found as immediate. So simply looking for them to find the decompression function isn't possible.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The entropy of them looks like that:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   modem.b26\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KN5zl.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KN5zl.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Binwalk mentions parity information, but it is in the area of high entropy. So maybe it is a false positive?:\n </p>\n <pre><code>> binwalk modem.b26\n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n25953729      0x18C05C1       MPEG transport stream data\n29114525      0x1BC409D       PARity archive data - file number 16432\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The first few bytes are:\n </p>\n <pre><code>> xxd -c 16 modem.b26  | head -n 3\n00000000: 3c9b 9ed4 bb7b 281c 050f 8a9c d875 4130  <....{(......uA0\n00000010: 801d 8619 2c17 8028 2ea1 bbee db57 0160  ....,..(.....W.`\n00000020: e17c 846c 2a18 14c8 2db0 20ae f952 0041  .|.l*...-. ..R.A\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   modem.b28\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jUVIj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jUVIj.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Binwalk returns nothing.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  The first few bytes are:\n </p>\n <pre><code>> xxd -c 16 modem.b28  | head -n 3\n00000000: 1200 0000 4c00 59ce 3c11 59ce 3c22 59ce  ....L.Y.<.Y.<\"Y.\n00000010: 3c33 59ce 3c44 59ce 3855 59ce f465 59ce  <3Y.<DY.8UY..eY.\n00000020: bc76 59ce bc87 59ce bc98 59ce bca9 59ce  .vY...Y...Y...Y.\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Do you have any idea how to proceed to decompress those segments?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
