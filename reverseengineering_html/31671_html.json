Notice that you can see assignments to all three of those registers throughout the function body. Also notice at the bottom of your screenshot that the values of the registers are restored by popping them right before the return statement, such that the calling function will have the same values for those registers after the call as they did before the call.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
