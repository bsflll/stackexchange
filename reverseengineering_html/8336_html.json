    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  There is a game that has been created with Unity which I'm trying to beat. It sends your high-score to a site and gets posted there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've sniffed the outgoing traffic and the game sends your username, your score plus a MD5 hash.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Looking to some on-line tutorials (and I'm guessing this too) the hash consists of something along the lines of:\n </p>\n <pre><code> MD5(user:USERNAME, score:SCORE, SALT)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  As you can guess, I know the username and the score, but I don't know the secret. I'm trying to find these strings in Ollydbg but I'm having some trouble finding it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm having trouble in being able to set a breakpoint, as the score is sent when you click submit and time of the game is still running.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any suggestions on how to find where the hashing occurs using Ollydbg? \nHow would you set the breakpoint if the game is still running?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
