I have a\n  <code>\n   .exe\n  </code>\n  file which has different contents inside when opened with 7zip. However let's say I know that it uses\n  <a href=\"https://www.ej-technologies.com/download/exe4j/files\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   EXE4J\n  </a>\n  , how can I decompile it and get the jar out of it?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Use 7zip on the file to unpack embedded\n   <code>\n    .jar\n   </code>\n   files. Alternatively, execute the file and grab the JAR from the TEMP folder.
