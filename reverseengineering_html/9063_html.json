    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a board that I'm reversing - and attempting to dump the image out of the NAND flash.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Board has a SAMSUNG s3c2440 SOC CPU, and there's a SAMSUNG k9f1g08u0d 128 MB NAND flash device.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm using a BusPirate through JTAG to connect. I am able to run OpenOCD and view the chip, dump registers, etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, the whole setup is unstable. I'm running on a Linux host PC. Steps are:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   power up the target\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   power up buspirate\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   start openocd daemon\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   start telnet into openocd daemon\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   enable debug_level 3\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   just watch the debug messages flow on the openocd daemon window.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    the flow of messages stops after 15 seconds or so with the following error:\n   </p>\n   <pre><code>Error: 7399 146854 bus_pirate.c 1091 buspirate_serial_read() should have read = 15 actual size = 0 \nError: 7399 146854 bus_pirate.c 1091 buspirate_serial_read() Error treading data timeout = 10, len = 0, size = 15\n</code></pre>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I have a Buspirate 3, with the latest version 6.1 firmware.\nOpenocd is version 0.9.0\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any suggestions to get a setup to be more stable is welcomed.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Not sure if that's what's happening here, but worth checking into. Can you test your setup on some known-good development board to see if you still have the same issues?\n</span>\n</body></html>",

However, your description of 'start openocd', 'telnet into openocd' seems to explain that this happens after the system has been running for a while. I'd expect a problem with the signal itself, maybe caused by  a bad power supply or similar, that disturbs the signal on the JTAG pins. Do you have a scope to hook up to the pins to verify this? Also, the folks at the electrical engineering SE might have more experience with this.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
