In the debugging of an exe file, I found which dll is used (kernel32, ntdl, user32, etc).

This would bring up a list of functions called from the main module. You can the set a logging breakpoint on all the functions. The disadvantage of this approach is that dynamically resolved function calls cannot not be intercepted.\n    <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VOfDV.png\"/>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Search for\n    <em>\n     Name in all modules\n    </em>\n    . Next set logging breakpoints on all exported entries. Disadvantage of this approach is that there will be a lot of false positives such as when a function from\n    <em>\n     kernel32\n    </em>\n    calls into another function in\n    <em>\n     ntdll\n    </em>\n    , it will be logged too. To clear the false positives you can use a conditional logging breakpoint to check if the return address is within the ranges of the main module.\n    \n\n    <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HSWXW.jpg\"/>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Use a dedicated tool for this purpose like\n    <a href=\"http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     API Monitor\n    </a>\n    ,\n    <a href=\"http://www.nektra.com/products/spystudio-api-monitor/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     SpyStudio\n    </a>\n    etc. If you use the SpyStudio, be sure to check out the\n    <a href=\"http://whiteboard.nektra.com/trace-an-application-from-startup\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     docs\n    </a>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
