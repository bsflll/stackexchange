    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I want to pass raw bytes to a (C) program using the Linux Bash shell. I find that when I try to pass for example \"\\x00\\xFF\\xAB\", the program receiving the input actually gets the\n  <strong>\n   ASCII character codes\n  </strong>\n  for the string, rather than interpret them as the raw bytes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One way I've seen people accomplish this is by calling\n  <code>\n   python -c 'print(\"\\x00\\xFF\\xAB\")'\n  </code>\n  and piping output to the program under test. Is there a way to do this without using Python by just using the Bash shell?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
