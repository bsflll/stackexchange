So, \"Run -> local windows debugger\" is wrong. Start the win64_remotex64 server manually, then have IDA connect to it.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Here's how you can debug x64 processes on a local machine with IDA Pro:\n </p>\n <p>\n  (1) Create a .bat file with the following:\n </p>\n <pre><code>\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA 6.5\\dbgsrv\\win64_remotex64\" -Pnh8sy261\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  in this case it's the location of\n  <code>\n   win64_remotex64\n  </code>\n  or remote debugger and\n  <code>\n   nh8sy261\n  </code>\n  is just some random password. You pick it. Make sure though not to put any spaces after the\n  <code>\n   -P\n  </code>\n  parameter and the password.\n </p>\n <p>\n  (2) Run batch file from (1) as admin.\n </p>\n <p>\n  (3) Open 64-bit version of IDA Pro as admin. (File\n  <code>\n   \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA 6.5\\idaq64.exe\"\n  </code>\n  )\n </p>\n <p>\n  (4) Pick\n  <code>\n   Go\n  </code>\n  to work on your own. Then in the blank IDA Pro window, in the menu go to\n  <code>\n   Debugger -> Run -> Remote Windows debugger\n  </code>\n  . Then in the\n  <code>\n   Application\n  </code>\n  pick your application with the\n  <code>\n   ...\n  </code>\n  button. Specify debuggee parameters and directory, if needed. Then in the\n  <code>\n   Hostname\n  </code>\n  add\n  <code>\n   127.0.0.1\n  </code>\n  , port as\n  <code>\n   23946\n  </code>\n  and password as what you typed above in the batch file:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4EZU5.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4EZU5.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can also check to\n  <code>\n   Save network settings as default\n  </code>\n  for later access. Then click OK.\n </p>\n <p>\n  (5) At this point the debugger should load the\n  <code>\n   debuggee\n  </code>\n  process and you should be able to step through it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
