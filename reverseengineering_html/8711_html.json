    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a game (Crysis 2) and the developers exported each DLL to be loaded separately by the main executable instead of merging all of them. Instead of having 9 instance of IDA open everytime and switching between tabs I wanted to load all the modules together as if they were 1 executable. I looked at this :\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://www.hexblog.com/?p=6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   http://www.hexblog.com/?p=6\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  and when I tried the script it had a syntax error, which I later fixed. Once I \"fixed\" it (by merely commenting the function call out) I tried running the script again and ended up with this :\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"IDA Error from the script\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/swC8v.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  It then loads the segment but doesn't load strings, imports etc. because as the error stated the main structure in the PE file format was not found..\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does anyone have any solutions to this or any alternative ways of loading all the DLLs in one database?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

(In short IDA debugger doesn't load the other modules).\n</span>\n</body></html>",
