I can't seem to find any documentation as to why one device may have 1 filesystem structure (ex squashFS) while others can have several structures within the firmware binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Why do some vendors seem to do everything in one file system structure, while others use several structures?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Other parts should always be read-only, so there squashfs would be a great fit.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Some vendors allow OEM-partitions that contain changes specific to that OEM, while that doesn't necessarily have to be a different filesystem it's often a filesystem that allows read/write access so it's easier to setup or try out changes\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Different filesystems have different advantages and disadvantages: Compression, read and write speed, cpu power and so on also should be taken into consideration when choosing a filesystem\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Different developers working on the same project: Often a reference implementation is provided by the SoC manufacturer, that uses a specific filesystem. If developers prefer a different filesystem they decide to use it, so many developers on different parts that can be easily seperated could be a reason aswell. Ultimately this comes down to an inaccurate specification that gives the developers options where it shouldn't\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Sometimes developers just want to try different things. While a product shouldn't be a playground for developers, sometimes it is exactly that\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
