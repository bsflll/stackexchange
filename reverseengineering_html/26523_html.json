    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have an offset to a property within a player class that I need to access data from. It's made of a specific struct that I have already assembled. IDA reports the accessing offset as so:\n </p>\n <pre><code>v32 = ( v3 + 280 ) // v3 is the player in this case\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I want to convert this to the correct struct within my own C++ module so I can read a specific property of that struct. I can easily get the base address of the players but whenever I get the property it doesn't come out correct.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have tried something of the following:\n </p>\n <pre><code>playerData* lpData = reinterpret_cast<playerData*>((int)n_GetLocalPlayer() + 280);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But the struct isn't correct.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is NO doubt that the base address or offset are correct, as the function I reversed in IDA was short and well commented. I just need help casting it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
