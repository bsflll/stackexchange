I have been unable to understand why the double '\n  <code>\n   ?\n  </code>\n  ' is appended to some paths.

Windows subsystem DLLs\n  prefix names passed by Windows applications that reference objects in\n  \\DosDevices with\n   <em>\n    \\??\n   </em>\n   (for example, C:\\Windows becomes \\??\\C:\\Windows).\n  When the object manager sees the special \\?? prefix, the steps it\n  takes depends on the version of Windows, but it always relies on a\n  field named\n   <em>\n    DeviceMap\n   </em>\n   in the executive process object (EPROCESS, which\n  is described further in Chapter 5) that points to a data structure\n  shared by other processes in the same session.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The\n   <em>\n    DosDevicesDirectory\n   </em>\n   field of the\n   <em>\n    DeviceMap\n   </em>\n   structure points at the\n  object manager directory that represents the process’ local\n  \\DosDevices. When the object manager sees a reference to \\??, it\n  locates the process’ local \\DosDevices by using the\n   <em>\n    DosDevicesDirectory\n   </em>\n   field of the\n   <em>\n    DeviceMap\n   </em>\n   . If the object manager\n  doesn’t find the object in that directory, it checks the\n   <em>\n    DeviceMap\n   </em>\n   field of the directory object. If it’s valid, it looks for the object\n  in the directory pointed to by the\n   <em>\n    GlobalDosDevicesDirectory\n   </em>\n   field of\n  the\n   <em>\n    DeviceMap\n   </em>\n   structure, which is always \\Global??.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
