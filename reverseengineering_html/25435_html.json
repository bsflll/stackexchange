    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm currently trying to look into Q.U.B.E. 2's internal mechanics, so I decided to look at it using Ghidra. Q.U.B.E. 2 is built upon UnrealEngine, so it it's pretty big (~50 Mb's). However, when importing the file, Ghidra complains about a lot of missing DLLs. So I started downloading all of them manually and putting them into a directory which I specified in the import settings -> External Libraries, however, the missing files only get written in the \"Additional Info\" field of the import results.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The problem here is, that the \"Additional Info\" ends with the following message:\n </p>\n <pre><code>There were too many messages to display.\n659 messages have been truncated.\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  meaning I can't take a look at all of the missing dll's.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can't have a good look into the code without the dependencies, as Ghidra displays\n  <code>\n   No symbol\n  </code>\n  warning's everywhere. My guess is that a big thing of Unreal Engine is still missing, as most of the missing symbols start with\n  <code>\n   U\n  </code>\n  (\n  <code>\n   UObjectBase\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   UWorld\n  </code>\n  , ...)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can I somehow look at the complete import log to add the missing libraries? Or is there a faster way to supply every dependency?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
