What tools would be necessary for doing such a thing?  I am open to all suggestions short of desoldering the flash chip from the device.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Then use the JTAG probe and an openly available tool such as OpenOCD to dump the contents of the flash chip. This should also be usable to flash it again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, since this is very specific to each piece of hardware it's hardly possible to give some generic advice about how to go about and what to be careful about.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Refer to the above linked question for details on how to find the JTAG header after disassembling the device and look in the\n  <a class=\"post-tag\" href=\"/questions/tagged/jtag\" rel=\"tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'jtag'\">\n   jtag\n  </a>\n  tag to find other existing questions and answers surrounding that topic.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
