    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Here's the case:\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm analyzing an API and the way JWT was implemented seems to be anti-tampering. There's two components that must be there or there's an authentication error:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Auth Bearer -> Stays the same 'til the session expires\n </p>\n <p>\n  Async-Token -> Some fields Changes in every request made, it also expires.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So when I log in and do any operation (view/edit profile, check balance, top-up, etc) the server replies with a new Async-token, the app receives it and makes the same request with this token, only then the operation is made.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If I try to change values in the body, it doesn't do anything because the requests has already been made with both tokens. If I intercept and try to change the values (say user ID) before receiving the token, it returns an error. I tried to exploit the common flaws of JWT but this one appears to be very well secured.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note: I can decode the tokens in base64 and see all the values except the signature.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
