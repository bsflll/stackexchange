You can replace the top most instructions with\n  <code>\n   mov r0, 0\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   mov pc, lr\n  </code>\n  and leaving the remaining code as is would make it not execute those instructions after\n  <code>\n   mov pc, lr\n  </code>\n  and just return to the calling function.\n </p>\n <pre><code>MOV R0, 0\nMOV PC, LR\n// leave the rest as is, it wont execute\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  You can also patch starting after  STMFD SP!, {R4-R6,LR} with MOV R0, 0 and then nopping all the way to the return statement LDMFD SP!, {R4-R6,PC}.\n </p>\n <pre><code>STMFD SP!, {R4-R6,LR}\nMOV R0, 0\n// NOP ALL THE WAY TO:\nLDMFD SP!, {R4-R6,PC}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  You can also just patch starting after\n  <code>\n   STMFD SP!, {R4-R6,LR}\n  </code>\n  with\n  <code>\n   MOV R0, 0\n  </code>\n  and then replacing the following instruction with\n  <code>\n   LDMFD SP!, {R4-R6,PC}\n  </code>\n  to return early making the rest of the code below it un-executed.\n </p>\n <pre><code>STMFD SP!, {R4-R6,LR}\nMOV R0, 0\nLDMFD SP!, {R4-R6,PC}\n// leave the rest as is, it wont execute\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
