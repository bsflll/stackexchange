    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have seen the Moonsols Memory Toolkit for Windows (Community Edition). It however does not support x64 memory dumping. Only its professional version can do that. Are there any free alternatives out there that do the same ? To narrow down what I am looking for I would be interested in features like -:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Convert a memory dump from a x64 Architecture.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Convert or decompress Windows 7 hibernation files.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Convert a Windows 7 memory dump.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I have seen a lot of free tools for x86, but for x64 its a whole different ball game.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
