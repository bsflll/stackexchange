While there may be the value 4 stored at ESP at that point, the adress is not known. So given this uncertainty, how can we know in line 6 what the value of EAX is, if we do not know the adress of ESP in Line 5?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Basically line 5 reads some sort of size/length field (probably a length of 2-byte elements) and line 6 loads the address of where\n <code>\n  esp\n </code>\n points plus\n <code>\n  eax\n </code>\n elements (likely of 2-byte size) + 4 ... so it's reaching into some sort of structure, I suppose. What's unclear about line 6? The first lines look like the prologue of a function, so\n <code>\n  esp\n </code>\n will point to the top of the stack which we can assume to be already populated ...\n</span>\n</body></html>",
