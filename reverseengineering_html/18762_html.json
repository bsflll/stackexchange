    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a program which uses ODBC to access an accdb database. I can open it in access but it asks for a password.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Wh0eG.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Wh0eG.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  The application accesses it through a DSN string. I have found the string using ODBC Data Source Administrator. However, I cant find the password! (even in the registry)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is it possible to record the incoming connections to ODBC and snoop the password from the connection attempt? I have tried tracing, but I cant see it in the log.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also would the program access the db using the connection string or does it decrypt the database first of all. I have tried using IDA to pull out the strings/ trace but cant see anything meaningful.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a password cache location that I'm missing.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
