Obviously I didn't know all fields when I created the structure type, and now I want to edit in some new fields / change pure byte gaps into meaningful fields.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This, for example, is a structure of a GuiButton which I know by now, but it's just a gap yet:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WGjt7.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WGjt7.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I don't find any way to edit the field of the structure. Do I have to completely delete the existing structure and create a new one?\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8kQLb.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8kQLb.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
