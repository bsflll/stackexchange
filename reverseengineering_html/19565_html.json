    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I was scanning the airwaves using my RTL-SDR and found a signal being broadcast locally that I was able to receive. When I configure the SDR Console V3 software to NFM, I get the following\n  <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/rpvvuc60b0q7i58/06-Sep-2018%2018h48m47s%20-%20460.519.5%20MHz%2C%20NFM.wav?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   audio.\n  </a>\n  (Wav file)\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/J3KyB.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Waterfall\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/J3KyB.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I started investigating and here are my findings:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   What I know:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  According to my local FCC equivalent the license documents list it as coming from an electrical switch yard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is are two different frequencies for Tx and Rx.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The signal runs continuously.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   What I assume:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  That this is a 2-fsk/BFSK signal, due to the two tones it uses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That it is broadcast in NFM. That mode does sound the best however, and lines up with licensing documents.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That it is actually data, not just some tone control system or random noise.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   What I have done\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  In SDR Console V3 I created an IQ\n  <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/0o425aev39s5jk5/05-Sep-2018%20174844.937%20460.514MHz%20000.zip?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   recording.\n  </a>\n  (Large File)\n </p>\n <p>\n  I then created a flow graph in GNURadio to record a file using a sink\n  <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/css2anwgau6w9g8/460519200_2FSK_1M.zip?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   file.\n  </a>\n  (Large File)\n </p>\n <p>\n  I created a\n  <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/su2ab0r1nmuo6sx/Working.grc?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   GNURadio flow graph\n  </a>\n  using that file as an input to low pass filters and a FM Demod.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The\n  <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/qdya8werqyzv0qm/FMDemod_new?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Demodulated file\n  </a>\n  was then opened in Inspectrum which produced the following image.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HwM6f.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Inspectrum\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HwM6f.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   What I think I need to do next\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I think I need to recover the clock of the signal somehow. I have had a look for a preamble but can't see anything that might match.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I thought it might be Manchester encoded but I can see long runs of 0's or 1's so I don't think it is.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I thought it might be clocked to the frequency of the local power supply given that it is in a switch yard, but it doesn't line up completely with rise or falls of the signal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Am I on the right path with this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way to determine the start of the message? The receiving radio has to be able to lock on to the start of the message somehow, right?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I did find a program in Linux called minimodem. I used the following command to get a somewhat readable output.\n </p>\n <p>\n  minimodem  -r -i -5 -M 1615 -S 1680 12 -f file_mono1.wav\nIt gave me the following output:\n </p>\n <pre><code>TTTGB?/2991\"05\"/\"ZWLOQB?/29.1?)5\"/\"WWLOPZBOWWOMQBLTZXZLWZTGB?/OOMBLTZXZQWLOBB?/29.1?)5\"/\"YWLOHB?/29.1\")6\"LZ_OYB?/29.1\")5\"/\"\"5\"5^\"\"?9/29.1?)5\"/\"B59&??/29.1?)5)6\"WBTOGB?/29.1?)5\"/\"TGLOQB?/2991\")5\"/\"LGLOPB?/29.1?)5\"/\"WGLOGB?/29.1?)5\"/\"BLTOZBBOXWOMQBLTZXZHGLOXB?/29.1?)5\"/\"TLTTHB?/29.1?)5\"/\"ZLTTOB?/;59.?)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But since I know nothing about the signal it may not be ASCII, it could be anything. It may not be 5 bit, it could be 8 bit for all I know. Can anyone shed any light on where to go next in investigating this?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
