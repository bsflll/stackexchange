    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am new to malware analysis, and I'm learning how to detect malware that uses process injection to execute PE files from memory. I chose a ransomware sample that uses process injection to load the actual payload in memory and took a crash dump at the point where the executable is loaded into memory. Is it safe to open (and not run) the crash dump file in WinDbg in a trusted environment? I will be using WinDbg commands to list peb, TIDs etc.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The debuggers won't map crash dumps into executable memory, and extensions such as\n  <code>\n   .call\n  </code>\n  only work in live debugging.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
