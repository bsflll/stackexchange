Note however that the command could be read as 'init IV', where IV usually means\n <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  Initialization Vector\n </a>\n , and that an IV or AES key here would normally be 128, 192 or 256 bits (=32,48,64 bytes) whereas e.g. alpha is 10, first omega 78, second 77.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Alternatively try and capture many traces and look for common patterns, e.g. do some bytes in either parameter crease slowly and so might be a time stamp? Here your two omega values start with the same 10 bytes: is that always true? Might that mean something? etc.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
