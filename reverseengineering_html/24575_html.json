    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to reverse engineer the firmware for an AutoDrive AD-520 dashcam. The firmware is available for download\n  <a href=\"http://giinii.com/GiiNii/AD520_software_upgrade.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  . I've installed binwalk on windows, I can get it to read the file just fine, here's a screenie of a regular\n  <code>\n   binwalk SD_CarDV.bin\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ecCiB.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ecCiB.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, if I try pretty much anything else it doesn't work. I can't do -E, it just sits there for a minute then reads out the file contents like --signature, but doesn't do anything else, and trying to save the -E to a png I get an error saying \"failed to import matplotlib module\". When I try -e, I get a readout just like with --signature, but no actual files are created in the working directory. If I use\n  <code>\n   -e -C=./tmp\n  </code>\n  I get the normal readout, a tmp folder is created, but no files. I've tried\n  <code>\n   --dd=\".*\"\n  </code>\n  , as well as\n  <code>\n   --log=binwalk.log\n  </code>\n  , literally copied from the github manual, and I get this error (same error with -dd and --log)\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CtKZ2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CtKZ2.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can't seem to get this thing to work. I'm wondering if it's me, windows, the firmware file itself...I can't figure it out. Can anyone help me?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you want to extract image data you have to install matplotlib library for Python. Also, not sure if that matters but \"./\" is not the correct notation in Windows. use \"C:\\\\tmp\" instead (note the double \\).\n</span>\n</body></html>",

I installed matplotlib, I can now get an output from the -E command, I had to resize it so the labels wouldn't hide the graph:\n <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/WRnDo0p.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  i.imgur.com/WRnDo0p.png\n </a>\n Also here's a screenshot of the command window after running the -E --verbose commands\n <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/AKe0tTS.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  i.imgur.com/AKe0tTS.png\n </a>\n I still can't get anything to extract though, with -e or -dd.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
