Then you can't do this in frida JavaScript as the JS code is executed on Android side. You can only use\n <a href=\"https://frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#communication-send\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  send()\n </a>\n on client side but the you have to implement python code on server side to handle those sent messages.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
