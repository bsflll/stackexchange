These files do not have a DDS header, however the data looks similar to what I've seen in other DDS images. I believe to a great extent that this data uses DXT5 texture compression. Is there any way for me make a DDS image out of these files if I dont have the file header?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is a link to a pastebin with the data of one of the files that I believe are headerless DDS (DXT5):\n  <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/axf7ytfj\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://pastebin.com/axf7ytfj\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The type of image (DXT5, DXT3, DXT1) can be a constant throughout the files, and the width can be inferred from the file size, model data, or some other metadata. Though, this may not be a DDS image as I am not getting a clear picture with TextureFinder\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/dguJs.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/dguJs.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
