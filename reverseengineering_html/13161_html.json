As far as I know Immunity just displays the\n  <code>\n   CPU\n  </code>\n  window initially. All the other windows are normally closed. So I would recommend to just close all windows and open\n  <code>\n   View\n  </code>\n  >\n  <code>\n   CPU\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  To \"reset\" the tiling within the\n  <code>\n   CPU\n  </code>\n  window. Just close all windows expect the\n  <code>\n   CPU\n  </code>\n  window. Minimize the\n  <code>\n   CPU\n  </code>\n  window manually and click\n  <code>\n   Tile horizontal\n  </code>\n  afterwards. Normally the tiling within the\n  <code>\n   CPU\n  </code>\n  window should be centered now.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  In the case you want to display multiple windows and re-arrange them:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   close all windows\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   open the windows of interest with\n   <code>\n    View\n   </code>\n   >\n   <code>\n    CPU\n   </code>\n   /\n   <code>\n    Memory\n   </code>\n   /\n   <code>\n    Log\n   </code>\n   /\n   <code>\n    ...\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Tile windows with:\n   <code>\n    Window\n   </code>\n   >\n   <code>\n    Tile horizontal / vertical\n   </code>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Until now, I didn't find a better solution.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
