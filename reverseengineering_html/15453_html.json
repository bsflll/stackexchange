It simply loads the address of the memory instead of the memory value itself. In this case, it is just being used as a fast add operation. Compilers will often use it for simple addition or multiplication which is faster than an add/mul/etc instruction. In the case of\n  <code>\n   lea r12, [rbx + 4]\n  </code>\n  , this is doing just r12 = rbx + 4; there is no memory access at all.\n  <code>\n   rbx\n  </code>\n  is being used as a current byte index into the strings and\n  <code>\n   r12\n  </code>\n  is being used as the next byte index.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
