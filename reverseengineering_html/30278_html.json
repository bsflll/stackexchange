Indeed it is, I can see the value in the Optional Header.AddressOfEntryPoint field which clearly exceeds the file size.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My question is why is this happening?\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is the C code. Very simple.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <pre><code>#include<studio.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n   printf(\"THIS IS OUR TEST APP!\");\n\n   return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  The file on disk ends at an offset of\n  <code>\n   95ffh\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The entry point is\n  <code>\n   11334h\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am new to reverse Engineering so please be kind.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am using Visual studio 2017 community edition, PEBear and OllyDbg for my studies on Windows 10. I am using C to write simple programs for study.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The entrypoint, like all so-called \"relative virtual addresses\" (RVAs) referenced in the PE header, does not refer to a physical offset within the PE file. Any particular bytes within the PE file (after the initial MZ and PE headers) probably will not have the same file offset and relative virtual address. Look into the difference between \"section alignment\" versus \"file alignment\", and the concept of a \"section\" within a PE file.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
