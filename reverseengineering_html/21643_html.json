Anyone know how to get a log like this?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

            "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  There is no such functionality in x64dbg out of the box, but we can make your own by writing a plugin! There are many examples (often with source code) available on\n  <a href=\"http://plugins.x64dbg.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   http://plugins.x64dbg.com\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  In this case you will want to register a callback for\n  <code>\n   CB_STEPPED\n  </code>\n  , which gets called after every step. The basic functionality could look something like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>PLUG_EXPORT void CBSTEPPED(CBTYPE, PLUG_CB_STEPPED* info)\n{\n    REGDUMP regdump;\n    DbgGetRegDump(&regdump);\n\n    auto& r = regdump.regcontext;\n\n    _plugin_logprintf(R\"(eax=%p ebx=%p ecx=%p\nedx=%p esi=%p edi=%p\neip=%p esp=%p ebp=%p\n)\",\nr.cax, r.cbx, r.ccx,\nr.cdx, r.csi, r.cdi,\nr.cip, r.csp, r.cbp);\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I added 64-bit support and a menu to enable/disable this functionality and put the source code on GitHub:\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/mrexodia/regstep\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/mrexodia/regstep\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  This functionality is dubiously useful in my opinion, because the changes to register values are highlighted in red in the register view and the affected registers of the selected instruction are underlined there as well. In addition you have the info box below the CPU view, which shows you all relevant values for the currently selected instruction too, but if you think logging registers every step is useful for you feel free to extend the plugin to your liking.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
