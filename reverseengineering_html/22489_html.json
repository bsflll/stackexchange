    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Assume I were to be reversing some game which processes all of it's movement client side and have determined some function to be of the type:\n </p>\n <pre><code>bool __thiscall Player::CanJump(Player *this)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  that I have determined to be a member of the Player object's vtable. Now lets assume I wanted to edit that object's vtable to point to my own dll injected implementation so that I could jump whenever I wanted. I could declare it as\n </p>\n <pre><code>bool __fastcall CanJumpReplacement(Player *player) {\n    return true;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and replace the Player's vtable entry with a pointer to this function. This works as expected, but\n  <em>\n   why should I use the fastcall convention here\n  </em>\n  ? Fastcall is used almost exclusively for this purpose from what I can tell, but I was reading through the calling conventions and cdecl seems to be a much closer match to thiscall than fastcall. Both calling conventions succeeded in replacing the function.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So either you implicitly say the class pointer will be in\n  <code>\n   ecx\n  </code>\n  (\n  <code>\n   __thiscall\n  </code>\n  ) or you say the function is not a member function but has one argument - which also gets passed in\n  <code>\n   ecx\n  </code>\n  when using\n  <code>\n   __fastcall\n  </code>\n  so the class pointer still ends up in the right register.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, both calling conventions use callee cleanup so no problem here, too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, this only works for no-argument functions. If your function had an argument, it would end up in\n  <code>\n   edx\n  </code>\n  for\n  <code>\n   __fastcall\n  </code>\n  , but on the stack for\n  <code>\n   __thiscall\n  </code>\n  and therefore not work anymore.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

For my last project that required C++ member function hooking, I wrote 2 small wrapper functions defined as <code>__declspec(naked) __stdcall</code> which had inline assembly code that turned the this pointer from <code>ecx</code> to a standard stack argument on entry, and on exit took the <code>this</code> pointer from the stack and moved it into <code>ecx</code> again.</span>",
