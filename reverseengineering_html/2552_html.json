    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  As I am just getting started in RE, I've mostly faced files packed with a single-layer of packing , such as UPX, ASPack, etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unpacking these protections is fully documented online. The problem begins when I deal with\n  <strong>\n   multiple layers of packing\n  </strong>\n  , especially concerning malware. I have followed some tutorials though they're usually not detailed enough. They seem to go through a\n  <strong>\n   tedious process\n  </strong>\n  to find the OEP. For example, they start by dealing with common packers (which is the easy part) and then they begin to set breakpoints everywhere \"\n  <strong>\n   in calls and jumps\n  </strong>\n  \" and tracing through the file here and there, which is for me the\n  <strong>\n   hard part\n  </strong>\n  that I have described above. At this point, I have no clue for what they are seeking or for what they are aiming, and then after some work, they find the OEP!\n </p>\n <p>\n  So what logic did they follow in that process? Also, because I know that the subject is broad, I'm also interested in some keywords.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
