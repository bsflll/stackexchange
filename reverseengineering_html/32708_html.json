Win32 API methods that end with a\n <code>\n  W\n </code>\n (like\n <code>\n  CreateFileW\n </code>\n ) usually require those strings.\n <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/char-wchar-t-char16-t-char32-t\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/â€¦\n </a>\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Unicode is supposed to be a universal character set with\n <i>\n  encodings\n </i>\n and previously Windows used UCS-2 (each code point encoded by\n <i>\n  exactly\n </i>\n one 16-bit code unit) and now uses UTF-16 (usually Little Endian, due to supported machines) since XP. UTF-16 has limitations and IIRC is not capable of expressing every possible code point Unicode has to offer these days. As pointed out UTF-16\n <i>\n  knows\n </i>\n surrogates and is thus indeed variable-length for each code point. However, because the string only contains ASCII each code point is 16-bit only.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

This is UTF-16 if encountered on Windows XP or newer or UCS-2 on older Windows versions. The main issue with the comment is that\n <code>\n  wchar_t\n </code>\n (= 16-bit type when targeting Windows, 32-bit on every other target platform I know) is merely the\n <i>\n  code unit\n </i>\n . Code units are the machine-level \"cells\" into which the\n <i>\n  code points\n </i>\n for Unicode-defined characters are encoded. In UTF-8 the code unit is usually\n <code>\n  char\n </code>\n , in UTF-16 (on Windows)\n <code>\n  wchar_t\n </code>\n on other systems UTF-32\n <code>\n  wchar_t\n </code>\n .

The <code>wchar_t</code> in Windows is the <i>code unit</i> to <i>encode</i> Unicode <i>code points</i>. And the full range of UTF-16 is very much supported. Yes, it has limitations compared to UTF-8 and UTF-32, but it <i>is very much a Unicode encoding</i>. UTF-16 has been used by Windows since XP (AFAIK) and previously UCS-2 was used, which can be considered sort of a predecessor to UTF-16. UCS-2 only ever considered the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) and thus limited itself to the notion of 1 <code>wchar_t</code> (16 bit) == 1 <i>code point</i>. Where the <code>\\0</code> is depends on Endianess.</span>",

My main point was, however, that <code>wchar_t</code> is just the <i>code unit</i> and UTF-16 (since XP) does provide means to encode code points beyond a value range of 0..65535 through surrogates. So on modern Windows \"characters\" (code points) beyond the value 65535 are possible by encoding them via surrogate mechanism.</span>",
