I do not want to write my own buggy code.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

They are more than simple test cases, they approximate real software with enough complexity to stress both manual and automated vulnerability discovery. The CBs come with extensive functionality tests, triggers for introduced bugs, patches, and performance monitoring tools, enabling benchmarking of patching tools and bug mitigation strategies.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  For more information, see their blog post\n  <a href=\"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2016/08/01/your-tool-works-better-than-mine-prove-it/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Your tool works better than mine? Prove it.\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  If this particular suite of binaries is not to your liking, I recommend reading the paper\n  <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00140.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   The Art, Science, and Engineering of Fuzzing: A Survey\n  </a>\n  , which includes 240 references. If the paper does not discuss fuzzer benchmark suites, some of the cited papers surely will.\n </p>\n <p>\n  An additional option is to examine\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=fuzzing&type=Repositories\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   fuzzer-related repositories on github\n  </a>\n  such as\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/google/fuzzer-test-suite\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Google's fuzzer test suite\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  If no existing test suites meet your specific, particular requirements, then either a) change your requirements or b) create your own test suite.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
