When analyzing a program, I find it helpfull.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Functions that are referenced very often typically are common functionality. An example would be stuff like\n  <code>\n   strcmp()\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   malloc()/free()\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   strlen()\n  </code>\n  , etc..\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some of those are quite easy to identfiy (like  a\n  <code>\n   strcmp()\n  </code>\n  implementation), and giving a name to those functions early on, makes the analysis of the rest more easy.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
