I know where it is, I know what it's called etc.  I know where in the exe it calls it.  But I am unable to set a breakpoint that triggers using either IDA 7, or OllyDbg 1.1 or 2.0.  Anyone have any tips for getting a functioning breakpoint inside a COM dll?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

All parameters are marshaled through COM. Either use\n <code>\n  GetProcAddress()\n </code>\n or find the function in COM dll in any disassembler.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
