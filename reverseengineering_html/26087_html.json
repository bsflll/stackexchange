    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have files with binary data, the format description of them is very vague and incomplete. E.g., it states that records start with header byte, like (hex) FA, followed by datetime (accurate down to milliseconds) and other data fields, but no indication of field length, least significant bit (LSB) value, or even the byte endianness of record fields. Overall, the files should represent some sort of message log, and I need to decode them properly into meaningful data.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Given the vagueness, incompleteness and possible errors (see below) in format description, my only hope to achieve the goal is a table that I have. It's describing roughly what's in the binary files. E.g., I know that some field from a specific file must decode to a value near 2700, another field must be -8.77, etc. There's at most one record statement like that, per file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've first read\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1331/automated-tools-for-file-format-reverse-engineering\">\n   this question\n  </a>\n  , but I'm not sure which of those tools can help in my situation. So I've translated my input binary into text files, simply displaying the initial data in hex representation, all in one big string. Splitting it by header bytes yielded some weird picture where each record seemed to have different length in bytes. Further investigation has shown that there are more types of headers (I call them sub-headers) than stated in format description. Also the first 1-byte field seems to indicate how many internal 22-byte blocks of data a record additionally has. This first field is out of place - it should've been datetime, judging by the format description. So, it's not that accurate/trustworthy, but at least it pushed me (seemingly) in the right direction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm totally new to reverse engineering, so my questions may be rather bad, but please bear with me:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Is my task even possible to do, given the described situation?\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    If it is, how should I try and find a decoding method? What tools could help find correct field length, LSB and semantic (i.e., which data field is which, as I don't trust that format description too much anymore)?\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <h2>\n  EDIT: Additional information on findings\n </h2>\n <p>\n  Here are some examples of internal 22-byte blocks. One of the records has 7 blocks:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0018001E030825411C004303076D000D230000013802\n0018002B020B56010C001C030011000D22065D011601\n0018003103166A0052001803000A000D22065D011601\n00187F7301197440390017030779000D22065D011701\n0018002B02230540390019030779000D22065D011E01\n00187F7E032578004A0024030009000D22065D012B01\n00180038012B2501040028030010000D230000013101\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Prefixed by 'FE070F600710', where '07' says that there are 7 of them, and '0F600710' seems to be repeated in such prefixes throughout the file. Example of a different, 8-blocks record:\n </p>\n <pre><code>00187F4C020614414E0030030767000D230000012001\n00187F4E000669414E0031030767000D230000012301\n00180014030E3B004A0028030009000D230000012601\n0018002B0110694042001B030778000D230000011C01\n00187F620321080052001203000A000D230000011601\n0018000B00254440390028030779000D230000012E02\n0018001601345C00420018030008000D230000012401\n0018002B013923404A0010030777000D230000011E01\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  As we can see, they all start with '0018', so that may be another sub-header, not data. That leaves us with exactly five 4-byte floats, or two 8-byte doubles and extra 4 bytes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some columns of '00's can be seen, '0D' seems to also repeat in a column pattern. There's a '03' that is also always present. If we think of them as additional delimiters, fields of 7, 1, 2, and 6 bytes can be guessed, which mostly isn't like some standard single- or double-precision floats. That's why in the initial statement I thought real numbers were coded as integers, with some unknown LSB.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Though I do have some additional ideas based on my previous observations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So to directly answer the original 2-part question:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <ol>\n   <li>\n    Is my task even possible to do, given the described situation?\n   </li>\n  </ol>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  It may or may not be possible, depending on what the final goal is, and what resources are available.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you have enough data samples, with matching knowledge of the inputs that created those samples, then it may be possible to figure out the parts of the format that represent those inputs, if that's all you require.  It likely helps that you have the format description, even if it's imprecise or inaccurate.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But if the goal is a complete understanding of the data format (for example, to write an implementation that's 100% compatible), then in my (novice) opinion, it's unlikely you will be able to do that without access to something that reads/writes the files (if for no other reason than you would need a way to validate assumptions).  It perhaps might be possible if you have a large amount of data samples that have adequate variation in the data values across all fields, but I think it would be an uphill struggle, and that there's a high likelihood that understanding would fall short of 100%.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"2\">\n   <li>\n    If it is, how should I try and find a decoding method?

Sure there are hex editors, and tools like 010 Editor or Kaitai Struct or binary diff tools that can help you do the human part, but actually figuring out what everything represents and how it all fits together isn't (as far as I know) something that can be done by a tool, particularly when you only have data files and not machine code. (there are tools to do automated analysis of executable code, but my impression is that data files are a different class of problem).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Good luck to you, I hope you get it figured out.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Previous:\n </p>\n <p>\n  With the caveat that I'm still a novice with regard to RE, I've made some observations based on the posted samples.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It would be helpful if you could look at the other data samples you have and validate/disprove the assumptions below.  I'll make updates as you respond and as I make further progress.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Observations and assumptions so far:\n </p>\n <p>\n  (Byte offsets start from 0)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bytes 02-03:  16 bit int.  Notable is the juxtaposition of small positive values, and values near INT16_MAX, with nothing in between.  This leads me to wonder if the original value might have been negative, but the sign bit got stripped during a conversion.  Alternatively, there wasn't any conversion issue and the data is simply bi-modal.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Aside: if you can give more detail on what the logs are supposed to represent and/or what is generating the logs, it would be helpful.  As would more information on the expected values (e.g., you said \"near 2700\" and \"must be -8.77\") and what they represent.  In general, context is often helpful.  More samples may be helpful as well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Byte 04: 8 bit int.  May represent an enum.  Values seem to always be in the range of 0x00-0x03.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Byte 05-06:  Byte 05 appears to monotonically increase within a group of records.  The step is variable, so likely not a counter, but it could indicate a time stamp or time offset of some sort.  My current thinking is that 5-6 could be \"milliseconds since T\" where T is a reference time found elsewhere in the file.  If the header before the group is supposed to contain a timestamp, then it could be relative to that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, the fact that the field is 16-bits would mean that there would need to be a new reference timestamp at least every minute (approximately) or the field would overflow.  Do the data samples you have reflect that kind of behavior?\n </p>\n <p>\n  That's all I have for the moment.  I'll check back later.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
