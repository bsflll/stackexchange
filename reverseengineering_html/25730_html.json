But you should first install your root Ca cert as user certificate so you get the correct file as\n <code>\n  c8450d0d.0\n </code>\n is only the valid name for the mitmproxy root ca cert. However I would recommend to use a real phone. Banking apps often refuse to work on emulators.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
