For example:\n </p>\n <pre><code>while (true) {\n    std::cout << \"I am running.\n\";\n    Sleep(1000);\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I'm not sure how but no matter how I do this, the target program closes itself after a couple minutes. I know that it is not the DLL's presence because if I don't have an infinite loop and it \"completes\" (but stays in memory) it doesn't detect anything.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am using Cheat Engine to inject the DLL. It is detected both when I inject it normally and when I have the loop in a separate function and create a thread for it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If there aren't a few easy and easy to patch ways to detect things like this, what are alternatives? I'm writing it as a DLL because I need to call functions within the process (CreateRemoteThread-ing the bases wouldn't be easy because most of them have many more than one argument).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

But with some luck, the fact that your threads would only run for a fraction of a second under this proposal, it would be much less likely for the program to detect them.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I wrote an assembly script to handle the conventions I need and allocate &amp; write it, then when I need to call a func I allocate &amp; write a structure containing the convention, address, num of args, and args and pass a pointer to it as an arg to the function with CreateRemoteThread. Probably a lot harder than it has to be but it works, at least. Thanks</span>",
