The\n  <code>\n   gdbserver\n  </code>\n  implements the\n  <a href=\"https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Remote-Protocol.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   Remote Serial Protocol\n  </a>\n  , and IDA is using that to send commands (read/write registers/memory, set breakpoints etc.) and get results.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since IDA is not using the GDB program itself, it cannot process its commands. You need to use IDA commands to control the executable and retrieve the information.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The \"GDB\" commandline at the bottom allows you to send the so-called \"monitor commands\" which allow the remote stub to implement various functionality not covered by the protocol. For example, VMWare's GDB stub supports \"r\" command to get details about some registers.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
