Based on the data sheet you posted, you need to see if Pin 9 is tied directly to ground, or can be controlled by the CPU. If it can be controlled, the chip can be re-programmed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If Pin 9 is tied to the CPU, you may then be in the realm of trial-and-error to see how to control that pin.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In fact, the resister appears to connect to a VIA (the little hole through the PCB) which often indicates a multi-layer PCB. Use a multi-meter to test connectivity.  A resister may also tie it to the cpu. It is hard to tell from the picture.</span>",
