For the life of me I cannot seem to figure how to switch if back to byte format.  Resetting the desktop does not work.  I could use some advice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks\nJim\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You can see the separate bytes in the Hex View (synchronize it with IDA View to see the bytes corresponding to the current instruction).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
