    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I managed to log BLE communications with a Nordic chip based device I am interested in on my Android phone and loaded the log in Wireshark, applying\n  <code>\n   btatt\n  </code>\n  as filter.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It uses some default BLE \"transmissions\" like \"Battery Service: Battery Level\" as well as UART for actual control. Wiresharks Info column shows e.g.:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Sent Write Request, Handle: 0x0011 (Nordic UART Service: Nordic UART Tx)\n...\nRcvd Handle Value Notification, Handle: 0x000e (Nordic UART Service: Nordic UART Rx)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  How can I set a filter to get only the UART Rx and Tx raw data as a list?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
