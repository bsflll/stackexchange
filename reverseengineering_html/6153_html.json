I assume that it is an anti-debugging technique because the process terminates after hitting that line.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But, I could not find any good explanation for\n  <code>\n   \"ZwQueryInformationThread\"\n  </code>\n  stopping the process. For me, the purpose is clear: it tries to make my work harder, but I would like to get more information about that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, my question would be:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Is there someone who can tell me what\n   <code>\n    \"ZwQueryInformationThread\"\n   </code>\n   does?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The technique is documented at\n  <a href=\"https://ntquery.wordpress.com/2014/03/29/anti-debug-ntsetinformationthread/#more-6\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   https://ntquery.wordpress.com/2014/03/29/anti-debug-ntsetinformationthread/#more-6\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   We call NtSetInformationThread two times with wrong parameters and\n  this will reveal most anti-anti-debug plugins. Since Vista it is\n  possible to use NtQueryInformationThread and this makes it much more\n  powerful. Currently no anti-anti-debug plugin is hooking\n  NtQueryInformationThread to prevent this check.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
