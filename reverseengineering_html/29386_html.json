I am using the python bindings.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The task I am trying to automate is tracing the arguments to wrmsr instructions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I notice that hexrays represents them like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>__writemsr(*(_DWORD *)SYSTEM_BUFFER, *((_QWORD *)SYSTEM_BUFFER + 1));\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Using Hexrayscodexplorer I figured out that this is a \"helper\" expression:\n </p>\n <pre><code>helper __writemsr\nea->FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\nvoid (__fastcall *)(unsigned int, unsigned __int64)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  By the looks of the decompilation output, I expect I should be able to access the arguments to the \"helper\" (\n  <code>\n   *(_DWORD *)SYSTEM_BUFFER, *((_QWORD *)SYSTEM_BUFFER + 1)\n  </code>\n  in this case) - however the spots where I would look for operands or function arguments for a function call (cot_call) aren't populated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is this possible to do?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have so far tried to look for arguments in:\n </p>\n <pre><code>cexpr_t.x\n\ncexpr_t.y\n\ncexpr_t.a\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I'm sure I just don't understand how these helper expressions work in IDA. Unfortunately the function I'm trying to analyze is nested very deeply in a huge function, so it's kind of hard to see how all of the trees work together in the ctrees graph view provided by Hexrayscodexplorer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Are the arguments held in some other cexpr object? How do I get to them?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I highly recommend installing it and using it often:\n <a href=\"https://github.com/patois/HRDevHelper\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  github.com/patois/HRDevHelper\n </a>\n</span>\n</body></html>",
