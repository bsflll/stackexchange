Then I saw the \"law\" tag here, which states that \"This tag is for questions relating to legality and not about ethics. If using this tag, then please add details about your location such as state or country\". Yes my question isn't directly about reverse engineering as per the help center, but it's a reverse-engineering based topic (I RE'd an app to get the private key), hence why I posted my question here.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
