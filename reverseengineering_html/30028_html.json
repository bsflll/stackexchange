    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  For reverse calculation of CRC checksums, there is a pretty nice tool –\n  <a href=\"https://reveng.sourceforge.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   CRC reveng\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was looking for, and have not found, a similar tool that can do the same for\n  <strong>\n   non CRC\n  </strong>\n  checksums. For example, using Xor, Sum, bit-shift action for the single bits or nibbles to get the given checksum.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does anyone know about such a tool that can do this job?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/29991/finding-method-for-checksum-calculation-crc-or-xor-or-other\">\n   In my case\n  </a>\n  I have just 5 nibbles of data that are calculated into 1 nibble of checksum, but there is an algorithm behind which I was not able to reverse by myself. And I have a large set of data that can be used to accept or refuse proposed algorithms.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
