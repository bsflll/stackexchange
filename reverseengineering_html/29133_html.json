By default BinDiff will automagically match functions, and then only output the comparison score between the function matches that it finds.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have an a priora candidate function match\n  <code>\n   [func_i from database A, func_j from database B]\n  </code>\n  and I want to get the BinDiff comparison score of this pair.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bonus points if this can be batched and run from the command line, where I can provide a list of function pairs and get the BinDiff comparison score for each pair.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
