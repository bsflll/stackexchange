Now since I'm a very careful user, I'm 100% sure I did not download that. I believe it was planted by someone who had access to my computer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way I can identify who wrote it? (Computer name maybe, VS username, etc?)\nAdvanced methods would be appreciated as well in case whoever wrote it found a way around the obvious ones.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

But maybe a\n <i>\n  Time Date Stamp\n </i>\n (a compile time of the executable) could give you some useful information? You can see it in\n <i>\n  IMAGE_FILE_HEADER\n </i>\n with PEView, for example. Sorry, if its not relevant for you, its the only my suggestion.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
