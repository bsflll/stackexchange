Often times just applying binary signatures which could be inaccurate. Without gaining a decent understanding of VMProtect to recognize the differences this will be quite difficult.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If tools used are open-source or well-documented, you can go over the signature used to detect the version, and validate it manually once you have a good understanding of the rational behind it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
