    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm wondering if anyone has had any luck with Radare2's configuration variables,\n  <code>\n   esil.exectrap\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   esil.iotrap\n  </code>\n  , and\n  <code>\n   esil.nonull\n  </code>\n  while\n  <em>\n   emulating\n  </em>\n  ?\n </p>\n <pre><code>xor eax, eax\nmov eax, dword [eax] <-\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  From what I can tell, if I set all of the variables to\n  <code>\n   true\n  </code>\n  (specifically\n  <code>\n   esil.nonull\n  </code>\n  ), I should expect an exception in the above code and for it to stop executing, or see the eflags change right? Well that's not what happens and execution continues.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is also the\n  <code>\n   cmd.esil.trap\n  </code>\n  variable, amongst a few similar ones, that allow me to execute a command when a trap happens. I've tried commands such as\n  <code>\n   echo trap\n  </code>\n  but again nothing happens. Am I doing something wrong or missing something here? Do I need to configure another variable to make this work? Is this only available in debug mode?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
