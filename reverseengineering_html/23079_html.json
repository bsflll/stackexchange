    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  i have been trying to use IDA to make a breakpoints on a 4 byte memory address \nto find out what arm op code writes to it . yet it fails to set a breakpoint and gives me this message \" Xscale support only 1 byte length hardware breakpoints\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  am using it on rooted mobile Samsung galaxy S6 , Armv8 \nserver connection is fine i can live edit values and functions also set a break point on functions ( 1 byte op code ) it works fine  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  so i guess that either am doing something wrong or debugger is limited . \nplease note that am new to arm debugging o just want to find the op code that writes to this address for an android game .\n </p>\n <p>\n  thank you much appreciated .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
