But none of the answers in any forum seems to work, because no matter what I try the\n  <strong>\n   SymbolsNotMatchingException\n  </strong>\n  is thrown with the error message\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Symbols were found but are not matching the assembly\".\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  By the way, my target \"application\" is a Unity Game.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is some code I use (side note: ProjectPath is the path to my target\n  <code>\n   *.dll\n  </code>\n  ):\n </p>\n <pre><code>var resolver = new DefaultAssemblyResolver();\nresolver.AddSearchDirectory(GetDLLsFolderToResolve(ProjectPath));\n\nusing var assembly = AssemblyDefinition.ReadAssembly(ProjectPath,\n                new ReaderParameters { ReadWrite = true, AssemblyResolver = resolver, \n                    SymbolReaderProvider = new PdbReaderProvider(), ReadSymbols = true });\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I have already the\n  <code>\n   Mono.Cecil.dll\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   Mono.Cecil.Pdb.dll\n  </code>\n  in the same folder due to import Mono.Cecil via NuGet. Also, the target DLL and the PDB also are in the same folder.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does anybody have a working example? Or any idea how this error could be solved? Would be happy for any help.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The only thing I have done wrong was, that my target\n  <strong>\n   DLL\n  </strong>\n  was modified by Mono.Cecil before (I already had read and wrote my target\n  <strong>\n   DLL\n  </strong>\n  and modified it by this way). So the\n  <strong>\n   DLL\n  </strong>\n  and the\n  <strong>\n   PDB\n  </strong>\n  was not the same anymore.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So if you want to run Mono.Cecil just once and you get the exception above do the following things:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Build your target application again (which should have all the DLL's and the corresponding PDB's for each DLL)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Add\n   <code>\n    ReadSymbols = true\n   </code>\n   to the ReadParameters (in my case I don't\nwant to write, so I need only the ReadParameters)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Run your Mono.Cecil application\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Note: This is only a solution if you want to run Mono.Cecil once. If you want to run it again over your target\n  <strong>\n   DLL\n  </strong>\n  , you have to make all steps above again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hopefully this will help someone!\n </p>\n <p>\n  ~Sulan\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
