    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm very much on the software side of things so I'm super inexperienced with debugging hardware. A custom processor I'm working with gives 2 debug pins, and given that it's an ARM system I suspect it to be 2-wire SWD. Looking at some tools I found online, specifically J-Link, it looks like I need to not only connect the two debug pins, but also a ground pin. However, I'm not given a third pin and I don't have a pinout of the processor due to it being a custom build. Is there a way to find a ground on the processor?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

There may also be big copper areas used for the ground plane.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
