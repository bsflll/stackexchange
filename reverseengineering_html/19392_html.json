This is needed for the first initialization of the GOT (remember, the first time you encounter the function@plt, you need to execute the program which is located at the very beginning of the PLT). So, this explain why you have the PLT address repeatedly stored in the GOT (one address per library function that is used in the binary).\n</span>\n</body></html>",
