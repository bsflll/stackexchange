I need to repair these boards but there is no replacement for them. I can make other boards, buy the components, but I can not get the firmware, the microcontroller is a STC 89C58RD.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I found a datasheet:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://www.stcmcu.com/datasheet/stc/STC-AD-PDF/STC89C58RD+-english.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   http://www.stcmcu.com/datasheet/stc/STC-AD-PDF/STC89C58RD+-english.pdf\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  As I could see it can be programmed by serial  RS232 interface. I looked for a programmer but I just find this document in chinese(I'm not sure)  as following :\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://www.stcmicro.com/pdf/STC-ISP-Programmer_V6.0_Manual.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.stcmicro.com/pdf/STC-ISP-Programmer_V6.0_Manual.pdf\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I already read and study a bit about JTAG standard and the TAP controller state machine to do a similar job with a Motorola Microcontroller, but I would like to know if someone know this microcontroller STC 89C58RD or has a tip about how to perform this task.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
