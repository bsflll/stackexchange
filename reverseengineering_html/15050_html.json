I figured out that the number is some kind of a checksum (depends on the text somehow) and also that it increments by one on cases such as this: \"aaaaaaab\" = X and \"aaaaaaba\" = X+1.\nDoes anyone here have any idea what I could be dealing with?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Additional data:\n </p>\n <pre><code>iiiiiiii =  4d0b \niiiiiiil =  920b \niiiiiill =  ce0b \niiiiilll =  120c \niiiillll =  5a0c \niiilllll =  990c \niillllll =  dd0c \nilllllll =  210d \nllllllll =  680d\nliiiiiii =  940b \niliiiiii =  950b \niiliiiii =  960b \niiiliiii =  970b \niiiiliii =  980b \niiiiilii =  990b \niiiiiili =  9b0b \niiiiiiil =  920b \naaaaaaaa =  210f \naaaaaaab =  a110 \naaaaaaba =  a210 \naaaaaaca =  9f0f \naaaaaacb =  1f11 \nbaaaaaaa =  a610 \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The second part is what I have deduced to be the number which depends on the string. It's also obvious from the data  that the first two digits are least significant.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
