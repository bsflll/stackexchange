    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I came across a document called\n  <a href=\"http://anti-reversing.com/Downloads/Anti-Reversing/The_Ultimate_Anti-Reversing_Reference.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   The Ultimate Anti-Reversing Reference\n  </a>\n  , which describes various Anti-Debugging techniques. in point\n  <em>\n   4.Thread Local Storage\n  </em>\n  There is a mention\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Thread Local Storage callbacks are called whenever a thread is created\n  or destroyed (unless the process calls the kernel32\n  DisableThreadLibraryCalls() or the ntdll\n  LdrDisableThreadCalloutsForDll() functions). That includes the thread\n  that is created by Windows when a debugger attaches to a process. The\n  debugger thread is special, in that its entrypoint does not point\n  inside the image. Instead, it points inside kernel32.dll. Thus, a\n  simple debugger detection method is to use a Thread Local Storage\n  callback to query the start address of each thread that is created.\n  The check can be made using this 32-bit code to examine the 32-bit\n  Windows environment on either the 32-bit or 64-bit versions of\n  Windows:\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <pre><code> push eax\n mov eax, esp\n push 0\n push 4\n push eax\n ;ThreadQuerySetWin32StartAddress\n push 9\n push -2 ;GetCurrentThread()\n call NtQueryInformationThread\n pop eax\n cmp eax, offset l1\n jnb being_debugged\n ...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I wrote the c++ code as below\n </p>\n <pre><code>bool fooBar()\n{\n    uintptr_t dwStartAddress;\n    TFNNtQueryInformationThread ntQueryInformationThread = (TFNNtQueryInformationThread)GetProcAddress(\n    GetModuleHandle(TEXT(\"ntdll.dll\")), \"NtQueryInformationThread\");\n\n    if (ntQueryInformationThread != 0) {\n\n        NTSTATUS status = ntQueryInformationThread(\n            (HANDLE)-2,\n            (_THREADINFOCLASS)9,\n            &dwStartAddress,\n            sizeof(dwStartAddress),\n            nullptr);\n       cout << hex << \"dwStartAddress: 0x\" << dwStartAddress << dec << endl;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and I'm running this inside the TLS callbacks\n </p>\n <pre><code>EXTERN_C\n#ifdef _M_X64\n#pragma const_seg (\".CRT$XLB\")\nconst\n#else\n#pragma data_seg (\".CRT$XLB\")\n#endif\nPIMAGE_TLS_CALLBACK p_thread_callback = fooBar;\n#pragma data_seg ()\n#pragma const_seg ()\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The value of dwStartAddress points to the .exe module, not to kernel32.dll as stated in the text. Regardless if I just run the exe or run in debugger or attach a debugger to the process (tho I'm not very experienced with attaching so maybe I'm doing something wrong here).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Am I doing something wrong, or the text is wrong / no longer valid?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
