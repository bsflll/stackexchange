And to be fair, I have found a couple entry points (WHY ARE YOU PEOPLE USING STRCPY()!?)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyway, I'm now taking a look at \"/brew/card1/DB/Ace.dat\" as it defines the installed J2ME programs and I've figured out a way to modify it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Problem is, I don't know what this \"AceDB\" format is. Interesting how the beginning of the file is: \"AceDB Created By Insun Kang,\"...\"SangJung Woo\". Not something you expect in a binary blob! Intriguingly, the phone is the one generating that text. Delete \"Ace.dat\" and restart the phone, all the listed games/apps disappear, but that string is still present in the \"now empty\" file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyone familiar with this? Here's a link to the samples I've uploaded:\n  <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12QpbYtsb6BlMgAw2A3nHM_bGzfi6tJzZ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12QpbYtsb6BlMgAw2A3nHM_bGzfi6tJzZ\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
