The music is contained in files like these:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   <a href=\"https://download-cdn-ac-pocketcamp.akamaized.net/assets/c8nZd_d233535a9244b7238bb423cb4f3f1c6e7dccf686_dena/compass/Android/3c1c9e59/f3c14602/25238ae2/1899ac8d.zdat\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    https://download-cdn-ac-pocketcamp.akamaized.net/assets/c8nZd_d233535a9244b7238bb423cb4f3f1c6e7dccf686_dena/compass/Android/3c1c9e59/f3c14602/25238ae2/1899ac8d.zdat\n   </a>\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  They seem to be split up and saved locally, like this:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   <a href=\"https://mega.nz/#!Xk9wzByB!5WtbQQtBFdQtId0AgJWQx2vIQuj5XUBAL9CD4b3t34Y\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    https://mega.nz/#!Xk9wzByB!5WtbQQtBFdQtId0AgJWQx2vIQuj5XUBAL9CD4b3t34Y\n   </a>\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Although the split up files contain no header, you can see the FSB5 headers inside both, which means they contain music. Although no program I've tested knows how to extract or convert these.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The files do not look encrypted. But cutting out the FSB's do not produce anything valid. Any ideas?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The header appears to be trivial. I have included a description of the header for the\n  <code>\n   .zdata\n  </code>\n  you posted. The\n  <code>\n   .unity3d\n  </code>\n  files contained within are the typical Unit3d webpack files. You can google around for a depacker for those, there are several.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IfaR9.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"example\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IfaR9.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
