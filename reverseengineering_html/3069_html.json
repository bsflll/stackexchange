For example function names, static variables, relations, namespaces, fields, etc...maybe even changes trough version changes, but that's just an extra.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The best thing I came up with is a local MediaWiki, where I create a new page/definition for every function, and stuff, but it's obviously pain in the ass, nearly impossible to maintain. There must be some industry standard right? I wonder if you guys know / use any tool like for this issue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit:\nHere is the structure I'm using now with in the Wiki :\n  <img alt=\"MediaWiki Documentation structure\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/N4UBs.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   If you know another solution, I'm looking forward for your answer as well :)\n  </strong>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

For this, you may want to take a look at\n  <a href=\"http://www.idabook.com/collabreate/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   collabREate\n  </a>\n  or the\n  <a href=\"http://thunkers.net/~deft/code/toolbag/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   IDA toolbag\n  </a>\n  . The unfortunate truth is that a lot of these projects tend to slow down or die completely due to a lack of interest from the original authors.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now if your problem is completely centered around documentation, what I also find fairly common is to have header files with the function, class and structure definitions in them with\n  <a href=\"http://www.doxygen.nl/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   doxygen-\n  </a>\n  or\n  <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   JavaDoc-\n  </a>\n  formatted comments in them. You then use doxygen to generate automatic documentation and class diagrams. This way the documentation becomes completely living, self-maintaining and easily navigated.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
