    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have been starting to use Ghidra and I find the decompiler view very useful. However, when I rename a variable, the name propagates through all uses of that register or stack pointer throughout the function. In most cases this is good, however often when the variable is stored in a register, the same register will be used to store a different variable later in the function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My question is: Is there a way to only rename a variable in a function below the current line? This way, later uses of said register will have the correct variable name.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
