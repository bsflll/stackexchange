In the disassembly, calls to the functions then appeared visually like calls to known WinAPI methods, for example:\n  <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jYRep.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  In OllyDbg 2 it looks like:\n  <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VDgLt.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sadly strings are not directly seen anymore, but it helped me much more seeing when pushes are about to be method parameters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there an OllyDbg 2 compatible plugin providing me this feature?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
