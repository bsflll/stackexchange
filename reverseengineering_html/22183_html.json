I am not sure whether this is some strange Ghidra behaviour or something that is set by default during compile time which produce a lot of assembly code, but I actively write only few LOC.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is my sample C program created with VS Studio 2017:\n </p>\n <pre><code>void main()\n{\n    int x = 1;\n    int y = 2;\n    x = x + y;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And this is what I get when I try to disassemble it with Ghidra:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gDxiS.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gDxiS.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The above screenshot is from the supposed 'entry' point of the program. But why is it so complex? I did a simple program to test how local variables are presented in Assembly and I get such output. Yet it should be few simple Assembly commands instead.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/sevCw.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/sevCw.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am not sure what I am missing out here, so if someone could help me to try and understand this, I would be grateful.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I have one other question, but I will open another thread here, because it requires a bit more information. I am essentially trying to learn difference between Global vs Local variables in Assembly. I know the theory that global are stored in Memory, and Local variables are on Stack, but I want to see it with my C code and my disassembly.</span>",
