Those that I have found via strings / order are different in that the program has a push/pop ebp shell, often uses different registers, and sometimes uses different opcodes, but they accomplish the same thing in the end.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Are there any tools / techniques that could assist me with finding some of the other functions? In the DLL, of course, the functions are, for the most part, right next to each other, but in the program they are mixed, making it hard to find any functions that don't contain strings.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

That's not a main feature but might provide what you are looking for.\n  <code>\n   Options -> Compiler...\n  </code>\n  will open a dialog allowing you to manually set compiler related properties as well as use preconfigured defaults for certain widely used compilers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If IDA identified the compiler being used, those values will be populated accordingly when the dialog is opened.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's a screenshot:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oEJtu.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"IDA's compiler options dialog\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oEJtu.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <h2>\n  PEiD\n </h2>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://tuts4you.com/download.php?view.398\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   PEiD\n  </a>\n  is one of the most widely known and used packer detection tools.
