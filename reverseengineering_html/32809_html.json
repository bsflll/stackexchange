    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am trying to compare a source code to a disassembled version of a Sega Genesis (68000 processor) game. I ran the binary through IDA Pro 7.7 to disassemble it, and when I was going through the code and comparing it to the source code, I noticed that IDA Pro's disassembler labeled some instructions improperly. Is there a way to manually correct it? As it is, I cannot compile the disassembled code, because an error regarding that instruction will come up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  IDA Pro identifies the code as the following:\n </p>\n <pre><code>ROM:00005CA6 013C                                        d0              ; start of messed up disassembly\nROM:00005CA8 00F0 4E75\nROM:00005CAC\nROM:00005CAC                     _1:                                     ; CODE XREF: Findhittype+10â†‘j\nROM:00005CAC 013C                                        d0\nROM:00005CAE 001E 4E75                           ori.b   #$75,(a6)+ ; 'u' ; end of messed up disassembly\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The source code shows it as follows:\n </p>\n <pre><code>    btst    d0,#%11110000\n    rts\n.1\n    btst    d0,#%00011110\n    rts\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Checking the opcode, it looks like the 68k disassembler does not recognize this instruction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is a description of the BTST instruction:\n  <img alt=\"BTST\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Euf7e.png\"/>\n  <img alt=\"BTST-2\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DYREe.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way to change this? Thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

By undefining (\n <code>\n  u\n </code>\n ) and then defining as code (\n <code>\n  c\n </code>\n ) pieces of code, based on the offset from where you say it wrongly identified it, should theoretically do the job. You can also manually set the instructions, but I don't remember the shortcuts for that (and don't know if the decompiler, for example, would heed those changes).\n</span>\n</body></html>",

I did \"analyze\" when asking after highlighting and pressing C, still displaying wrong. Not sure if there is a bug in the disassembler, it looks like this is not a common way to use the BTST instruction\n</span>\n</body></html>",
