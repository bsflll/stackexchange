On my hexdump, here is what I got:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/32smC.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/32smC.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  On binvis.io:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OJ4UY.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OJ4UY.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  And lastly, binwalk:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/waFr9.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/waFr9.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  From the entropy, it shows that it's compressed rather than encrypted, right?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried to ignore the false positive and decided to proceed disassembling with Ghidra. But I got tons of error (I think so) because there were red and orange indicator on the side scroll bar, in the code browser, like the one you would get in Android Studio if there's an error.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On other websites, I found out that getting an output from the false positive is a crucial part to extract/disassemble.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So what seems to be the problem? Do I have to install something like matplotlib for it to work? If there's anything you want me to add, please don't hesitate to let me know. Thanks in advance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Oh, it's a firmware from a Smart Door Lock using a nRF51802 if it matters.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
