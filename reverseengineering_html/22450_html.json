But, some attackers started to exploit the fact that you could overflow the stack, reach the\n  <code>\n   argv[0]\n  </code>\n  and overwrite it with an address that you choose. Indeed, if you can control the address at\n  <code>\n   argv[0]\n  </code>\n  and crash the application, you can leak the whole stack outside of the application.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This technique was mainly used in servers where\n  <code>\n   fork()\n  </code>\n  was used to respawn an instance. As\n  <code>\n   fork()\n  </code>\n  is cloning the memory of the initial process, the ASLR was useless because the same starting memory image was used and, then, the same memory mapping was used again and again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If a secret key or some confidential data were stored in the stack, then an attacker can access it through this feature.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That is why, sometime last year, some developers decided to avoid to use\n  <code>\n   argv[0]\n  </code>\n  when displaying information about the stack-smashing and replaced it by\n  <code>\n   <unknown>\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is an\n  <a href=\"https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/530524/disable-stack-smashing-detected-unknown-terminated/530545#530545\">\n   answer on Unix/Linux Stack-Exchange site\n  </a>\n  that pinpoint the part of the code of\n  <code>\n   glibc\n  </code>\n  that is responsible for that.\n </p>\n <pre><code>void\n__attribute__ ((noreturn))\n__fortify_fail_abort (_Bool need_backtrace, const char *msg)\n{\n  /* The loop is added only to keep gcc happy.
