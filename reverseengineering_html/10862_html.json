To do that you may need a hex editor, like\n  <a href=\"http://www.x-ways.net/winhex/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   WinHex\n  </a>\n  . To NOP out the subroutine, you have to determine from which address it is called. To see that address, in IDA go to\n  <strong>\n   Options -> General\n  </strong>\n  and mark\n  <strong>\n   Line Prefixes\n  </strong>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  It's also nice to see which Opcodes you would like to NOP out. Go to\n  <strong>\n   Options -> General\n  </strong>\n  and write\n  <strong>\n   6\n  </strong>\n  in the field\n  <strong>\n   Number of opcode bytes\n  </strong>\n  . Then your IDA graph mode will look like that:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JRKL4.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"IDA Graph mode\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JRKL4.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  In my example, if I want to skip the foo-subroutine while execution, I need to set the opcode bytes\n  <em>\n   E8 DF E6 FF FF\n  </em>\n  to\n  <em>\n   90 90 90 90 90\n  </em>\n  (E8 is the call mnemonic and the rest are the offset bytes). 0x90 is the NOP opcode.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To NOP out these bytes I open the executable in\n  <a href=\"http://www.x-ways.net/winhex/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   WinHex\n  </a>\n  and search the offset 0x31CC (not 0x4031CC, because 0x400000 is the load address of my executable in IDA). Finally, when I've found the offset 0x31CC I look for the sequence of bytes E8 DF E6 FF FF and then edit them to 90 90 90 90 90. Save it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also you may think about NOPing out of the PUSH-instruction(s) preceding your subroutine in order to avoid errors in the succeeding code.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
