A LIF volume contains a header\n  (identifying it as a LIF volume) and a directory that defines the\n  contents (i.e. files) of the volume.  The size of the directory is\n  fixed when the volume is initialized (see lifinit(1)) and sets an\n  upper bound on the number of files that can be created on the volume.\n  HP-UX contains a set of utilities (referred to as lif*(1)) that can be\n  used to:\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    Initialize a LIF volume (i.e. create a header and an empty directory),\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Copy files to and from LIF volumes,\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    List the contents of LIF volumes,\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Remove LIF files,\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    Rename LIF files.\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n   The lif*(1) utilities are the only utilities within HP-UX where the\n  internal  structure of  a LIF volume is known.

These do not conform to any standard and their structure and contents vary across devices and manufacturers, hence no magic bytes or standard headers or signatures.
