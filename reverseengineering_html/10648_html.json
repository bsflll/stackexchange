The emulator from google will however work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example BlueStacks uses a proprietary technology called LayerCake which allows apps to run at near native speeds. This is possible since LayerCake\n  <em>\n   \"converts\"\n  </em>\n  ARM to x86 and this is the reason for its speed.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
