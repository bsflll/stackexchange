This is SBOX, but with custom values\n     <strong>\n      (values are different from AES SBox)\n     </strong>\n     ;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Size - 256 bytes.

In sentence \"For now I know only first operations in data in algorithm\" I've meant that I've started \"tracing\" through code and for now I found next data transformations. I need to implement this algorithm (write external code which will do same encryption). About \"googling\" constants - it's the first what I've done (no results).\n</span>\n</body></html>",
