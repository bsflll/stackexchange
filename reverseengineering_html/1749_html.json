It might be an interesting discussion for a chat room or even an on-going discussion forum, but it's just not well-suited to\n <i>\n  this\n </i>\n type of canonical Q&A format. Sorry about the confusion. See\n <a href=\"http://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/about\">\n  reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/about\n </a>\n .

Asking whether one of the recommended/suggested tools is effective or not, would be a progression of that. Moreover, this tool would probably have a very limited number of users, and spotting errors in its functioning would require a certain degree of expertise.

Significant reverse engineering skill is more honored in it's absence than it's observance among their target demographic and it's clear this tool caters to them. Stick with IDA and Immunity if you are serious.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
