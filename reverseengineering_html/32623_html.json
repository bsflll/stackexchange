I would like to analyze the USB packets that go between XCode and the device when I install an app from Xcode to the device. I open up wireshark, and I see a few interfaces that seem like an obvious choice:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   iPhone USB: en6\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   en12, en13 (these only showed up when I plugged the phone in, they disappeared when unplugging, so I figured they're related)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Thunderbolt 1-4: en1-4 (I have it plugged into one of my thunderbolt ports, so maybe?)\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I've tried running wireshark as sudo, I've also tried turning the interfaces off and then on again using\n  <code>\n   sudo ifconfig <interface> off/on\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  When I run Wireshark on en6, en12, and en13, I see traffic that looks like it correlates with when I build in XCode and the app starts running, but I don't see anything that looks like it's big enough traffic to copy the code from XCode to the phone, and then run it. All I see are some DHCP discover packets, and some MDSN packets.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
