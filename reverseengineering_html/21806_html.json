When there are question about binary XML, the usual answer is \"use apktool\" (or something similar).\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, no tool is perfect; actually all suggested tools are more or less buggy, and I don't know tool that can successfully decompile and recompile\n  <strong>\n   any APK\n  </strong>\n  from Google Play.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Because such tools are usually open source ones, they are rarely updated and don't fix bugs for years (see\n  <strong>\n   Issues\n  </strong>\n  on github for any such tool and see how quickly issues are closed).\n </p>\n <p>\n  My question is: so,\n  <strong>\n   where is this format documented?\n  </strong>\n  If\n  <code>\n   apktool\n  </code>\n  and similar tools exists, it mean that they found format description somewhere and tried to implement its parser and writer.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
