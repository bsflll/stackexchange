Your code would be also slow when executed in plain J2SE Java.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The simple reason is because you are reading the file byte by byte using an unbuffered\n  <code>\n   FileInputStream\n  </code>\n  which is the worst way you can read a file. Typically IO operations work on blocks of at least 4096 bytes (a typical block site in a file-system).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Therefore a simple modification would be to wrap the\n  <code>\n   FileInputStream\n  </code>\n  in an\n  <code>\n   BufferedInputStream\n  </code>\n  :\n </p>\n <pre><code>var fis = Java.use(\"java.io.FileInputStream\");\nvar bis = Java.use(\"java.io.BufferedInputStream\");\nvar file = bis.$new(fis.$new(\"/data/local/file.txt\"));\n...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However this does not the\n  <code>\n   read\n  </code>\n  calls which will take significant time. Therefore the following code reads byte blocks and procesess them.\nThis should be a lot faster:\n </p>\n <pre><code>var fis = Java.use(\"java.io.FileInputStream\");\nvar file = fis.$new(\"/data/local/file.txt\");\nvar fileBytes = new Uint8Array(file.available());\nconst buffer = Java.array('byte', new Array(4096).fill(0));\nvar x;\nwhile ((x = file.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < x; i++) {\n        fileBytes.push(buffer[i]);\n    } \n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The fasted way would be if your app would contain Java code that directly read a file to a byte array. The less Frida JavaScript calls you have to perform the faster the result.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Therefore check if your app contains a libraray like Apache common IO. Then you could directly execute\n  <code>\n   org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.toByteArray(java.io.InputStream)\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
