This typically means: v2+0x60 on a 32-bit program where a pointer size is 4 bytes, and double that in a 64-bit system. v2 = a2, which is the second int passed to\n <code>\n  sub_1\n </code>\n , probably in register EDX, because it is a __fastcall type func. The first line of your code also calls a function pointer, but I cannot see which scope it belongs to.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

If you have RTTI information in the binary you can use this to give you clues â€“ these should include the class name, function names and function signatures.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
