I'm wondering because there is challenge in hacking lab which is to extract file from ZIP with passwd protection, and it's category is reverse engineering but when I look at the HEX dump I only see the file name.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In this particular case, you reverse engineer the zip file (learning file headers, magic numbers etc) to get the idea of how the file is organised IN ORDER to get something (change file contents, circumvent the file protection, like password etc). So, I don't understand the first comment here.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

If an\n  encrypted ZIP archive was created with WinZip version 8 or earlier,\n  and if the archive contains 5 or more files, Advanced Archive Password\n  Recovery can unlock the archive and decrypt its content â€“ guaranteed!\n  A modern PC takes just under one hour to finish the job.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  If those special cases don't apply, you'd need to apply standard brute-force techniques.
