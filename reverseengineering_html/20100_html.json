Then some mechanisms are done as demonstrated\n  <a href=\"http://www.osronline.com/article.cfm?id=257\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  nicely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, I cannot find out how API calls work on Android NDK. I think there's no IAT in an ELF file. Could anybody tell me how API calls on android works, in assembly level?\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   E.g.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   When I call\n   <code>\n    ALooper_acquire(&mylooper)\n   </code>\n   then it assembles as\n  </p>\n  <pre><code> mov r4, 0x2000  ; address of mylooper\n bl 0x7777fff0      ;address of ALooper_acauire\n ... after ALooper_acquire()\n</code></pre>\n  <p>\n   then in\n   <code>\n    0x7777fff0\n   </code>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <pre><code>Blah blah happens to call system api, ...\n</code></pre>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
