I don't think I'm violating any sort of important confidentiality considerations by simply copying and pasting the response here; I apologize in advance to Hex-Rays if I misjudged that:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   We will try to combine these two type systems into one. However, it is not a simple task:\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    C types can not express everything that asm level types can (e.g. member comments or representation)\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    C types in general cannot be used to represent data items in the assembler listing\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    It is impossible to refer to a member of a C type by its \"id\"\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    asm types are used to represent stack frames; I doubt that C types can do this job nicely\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n   These are just a few things, there are probably many other obstacles on our way. However, the idea is to combine them, or at least hide the struct/enum types from the user and let him work only with local types.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

For example, the fact that it's impossible to refer to a member of a C type by its id is irrelevant: it's just a problem in their C-type system. There's nothing preventing them to make a single type system that supports both ways: and has the ability to refer to members of a type by id. You already can import C-type to the Structures and edit either of those 2, and the other one will update accordingly.</span>",
