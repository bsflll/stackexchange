Remember to try both little-endian and big-endian variants. For finding the entrypoint, see here:\n   <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/11096/\">\n    Reverse Engineering MIPS Bootloader\n   </a>\n  </strike>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note that it may be possible that the firmware is packed or encrypted (check binwalk's entropy analysis); in that case reading it directly from the flash chip may be necessary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   EDIT\n  </strong>\n  : So, apparently the code is\n  <em>\n   not\n  </em>\n  MIPS after all. Going by the objdump output, the instruction set seems to be a derivative of the Motorola/Freescale MCORE (previously Motorola RCE), even if they call it \"csky\". You should be able to disassemble raw binary by specifying binary file format and architecture to objdump, e.g.:\n </p>\n <pre><code>objdump -D -b binary -m csky file.bin\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  In case you don't get good results, try adding\n  <code>\n   -EB\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   -EL\n  </code>\n  to force big-endian or little-endian disassembly. Note that sometimes you may get nonsense disassembly in case there is data intermixed with code (\n  <code>\n   -D\n  </code>\n  forces disassembly of the whole file).\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   EDIT2\n  </strong>\n  :  C-sky support has been added to official binutils source tree.\n  <a href=\"https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commitdiff;h=b8891f8d622a31306062065813fc278d8a94fe21\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   The commit\n  </a>\n  message says:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   V1 is derived from the MCore architecture while V2 is substantially\ndifferent, with mixed 16- and 32-bit instructions, a larger register\nset, a different (but overlapping) ABI, etc.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   EDIT3\n  </strong>\n  : C-SKY and Motorola MCore architecture support\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/pull/11448\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   was added\n  </a>\n  in Radare2 reverse engineering framework.

The CK610M is a v1 ISA, which has the MMU, so it is able to run Linux, which contains support as of v4.19.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There are currently (since October 2018) a $6US C-Sky Development SBC's supporting the CK610M in the gx6605s SoC package produced by NationalChip.
