People who say it's easy are either stupid or want to sell you something. On the other hand, it's relatively easy if the code in question is created by a completely naive person or they really don't give a damn if it being attributed to them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For general education try some results of this search\n  <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/search?q=attribution+in+infosec+is+hard\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.google.com.au/search?q=attribution+in+infosec+is+hard\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  PS I recall seeing some research in attributing code and even binaries (at least to compilers) based on statistical methods, but I cannot recall where.
