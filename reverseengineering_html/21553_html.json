If you check the middle of your trace there are single 1 bits with some spaces between them. Every single bits are stop bit and after every stop bits a new start bit begins. These are the borders of a packet. If you draw some rectangles with the same width you can separate the picture to\n  <strong>\n   12 UART packages\n  </strong>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VF8IL.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VF8IL.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now our job is easy we just need to figure out the values inside each packets. According to my measurements the message is:\n  <strong>\n   0x5F 0xAC 0x11 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x32.\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Regarding the communication settings if you measure the duration of a single stop bit you can calculate by the f = 1/t formula what is the baud rate. It is hard to figure out from this low resolution picture but if I assume the delta 14.02 ms time is the total length of the packets and we have 12*(1+8+1) = 120 bits inside then a single bit duration is 116.83 us, so the baud rate is 8559 baud. The nearest valid UART baud rate is 9600 baud, so I think it should be the correct value.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I think the baud rate is\n  <strong>\n   9600baud\n  </strong>\n  (it should be measured by tool), there is\n  <strong>\n   1 start bit, 1 stop bit, no parity\n  </strong>\n  and the\n  <strong>\n   packet data length is 8 bits\n  </strong>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It is application specific that those ground are connected to each other or not. If you measured this signal between TX pin and GND of your device than the SGND &amp; GND might be connected to each other therefore I do not expect different signal on the scope. Why would you like to use the SGND?</span>",

Sometimes for signal integration check the transmitter calculates a checksum at the end of the message. I tested with the most regular 8 bit algorithms but no result, maybe there is no integration check at all.  If it is only a doorbell I assume it sends only one message,isn't? What is the purpose of your project? Would you like to build your own remote?</span>",
