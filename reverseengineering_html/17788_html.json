So, how can I fix this?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

One possible workaround could be to set the\n  <code>\n   IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE\n  </code>\n  flag in the PE Header which would give it an additional 1GB of address space, e.g using\n  <code>\n   editbin\n  </code>\n  :\n </p>\n <pre><code>editbin /LARGEADDRESSAWARE  windasm32.exe\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However this may lead to bugs and/or crashes if the program is not prepared to handle addresses above\n  <code>\n   0x80000000\n  </code>\n  . And it may still not be enough for the program you're trying to disassemble.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I would strongly suggest using another, more modern disassembler instead that can handle big files. If you can't find the functionality you need, ask a new question about it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
