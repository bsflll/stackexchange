You can find\n  <code>\n   MSR (register)\n  </code>\n  at C6.2.131 and\n  <code>\n   MSR (immediate)\n  </code>\n  at C6.2.130. These both access system control registers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Section D7 describes the generic ARMv8 system control registers. In D7.2.34 you can find the information that your\n  <code>\n   MSR\n  </code>\n  instruction is accessing the\n  <code>\n   HPFAR_EL2\n  </code>\n  register which contains the \"Hypervisor IPA Fault Address.\"  (see the table at the bottom of the section that shows the values of op0/op1/CRn/Cm/op2 that correspond to this register.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  The two instructions you show above are therefore -\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   MSR HPFAR_EL2, X0\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   MSR PSTATEField_SP, #0\n  </code>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
