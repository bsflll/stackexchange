The problem I encounter is that it often bloats the size of the image.  It appears this happens during the\n  <code>\n   mksquashfs\n  </code>\n  step.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If I'm just unsquashing a filesystem and then resquashing it with the same compression, with no modifications, why is the resulting image larger than the original?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
