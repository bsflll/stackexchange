If I disassemble the SO with\n  <code>\n   objdump -d\n  </code>\n  I only see (what I believe to be) the exported symbols. I would like to be able to see also the other symbols that are described in the debug library. Is there any way to do that?\n </p>\n <p>\n  (in a sense I would like to \"merge back\" the data that was stripped during compilation)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Personally I'd probably write a wrapper for the lib and then use that to import, say, the map file generated by IDA.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
