It can be enabled/disabled via\n  <code>\n   Edit -> Tool Options -> Listing Fields -> Operands Field -> Always Show Primary Reference\n  </code>\n  Here's what the help says about the option:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Always Show Primary Reference\n   </strong>\n   - Option to force the display of the primary reference on all operands.Â  If a suitable sub-operand replacement can not be identified the primary reference will be appended to the operand preceded by a \"=>\" prefix.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
