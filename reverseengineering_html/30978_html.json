I am attaching the link to binary along with some of the screenshots which can bring more context to my current problem, in case I missed something, my apologies.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Link to binary :\n  <a href=\"https://easyupload.io/xcqeod\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://easyupload.io/xcqeod\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Screenshots :\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FKHOY.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Garble obfuscated malware\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FKHOY.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pr6UE.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"functions\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pr6UE.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/imLaA.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"functions\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/imLaA.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
