It looks to be a variant of fastcall. Is there a name for this convention?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

What you're seeing is most likely the result of\n  <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301698.aspx\">\n   Link-time Code Generation\n  </a>\n  , also known as LTO (Link-time optimization) or WPO (\n  <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us//library/0zza0de8.aspx\">\n   Whole program optimization\n  </a>\n  ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  When it is enabled, the optimization and code generation is done at link time, when the compiler has access to the code of whole program and all compile units, and can use this information for the more extreme optimizations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From\n  <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xbf3tbeh.aspx\">\n   MSDN\n  </a>\n  :\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   When /LTCG is used to link modules compiled by using /Og, /O1, /O2, or\n  /Ox, the following optimizations are performed:\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    <p>\n     Cross-module inlining\n    </p>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    <p>\n     Interprocedural register allocation (64-bit operating systems only)\n    </p>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    <p>\n     <strong>\n      Custom calling convention\n     </strong>\n     (x86 only)\n    </p>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    <p>\n     Small TLS displacement (x86 only)\n    </p>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    <p>\n     Stack double alignment (x86 only)\n    </p>\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    <p>\n     Improved memory disambiguation (better interference information for global variables and input parameters)\n    </p>\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  In the code snippet you quoted the compiler detected that the function\n  <code>\n   FOO\n  </code>\n  is not called from outside of the program, so it could customize the calling convention to something that uses register values already set up at the place of call, or otherwise improve register allocation. With heavily templated code you can even get several copies of often-used functions that accept arguments in different sets of registers and/or stack.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
