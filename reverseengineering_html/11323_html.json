This programm implements an antidebug technique.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From what I've understand so far, the father\n  <code>\n   ptrace\n  </code>\n  a forked process.\n </p>\n <p>\n  An the child does something like that:\n </p>\n <pre><code>some code\nInt 3\nsome code\nInt 3\nsome code\nInt 3\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and so on\n </p>\n <p>\n  I think the father implements a kind of debugger because with\n  <code>\n   strace -i\n  </code>\n  I see a lot of:\n </p>\n <pre><code>[77b7457c] waitpid(2468, [{WIFSTOPPED(s) && WSTOPSIG(s) == SIGTRAP}], __WALL) = 2468\n[77b7457c] --- SIGCHLD (Child exited) @ 0 (0) ---\n[77baf52c] ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGS, 2468, 0, 0x7fb68be4) = 0\n[77baf52c] ptrace(PTRACE_SETREGS, 2468, 0, 0x7fb68be4) = 0\n[77baf52c] ptrace(PTRACE_CONT, 2468, 0, SIG_0) = 0\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  It reminds me this document\n  <a href=\"http://www.alexonlinux.com/how-debugger-works\">\n   http://www.alexonlinux.com/how-debugger-works\n  </a>\n  where we found the same ideas: a child process, sending TRAP, catched by the father via ptrace calls, setting registers to the right value, then continue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My problem now: How can I debug this \"debugger\"?\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   If I bypass the ptrace, the child will get its SIGTRAP and stop.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   If I leave the ptrace, I can't use gdb\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   If I bypass ptrace and use gdb with\n   <code>\n    set follow-fork-mode child\n   </code>\n   , I can't follow how and where the TRAP is caught in father process because gdb handle it. And if I send\n   <code>\n    signal SIGTRAP\n   </code>\n   the father detects it (how? that's one thing I want to understand) and terminates.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I know that gdb can't follow both father and child, so is there a way to debug this program?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
