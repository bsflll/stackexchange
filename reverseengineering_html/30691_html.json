The main goal was to understand how hex editor used to identify files and extract needed data.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In my case I have 2\n  <code>\n   .ebx\n  </code>\n  files and Chunk ID file. The goal is to use the\n  <code>\n   ebx\n  </code>\n  to extract the data in the chunk file but I am confused. I used 010 editor template to see whether it will find any wav/mp3 data, and it did. I appreciate if someone can explain some of the stuff here and give me some good tuts where I can learn this kind reversal?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://mega.nz/file/rkJWhTpB#c0v5bJfcsriYhK18TcAJZd9Uj4KQiae8u_R2y5ziyUs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Chunk ID file\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://mega.nz/file/LspmCKjJ#iTHgpTS0TDteXZGwKVjEeDiFPdvj0HlEKTa2oXARznU\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Ebx File audio\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
