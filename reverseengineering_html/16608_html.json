A number of studies examined dynamic analysis (Rieck, Trinius, Willems, & Holz, 2011), static analysis (Kerchen et al., 1990) and file properties (\n    <a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/969588/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     Subramanya & Lakshminarasimhan, 2001\n    </a>\n    ). The study examined three multidimensional datasets. The three datasets were generated by combining known malware, known benign and unknown samples into single feature dataset. Once the baseline was generated, the feature weighting was manipulated to see if detection rates would improve (Siddiqui, 2008).\n   </li>\n  </ol>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Text of interest from page 99:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Polymorphic malware may call libraries or use functions available through the operating system such as Microsoft’s dynamic link libraries (DLLs) (Egele, Scholte, Kirda, & Kruegel, 2012). The intended use or abuse of such functions by malware can be linked to file properties of the malware itself (\n   <a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7440587/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Hansen et al., 2016\n   </a>\n   ). Therefore, experiments conducted during this phase, added various features from file properties to those of dynamic-static occurrence tests performed previously. Previous research has shown that there exists a number of “metadata” properties that can be used for malware detection (Kamongi, Kotikela, Kavi, Gomathisankaran, & Singhal, 2013) and (\n   <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2381910\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    A. Singh et al., 2012\n   </a>\n   ). This study found similar results. This study performed extended static to dynamic occurrence testing with all three advanced clustering algorithms (MB, IBk and DLMLP).\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
