    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Downloaded and compiled CRC_reveng, but it's not finding any solutions. Maybe I'm over-thinking this? Not knowing too many other tricks that might be performed on the data or CRC before or after it's computed, I'm looking for guidance. I tried leaving out the start byte, and tried both 8-bit and 16-bit widths. No luck. Here's some sample data packets:\n </p>\n <pre><code>10020200C6FE2D00C5FE2D00047C000010038CEC \n10020200C5FE2D00C6FE2D00046D00001003DFA4 \n10020200C6FE2D00C5FE2D00015B00531003C1C4 \n10020200C5FE2D00C6FE2D0001A405534B000D004B1003F50D \n10020200C6FE2D00C5FE2D00047D00001003C7E7 \n10020200C5FE2D00C6FE2D00046E0000100313B9\n10020200C6FE2D00C5FE2D00015C155344000000000000000000008C4C08080000040D00201003BC41\n10020200C5FE2D00C6FE2D0001A505534B000D004B1003D221\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The data shown is both directions of the Fluke 233 IR port (every other line originates from either the display or the multimeter itself). Seems like \"C6FE2D00\" and \"C5FE2D00\" might be identifiers for the display and multimeter itself, since you see the same patterns on every other line. The data was collected with a DSLogic logic analyzer, and it looks like the data is simply 19200 baud, 8 bits, no parity. Most commonly, the data packets are 20 bytes long, but as you can see, that's not always the case.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any ideas how I might proceed since\n  <code>\n   reveng -w 16 -s [data]\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   reveng -w 8 -s [data]\n  </code>\n  don't turn up anything?\n </p>\n <p>\n  If anyone else has a Fluke 233 and feels like sniffing out the same data lines to compare notes, that'd be awesome. I'm wondering too if there's a unique identifier for the wireless display or if you can simply swap out the display between units.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The polynomial is\n <code>\n  0x1021\n </code>\n , just like CRC-16/CCITT. I've seen initial conditions for the 20-byte messages as either\n <code>\n  0xb37a\n </code>\n or\n <code>\n  0x04fb\n </code>\n . Other initial conditions are\n <code>\n  0x4259\n </code>\n for the longest message, and\n <code>\n  0x3f12\n </code>\n for a 25-byte message. Are there any systems out there that vary the initial condition based on factors such as length or a pre-shared random value?\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Notice the Check values are the same because, as it happens, these two models produce identical results.  One of them has\n  <code>\n   xorout=0xffff\n  </code>\n  , which is reassuring as it's a typical XorOut value.  However the corresponding Init value,\n  <code>\n   0x8c8f\n  </code>\n  , is a little unexpected, but by no means impossible.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Whenever the Init or XorOut values look 'random', it's worth looking again at the packet format in case some of the bytes are not going into the CRC algorithm after all.  These unexpected bytes throw the search code and force the Init and/or XorOut values to adjust to accommodate them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I try removing equal numbers of bytes from the start of each of the packets, until I get this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ reveng -w 16 -s \"0200C6FE2D00C5FE2D00047C000010038CEC\" \"0200C5FE2D00C6FE2D00046D00001003DFA4\" \"0200C6FE2D00C5FE2D00015B00531003C1C4\" \"0200C5FE2D00C6FE2D00046E0000100313B9\" \"0200C5FE2D00C6FE2D0001A405534B000D004B1003F50D\"\nwidth=16  poly=0x1021  init=0xffff  refin=true  refout=true  xorout=0xffff  check=0x906e  name=\"X-25\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  CRC RevEng is searching the preset models and finding one that matches; the command can be repeated with\n  <code>\n   -F\n  </code>\n  to show that it has nothing up its sleeve.  The algorithm will reappear along with its identically-functioning alias, as explained above.  Accordingly, we can say the packet we rejected earlier may have a typo:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ reveng -m x-25 -c 0200C6FE2D00C5FE2D00047D00001003\nc8e7\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
