    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have been discussing the effectiveness of GNU libc's\n  <code>\n   fclose()\n  </code>\n  function to thwart successful exploitation of trivial vulnerabilities due to segmentation fault when called without a valid pointer to a FILE data structure (implementations of libc on other operating systems fail silently). For instance, given a simple vulnerable function using\n  <code>\n   strcpy()\n  </code>\n  such as:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nvoid\nfoo(const char *str)\n{\n  char buffer[256];\n  int ret = 123456;\n\n  FILE *fp = tmpfile();\n  strcpy(buffer, str);\n  if (ret != 500)\n    fclose(fp);\n}\n\nint \nmain(int argc, const char **argv)\n{\n  foo(argv[1]);\n  return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Even when compiled with most memory-protection mechanisms disabled:\n </p>\n <pre><code>cc -m32 -ggdb -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -z norelro main.c\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The function, regardless of being overwritten up to\n  <code>\n   EIP\n  </code>\n  would never return since:\n </p>\n <pre><code>(gdb) r $(python -c \"print 'A' * 286\")\nProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n0xf7e3e307 in fclose@@GLIBC_2.1 () from /lib/libc.so.6\n(gdb) ba\n#0  0xf7e3e307 in fclose@@GLIBC_2.1 () from /lib/libc.so.6\n#1  0x080484bc in foo (str=0x41414141 <error: Cannot access memory...\n#2  0x41414141 in ?? ()\n#3  0x41414141 in ?? ()\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Could there be a way to achieve code execution for such trivial function?. Since the\n  <code>\n   ret\n  </code>\n  variable can be overwritten, can it be set to 500 so that the if condition which determines if\n  <code>\n   fclose()\n  </code>\n  is called or not could be bypassed?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The assumption of the ordering was on purpose, the overflow should rewrite <code>fp</code> address. Regarding <code>fclose()</code> always throwing an exception when invalid pointers are given, I couldn't bruteforce a single address that did not ended on SIGSEGV, but sometimes advances up to FILE-&gt;_IO_file_close.</span>",
