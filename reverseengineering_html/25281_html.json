A small minority (e.g. ntdll, kernel32, ntoskrnl) also include various system\n  <strong>\n   types\n  </strong>\n  (structures , enumerations) which is very useful for low level debugging. But even without types you can often guess a lot just from the function names.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
