I know that it depends mostly on the compiler, but I think that for most CPU architectures it should be a lot of CALL/RETN/JMP/PUSH/POP opcodes (statistically more than others). Or maybe should I search for some patterns in code specific for a particular CPU (instead of opcode occurrences)?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I would take 20 programs for each architecture you want to know, with variable sizes, and save them.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    When confronted with a program that I wanted to know which architecture it is, I'd compute its NCD against all my examples.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    I'd pick the best (smaller) NCD and would then verify it if is was a real match (let's say, trying to run it on the discovered architecture).\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Update\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've always done this\n  <em>\n   by hand\n  </em>\n  , when it comes to NCD. How I did it:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    you have 20 files for SPARC and you call them A01, A02, A03, and so on. Your x86 files: B01, B02, etc.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    You get the unknown file and call it XX.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Choose your preferred compression tool (I used Gzip, but see remarks at the end of this answer).\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Calculate NCD for the first pair:\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  NCD(XX,A01) = ( Z(XX+A01) - min(Z(XX), Z(A01) ) / max(Z(XX), Z(A01))\n </p>\n <p>\n  Z(\n  <i>\n   something\n  </i>\n  ) means that you compress the\n  <em>\n   something\n  </em>\n  with Gzip and get the file size after compression. For example, 8763 bytes, so Z(\n  <i>\n   something\n  </i>\n  ) = 8763.\n </p>\n <p>\n  XX + A01 -> means that you concatenate things. You append the A01 file to the end of the XX file. In Linux, you could do a\n  <code>\n   cat XX A01 > XXA01\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  min() and max() -> you calculate the compressed size of XX and A01, and use the minimum and maximum that you get.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So you'll have a NCD value: it'll lie between 0 and 1, and use as many decimals places as you can, because sometimes the difference is in the 7th or 8th digit. It'll be like comparing 0.999999887 to 0.999999524.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You'll do that for every file, so you'll have 20 NCD results for SPARC, 20 for x86...\n </p>\n <p>\n  Get the smaller NCD of all. Let's say that the B07 file gave you the smaller NCD. So, probably, the unknown file is a x86.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tips:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    your unknown and your test files must have a similar size. When you compare a file with bigger or smaller ones, NCD won't do its magic. So, if you'll be testing files of 5 to 10k, I'd get test files of 2.5k, 5k, 7.5k, 10k, 12.5k ...\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    In my Master's degree I got better results always using the smaller NCD value. The second best method was to do some voting: get the 5 smaller NCD results, and see which architecture got more votes. Ex.: smaller NCD were A03, A05, B02, B06, B07 -> B go 3 votes, so I'd say it's a x86...\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    compressors based on the Zip construction have a limitation of 32kB: the way they compress things, they just consider 32kB at time. If your XX + A01 is bigger than this, Gzip, Zip, etc., won't give you good results. So, for files that are bigger than 15 or 16kB, I'd choose another compressor: PPMD, Bzip...\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
