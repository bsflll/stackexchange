But Visual Studio for example has a debugger, that can directly point to the source (from where the problem occurs) if you start the debugger in the same instance where you loaded your solution. Also Visual Studio supports to output PDB files (and a MAP file, if needed) which would give you all function names, variables names, parameters, etc. This is helpful too when debugging in IDA.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You should find out if your compiler can also output a kind of 'debug' file which you can import in IDA Pro. If not, then it's not possible in this case.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It's very hard to read a piece of code and then copy it and not have the original ideas influence your design. You have a similar situation only that you're looking for matching functions in order to ease your reverse engineering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is what I would do:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Find the binaries I suspect contains the code I'm interested in identifying.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   If I have reference source that I'm interested in looking for in the binaries:\n   <ul>\n    <li>\n     Find out what compiler was used in order to build the suspect binaries.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Use the same compiler to compile the reference source. Now we have reference binaries and suspect binaries.\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Once I have two binaries, reference and suspect I would run them through something that analyzes flow graphs and call graphis, such as\n   <a href=\"http://www.zynamics.com/bindiff.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    BinDiff\n   </a>\n   .\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   You then get a set of candidates that you have to go in and analyze more thoroughly.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I've successfully used this strategy to successfully identify and analyze similarities between software written in a native language and software written in a managed language. It's quite a powerful technique. If you're on a constrained budget and both reference and suspect binaries are targeting the same platform using the same compiler, you can build a\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/tech/flirt/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   FLIRT\n  </a>\n  database from your reference binaries. This will likely miss a large number of good candidates though.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you're not analyzing any binaries produced by someone else, just build your target with debug information and you'll get all the information you need, see\n  <a href=\"http://wiki.dwarfstd.org/index.php?title=Dwarf_FAQ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   DWARF\n  </a>\n  if you're using GCC or PDB if you're using MSVC.
