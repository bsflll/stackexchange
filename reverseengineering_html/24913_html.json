If you need to check other operands I think it's easy to start from the code above. You could also match the mnemonic (CMP, MOV, etc) using\n  <code>\n   idc.print_insn_mnem(cur)\n  </code>\n  if needed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Additionally, I've included a check to make sure the code ignores library and thunk functions as you're probably not interested on them. Feel free to remove the check if you want. ;-)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In IDApython you may use this function:\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/277.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/277.shtml\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
