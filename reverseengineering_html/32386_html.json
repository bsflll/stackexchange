Is this compatible with a better known CPU?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there any (free) tool that could help? Like an extension for Ghidra, which\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions#what-processors-are-currently-supported\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   reportedly\n  </a>\n  does not support this instruction set out of the box?\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Update: I'm now wondering how far the CPU can be from the\n  <a href=\"https://wiki.superfamicom.org/65816-reference\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   65(C)816\n  </a>\n  of SNES fame.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
