To me it seems your assumption about developing your program as a shellcode is incorrect and will create problems for you later on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This kind of thing is often addressed using Packers and Crypters. There are several relatively simple ones (like\n  <a href=\"https://upx.github.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   UPX\n  </a>\n  ), while some are considered quite effective (\n  <a href=\"https://www.oreans.com/themida.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Themida\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"http://www.aspack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   ASPack\n  </a>\n  ). There are many more available packers to choose from, some are free and some are commercial.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you are reluctant to use any of the available packers I believe researching that domain will prove more fruitful to your goal. Using a shellcode will more often require:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Writing location independent code.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   creating your own DLL loading/locating and API resolving functionalities.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   writing or editing assembly directly.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  And will however provide only little advantage over code compiled normally. For example, anti-debugging techniques (as mentioned in your comments) are not limited to \"shellcode\" and can just as easily be injected/written into C/C++ code. Moreover, most packers include anti-debugging tricks by default (or provide such configuration).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
