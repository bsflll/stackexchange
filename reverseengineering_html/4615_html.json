Depending on the ZyNOS version, compiler version, compiler options, target architecture, etc., even the same source code will compile to a different sequence of bytes and instructions, and different versions/flavors of ZyNOS may be \"packaged\" very differently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In your case, I can almost guarantee that those LZMA signatures are valid, and probably contain some data/code. There is also probably raw, uncompressed code in the image as well (try binwalk -A to search for raw executable code).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some general steps that you'll need to accomplish what you want:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Decompress all compressed blocks and identify which ones, if any, contain executable code\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Disassemble all code (probably starting with any code that wasn't compressed to start with, since it's probably used to bootstrap the system and decompress the other sections of the firmware)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Part of the disassembly process will be identifying the load address of each code section; without this, data xrefs won't make sense. Look for references to absolute memory addresses for hints (e.g., jumps to direct addresses, function tables, jump tables, etc).\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Now you can start actually reversing the code, looking for code that handles requests for the ras file. If you're lucky you'll have a symbol table which no disassembler will understand, so you'll have to write a script to parse the symbol table and rename all symbol addresses. If you aren't so lucky, identification of functions must be done manually.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Once you have identified the code that needs to be patched, you can patch it in a similar manner to piotrbania, though obviously details may differ slightly for your firmware image.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Re-compress and re-pack the firmware image parts, update all header checksums, then upload to your device and hope it doesn't turn into a paperweight. :)\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  So to answer your question, yes, this is certainly possible. But I'm not aware of a pre-built solution that will allow you to easily extract/patch/re-build the firmware, so it will take some effort to accomplish. Obviously, having some sort of debug access to the device (e.g., UART or JTAG) will help a lot, as evidenced by piotrbania's work.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
