    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have injected a DLL into an external application that is based on the QT framework. I, then, use the method\n  <code>\n   QApplication::allWidgets()\n  </code>\n  and iterate through the list of widgets to find a\n  <code>\n   QGraphicsView\n  </code>\n  that represents the window I want to interact with.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The buttons and other controls in the scene are all derived from\n  <code>\n   QGraphicsObject\n  </code>\n  . But, I don't have the source. So, I can only cast to\n  <code>\n   QGraphicsObject\n  </code>\n  and not to the actual type.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The list of methods from the meta-object is incomplete, which is to be expected, because I cast to a\n  <code>\n   QGraphicsObject\n  </code>\n  . I can find the method names using IDA though.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is it possible to call a particular method, and how would you do it?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Can you determine which compiler&version was used to create the binary? If it was MSVS, what you can do is install that version of MSVS, and then write a small test program with a basic class that inherits from QGraphicsObject. Then you can compile it with some special flags (see answer #2 here:\n <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/302446/how-can-one-inspect-a-vtable-in-visual-c\" title=\"how can one inspect a vtable in visual c\">\n  stackoverflow.com/questions/302446/â€¦\n </a>\n ) and MSVS will output the format of the object, including the vtable.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
