Could the first one be a stupid kd -kl / livekd issue again?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Curious. I thought it could be that 0xf0 has never been mapped as opposed to mapped then unmapped, and for some reason left as MiNonCached and not MiNotMapped (and it may or may not return it to MiNotMapped when unmapping a cached area, but I don't know). I would have thought that this range would never have been mapped on ntoskrnl because it's not supposed to be using BIOS services.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the host:\n </p>\n <pre><code>lkd> !pfn 0xf1\n    PFN 000000F1 at address FFFFFA8000002D30\n    flink       FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF  blink / share count FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF  pteaddress B47756FFFFE9FFFF\n    reference count 517C    used entry count  B4E9      Cached    color 2D   Priority 7\n    restore pte FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF  containing page        756FFFFE9FFFF  Bad           WEXY\n          WriteInProgress InPageError ParityError RemovalRequested\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This time it's 'Cached', and clearly contains garbage, so the MiNotMapped part of the question may be irrelevant, and should have perhaps been\n  <em>\n   whats the difference between a garbage PFN entry and a zero intialised one?\n  </em>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
