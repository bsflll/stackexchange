    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I came across \"a strange\" inconsistency in terms of the function addresses in the particular application.\n </p>\n <p>\n  First, the main function is hooked successfully, the address is derived in a fashion:\n </p>\n <p>\n  baseAddress + Offset, i.e. from Ghidra baseAddress is\n  <strong>\n   140000000\n  </strong>\n  and the address of the main function is:\n  <strong>\n   0x39EA0\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, the main function address is\n </p>\n <pre><code>(DWORD_PTR*) baseAddress + 0x39EA0 / (2 * sizeof(DWORD))\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This works just fine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But now I am trying to call\n </p>\n <pre><code>gladius::world::World* __fastcall gladius::gui::GUI::getWorld(gladius::gui::GUI* thisptr);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  from within the hooked function and\n </p>\n <p>\n  which according to Ghidra supposed to be at\n  <strong>\n   14003ef30\n  </strong>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  That makes the offset equal to\n  <strong>\n   0x3ef30\n  </strong>\n  (plus pointer arithmetic). But at that offset from the baseAddress I get\n </p>\n <pre><code>Gladius.exe!proxy::video::RenderQueueManager::get\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  which in the static analysis is at address\n  <strong>\n   14003ecc0\n  </strong>\n  , 270 bytes away from the static address of\n  <em>\n   getWorld\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, what is happening? Why the stack shifted by 270 bytes? Is it the size of my hooked function?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Not sure, why it is 2* in this case, but it gives the right offset for most of the functions. I will update the question with the screenshots for the place in the debug run in question.
