However, it's possible that for your system you need to enable multilib support [1] so that your x86-64 OS can run x86-32 binaries (that\n  <code>\n   RelayD\n  </code>\n  ELF file) and that you may have to install some packages you have to install in order to have GDB support this scenario. The alternative could be to run a 32-bit container (which still requires multilib, if I am not mistaken) and inside that prepare and debug with a 32-bit GDB or use a 32-bit VM to get the debugging done. But for all I know most distros support the scenario of debugging a 32-bit binary on the 64-bit host system. So it's likely a matter of installing some extra packages.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Oh and last but not least you may be missing some of the shared objects (libraries) that the 32-bit executable expects. Use\n  <code>\n   readelf\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   ldd\n  </code>\n  on your\n  <code>\n   RelayD\n  </code>\n  to find out more.\n </p>\n <p>\n  [1]\n  <code>\n   yum groupinstall \"Compatibility Libraries\"\n  </code>\n  should do the trick, provided\n  <code>\n   multilib_policy=all\n  </code>\n  is set in your\n  <code>\n   yum.conf\n  </code>\n  and you're indeed running on RHEL (or CentOS or Scientific Linux) as suggested by the GDB output you gave. Also make sure\n  <code>\n   yum.conf\n  </code>\n  does\n  <em>\n   not\n  </em>\n  contain\n  <code>\n   exclude = *.i?86\n  </code>\n  to preclude the 32-bit packages from being considered (\n  <code>\n   exactarch=1\n  </code>\n  may also have an adverse effect, so consult\n  <code>\n   man yum.conf\n  </code>\n  ). You can also pick and choose your own compatibility libraries by searching the list with\n  <code>\n   yum search compat|grep ^compat-\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You may have to use <code>readelf</code> instead (which doesn't use the loader) <i>or</i> install a 32-bit linker first, so <code>ldd</code> can do its job. Otherwise, I reckon, something fishy is going on ...</span>",
