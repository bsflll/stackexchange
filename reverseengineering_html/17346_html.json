On Page 32, the author states,\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   The relocation records for 32-bit ELF files are the same as for 64-bit, but use 32-bit integers. The following example for are object file code will be compiled as 32-bit so that we can demonstrate implicit addends, which are not as commonly used in 64-bit. An\n   <strong>\n    implicit addend\n   </strong>\n   occurs when the relocation records are stored in\n   <code>\n    ElfN_Rel\n   </code>\n   type structures that don't contain an\n   <code>\n    r_addend\n   </code>\n   field and therefore the addend is stored in the relocation target itself. The 64-bit executables tend to use the\n   <code>\n    ElfN_Rela\n   </code>\n   structs that contain an\n   <strong>\n    explicit addend\n   </strong>\n   . I think it is worth understanding both scenarios, but implicit addends are a little more confusing, so it makes sense to bring light to this area.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  What is the actual definition of an\n  <em>\n   \"addend\"\n  </em>\n  ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

(If instead we loaded the binary at 0x800000 then this should point to 0x805678, hence it needs relocating.) I don't know ELF, but my reading of this is that\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    in the implicit case the relocation table stores just offsets into your binary, in this case 0x1234, and in our binary at offset 0x1234 we store the target offset 0x5678. Therefore relocation becomes\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    for each address\n    <code>\n     A\n    </code>\n    in the relocation table\n    <code>\n     *(base + A) += base\n    </code>\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    (This is how relocation tables work in PE files.)\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    in the explicit case, the relocation table stores both the offset into your binary and the target offset, i.e. 0x1234 0x5678.

So knowing the first argument is not just an argument to\n   <code>\n    add\n   </code>\n   but the destination;\n   <code>\n    add rax, rbi\n   </code>\n   will store the result in\n   <code>\n    rax\n   </code>\n   . If assembly was displayed with operators instead, we'd have\n   <code>\n    rbi += rax\n   </code>\n   and\n   <code>\n    rax += rbi\n   </code>\n   .\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Because the\n   <em>\n    addend\n   </em>\n   is not\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   an offset, and the augend is not always the base.
