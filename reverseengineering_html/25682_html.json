By default, IDA 7.4 will install IDAPython for Python 2.7, but users will\nhave the opportunity to pick an alternative build that runs against\ntheir Python 3.x installation.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  I have found\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/ida74_idapython_python3_porting_guide.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   this porting guide\n  </a>\n  very useful. Using Python 3 with IDA 7.4 is great, and the new API is cleaner in many ways.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
