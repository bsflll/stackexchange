However, I had started messing around with a function changing from\n  <code>\n   code\n  </code>\n  to\n  <code>\n   data\n  </code>\n  and  vice versa and completely messed the function up and destroyed the way it looked like. I don't want to start new database on the executable and re-do all my work.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way to re-analyse a single function and return it to the way it looked like after initial analysis?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

IDA almost give you ability of doing anything wih obfuscated code to help you to understand code correctly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Addendum\n  </em>\n  After converting to C (code), do Alt+P to create/edit function. In addition, rebuild layout graph by go to Layout view, right clicking empty space and selecting \"Layout graph\".\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
