On a higher level the pseudo code of what i want to achieve could be:\n </p>\n <pre><code>static last_r9 = 0;\nif(r9 != last_r9){\nLog();\nlast_r9 = r9;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Is is even possible to achieve something like that?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's an screenshot just for reference:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/q298c.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/q298c.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
