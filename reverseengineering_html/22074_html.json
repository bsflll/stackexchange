This is a good sound quality WIFI and Bluetooth speaker, but with Aether going bust, there is no support only a final firmware that enabled spotify.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What Information I currently know:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    CPU MCIMX6L3DVN10AB Arm Cortex A9:\n    <a href=\"https://www.nxp.com/part/MCIMX6L3DVN10AB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     https://www.nxp.com/part/MCIMX6L3DVN10AB\n    </a>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Storage 4G Sandisk:\n    <a href=\"https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/NYUMNKWYff1QtBte.huge\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/NYUMNKWYff1QtBte.huge\n    </a>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Board images:\n    <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Aether+Cone+Speaker+Disassembly/102058\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Aether+Cone+Speaker+Disassembly/102058\n    </a>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Firmware: This can be got from the GitHub page as a .morse file.\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/AetherThings/AetherCone/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n     https://github.com/AetherThings/AetherCone/wiki\n    </a>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Investigation:\nI have tried using binwalk to examine and extract the files but I have had limited success.\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ binwalk FRM000104.03.01.0013.morse\n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION`\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27842795      0x1A8D8EB       StuffIt Deluxe Segment (data): f\n30729686      0x1D4E5D6       MySQL MISAM compressed data file Version 7\n57321984      0x36AAA00       POSIX tar archive, owner user name: \"ader.img\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I have extracted the firmware to give this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>ls -larth _FRM000104.03.01.0013.morse-0.extracted/\ntotal 29M\n-rw-rw-r--  1    500   501   27 Oct  2  2015 version.txt\n-rw-rw-r--  1    500   501  256 Oct  2  2015 signature.sha256\n-rwxr-xr-x  1    500   501   12 Oct  2  2015 pre-inst.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x  1    500   501  184 Oct  2  2015 post-inst.sh\n-r--r-----  1    500   501 1.9K Oct  2  2015 cert.pem\n-rw-rw-r--  1    500   501   31 Oct  2  2015 bootloader.ver\n-rw-rw-r--  1    500   501 221K Oct  2  2015 bootloader.img\n-rw-r--r--  1    root  root 29M Sep  8 08:06 1A8D8EB.sit\n-rw-r--r--  1    root  root 231K Sep 8 08:07 36AAA00.tar\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  If I try and read these, there is nonsense.

My main aim would be to either get the root password as ssh is open on the device or be able to edit the firmware file to allow root so that I can update packages and hopefully keep this thing alive, people have had issues with the spotify connect plugin not working with more recent spotify versions.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
