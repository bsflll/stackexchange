Basically it has a basic auth system (login and pass). I sniffed traffic with Wireshark and found the packets are encrypted. So i started to reverse engineer it. I tried Ollydbg and IDApro with stealth plugins but still can't run it with debugger. Here is a message when I try to run it with debugger:\n </p>\n <pre><code>A debugger has been found running in you system\nPlease unload it from memory and restart your computer\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I suppose it is a some lib to prevent debugging because it a pretty standard message because when I try to google it, it appears not only in this program.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I dive into code. At this moment i found only this 2 functions:\n </p>\n <pre><code>.vmp1:013F9BDC loc_13F9BDC:                            ; CODE XREF: sub_1427AA5+4j\n.vmp1:013F9BDC                 not     dl\n.vmp1:013F9BDE                 bt      ebx, 1Eh\n.vmp1:013F9BE2                 rol     dl, 3\n.vmp1:013F9BE5                 call    loc_144B5CD\n.vmp1:013F9BEA                 and     al, 14h\n.vmp1:013F9BEC                 xor     al, 0C3h\n.vmp1:013F9BEE                 lodsb\n.vmp1:013F9BEF                 cmp     al, 0EAh\n.vmp1:013F9BF1                 imul    ebx\n.vmp1:013F9BF3                 add     [eax-36h], edx\n.vmp1:013F9BF6                 mov     dh, 0DFh\n.vmp1:013F9BF8                 sub     ch, [eax]\n.vmp1:013F9BFA                 test    al, dh\n.vmp1:013F9BFC                 wait\n.vmp1:013F9BFD                 adc     esi, 28h\n.vmp1:013F9C00                 int     3               ; Trap to Debugger\n.vmp1:013F9C01                 sub     ah, bh\n.vmp1:013F9C03                 shr     byte ptr [ecx], 1\n.vmp1:013F9C05                 jmp     far ptr 0F03Dh:0AE62FB1Fh\n\n    loc_1402816:                            ; CODE XREF: sub_15E0009-1DD80Ej\n.vmp1:01402816                 pop     ebp\n.vmp1:01402817                 arpl    [ebx], cx\n.vmp1:0140281A                 adc     al, 0C8h\n.vmp1:0140281C                 int     3               ; Trap to Debugger\n.vmp1:0140281D                 sbb     al, 0B2h\n.vmp1:0140281F                 loopne  loc_140285A\n.vmp1:01402821                 or      al, 0CFh\n.vmp1:01402823                 fisttp  qword ptr [edi]\n.vmp1:01402825                 xchg    eax, edx\n.vmp1:01402826                 sbb     ah, 7Fh\n.vmp1:01402829                 retf\n.vmp1:01402829 ; END OF FUNCTION CHUNK FOR sub_15E0009\n.vmp1:01402829 ; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n.vmp1:0140282A                 dw 0BB70h\n.vmp1:0140282C                 dd 2FEC5FA0h, 1C84B195h, 0E7C1879Fh, 0F4D8BCF8h\n.vmp1:0140283C ; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n.vmp1:0140283C                 push    ds\n.vmp1:0140283D ; START OF FUNCTION CHUNK FOR sub_15E0009\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I also tried to undefine those or define as nop. I'm pretty new to reversing and I know only basic of Assembler but have background with C or C++ and some other languages. How can I avoid this anti-debugging ? Maybe some specific settings of a plugin ? Or maybe using another debugger ? Right now I'm trying to use Windbg and win 32 debugger. Or please tell me where to dig. here is DIA output.\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3u5wx.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3u5wx.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
