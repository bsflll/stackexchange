It's a simple buffer overflow with the return address pointed to the system call with the string \"/bin/sh\" on the stack. For some reason, when I try to execute the program, although the program perform a system call with string \"/bin/sh\", but no shell was spawned, and I'm not sure why that is the case. Below snapshots of the stack before and after entering system call.\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/dTSDZ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"stack information\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/dTSDZ.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <sup>\n   <i>\n    The stack before entering system call.

As for a program, it just declare a buffer of 64 bytes and call gets() to fill that buffer.
