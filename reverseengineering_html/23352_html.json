Also, since you mentioned pseudo-code (which IDA does\n <i>\n  not\n </i>\n generate), I replaced\n <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ida\">\n  ida\n </a>\n by\n <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hexrays\">\n  hexrays\n </a>\n . The latter is the plugin\n <i>\n  for IDA\n </i>\n providing decompilation (and generating pseudo-code).\n</span>\n</body></html>",

The pseudocode will then change to reflect the changes you have done (or simply the optimizations done by the Hex-Rays decompiler). Typical changes you will see are the number of function arguments that will be adjusted to be more correct.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Usually what I do if I encounter pseudocode that seems incorrect in terms of function arguments, I will click around and \"peek\" into the different problematic functions before I go back to the initial function I started with and re-analyze it. The pseudocode will then look way better and be easier to work with.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And if you would like to re-analyze the whole binary you coud always do that by going to\n  <code>\n   Options -> General -> Analysis -> Reanalyze program\n  </code>\n  , and\n  <code>\n   Ctrl+F5\n  </code>\n  to decompile all functions.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
