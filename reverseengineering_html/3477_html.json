Putting those in different parts of the program and then checking the difference can give you some primitive detection.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/time/\">\n    <code>\n     time()\n    </code>\n   </a>\n   - Get the current calendar time.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"http://faydoc.tripod.com/cpu/rdtsc.htm\">\n    <code>\n     RDTSC\n    </code>\n   </a>\n   - Gets the current value of the processor's time-stamp counter. This one could be hard to find if placed wisely.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  The thing is, that all those could be neutralized once the researcher became aware of them. There are various debugger plugins which will make that happen by patching APIs, installing drivers and etc. Of course, it could be done manually in most cases.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What you really should think of is placing and integrating those inside your code, so it will be less evident what the real purpose of the calls to the APIs/instruction.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If the delta is significantly larger than you would expect in native execution mode, then it suggests the presence of the debugger.  Note, however, that this is far from an accurate method, since that result is indistinguishable from a system under heavy load.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is covered in some detail in section \"(C) Execution Timing\" in my \"Ultimate\" Anti-Debugging Reference (\n  <a href=\"http://pferrie.host22.com/papers/antidebug.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://pferrie.host22.com/papers/antidebug.pdf\n  </a>\n  )\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
