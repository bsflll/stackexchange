    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a binary that I'm attempting to reverse engineer to find a flag.  From using ghidra I have found that the flag is stored in the program at a point called \"check\" and then run through memfrob to compare to the string that the user inputs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm trying to either debug the binary to run until the point after the memfrob was called and the value is stored in a register to view its value or take the value from the assembly that I found and run that through memfrob in my own C script.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm having trouble finding an explanation on how to do it the first way and when I try to run memfrob on my own in C it tells me \"implicit declaration of function 'memfrob'\" but I am including string.h.\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <string.h>\nint main(void)\n{\n\n    char check[20] = {0x5f,\n    0x40,\n    0x5a,\n    0x15,\n    0x75,\n    0x45,\n    0x62,\n    0x53,\n    0x75,\n    0x46,\n    0x52,\n    0x43,\n    0x5f,\n    0x75,\n    0x50,\n    0x52,\n    0x75,\n    0x5f,\n    0x5c,\n    0x4f};\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++)\n    {\n        printf(\"%x\",check);\n    }\n\n    memfrob(&check,0x14);\n\n    \n    \n    return 0;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I'm not sure what the correct way to go about this is, but so far I've had no success with either.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have also tried running it through things like CyberChef to decrypt the XOR42 from memfrob but that also ended up giving me nothing useful\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
