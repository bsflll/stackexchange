Just to give you an idea: you don't mention a target platform, but it could matter. Your question\n <i>\n  sounds\n </i>\n as if you are attempting to change the functionality of an existing program, but by way of a DLL placement attack or\n <code>\n  LD_PRELOAD\n </code>\n your endeavor may be easier to achieve than through round-tripping between disassembly and feeding that to the disassembler. One relevant point would also be if the program performs any sort of integrity checks on itself.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Generating the assembler code isn't the problem but references (-> address) between different assembler blocks or to data. When decompiling you have to decide for every number if it is a a simple value or an address. Common decompilers can identify a lot of references, but when fully reversing a program just missing one can mean the program will no longer work after recompiling. Therefore binary modifications usually start with the original binary and try to modify as little as possible.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
