After setting number of shown xrefs to 300 IDA has rounded to 256 what seems to be the maximum. I thought it is just GUI limitiation so I tried iterating over XrefsTo() programmatically which as well yielded only 256 xrefs. After quicky skimming through config I found nothing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does anyone have any idea how to fix it ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
