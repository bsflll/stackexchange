But the malware load libraries/functions dynamically and I need to resolve this. For example, If malware will use createThread, first get address of this function with getprocaddress then kept the pointer into a variable. To call function use variable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I need to resolve dynamic addresses to disassemble. How can I do it?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
