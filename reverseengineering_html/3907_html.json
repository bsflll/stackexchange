I haven't found it in popular references so far.\n </p>\n <p>\n  First of all here it is.\n </p>\n <pre><code>fnsave [esp-100h]\ncmp word ptr [esp-0EEh], 07FFh      ; 07FFh (all bits set) in Olly 2\n                                    ; 0000h in Olly 1\n                                    ; something different otherwise\nje @being_debugged\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The code fragment checks the \"Last Instruction Opcode\" at +0x12. According to Intel manuals it's set if and only if an exception occured.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The value is set only once, it doesn't work when restarting (<<) the program.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But I don't know where the values come from. When Olly calls GetThreadContext() of debuggee, the value is already set. Other debuggers does not seem to behave like this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can anyone confirm this? Tested on Win XP SP3, Intel P4.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The context structure initialization leaves some fields unassigned.  It's not specific to Olly that some of the bits are set.  Also note that the value of (0xd800+)0x7ff does not decode to any meaningful instruction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In short, not a reliable detection method.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
