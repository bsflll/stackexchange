There is a bit of info in idc.idc and the SDK headers, there's Chris Eagle's book (which predates quite a few advances in IDA), and there's the occasional juicy tidbit in the blogs of Ilfak, Igorsk, Daniele and the others.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But by and large there's mostly Google, reversing IDA.WLL, and copious experimentation. Which means that it's often much slower going than we would like, and quite often things require a lot more effort than necessary because we're unaware of some trick, twist or workaround that somebody else has already discovered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The perfect solution would be a community wiki.\n  <strong>\n   So, is there a wiki for all things IDA?\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  If so then all serious spelunkers needs to know about it: it ought to be linked from here, from IDA's home site and major RCE gathering places...\n </p>\n <p>\n  If there's no wiki yet then we ought to do something about it (like badgering Ilfak).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

And where I can go look to find out what's really going on. E.g. why calling\n <code>\n  set_idc_getattr\n </code>\n with the result of a previous call - or that of a call to\n <code>\n  get_idc_getattr\n </code>\n - will fail and crash IDA when your plugin is unloaded (it's because IDA returns\n <code>\n  \"\"\n </code>\n for an empty method but you have to pass 0 to reset, not\n <code>\n  \"\"\n </code>\n which fails and leaves things as they are)\n</span>\n</body></html>",
