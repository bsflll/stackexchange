However, I was looking at Wikipedia's article on the Observable Universe and found this image:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Observable_universe_logarithmic_illustration.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Observable_universe_logarithmic_illustration.png\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Personally, it looks at lot like a CD or DVD.  Does anybody know how that might be scribed onto such media while guaranteeing it could at least be Read available (music, video, or data, whatever might work), just to see if there was anything interesting?  Listen to the Observable Universe spinning on a CD player (or at least an artists high-quality rendering concept).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
