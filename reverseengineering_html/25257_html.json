    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I encountered a print format vulnerability challenge in a CTF. I don't know anything about these vulnerabilities, so I'm working my way through Saif El-Sherei's format string exploitation tutorial from exploit-db.com (\n  <a href=\"https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/english/28476-linux-format-string-exploitation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/english/28476-linux-format-string-exploitation.pdf\n  </a>\n  ). But, I'm getting stuck really early on. I'm hoping someone can point out where I'm going wrong.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here's some code I wrote:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nvoid nicefunction()\n{\n        printf(\"you are in the nice function!\n\");\n}\nvoid notnicefunction()\n{\n        printf(\"you are in the NOT nice function!\n\");\n}\nint foo()\n{\n  void (*fptr)() = &nicefunction;\n  char buf[100];\n\n  puts(\"Please enter a string. \");\n  fgets(buf,80,stdin);\n  puts(\"Here's your string\");\n  printf(buf);\n  puts(\"\nNow we call the nice function\");\n  (*fptr)();\n  return 0;\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv)\n{\n  foo();\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  My goal is to craft an input string that I can use to change fptr to point to notnicefunction. I compiled it with:\n  <code>\n   gcc -m32 -g test.c -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -o test\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I ran the binary under gdb and added before and after breakpoints. When I enter the string \"AAAA\" and then do x/20xw $esp afterwards, I see my 0x41414141 in the stack, at 0xffffd018. If I rerun and enter the string \"AAAA %6$x\" I get AAAA 41414141. So far so good.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now I want to find the address of fptr. Using nm, I see that it should contain the value of 0x0804849b (the address of nicefunction). My goal is to change it to 0x080484b4, the address of notnicefunction. I rerun with AAAA, and then examine the stack until I find the address that contains 0x0804849b. That's 0xffffd07c, 0x64 (100d) words deeper in the stack from the start of buf. Which makes sense.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd like to control the contents of fptr by using %n. So I crafted this input string: \\x7c\\xd0\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xffAAAA%5$x%n. I think this should change the contents of 0xffffd07c to 13d. But instead I segfault in the printf.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Where am I going wrong?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   UPDATE:\n  </strong>\n  I tried writing my fptr address into the start of the buffer, just to see if I was writing the address correctly. But when I checked it in gdb, it had the ASCII representation in it:\n </p>\n <pre><code>(gdb) x/20xw $esp+8\n0xffffd018: 0x6337785c  0x3064785c  0x6666785c  0x6666785c\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So the problem is that bash doesn't like my hex literals. I guess I could fix this with redirection from a file. But if anyone knows of a cleaner way to handle this, I'd love to know about it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   MOAR UPDATE\n  </strong>\n  : Pawel's comment below got me past the how-do-I-get-hex-bytes-into-this-binary hurdle. But I was still segfaulting on my %n. But the segfaults went away when I changed %5$x %n to %x %x %x %x %x %n. Now I am able to (sort of) control the contents of arbitrary stack memory. Whoohoo!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
