    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  My situation:\n </p>\n <p>\n  I analyze some piece of code and I have the following line:\n </p>\n <pre><code>         ...\n         call eax\n         ...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I am using IDA PRO. My problem is that I can not go to the place where eax points. I mean: normally, I have something like\n </p>\n <pre><code>        ...\n        call sub_xxxxxx\n        ...\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  and when I click on sub_xxxxxx, then IDA PRO shows me the code at sub_xxxxxx. Sometimes, there is also an offset. \nBut now, I have that register, and when I click on that then IDA PRO is not going to that location. It opens a window where I can rename the register. \nI guess, IDA does not know where to go or something like that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I also try to open it with ollydbg, but since the file is a .bin file, I could not open it(in the search window, before opening, the .bin file was not listed)\n </p>\n <p>\n  How can I handle that problem ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
