Now that I am equipped with the necessary development knowledge, I would like to turn toward reverse to find vulnerabilities in binaries, and practice that methodology. I have searched Google and it seems to come up with CTF find a password type of challenges.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Are there resources that focus on challenges similar to CTF, but specific to finding vulnerabilities is binaries, such as BO, RELRO, NX bypass, ROP, etc...?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Any 10 minute Google attempt would give you some results from which one could work. Then one could come back and ask for more specific help and demonstrate ones 'failed' attempt(s) (research effort).

It also has a rating system for people who have completed the \"challenge\" which includes fun factor/educational/difficulty which I found useful when trying to find problems to do.
