Certain strings exist such as\n  <code>\n   %s%s\n  </code>\n  , so I can assume that\n  <code>\n   printf\n  </code>\n  has been utilised, for example.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, when looking through the code, nothing stands out as obviously being library code. Is there a way to identify library functions just from looking at the assembly/decompiled output?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks,\nJames\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
