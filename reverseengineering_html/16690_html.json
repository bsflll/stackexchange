    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to decrypt jpg images of comics I purchased in my comic reader app on android but neither I can view them (after copying from SD card to Windows desktop) nor can I convert them to pdf to read on my desktop.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I see a lot of data before start of jpg header FF D8, and am confused.\n </p>\n <p>\n  01 00 00 00 2D 82 00 00 28 00 00 00 80 47 88 47 80 48 08 48 00 48 08 48 00 48 88 47 00 48 88 47 00 48 88 47 00 48 08 48 EF 4F 00 00 00 00 00 00 41 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 41 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 C8 E3 E4 E4 03 3A AB F3 0F DE 05 14 33 C9 82 B8 32 72 8F 20 67 10 7D 08 45 09 99 C6 61 1B 30 C4 D4 15 6F F1 8C 65 05 C1 FF D8 FF E0\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here are examples of those encrypted images:\n  <a href=\"https://www.mediafire.com/view/4tnc45xppeazy1c/09.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.mediafire.com/view/4tnc45xppeazy1c/09.jpg\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.mediafire.com/file/u0z57slaar4k9ln/10.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.mediafire.com/file/u0z57slaar4k9ln/10.jpg\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way of decrypting these in a C Program ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried getting information in JPEGsnoop, it stops at Unknown marker [0xFF02] From the header information it is jpeg file, but parsing stops abruptly. It may be embedded jpeg's in custom format.\n </p>\n <pre><code>*** Marker: SOS (Start of Scan) (xFFDA) ***\n  OFFSET: 0x00000152\nScan header length = 12\n  Number of img components = 3\n    Component[1]: selector=0x01, table=0(DC),0(AC)\n    Component[2]: selector=0x02, table=1(DC),0(AC)\n    Component[3]: selector=0x03, table=1(DC),0(AC)\n  Spectral selection = 0 .. 0\n  Successive approximation = 0x01\n\n NOTE: Scan parsing doesn't support this SOF mode.\n\n*** Marker: ??? (Unknown) (xFF02) ***\nOFFSET: 0x00004806\n    WARNING: Unknown marker [0xFF02]\n  Stopping decode\n  Use [Img Search Fwd/Rev] to locate other valid embedded JPEGs\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  While opening in photoshop loads only a part of jpeg image or shows error \"Could not complete your request because of a problem parsing the JPEG data\". While in android app first a thumbnail image loads, then panels are loaded as detailed images, but all information is contained in one single jpeg file. \nOr if there is already a software that can fix extra data in these files.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Unless you unpack the application, decompile it, and/or view its contents dynamically in memory (scanning for JPEG SOF/EOF and attempting to rebuild files manually via hex editor, Python, etc.), what you're looking to accomplish may simply not be possible using the samples you've provided...maybe. I haven't looked at the files, so I'm not sure. The app may also be rendering JPEG output (based on zoom) from a different lossless image format, etc.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
