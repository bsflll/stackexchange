I want some guide lines on this subject because I don't know how to search my problem in the internet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I want to create an executable file which can inject code into a targeted (another) executable file and run that target. What I talking about is\n  <strong>\n   not\n  </strong>\n  a patched\n  <code>\n   exe\n  </code>\n  . I want that\n  <code>\n   exe\n  </code>\n  to inject the code and run the program.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is it possible to create such executable files..? If it is, can you please tell me some guiding materials..?\n </p>\n <p>\n  ps: when I search about\n  <code>\n   injection\n  </code>\n  , I get only about\n  <code>\n   dll\n  </code>\n  injection and it is not I want.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank You!!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

To quote:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Another way to copy some code to another process's address space and then execute it in the context of this process involves the use of remote threads and the WriteProcessMemory API. Instead of writing a separate DLL, you copy the code to the remote process directly now—via WriteProcessMemory—and start its execution with CreateRemoteThread.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  You could also use the\n  <strong>\n   <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms681674(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    WriteProcessMemory function\n   </a>\n  </strong>\n  to write bytes directly, whether it's overwriting bytes directly or\n  <strong>\n   <a href=\"https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20240/The-Beginners-Guide-to-Codecaves\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    code-caving\n   </a>\n  </strong>\n  . There are nuances to keep in mind, though, like making sure the permissions of the memory you're writing to are set properly (read/write/execute), ala the\n  <strong>\n   <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366887(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    Virtual* functions\n   </a>\n  </strong>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
