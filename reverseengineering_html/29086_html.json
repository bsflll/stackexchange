The OllyDbg break at the breakpoint, but when I step over, the OllyDbg put a hardware breakpoint. (Yesterday not happened in OllyDbg, but today during training it happened.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   ŸçEdit :\n  </strong>\n  A red square usually occurs when step over, but goes to the next line immediately. But in this call, when i click F8 to step over, the program has stopped and no longer works.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kMFzp.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kMFzp.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
