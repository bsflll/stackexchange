Later, I converted it into an EXE file (for personal use only), and unfortunately I lost the original .py source files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now I need to recover the internal logic/scripts inside the EXE ‚Äî even partial recovery would help.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was likely packed or obfuscated, and may not have been built with PyInstaller (I can't unpack it using pyinstxtractor).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm the original author of this tool, and I can confirm that the EXE was generated from a Python script.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can anyone suggest a method or tool that could help me unpack or reverse engineer it?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you very much üôè\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
