    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Imagine this:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  You have a binary for a piece of ARM firmware. You are nearly 100% it is ARM, and that it runs on the bare metal. You obtained this firmware from a manufacturers update page.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, you are uncertain of the exact model of chip the binary is intended for. You are unable to find the developer's guide or spec sheet for the chip.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The binary has no known headers, and research suggests that it is not compressed or encrypted. The large section of strings at the bottom of the binary suggests it is a single flat binary file, and not several records compressed together. There are no indications of a file system.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You should reasonably be able to disassemble the code but a few factors are missing to prevent you from retrieving control-flow, and creating a sensical disassembly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  1) You do not know where the initial entry point is. \n2) You do not know if there is a ram section, and what address it might start and end at. \n3) You do not know if there is a rom section, and what address it might start and end at.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Given these, or similar circumstances, how might a reverse engineer deduce the initial entry point, and location/size of areas like ROM?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I imagine detecting reads and writes from a memory mapped chip of some sort would be possible to infer from a valid disassembly, just by highlighting common memory regions which are frequently referenced, and classifying them into sections. I am hoping someone has come up with an automated method for this sort of analysis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   E.G\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The range 0x7-0x9 is frequently referenced. It may be ROM. The highest address is 0x7998, the area appears to occupy 8 Mbs.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The other area, identifying the entry point, has stumped me so far. Without the documentation for the chip is it possible to infer the initial entry point of the code? This is especially frustrating on chips where the bootloader appears to be stored in ROM separate from the main firmware.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can the structure of such a firmware image be implied without developer documentation?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

For instance the address list will not have absolute pointers for each function, or maybe you disassembled some functions incorrectly. Maybe you will have better luck focussing on the string addresses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I usually do this list matching by hand, in\n  <code>\n   vim\n  </code>\n  using regex searches. On some occasions I have written small scripts to help finding a match. ... but i can't find those right now, i will update my post if i find them again.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <h2>\n  summary of the\n  <a href=\"https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/67646/discussion-between-willem-hengeveld-and-baordog\">\n   chat\n  </a>\n </h2>\n <p>\n  The firmware file being discussed:\n  <a href=\"http://dvdo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Matrix6_Version_01.zip\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   DVDO Matrix6 Firmware 01.01\n  </a>\n  from\n  <a href=\"http://dvdo.com/product/dvdo-matrix6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   dvdo\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I took a look at other binaries from the same site, and found references to the\n  <code>\n   LPC1758\n  </code>\n  - an ARM based chip.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Indeed IDA does not immediately recognize the binary. The reason is that this binary has only Thumb instructions. IDA expects arm binaries to start with ARM32 code.\nThumb code can be recognised from a hex dump by the presence of byte sequences like\n  <code>\n   70 47\n  </code>\n  (BX LR),\n  <code>\n   00 bf\n  </code>\n  (NOP),\n  <code>\n   *0 b5\n  </code>\n  (PUSH {...}\n </p>\n <p>\n  So after changing the segment type\n  <code>\n   T\n  </code>\n  to\n  <code>\n   1\n  </code>\n  using\n  <code>\n   Alt-G\n  </code>\n  .
