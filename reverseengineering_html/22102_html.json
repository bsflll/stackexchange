I want to compare the differences of a software: Immunity Debugger can trace all assembly instruction with the\n  <em>\n   Add entries of all procedures\n  </em>\n  option (\n  <em>\n   Run trace --> Add entries of all procedures\n  </em>\n  ) and saves it to *.txt file (\n  <em>\n   Run trace --> Log to file\n  </em>\n  ). I want to know if I can do the same in x64dbg?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
