    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm sure many of you are familiar with this classic antidebug trick accomplished by calling\n  <code>\n   ZwSetInformationThread\n  </code>\n  with\n  <code>\n   ThreadInformationClass\n  </code>\n  set to 0x11. Although many OllyDbg modules exist for the purposes of revealing the existence of threads hidden with this method, I haven't been able to find any information on the canonical technique employed to unhide these threads in OllyDbg.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is the function generally hooked in user mode (e.g\n  <code>\n   SetWindowsHookEx\n  </code>\n  ), or is it more pragmatic to patch instructions that either call the NTDLL function directly or system calls which indirectly invoke it?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This would be weak since GetProcAddress or manual imports would bypass it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You could hook the NtSetInformationThread function by inserting a call to your own function in the function prologue and then ignore ThreadHideFromDebugger while forwarding the rest to the original function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I strong advice against it but for the sake of completeness, you could also hook NtSetInformationThread in the\n  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Service_Dispatch_Table\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   system service dispatch table\n  </a>\n  .

If you want to get the index in the table yourself you can just disassemble the NtSetInformationThread export from ntdll.dll.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you're interested in more anti-debugging techniques strongly recommend reading\n  <a href=\"http://pferrie.host22.com/papers/antidebug.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   Peter Ferrie's awesome anti-debugging reference\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
