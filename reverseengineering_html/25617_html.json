However, I've not found as many thorough resources for ELF as I did for PE, such as ARTeam's PE format compendium and other blogs. I am looking for a comparison of how dependency/symbol resolution, version symbols, and relocations are done in ELF vs. Portable Executable.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
