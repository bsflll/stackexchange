If one ping succeeds in 0.1 ms there is no guarantee that the next will also succeed within the same time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ping uses non-blocking IO to receive datagrams over the network. This means it will make repeated tries before bailing out. Correspondingly, you would get different execution traces for those runs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For reference, here is the relevant\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/mirror/reactos/blob/master/reactos/base/applications/network/ping/ping.c\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   source\n  </a>\n  snippet of ping taken from ReactOS.\n </p>\n <pre><code>/* Expect to receive ICMP echo reply */\nFD_ZERO(&Fds);\nFD_SET(IcmpSock, &Fds);\nTimeval.tv_sec  = Timeout / 1000;\nTimeval.tv_usec = Timeout % 1000;\n\ndo {\n    Status = select(0, &Fds, NULL, NULL, &Timeval);\n    if ((Status != SOCKET_ERROR) && (Status != 0))\n    {\n        Length = sizeof(From);\n        Status = recvfrom(IcmpSock, Buffer, Size, 0, &From, &Length);\n\n#ifndef NDEBUG\n        printf(\"Received packet\n\");\n        DisplayBuffer(Buffer, Status);\n        printf(\"\n\");\n#endif /* !NDEBUG */\n    }\n    else\n        LostCount++;\n    if (Status == SOCKET_ERROR)\n    {\n        if (WSAGetLastError() != WSAETIMEDOUT)\n        {\n            FormatOutput(IDS_COULD_NOT_RECV, WSAGetLastError());\n            GlobalFree(Buffer);\n            return FALSE;\n        }\n        Status = 0;\n    }\n\n    if (Status == 0)\n    {\n        FormatOutput(IDS_REQUEST_TIMEOUT);\n        GlobalFree(Buffer);\n        return TRUE;\n    }\n\n} while (!DecodeResponse(Buffer, Status, (PSOCKADDR_IN)&From));\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I verified myself that even for completely deterministic non trivial programs (i.e., \"ls\"), the number of executed basic blocks varies from execution to execution, with the <i>very same</i> inputs. Indeed, in a fuzzer I wrote using code coverage data, to get a measure of executed basic blocks I get the average between 10 runs instead of only one execution because I know I cannot trust the results of just one execution.</span>",
