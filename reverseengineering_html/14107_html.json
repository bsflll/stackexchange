    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm doing a kernel debugging on a VmWare installed Windows 10 corporate edition (x64 version 1607 build 14393.447). I use Ida Pro 6.6 with the WinDbg plugin. On my host i have the same OS , with Debugging Tools For WIndows 10 installed. When i connect to the target machine, all the symbols are loaded correctly except for the win32 system ( win32k.sys/win32kbase.sys/win32kfull.sys ). I have the symbols defined in my user-environment variable like so :\n </p>\n <pre><code>_NT_SYMBOL_PATH=srv*c:\\symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  When i choose load symbols in Ida modules menu i get the following output:\n </p>\n <pre><code>WINDBG>!sym noisy\nnoisy mode - symbol prompts on\n\nTrying loadDataForExe with 14000000\nloadDataForExe: 806d0012\nTrying loadDataForExe with ffffffff\nloadDataForExe: 806d0005\nPDB: could not process file \\SystemRoot\\System32\\win32kbase.sys with DIA: Failed to open the file, or the file has an invalid format (E_PDB_NOT_FOUND)\n\nTrying loadDataForExe with 13dd0000\nloadDataForExe: 806d0012\nTrying loadDataForExe with ffffffff\nloadDataForExe: 806d0005\nPDB: could not process file \\SystemRoot\\System32\\win32k.sys with DIA: Failed to open the file, or the file has an invalid format (E_PDB_NOT_FOUND)\n\nTrying loadDataForExe with 14960000\nloadDataForExe: 806d0012\nTrying loadDataForExe with ffffffff\nloadDataForExe: 806d0005\nPDB: could not process file \\SystemRoot\\System32\\win32kfull.sys with DIA: Failed to open the file, or the file has an invalid format (E_PDB_NOT_FOUND)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  lmi output:\n </p>\n <pre><code>WINDBG>!lmi win32kbase\nLoaded Module Info: [win32kbase] \nCannot read Image header @ ffff81ce14000000\nLoad Report: export symbols\n\nWINDBG>!lmi win32k\nLoaded Module Info: [win32k] \nCannot read Image header @ ffff81ce13dd0000\nLoad Report: public symbols , not source indexed \n                     c:\\symbols\\win32k.pdb\\0383A6141581403B9E8426F05328D45F1\\win32k.pdb\n\nWINDBG>!lmi win32kfull\nLoaded Module Info: [win32kfull] \nCannot read Image header @ ffff81ce14960000\n    Load Report: public symbols , not source indexed \n                 c:\\symbols\\win32kfull.pdb\\A792B492035540D397D66128F30037B01\\win32kfull.pdb\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This is all really annoying, because sometimes the symbols just loads correctly, i do not know on what this depends, i found a similar topics in google\n  <a href=\"https://www.sysnative.com/forums/bsod-processing-apps-download-information-discussions/3366-symbols-could-not-loaded-win32k-sys-3.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  they had the same problem, but with the dumps. \nThis is really annoying problem, maybe someone had the same problem, trying to do some reverse-engineering the win32k subsystem, and can help me.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
