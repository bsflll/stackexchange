    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I was trying to emulate a firmware and as a part of the process I was interested in knowing what device files are being registered using mknod. In order to intercept those calls I had created a shared object file and just for a dry run, I was trying to preload this shared library while making a call to mknod to register a character device while doing user space emulation with QEMU like so.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   sudo strace chroot . ./qemu-mips-static -E LD_PRELOAD=\"/mknod.so\"\n  mknod chrdev4 100 0\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  The files are in the correct place and I was following a tutorial very closely so I know am not making a syntactical as such, but my strace log showed my preloaded library not being accessed at all. Please note that in this case, my mknod is a symbolic link to the busybox binary which in turn executes the mknod syscall. I was wondering if that level of indirection could be an issue and possibly a reason as to why my library isn't getting preloaded?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You can have multiple\n <code>\n  -E\n </code>\n options. A complete command might look like this:\n <code>\n  sudo strace chroot . ./qemu-mips-static -E LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"/\" -E LD_PRELOAD=\"mknod.so\" mknod chrdev4 100 0\n </code>\n</span>\n</body></html>",
