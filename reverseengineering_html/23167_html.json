What I want to do is add some data (let's say level data), to an old game ROM, but that would probably shift all the jump labels by the amount of bytes I added.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I thought about disassembling the ROM, finding its starting point and parsing my way through the jump instructions to find all (absolute) labels and tweak them after I know where and how much data I added.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is that feasible/practical and are there tools for such an operation already?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
