I want to decompile it to C++, or at least assembly. I have some experience with assembly, but mostly with MIPS and that was years ago - so high level code is preferred.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Link to .hex file:\n  <a href=\"http://www.3fvape.com/images/3fvape-blog-img/20150806-4384-xcubeII-upgrade/SMOK_X_CUBE_II_firmware_v1.07.hex\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://www.3fvape.com/images/3fvape-blog-img/20150806-4384-xcubeII-upgrade/SMOK_X_CUBE_II_firmware_v1.07.hex\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The device it resides in is a SMOK Xcube 2 (e-cig box mod.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  My goal is to add an option to control the LED color based on the atomizer temperature.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I searched but could not find an applicable how-to.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
