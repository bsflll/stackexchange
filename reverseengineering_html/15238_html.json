The program header table must be separated from the ELF header, the code then must be appended to the end of the program header table, and finally the entry point must be recalculate to point to the new offset of the first instruction in the binary. In this particular case, this can be done relatively straightforwardly using a tool called\n  <code>\n   lepton\n  </code>\n  (I am the developer).
