    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Why does this happen and how do I get to that place in file using IDA? I have found a unicode string using WinHEX. Now I would like to see from where is it referenced. I tried to jump on the file offset, but it prints out an error:\n  <code>\n   Command \"JumpFileOffset\" failed\n  </code>\n  . Searching for those bytes as well as for the text value yields no results. It's like IDA somehow missed that part of the file. Looking at IDA's hex-view the file ends with a lot of\n  <code>\n   ??\n  </code>\n  bytes, whereas in WinHEX those offsets have all sorts of data: what looks like garbage and a lots of unicode strings.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It seems like there is some trivial knowledge I'm missing.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Check what should be the RVA of your string and whether it does land in a section or not depending on the header of your executable.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
