Also if I'm asking an idiotic question, I apologize beforehand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What I basically want to do is to hex edit an executable file to change an integer variable in an address I know from signed to unsigned. Is this even possible? to change variable types by hex editing? I know how to change the value of the variable, but how can I change its type?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks in advance,\nRay.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In assembly there is no way to tell that a particular integer variable is signed or unsigned until you interpret it in the one or another way (and you may change this interpretation many times).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Knowing this, to interpret some integer value you use instructions like\n  <code>\n   ja\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   jb\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   mul\n  </code>\n  in case of unsigned integer, or\n  <code>\n   jg\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   jl\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   imul\n  </code>\n  in case of signed integer (in\n  <code>\n   x86\n  </code>\n  architecture). So, if you want to change the way the particular integer is interpreted, you have to change instructions in one of these groups to their counterparts in the second one.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
