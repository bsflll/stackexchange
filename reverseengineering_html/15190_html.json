It seems you're dealing with an executable compiled with incremental linking enabled (default in Debug builds). When incremental linking is on, the linker generates jump stubs for all functions and refers to them instead of \"real\" function bodies; this allows it to replace just the jump to point to the new/updated function body on next link and to not have to update all other references to the function (since they all go to the jump) which speeds up linking, especially with big projects.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, you have the following options:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Compile the target with incremental linking disabled.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Detect this situation (e.g. check if first byte is E9) and follow the jump to the actual function body.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Patch the jump to point to your hook, then jump back to the final target.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
