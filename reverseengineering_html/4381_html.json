Such heuristics include files that seem to be setup programs for some software. But there are more heuristics and other situations where elevation is assumed to be required.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If the executable has no manifest, you need to add one. Otherwise you may have to modify the existing one.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can tell by loading it into a resource editor or resource viewer such as:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"http://www.resedit.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    http://www.resedit.net/\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  ... and so on.

There was a much easier fix though: the filename of the binary was original_patched.exe, which tripped the UAC heuristics you mentioned. So all I had to do was rename the file. Interestingly, setting the manifest correctly trumped the UAC heuristics.</span>",
