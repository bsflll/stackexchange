Once you know the address, you can look up that in IDA.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If the application uses some window toolkit (like\n  <code>\n   gtk\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   qt\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   swing\n  </code>\n  if it's a java application, whatever), this might be a bit harder, because these toolkits will probably use only a small subset of the Windows API and do the event handling themselves. It might, however, still be successful if you place a breakpoint on\n  <code>\n   GetWindowText\n  </code>\n  and/or\n  <code>\n   GetDlgItemText\n  </code>\n  (again, in several A/W/Ex variants) to check when and where the application actually reads what you've entered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If, for some reason, you absolutely can't use a debugger and have to use IDA only, you can still try to cross-reference the above functions and work your way from there. But, since you don't know which of the cross-references is used in the password checking code, this will probably be much harder/more time consuming.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Apart from this, some of the ideas in my\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/4724/custom-ui-buttons/4725#4725\">\n   answer to a similar question\n  </a>\n  might help you.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

For example, in IDA Pro:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/W3LUj.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  If it's a simple password\n  <em>\n   crackme\n  </em>\n  , you should be looking for code which iterates through each character of a string, i.e. the user input, and compares it to some hardcoded value. Alternatively, as others have elaborated, you could look for specific uses of the Win32 API and find cross-references.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
