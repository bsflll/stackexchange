While I agree that own research should have been done up front, I don't think this was a very welcoming tone. For example the comparison table\n <a href=\"https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  here\n </a>\n makes no mention of plugins and it's also not listed as a limitation.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

I\n <i>\n  know\n </i>\n that they don't officially provide support for the freeware version, but I suppose if you ask them nicely you could find out by sending an email to\n <code>\n  support@\n </code>\n Hex-Rays ... and once you have the authoritative answer, you could answer your own question here for the benefit of others?!\n</span>\n</body></html>",
