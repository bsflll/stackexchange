    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am using Intel Pin in order trace memory activity of an executable on Windows. What I have found, that most of the memory operands (Read or Write) operates with 2 or 4 bytes. So I decided to modify original Pin's\n  <em>\n   <a href=\"https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/pintool/docs/71313/Pin/html/index.html#MAddressTrace\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n    pinatrace\n   </a>\n  </em>\n  example, in order to see which Assembly opcodes produces which memory activity.\n </p>\n <pre><code>VOID Instruction(INS ins, VOID *v)\n{\n\n        UINT32 memOperands = INS_MemoryOperandCount(ins);\n        fprintf(trace,\"\n[%s]\n\",(INS_Disassemble(ins)).c_str()); \n        for (UINT32 memOp = 0; memOp < memOperands; memOp++)\n        { \n             .....\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  What it basically does (I hope), is just writes disassembled opcode BEFORE the memory operands it produces. But then I looked in the file (W is for write, R is for read):\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   [test edx, 0x800000]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [jnz 0x77708557]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [mov dword ptr [ebp-0x4], edi]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [test dl, 0x1]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [jnz 0x77703136] RWWRWW\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [lea edi, ptr [ebx+0xcc]]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [push dword ptr [edi]]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [call 0x77702520] RWW\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [mov edi, edi]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [push ebp]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [mov ebp, esp]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [mov eax, dword ptr [ebp+0x8]]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [mov ecx, dword ptr fs:[0x18]]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [lea edx, ptr [eax+0x4]]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [lock btr dword ptr [edx], 0x0]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [jnb 0x777041dc]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [mov ecx, dword ptr [ecx+0x24]]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [mov dword ptr [eax+0xc], ecx]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [mov dword ptr [eax+0x8], 0x1]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [mov eax, 0x1]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [pop ebp]\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [ret 0x4] WRRRWRWWRR\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  As we can see, opcodes that are supposed to work with memory (e.g.\n  <em>\n   mov\n  </em>\n  ) do not produce memory operands. While memory traces are connected as blocks after\n  <strong>\n   ret/call/jnz\n  </strong>\n  etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Question\n  </strong>\n  : What kind of memory operands does Intel Pin trace? Is it about calls to virtual memory/RAM/CPU registers? Could it be possible, that memory activity goes in blocks due to CPU's pipeline?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
