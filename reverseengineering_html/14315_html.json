I've tried ollydbg but could not open\n  <code>\n   x64\n  </code>\n  executables. Is there another way to achieve this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks in advance\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It also has the same patching functionalities ollydbg has. You will also need to resolve imports manually (or adjust the second executable's code to use the PE import table) and relocations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, there might be easier ways to do that by extracting the executable and ruining it. An automated way to do that is using WinRar SFX (self extracting) executable. This let's you create an executable that when starts will extract multiple files into a temporary directory and will run one of the extracted files. You can also implement something similar yourself by dropping an executable and running it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
