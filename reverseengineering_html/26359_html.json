    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Is it safe to assume that, in the general case, the name of the section containing the user code (not the compiler generated code) is\n  <code>\n   .text\n  </code>\n  ? I spot-checked several ARM, x86 and MIPS binaries (PE and ELF) and it seems to be the case.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I suppose the compiler/linker can be configured to chose a different name. In which cases would one want to change it? Are there known examples (CPU arch, compiler, etc.) where there is no\n  <code>\n   .text\n  </code>\n  section? What are other frequently used names? Can user code be put in other sections than the\n  <code>\n   .text\n  </code>\n  section?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or is the name\n  <code>\n   .text\n  </code>\n  required to be a valid PE / ELF and thus always chosen? The\n  <a href=\"https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/elf/elf.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   ELF specification\n  </a>\n  for example mentions the name\n  <code>\n   .text\n  </code>\n  several times, so does the\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   PE specification\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

For example, Delphi compiler uses CODE, and various packers use custom names (UPX00 etc.) or even garbage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  AFAIK the only section name that is somewhat enforced is\n  <code>\n   .rsrc\n  </code>\n  - I think Explorer may not show the file icon if resources section is renamed.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
