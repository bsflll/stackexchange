I run procdump and see some first chance exceptions like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>[14:29:38] Exception: E06D7363.?AVCServicesMDException@@\n[14:29:38] Exception: E06D7363.?AVCServicesMDException@@\n[14:29:38] Exception: E06D7363.?AVCBaseException@@\n[14:29:38] Exception: E06D7363.?AVCBaseException@@\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I want to attach to process and analyze some of these exceptions. But have difficulties with setting WinDbg to handle it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I run\n  <code>\n   .foreach(exc {sx}) {.catch{sxe ${exc}}}\n  </code>\n  &\n  <code>\n   sxe *\n  </code>\n  to catch all first chance exceptions and events.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But got nothing similar to exceptions from dump (written by procdump).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
