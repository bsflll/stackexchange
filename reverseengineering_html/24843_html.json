Using a UART logic analyser was able to guess the baud rate, data bits, start/stop bit. It idles at 14v and pulls to GND for 0.\n </p>\n <p>\n  when I press the same sequence repeatedly of buttons I get the following bytes:\n </p>\n <pre><code>PREAMBLE (sent when waking up unit):\n0x02 0x16 0x10 0x10 0x10 0x10 0x10 0x10 0x11 0x11 0x18 0x03\n\nVIDEO ON:\n0x02 0x3c 0x31 0x09 0x38 0x25 0x11 0x6f 0x00 0x1e 0x71 0x03 0x02 0x3d 0x11 0x6f 0x00 0x1e 0x31 0x09 0x38 0x25 0x72 0x03\n\nMIC ON:\n0x02 0x4a 0x31 0x09 0x38 0x25 0x11 0x6f 0x00 0x1e 0x7f 0x03 0x02 0x4c 0x11 0x6f 0x00 0x1e 0x31 0x09 0x38 0x25 0x01 0x03\n\nUNLOCK DOOR:\n0x02 0x38 0x31 0x09 0x38 0x25 0x31 0x45 0x11 0x1e 0x74 0x03 0x02 0x3a 0x31 0x09 0x38 0x25 0x11 0x6f 0x00 0x1e 0x6f 0x03\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Does this appear to be a protocol standard of any kind of control system?\n </p>\n <p>\n  EDIT:\nHere is the best I could understand:\n  <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQRyUafqa6CEMd9BOOyAWO4OKGXNKsGLvs6epR5PjqnqBRMbpWOqz2-ij51mFDz4lBUOcVSR7jxK505/pubhtml?gid=1867863786&single=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQRyUafqa6CEMd9BOOyAWO4OKGXNKsGLvs6epR5PjqnqBRMbpWOqz2-ij51mFDz4lBUOcVSR7jxK505/pubhtml?gid=1867863786&single=true\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  It seems as though the format is as follows:\nBYTE1 = STX\nBYTE2 = COMMAND\nBYTE3,4,5,6 = SRC\nBYTE7,8,9,10 = DST\nBYTE11 = SUM of BYTE2 BYTE10 trimmed to 8-bit\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
