    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I want to learn to reverse engineer hardware/firmware as well as software (eventually, i want to focus on hardware/firmware now). I have some experience programming STM32 microcontrollers as well as decent understanding of C. I understand verilog and have made some simple stuff in FPGA and have done PCB board design before as well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I started reading \"Reverse Engineering for Beginners\" but it seems like a lot of examples with no hands-on projects to work with. I learn a lot more by doing so if there was a book that teaches you reverse engineering, assembly/disassembly, and other topics with a project in mind i'd much prefer it. I'd like to learn ARM and x86 but more of a focus on ARM.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As for tools i have a Bus Pirate, Logic Analyzer, and basic soldering equipment. Any recommendations on tools i should get and projects i can do?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Moreover, they're mostly focused on software reverse engineering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From these, and as a reference, it is worth to mention:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://beginners.re/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Reverse Engineering for Beginners\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1118787315\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Practical Reverse Engineering\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0764574817\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1593272898\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    The IDA Pro Book\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  In the field of hardware reverse engineering, however, it is much harder to find a proper book, not to say one which is project oriented. But there is one book which overcomes the other and seems to fit best for your needs â€“\n  <a href=\"https://www.nostarch.com/xboxfree\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering\n  </a>\n  by Andrew Huang. The book is available for free since March 2013.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To quote from the book's description:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   This hands-on guide to hacking begins with step-by-step tutorials on\n  hardware modifications that teach basic hacking techniques as well as\n  essential reverse engineering skills. The book progresses into a\n  discussion of the Xbox security mechanisms and other advanced hacking\n  topics, with an emphasis on educating the readers on the important\n  subjects of computer security and reverse engineering. Hacking the\n  Xbox includes numerous practical guides, such as where to get hacking\n  gear, soldering techniques, debugging tips and an Xbox hardware\n  reference guide.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  You can visit the book's\n  <a href=\"http://hackingthexbox.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   official website\n  </a>\n  for more information.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Other books which you may find helpful are listed below:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1931836310\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Game Console Hacking: Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, Game Boy...\n   </a>\n   , by Joe Grand et al.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://www.nostarch.com/hardwarehacker\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    The Hardware Hacker - Adventures in Making and Breaking Hardware\n   </a>\n   , by Andrew Huang\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1932266836\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Hardware Hacking: Have Fun While Voiding Your Warranty\n   </a>\n   , by Joe Grand\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596003145\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Hardware Hacking Projects for Geeks\n   </a>\n   , by Scott Fullam\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   It is important for me to note that although the fact that most of these books is available online pirately, I encourage you to\n   <strong>\n    buy\n   </strong>\n   the books you are interested in and support their  authors.\n  </em>\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  On a general note, I'd suggest you to start reverse engineering from routers and old game consoles. Good references could be found in\n  <a href=\"http://www.devttys0.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   /dev/ttys0\n  </a>\n  . Choose a product which is cheap and you can buy many pieces from it so you won't be afraid of destroying it with your tests. The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) is an example for a console which is documented in details by other reverse engineers, check\n  <a href=\"https://www.zophar.net/documents/snes.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   this\n  </a>\n  for example. As for tools, most of the resources above contains recommendations for tools that would help you in each project.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
