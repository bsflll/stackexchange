    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am looking at the \"wordlist.txt\" file for Bookworm Deluxe (an old game by PopCap), and I have not been able to make sense of it. Most of the lines seem to be pieces of words, often with a single digit prefixing them. These numbers do not constantly represent a same letter combination, as 2rdvark would seem like 2 is \"aa\", but 2s is also in the list, and \"aas\" is not a word. Take note that the game has to have letter rarity information somewhere, but bonus\n  <em>\n   words\n  </em>\n  have their own separate file.\n  <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/thelabcat/0c47e9b4eec3630da081d19451ede6ae\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Here is the file as a Gist.\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
