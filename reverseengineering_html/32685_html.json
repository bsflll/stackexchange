I want to set a conditional breakpoint in Windbg with the condition to be when eax is 11h (17). I tried:\n </p>\n <p>\n  bu xxxxxxxx \".if(eax != 17){gc}\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  bu xxxxxxxx \".if(@eax != 17){gc}\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  bp xxxxxxxx \"j (eax == 17) ''; 'gc' \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  bp xxxxxxxx \"j (@eax == 17) ''; 'gc' \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nothing works. Thanks in advance\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You need to specify a number prefix if you want to stick with decimal (\n <code>\n  0n\n </code>\n ; e.g.\n <code>\n  0n17\n </code>\n ) or use the\n <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debuggercmds/n--set-number-base-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  <code>\n   n\n  </code>\n </a>\n command to change the default radix. Best way to not deal with this kind of errors is to always prefix your numbers with\n <code>\n  0x\n </code>\n even if you know the default radix is 16.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
