    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to programmatically link decompiled code generated by HexRays with the disassembly code of a given binary by mapping memory addresses between the two. The mapping exists, as I can see view it through IDA on a case by case basis (see the line of decompiled code in green, associated with the memory address in gold, which lets me reference the disassembly. Clicking through different decompiled source lines links to different memory addresses/sets of disassembly lines). But I can't find any way to get at these associations via scripting (IDC, IDAPython, etc) or via the command line. This strikes me as strange, as I can't imagine that this functionality hasn't been sought out or used before.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My end goal is to be able to read in a set of decompiled code line numbers, then return all the lines of disassembly which map to those decompiled code lines.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks!\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wcfur.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wcfur.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
