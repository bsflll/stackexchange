I get some weird instructions, following is a piece extracted from a (very long) trace:\n </p>\n <pre><code>RIP register   instruction\n\n0x7fff751fed17 mov rbx, 0xffffffffffdff000\n0x7fff751fed1e lsl r11d, eax\n0x7fff751fed22 xor r15d, r15d\n0x7fff751fed25 mov r10d, r11d\n0x7fff751fed28 mov r9d, dword ptr [0xff5ff080]\n0x7fff751fed30 test r9b, 0x1\n0x7fff751fed34 jnz 0x7fff1fdb4fdf\n0x7fff751fed3a mov rax, qword ptr [0xff5ff0a8]\n0x7fff751fed42 mov r13d, dword ptr [0xff5ff088]\n0x7fff751fed4a mov qword ptr [rdi], rax\n0x7fff751fed4d mov edx, dword ptr [0xff5ff088]\n0x7fff751fed54 mov r14, qword ptr [0xff5ff0b0]\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  To me, they are quite weird. First, some of them access directly to the memory, that means some addresses, e.g.\n  <code>\n   0xff5ff080\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   0xff5ff0a8\n  </code>\n  have been hard-coded into the program. Second, I find them nowhere in the loaded libraries and wget itself. Third, even more weird, by passing the parameter\n  <code>\n   (IARG_MEMORYREAD_EA)\n  </code>\n  to get the virtual addresses of the accessed memories. I got the addresses, e.g.\n  <code>\n   0xffffffffff5ff080\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   0xffffffffff5ff0a8\n  </code>\n  , etc, and all of them do not belong to the program's memory space.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Coud anyone give me some suggestions ?.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
