    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  i have found the following code sequence in a sample which I try to analyze:\n </p>\n <pre><code>....\npush offset LibFileName ;    \"KERNEL32.DLL\"\ncall LoadLibraryA\nmov esi, eax\ntest esi, esi\njz short loc_40EDF2\nlea edx, [ebp+var_108]\n...\n...\nmov eax, offset aUmehyJ ; \"UmehyJ{j\"\npush eax                ; lpProcName\npush esi                ; hModule\ncall GetProcAddress_0\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So, I know what the combination of LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress does. But what I do not understand is the following line:\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov eax, offset aUmehyJ ; \"UmehyJ{j\"\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I would say that the process name is somehow encrypted. I searched a little bit and read that XOR-encryption in combination with a loop is frequently used in malware. So, I let IDA PRO search all occurences of a XOR and try to locate of course those with a register-immediate combination, for example xor eax, 12h.\nBut I could not find something like this.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After that, I have read that Base64 encoding is also used in malware. So, I type the string \"UmehyJ{j\" in a online Base64 decoder tool (\n  <a href=\"http://www.opinionatedgeek.com/dotnet/tools/base64decode/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://www.opinionatedgeek.com/dotnet/tools/base64decode/\n  </a>\n  ) but without success.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, now I am at a point where I do not know how I should make the next steps.\nBecause of that, I hope somebody can help me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  best regards,\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I marked \"offset UmehyJ{j\" and click Strg+X to get the cross-reference list of offset UmehyJ{j , but in the list the mentioned line with mov eax, offset UmehyJ{j is the only place where that string appears. There is no other reference to it.</span>",
