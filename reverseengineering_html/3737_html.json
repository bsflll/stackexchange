I want to write a program in machine code to be executable directly to the CPU without assembling/etc. However, there's only one way I can think of:\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can flip the conundrum backwards, and instead of worrying about the formation of bits, I can write ASCII characters and save them in a text editor so long as their ASCII-binary equivalent matches the identical configuration of an opcode byte(s) for the target machine. But then the problem arises again ...\n  <strong>\n   there is not an existing one-byte ASCII character that can match every possible combination of bits within an opcode, so I can't code this way.\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  For me to write in machine code, I'd need a way of directly placing the right formation of bits that make up each byte(s) and instruction(s).\n </p>\n <p>\n  How could I do this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  CORRECTION: I am not trying to write a single bit at a time (not possible in x86), but get a byte configured with the correct bits in order to be stored that make up the correct machine instructions.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I think I explained enough - I need to formulate the bits of a byte, and wish to do so by structuring the bits manually of a byte to match that of an opcode. In a text editor this can't be done, and hex editors only allow whole bytes; I need the correct representation down to the bits.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
