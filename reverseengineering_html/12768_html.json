That is the only article I came across after searching for mechanism behind INT 0x2D after reading about it on Dr Fu's blog.  The other articles on the net usually only mention that a byte will be skipped without explanation.  Hence this question. Thanks for pointing me to Peter Ferrie's paper.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

A debugger that traps interrupt 0x2d will respond to the hook invocation, skip the\n  <code>\n   int3\n  </code>\n  opcode that follows, and resume execution normally.  A more primitive debugger that ignores interrupt 0x2d will instead trap the\n  <code>\n   int3\n  </code>\n  opcode, allowing the user to examine register state and respond to the hook call manually; or to patch a\n  <code>\n   nop\n  </code>\n  instruction over the breakpoint opcode to ignore the hook from now on.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you disassemble BOOTMGR.EXE (found compressed within\n  <code>\n   \\BOOTMGR\n  </code>\n  ), MEMTEST.EXE (found in\n  <code>\n   \\Boot\n  </code>\n  ), WINLOAD.EXE (found in\n  <code>\n   %SystemRoot%\\System32\\Boot\n  </code>\n  ) or NTOSKRNL.EXE (in\n  <code>\n   %SystemRoot%\\System32\n  </code>\n  ), you will see the\n  <code>\n   int 0x2d\n  </code>\n  /\n  <code>\n   int3\n  </code>\n  sequence appear.  Those are boot-time and/or kernel-mode programs which execute in a different environment from normal Windows applications, but the debugger ABI they are subject to is presumably the same.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
