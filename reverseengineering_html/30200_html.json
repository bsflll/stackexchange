    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n \n\n in oder to solve a CTF-Challenge I have to construct a small ROP-chain. The scope of the ROP chain is to print the content of the `flag` file. I already constructed the ROP-chain, but it seems that when I call the system function with the parameter `cat flag`, the result isn't printed to the console.\n <p>\n  My ROP-chain:\n  <code>\n   payload = b'A'*80 + pop_rdi + addr_cat_flag + systemPlt\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  As far as I know it should work this way, since it is a 64-Bit machine. But the strangest thing is that when insted of calling\n  <code>\n   system\n  </code>\n  I call for example\n  <code>\n   puts\n  </code>\n  then the content at address addr_cat_flag, which in this case is\n  <code>\n   cat flag\n  </code>\n  , is printed to the console. This means that the parameter is hand over corectly.\n  \n\n  The address of systemPlt should also be correct.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does anybody know were the problem could be?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
