    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Obfuscation techniques such as opaque predicates often trick IDA's auto-analysis into creating incorrect or contradicting interpretations of the code under analysis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is some mention of controlling IDA's auto-analysis via hooks on the\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/blog/improving-ida-analysis/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   IDA website\n  </a>\n  , however I cannot find other references to this online.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In my case, I have a list of known-valid branches and I want IDA to \"prefer\" these branches during auto-analysis in order to avoid sp-analysis and invalid decompilation issues.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have been able to essentially mimic this functionality by scripting my own analysis pass that ignores non- known-valid branches, but I wonder if there is an easier way.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

After that, I just enabled auto-analysis, and as the invalid branches were removed, the analysis results were fine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Of course, this depends on being able to find the valid and invalid branch\n  <em>\n   instructions\n  </em>\n  , not just their\n  <em>\n   targets\n  </em>\n  . I am unsure what you mean by \"a list of known-valid branches\", but in case you know the location of the valid branch instructions, or you can write a simple analyzer that detects the patterns with invalid branches, a preprocessor might be a good way to handle the problem.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
