To do so, it will directly check if the method (this + 8) is equal to the current method (0x004EDC58). If it's true, it will continue to the current code. Otherwise, the address of the method at\n  <code>\n   this + 8\n  </code>\n  is read and it jumps to this address.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You have different options to set a type to this memory part. Since it seems to be a pointer to something, go to this address address and type 'o' or\n  <code>\n   Edit → Operand type → Offset → Offset (data segment)\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
