    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to call a function with a function pointer in C++, but I can't find any convention that fits it. Its stack arguments are (right to left):\n </p>\n <pre><code>func(float x, float y, int unk);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  ...but ecx needs to be pointing to a buffer it can use for output / storage. That would be __thiscall, but the caller cleans up the stack (adds 12 to esp). This is what I have right now:\n </p>\n <pre><code>((void(__thiscall*)(char*,float,float,int))(0x1234567))(a, b, c);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  but it causes the application to crash because the stack isn't evened.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How can I call this?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
