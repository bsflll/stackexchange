The problem is that the trace is quite large and there are quite big chunks of the code that repeat (I assume they are loops).\n  \n\n  I would like to have some kind of tool that would be able to produce a graph or perform simple analyze/decompile to group loops into separate blocks and to simplify the flow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a tool like this or all of this should be done manually?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
