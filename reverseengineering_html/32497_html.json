It uses ida scripts to generate and preprocess the dataset.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It first requires me use IDA to generate the dataset.\n </p>\n <pre><code>python3 generate.py --ida /path/to/idat64 -b BINARIES_DIR -o OUTPUT_DIR_Step1\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This extracts function information from the dataset. After that, I have to run preprocessing scripts as follows (the instruction on their GitHub are incomplete).\n </p>\n <pre><code># Inside the dirty directory.\n\npython -m utils.preprocess OUTPUT_PATH PATH_TO_DATASET_FILENAMES OUTPUT_DIR_Step1\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But, the problem is that, the scripts don't take IDA path and they use\n  <code>\n   idapython\n  </code>\n  libraries such as\n  <code>\n   ida_typeinf\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Check -\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/CMUSTRUDEL/DIRTY/blob/main/binary/dire_types.py\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/CMUSTRUDEL/DIRTY/blob/main/binary/dire_types.py\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, if I run the above python script, as it lies outside the ida environment, gives me lib not found errors (because it can't see\n  <code>\n   ida_typeinf\n  </code>\n  ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there any way to run this script within ida environment (that's what I believe is the issue, but I could be wrong). It is also possible that the above command\n  <code>\n   python -m utils.preprocess OUTPUT_PATH PATH_TO_DATASET_FILENAMES OUTPUT_DIR_Step1\n  </code>\n  may not be accurate and I need Ida command line to run that command. Note that I know how to run idat on individual binaries.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Afaik, those libraries are meant to be used from inside since they're calling into the disassembler/decompiler API. Hence, it's sorta weird to run the python interpreter to use them directly.  You can run scripts from the UI with Alt+F7 (File -> Script File), or use the -S parameter from the commandline to explicitly run a script in IDA once it has loaded the database.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
