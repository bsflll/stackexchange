Put your mouse cursor on the instruction that you are interested in, go to Hex View, and the bytes corresponding to that instruction will be highlighted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you want to see the bytes corresponding to multiple instructions, you can write an IDAPython script to do that, such as this: (first use your cursor to select the instructions, then run this script)\n </p>\n <pre><code>start = idc.SelStart()\nend = idc.SelEnd()\n\nprint hex(start), hex(end)\n\nwhile start < end: \n    print hex(idc.Byte(start))\n    start = idc.NextAddr(start)\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
