    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Firstly I acknowledge that this is very borderline opinionated, but I'd like to emphasize this is more a thing of possibilities given some shortcomings of the default just writing down the offsets of things.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I do a lot of reverse engineering and then I write C/C++ code to mess with what I've learned. Suppose there is a class like this, representing a monster:\n </p>\n <pre><code>OFFSET  SIZE    VALUE\n0       8       Pointer to methods\n1280    4       X coordinate\n1284    4       Y coordinate\n128C    4       Z coordinate\n1400    4       Health\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  where, for example,\n  <code>\n   *(float*)((uint8_t*)obj + 0x1280)\n  </code>\n  would give the X coordinate. The rest of the class is unknown, and the only known method is\n  <code>\n   *(uint32_t*)((uint8_t*)*(uint32_t*)obj + 0xC)\n  </code>\n  , which just sets the health.\n </p>\n <p>\n  These kinds of classes can be updated very frequently, making it incredibly annoying to just have recorded the offsets of different things. I have seen it suggested to create a padded class with just\n  <code>\n   uint8_t[next off - start]\n  </code>\n  , but even that just feels really awkward.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Right now the best thing I can think of to do would be to create a bunch of different bytescans (excluding the offsets) for different methods of the object that access its members and automatically determine the offsets, but still.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My problem is that although I don't actually mind the updating itself, my code looks\n  <em>\n   terrible\n  </em>\n  . I effectively treat these objects as just integers floating around and have a bunch of scattered functions that operate on them like objects, but really they aren't.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a \"proper\" way to define an object with \"suggested\" offsets, with or without llibraries, and regardless, what would be a decent way to have clean code working with undocumented and mostly unknown objects like these?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In some cases it might also be possible to alias to arrays.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If using a padded struct, be careful of compiler alignment of the fields.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
