Working in ASM is really tough because I need to take out the code itself, not patch, and manually converting assembly code into pseudocode will be really hard to do.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Maybe only by looking at it, you will found the problem. If you find the origin but not understand the problem, you can try to patch it, to something like:\n    <code>\n     mov eax, <known_function_address>\n    </code>\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Maybe you can change a function signature to overcome the issue like it described\n    <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/15473/why-is-ida-call-analysis-failing\">\n     here\n    </a>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    You can try to use a different decompiler, when the most notable one is\n    <code>\n     Ghidra\n    </code>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The possible causes and solutions are described in the\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/decompiler/manual/failures.shtml#11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Hex-Rays Decompiler manual\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  One common cause is the stack adjustment of the call not being correctly detected by IDA (e.g. the called function is stdcall with arguments but IDA detected that stack change is 0). This can be fixed by specifying the correct stack change value via the\n  <kbd>\n   Alt+K\n  </kbd>\n  shortcut (4 for each push is a good rule of thumb).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
