    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  While reverse engineering a database middleware. This is presumably encoding a list of double or float values with Base64 encoding and then compressing it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Via\n  <code>\n   zlib.decompress()\n  </code>\n  I was able to decompress it, but I got a string of presumably multiple base64-strings. I can see that it consists of more than one, because it contains multiple\n  <code>\n   =\n  </code>\n  . But afaik, these do not always mark the end of a b64-encoded string, because one can also end without a\n  <code>\n   =\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is a excerpt of one field:\n </p>\n <pre><code>b'<\\x12u<\\xf4\\x808=\\x95\\xf0U=\\x9fse;\\xef\\xbe\\xf2=A\\xd1K=\\x1fB\\x99=\\x95\\x11\\xa3=\\xb8\\xcd\\xbd<\\xd2\\xfaL=\\x1d\\x80U=\\xd6:\\x1e=\\xdcp\\xcd=1\\xd2\\xe1=\\t\\x01\\x8e<\\x85\\xa8\\x16>8\\xb4\\xa7>2\\xf4\\x11=>\\x03\\x9b<\\xdfA\\x9b>%>a>\\xcf\\x9a\\x05>Ie\\x1c>\\t@Y<\\xdfC\\xe2=\\xf8\\'\\xb0=zpa=\\x8e\\xe8\\xde<\\xc8\\xcby=\\x88\\xfe\\xb6=\\xb8Uv=\\xd5\\xe3\\xee=q\\xef|<B\\xe1\\x1f=%\\xfe\\x85=\\x90_\\x04=p\\x9e\\xbd=\\x89og=\\x96\\x88\\x87<\\xa2\\x9c\\x84=\\x969\\xaf=\\xab\\x84^<\\xef\\x81\\xf6<T\\x7f\\xf4<\\x85\\xd6\\x86<\\x80Q\\x93<\\xb4\\xf9\\x00<\\xfc&s<\\xb9q\\x1b<\\xd3\\xd8\\xa0<4\\xe9\\xc3=\\x86a\\xb4=\\xd5s_=\\xc8\\xb1==\\xc24\\xca=~\\xd3\\xe8=^7\\xa5=e\\xa3-=\\x07?4<\\xd5HJ=='\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  As an amateur on this field, I am very unsure where to start.\nFrom the documentation I know, that it's a b64-encoded list, but I don't know how to use it. Obviously, when decoded, it will consist of a binary format that in some computer language represents a list of floats.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any tips on how to continue working on this problem?\nUnfortunately I have no access to the software currently, the only thing I have is this data structure.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sorry for my amateur questions, and thanks in advance for any tips!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
