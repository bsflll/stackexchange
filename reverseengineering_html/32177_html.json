The thing I've struggling a bit now it the\n  <code>\n   First Thunk\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   Original First Thunk\n  </code>\n  fields. To understand the difference between them I've read this post and that article. To test the problem \"live\" I've opened said\n  <code>\n   shell32.dll\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   notepad.exe\n  </code>\n  files in\n  <code>\n   PE-bear\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   IDA\n  </code>\n  BUT that appears the there is NO\n  <code>\n   import binding\n  </code>\n  in case of that files in contrast to what the articles say. Here are my question now:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Why there is NO\n  <code>\n   import binding\n  </code>\n  in these files?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here are the\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42413937/why-pe-need-original-first-thunkoft\">\n   first\n  </a>\n  and the\n  <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180103163005/https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100318-00/?p=14563\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   second\n  </a>\n  article.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Please don't down-vote the question if it appears to lame because I'm just newbie in the topic.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
