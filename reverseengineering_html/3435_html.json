It has some advantages, such as making it easier to redirect a function during runtime after load and makes it so that the loader only has to do a single relocation for that function. The other option would be to use an indirect call through an address. Neither is really optimal for performance due to the distance between the call and the jump or the address, which can hurt caching. You can\n  <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4khtbfyf%28VS.80%29.aspx\">\n   disable the jump thunk by disabling incremental linking\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  That said, what you're doing is probably a bad idea. IDA is not really made to produce code that can be reassembled. What's normally done is that you extend the last section or add a new section with the patched code then redirect the original code to the patch through a call or a jump.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
