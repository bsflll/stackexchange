What I want to avoid is to waste a lot of time on analyzing library functions which I know from the start I'm not interested in (such as MFC libraries).\n </p>\n <p>\n  If this is possible, an instruction how to do it in Ollydbg would be great though I'm grateful for any tips.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So, I have access to source header and lib files, and also the dlls of the component. How do I go from here (i.e. how do I create the MAP file, then load it into and use it in OllyDbg)?\n</span>\n</body></html>",
