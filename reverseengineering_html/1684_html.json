It seems it's even available in Debian in the package\n  <a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/sid/binutils-h8300-hms\">\n   <code>\n    binutils-h8300-hms\n   </code>\n  </a>\n  (might be outdated).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Alternative GNU-based toolchains for many Renesas processors (including H8) are provided by\n  <a href=\"http://www.kpitgnutools.com/\">\n   KPIT\n  </a>\n  (free but requires registration). I think they've been contributing to mainline too but not sure how's their progress there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Just for reference, here's how to use\n  <code>\n   objdump\n  </code>\n  to disassemble a raw binary:\n </p>\n <pre><code>objdump -m h8300 -b binary -D myfile.bin\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Renesas offers their own commercial compiler/assembler/simulator (and I\n  <em>\n   think\n  </em>\n  a disassembler too) suite called\n  <a href=\"http://am.renesas.com/products/tools/coding_tools/c_compilers_assemblers/h8_compiler/index.jsp\">\n   High-performance Embedded Workshop\n  </a>\n  (HEW) but I couldn't find out how much it costs. There is a\n  <a href=\"http://am.renesas.com/support/downloads/download_results/C2000301-C2000400/evaluation_h8c.jsp\">\n   downloadable evaluation version\n  </a>\n  , however.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For a quick look at some hex you can also try the\n  <a href=\"http://www.onlinedisassembler.com/odaweb/run_hex\">\n   Online Disassembler\n  </a>\n  , it has a couple of H8 variants.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
