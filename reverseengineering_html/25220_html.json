    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to learn how to do basic unpacking EXEs. I've read into how the PE header works, sections, the IAT and I already know a fair bit about assembly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I started with compressing my simple x64.exe with UPX and attempted to manually unpack it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I stepped through the stub code, established where the extracted original code goes (.UPX0 section), found the OEP and IAT. With this, I was able to use Scylla to dump the process and correctly rebuild the IAT.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, when I ran the unpacked exe it failed. I decided to debug the unpacked exe and realised the code attempts to address a static variable that was originally stored in the .data section but is now invalid and generates a memory violation exception (crashing the program).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyway to my frustration I realised that I needed to fix up the relocations as the original .reloc section had been lost. I painstakingly stepped through the UPX code and identified where the addresses that needed to be relocated were. I use PE explorer to rebuild the .reloc section manually. However, I gave up after 6 address when I realised there was a total of 100 to go through!\n </p>\n <p>\n  My question is, is there a tool that can automatically fix up the relocations (much like Scylla does with the IAT) or am I stuck doing it manually?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Many thanks\nZ\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Capture a second dump.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Compare two dumps. The locations with differences should be the relocations. Create a relocation table for them.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Specifically for UPX, thereâ€™s an easier way: the relocation table is stored in a predefined format so you just need to find and parse it. See the UPX source code for more info.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

With the introduction of ASLR, EXE files got a\n  <code>\n   .reloc\n  </code>\n  table for security but they still work just as well without one.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So if you have a dump of a file that has been relocated, just \"fix\" that image base in the PE header and remove the\n  <code>\n   .reloc\n  </code>\n  section and your binary should work.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
