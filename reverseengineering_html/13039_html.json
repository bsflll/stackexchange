It's just not what I am good at. I have an old windows3.1 tts engine called Keynote Gold multimedia application that I would like to decompile and make work on a modern computer system and also on android. If I send someone the dll files could you take a look and see if it can be done, please?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

QEMU probably the best option.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Porting Windows software the way you're suggesting is generally too painful to be realistic, and virtualization provides almost perfect results with little effort.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If it is just a DLL it might be more realistic than a full software package, depending on how complex the code is. Still a lot of work, and if you want it to run on Android you still have to emulate it somehow. Payoff/work ratio very low imho.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
