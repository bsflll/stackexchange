It supports version 3 QR codes for some menus and version 11 for most menus.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, using version 11 with this feature for\n  <code>\n   1+2\n  </code>\n  in\n  <code>\n   Calculate\n  </code>\n  mode produces a QR code linking\n  <a href=\"http://wes.casio.com/math/index.php?q=I-235F+U-000A00673394+M-C10000AD00+S-001410110000100E1010B00035DE+R-0300000000000000010000000000000000000000+E-31A632\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  . I have taken a photo of the QR code, shown below, but my camera quality is quite poor. I have also made several edits of the image, also shown below.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Original photo:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"Version 11 QR code for '1+2' in 'Calculate' mode\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/r0ENRs.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Photo edited to be easier to scan and reference. The changes I made include making it monochrome, rotating it and increasing the contrast.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"Photo edited to make it easier to scan and reference\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NeZlZs.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  QR code re-created as a pixel image. Keep in mind that, while I spent a few hours producing and double-checking this, there are several errors. However, it scans correctly, so it should be close enough to compare with.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"Manual recreation of the QR code as a pixel image\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/dlEb2.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Re-creation color-coded to indicate primary features of the QR code:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"Color-coded recreation of the QR code\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/eeXue.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am wanting to reverse-engineer these QR codes so that I can calculate an equation to produce a QR code with a specific image in order to display this image on the calculator. I'm aware that I won't be able to control lots of the QR code's pixels, but theoretically I'd be able to at the very least brute-force the closest QR code to a given image.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've found that the QR code uses 0 error correction and a mask pattern of 4. I've used\n  <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   a Python QR code library\n  </a>\n  to produce a QR code using these same settings (code and result shown below).\n </p>\n <pre><code>from qrcode import QRCode\nlink = 'http://wes.casio.com/math/index.php?q=I-235F+U-000A00673394+M-C10000AD00+S-001410110000100E1010B00035DE+R-0300000000000000010000000000000000000000+E-31A632'\nqr = QRCode(version=11,error_correction=0,mask_pattern=4)\nqr.add_data(link)\nqr.print_ascii(invert=True)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"QR code generated using the same settings in Python\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EOGtF.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, it is clearly different to the original QR code. I produced a difference map between the generated and original QR code:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"Difference map between the generated and original QR code\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GZNgq.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  As you can see, all the format and version info is identical and they link to the same URL, but the actual data is completely different. Even the encoding type, ECI type and length are the same. So where do I go from here? What could be causing such a difference between the two codes?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Did you find the timing patterns? Did you find the alignment patterns? Did you find the version info regions? Did you find the format info? RE is a lot of work and I expect you to do a big part of this - at least the obvious and easy stuff. E.g. redraw the picture (manually, if needed) in a nice B/W single pixel per pixel image and e.g. color the stuff that you can identify\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Version info and format info I described in the OP.
