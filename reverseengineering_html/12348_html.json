    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am trying to analyze some execution crash information, and to better identify the root cause of memory access error, I would like to\n  <code>\n   reverse execute\n  </code>\n  the program from the crash point.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, to identify the root cause of memory access error below, I would like to reversely execute from the third line, and by leveraging some data flow analysis techniques, I should be able to identify the root cause at the first line.\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov    -0x18(%rbp),%rax       <---- root cause is at memory -0x18(%rbp)\nadd    %rdx,%rax\nmov    (%rax),%eax            <--- crash when reading (%rax)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So here is my question, is there any dynamic analysis tool/debugger that can support reverse execution? I prefer\n  <code>\n   Pin\n  </code>\n  , but I am not aware that\n  <code>\n   Pin\n  </code>\n  can do this..\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

It doesn't exactly support reverse execution, but I wrote it with the idea to help in the problem you have: check why a crash happened by replaying recorded executions traces. The program is not executing but rather replaying the execution trace, however, in most cases, that is more than enough.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
