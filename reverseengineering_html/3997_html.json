    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I loaded an MS-Windows executable in Ollydbg. But as soon as I hit run from the\n  <code>\n   Debug\n  </code>\n  menu a message shows up:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Breakpoint set at address 76A010B1 is corrupt (contains hex code instead of int3 ...)\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  And the program doesn't run, rather it breaks to Ollydbg. I am puzzled. What is really going on? I see an\n  <code>\n   isdebugger\n  </code>\n  call. Fixing it, also, it doesn't run the program. I suppose it's using some advanced anti debugging technique. Any suggestions?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is the log from windbg:\n </p>\n <pre><code>(a9c.1fd4): Break instruction exception - code 80000003 (first chance)\n*** ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.

When i checked the binary with peid it shows it is compiled with visual c++ . But in fact it runs on java vm . I guess it uses jni to call native function but its just a guess . And no matter what i try , the process terminates or just hangs when i try to hook up a debugger to the process.</span>",
