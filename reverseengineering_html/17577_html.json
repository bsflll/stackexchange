The compiler took advantage of the fact that there is a fixed offset between source and destination. Ignoring the  lea  check, the assembly could be represented by this pseudocode:\n </p>\n <pre><code>wchar_t *dst = &some_data; //rcx\nwchar_t *src = ?; //r9\ndelta = src-dst; //r9 =r9-dst\nmaxc = 0x28; //r8\n\nloop:\n wchar_t ch = dst[delta]; (dst+(src-dst) = src, so ch=src[i];)\n if ( ch==0 ) break;\n *dst = ch;\n dst++;\n maxc--;\n if ( maxc!=0 ) goto loop;\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Now let's look at the mysterious\n  <code>\n   lea\n  </code>\n  . First thing you need to remember that it's basically just a fancy\n  <code>\n   mov\n  </code>\n  , and the operands are not necessarily addresses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  so let's take\n  <code>\n   lea     rax, [r8+7FFFFFD6h]\n  </code>\n  and do some math:\n </p>\n <pre><code>rax = r8+0x7FFFFFD6\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  multiply both sides by 2:\n </p>\n <pre><code>2*rax = 2*r8+0xFFFFFFAC\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  treat number as signed:\n </p>\n <pre><code>2*rax = 2*r8-0x54\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  now divide:\n </p>\n <pre><code>rax = r8 - 0x2a\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  so testing rax==0 is the same as r8==0x2a. Possibly the code is checking that number of characters to copy is not greater than the buffer size.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
