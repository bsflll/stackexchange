    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am working on a site that was made years ago (not be me) and I need to identify a jQuery file manager plugin. This plugin shows a file manager view in a browser and allows the user to visually navigate a directory tree and view, upload, or download files.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In its code it refers to itself as\n  <code>\n   documentLibrary\n  </code>\n  or\n  <code>\n   Document Library\n  </code>\n  . Based on file dates, it looks like this may have been implemented circa 2017.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have tried a variety of Google searches, as you can imagine the terms \"jQuery file manager\" and \"jQuery document library\" yield a lot of results that have nothing to do with what I am looking for. I have tried searching for pieces of the code, but I do not have any luck.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have found similarly named products related to a WordPress plugin and Sharepoint services, but they do not seem to be related to the plugin I am looking at.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here are some snippets that seem like they could be identifiable by someone familiar with this plugin.\n </p>\n <pre><code>    $.documentLibrary = function(element, options) {\n        \n        var defaults = {\n            ajax_url        : false,\n            csrf            : false,\n            file_container  : false,\n            folder_table    : false,\n            tool_bar        : false,\n            drop_zone       : false,\n            is_media_modal  : false,\n            example_callback: function() {},\n            restrict_files : []\n        };\n</code></pre>\n <pre><code>        plugin.init = function() {\n            plugin.settings = $.extend({}, defaults, options);\n            plugin.open_folders = [];\n            if(plugin.settings.csrf===false){throw \"Configuation Error: The document library requires a csrf token for ajax calls.\";}\n            if(plugin.settings.ajax_url===false){throw \"Document Library requires an ajax url.\";}\n            if(plugin.settings.folder_table === false ){\n                throw \"Document Library requires a file holder.\";\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Thanks for any help. Let me know if I can provide more information.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
