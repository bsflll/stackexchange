    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Somewhat recently FiveBelow started selling \"fancy\" famiclones branded under Vivitar. It's styled to look like an old CRT TV.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/j-xvHT_au9Y?si=ZeN9CmVRBeLvfJSs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   A video for those curious\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Intrigued in the possibilities for hardware hacking, I picked one up myself. Although because of the low quality of the PCB I ended up accidentally destroying it soon after due to lifting multiple pads. Oops.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But hey, it didn't die completely in vain because not only did I dump it's flash chip (which contains the games), but I also managed to de encapsulate the IC!\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/five-below-vivitar-fancy-famiclone-s-29-gl-064-n-90-tfi-04\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Here's the firmware dump\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  But unlike that Coleco Head-to-Head plug and play I decapped, this modern famiclone is SIGNIFICANTLY more complex! The former was little more then an NES and accompanying cartridge crammed down into two chips, but the latter is on par with\n  <em>\n   mid range microcontrollers!\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is a problem, because the firmware dump I have looks like absolute nonsense to me. Not even a single ASCII string in sight!\n </p>\n <p>\n  I also haven't found any part numbers on the NOAC silicon die, so I can't find a lead that way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any help would be appreciated!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
