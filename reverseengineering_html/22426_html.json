Entropy of 0.8 is pretty poor for any decent encryption or compression.

This gives you -\n </p>\n <pre><code>000128B0:  08 BC 18 47 3A 20 48 65 61 70 20 6D 65 6D 6F 72  ...G: Heap memor\n000128C0:  79 20 63 6F 72 72 75 70 74 65 64 00 4F 75 74 20  y corrupted.Out \n000128D0:  6F 66 20 68 65 61 70 20 6D 65 6D 6F 72 79 00 00  of heap memory..\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This makes much more sense. Other apparent strings become readable with this transformation too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd suggest you apply this to the whole file and see what that gives you.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This may already clarify your situation.\n  \n\n  You can also check the entropy with binwalk to verify if this is really compressed or encrypted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Besides of that my I ask you how you dumped the firmware? Ar you sure that the dump itself is correct?\n  \n\n  It kind of reminds me of a project that I was working on not that long ago. I had a few mistakes in my script. Those mistakes made the dump look really weird (e.g. it started correctly and after a few bytes I only had 0xFF bytes, that's why I am asking).\n </p>\n <p>\n  At least just by looking at the picture it doesn't look like .zip, .xz, .gzip to me. If I remember correctly the header formats of those three look different (assuming that your picure shows the beginning of the file). But I am not 100% sure about that, I might be wrong about that.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
