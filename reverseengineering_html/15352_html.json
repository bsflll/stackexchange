The IDA Free 5.0 (Windows only) is still using Borland VCL for GUI and AFAIK is accessible to some screenreaders.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm not familiar much with other tools and especially their accessibility, but I suspect Radare2, being console-oriented, should be somewhat friendly to screen readers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can also always use just plain linear disassemblers (\n  <code>\n   objdump\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   dumpbin\n  </code>\n  , or even IDA in batch mode) and edit the disassembly listing manually, or even dump hex and work from it...\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
