Next attach to the suspended process using your debugger, and resume all threads.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some other way would be to edit the PE file and change the bytes at the entrypoint to\n  <code>\n   EB FE\n  </code>\n  .\nThis is an instruction that jumps to itself, i.e. it is an infinite loop. Next start the application normally. Now use a debugger to attach to it. Restore the original bytes at the entrypoint and resume the process.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
