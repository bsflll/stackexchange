    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to determine - using IdaPython - if a function prototype is user-defined or have been automatically guessed / defined by IDA (i.e. without specific user interaction).\n </p>\n <p>\n  The flag is probably available somewhere but I haven't been able to find it, despite multiple tries.\n </p>\n <p>\n  According to the documentation for the\n  <code>\n   Functions Window\n  </code>\n  :\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   A bold font is used for functions that have a definite (user-specified) prototype.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  For example (disassembled Windows kernel with PDB), in the Functions window the\n  <code>\n   PsReferenceImpersonationToken\n  </code>\n  function is in bold, and its decompiled code prototype (signature) is in blue:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lQtZ2m89.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"User-defined function\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lQtZ2m89.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the other hand, the\n  <code>\n   ObReferenceFileObjectForWrite\n  </code>\n  function is not in bold in the Functions window, and its decompiled function prototype is in yellow:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Z1FnPsmS.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Non user-defined function\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Z1FnPsmS.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  What I'd like to find - using IdaPython - is that, given a function\n  <code>\n   ea\n  </code>\n  : is the function prototype user-defined or not? (i.e. bold in functions windows and blue in the decompiler).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've tried using\n  <code>\n   cfunc_t\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   cfuncptr_t\n  </code>\n  , checking the flags between various functions, but nothing definitive came out of it. Tried also with the\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/idapython/src/blob/master/examples/hexrays/vds4.py\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   vds4.py\n  </a>\n  example (with some modifications) but to no avail.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Note\n  </strong>\n  : I'm using IDA Pro 9.0 SP1 and have the x64 decompiler.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
