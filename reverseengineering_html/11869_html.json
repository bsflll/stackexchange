Say, if I opened a debugee process and started stepping through it with a debugger (WinDbg) and then want to look up the contents of memory. How do I change the address in the hex view pane?\n </p>\n <p>\n  (Circled in red in this screenshot)\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/H5OTp.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/H5OTp.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Instead of using cryptic keyboard shortcuts there should be an option in the right click menu \"Enter address\" or \"Jump to User Address\".
