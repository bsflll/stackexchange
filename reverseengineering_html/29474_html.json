The similar method was just super easier it seemed to be the same but it wasn't at all  ðŸ™ˆ had to follow the internal assembly which pointed to a function via br x4 and loads another function from another framework the int64 field matches some conditionals there, so it seems I never was meant to parse it? ðŸ™ˆ . Thank you again and please vote to close this question as I am satisfied :)\n</span>\n</body></html>",
