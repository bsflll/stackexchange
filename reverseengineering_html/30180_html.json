Because IDC is like C(++) in its syntax I figured I could do:\n </p>\n <pre><code>auto lala[4] = {0,1,2,3};\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But that doesn't work. Neither do round or square brackets.\nTrying to do lala[0] produces this output:\n </p>\n <pre><code>Cannot use [] operator on scalars\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  What gives?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
