Consider a \"reversible\" binary with an extension. Remove the extension. Is the binary itself any different than it was before? Extensions have no significance in this context. Although I'm not sure, your error appears to indicate a radare shortcoming.\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ file visiond \nvisiond: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /system/bin/linker64, stripped\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
