I am really enjoying re and I would love to get an internship in that area. My problem is that the number of re internship jobs I found on various job search engines is extremely limited to quite non existing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Do you have any ideas where I could look for jobs instead? I am living in germany but I also wouldnt mind to move to a nearby country.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you very much!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Analyzing virus/malwares is probably the main one. So maybe you can try browsing the homepages of some companies that sell antivirus products/services to see if they provide such jobs, or even contact them directly.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Otherwise you would have to trust everything a manufacturer says without a chance to verify it. Also verifying security of products e.g. software is much easier than reversing malware.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
