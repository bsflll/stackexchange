    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to extract some binary blobs from a unknown archive format. (*.pakz).\nI know this archive contains some\n  <code>\n   .xtreme\n  </code>\n  binary files that are the files I'm looking for. My goal is to extract those files from the archive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By doing some research I've came across\n  <code>\n   binwalk\n  </code>\n  . So I've tried to extract some signature info from it. It returned me several blobs of LZMA compressed data.\n </p>\n <p>\n  f.ex, this is the first entries in the output of\n  <code>\n   binwalk\n  </code>\n </p>\n <pre><code>    DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n12            0xC             LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 65536 bytes, uncompressed size: 1130064 bytes\n1079006       0x1076DE        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 65536 bytes, uncompressed size: 669520 bytes\n1718248       0x1A37E8        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 65536 bytes, uncompressed size: 807872 bytes\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I assume these are parts of a single compressed file I should combine? So I tried extracting each individual files/blob with\n  <code>\n   carve\n  </code>\n  option. This outputs me several .7z files however many are missing. I don't know why, by using verbose and log command line options, it doens't output any errors but outputs LZMA blob addresses that are not extracted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If I extract files I get several .xml files that give me useful information, f.ex, the path of the files I'm looking for but I still don't know from the path the start/end bytes of that file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does anyone has any clue?\nThanks in advance.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
