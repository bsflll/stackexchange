To do this you need to:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Pause the program, either via\n   <code>\n    Pause\n   </code>\n   option (F12) or using breakpoints\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Select\n   <code>\n    Trace\n   </code>\n   menu and then\n   <code>\n    Trace into...\n   </code>\n   (Ctrl+Alt+F7) or\n   <code>\n    Trace over...\n   </code>\n   (Ctrl+Alt+F8). If you want to log every instruction you probably want to use\n   <code>\n    Trace into...\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Now in the newly created window\n   <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/p1vEI.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    <img alt=\"Trace dialog\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/p1vEI.png\"/>\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  you can select the\n  <code>\n   Log Text\n  </code>\n  format, you can use the proposed\n  <code>\n   0x{p:cip} {i:cip}\n  </code>\n  which will log the data to file like\n  <code>\n   0x006E8749 mov ebp, esp\n  </code>\n  . It is also good idea to set the\n  <code>\n   Maximum trace count\n  </code>\n  and the\n  <code>\n   Log File...\n  </code>\n  where the data will be stored. After you are done just press\n  <code>\n   OK\n  </code>\n  and the x64dbg will start executing your program and log all the instructions. Keep in mind that the program won't work really fast during the trace procedure.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
