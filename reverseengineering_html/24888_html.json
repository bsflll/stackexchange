Your best bet is to find the arguments that are used when building an android app normally via gradle or whatever. Or the arguments that apktool calls aapt with.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

If you miss using zipalign and re-sign the apk, that may be a reason why you are getting crashes with errors.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
