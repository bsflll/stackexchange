    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  This is a multi part program where a 'challenge token' is generated and I have to provide a response that I believe needs to be in token form as well because when I enter it the parts in without spaces or a delimiter it fails. But I've also noticed that when even though\n  <code>\n   strtok\n  </code>\n  is called, the registers that hold my response include the delimiter which is what I think is throwing this off when my string is compared with the code's strings. Am I supposed to find or use a certain delimiter?\n  \n\n </p>\n <p>\n  Another question, In this portion\n  <code>\n   rbp-0x50\n  </code>\n  is the counter as it cycles through this part 4 times. I'm not sure what\n  <code>\n   sprintf\n  </code>\n  does, (Any insight?) Overall it  seems to be generating the string which my response should mirror into\n  <code>\n   rbp-0x30\n  </code>\n  . After this segment, the code goes on to show that whatever\n  <code>\n   sprintf\n  </code>\n  puts into\n  <code>\n   RAX\n  </code>\n  which ultimately ends up in\n  <code>\n   qword [rbp-0x48]\n  </code>\n  should be the same as what was generated in\n  <code>\n   [rbp-0x30]\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Disassembly :\n </p>\n <pre><code>400cd4:  mov     eax, dword [rbp-0x50]\n400cd7:  movzx   eax, byte [rbp+rax-0x40]\n400cdc:  movsx   eax, al\n400cdf:  mov     edx, dword [rbp-0x50]\n400ce2:  lea     ecx, [rdx+rdx]\n400ce5:  lea     rdx, [rbp-0x30]\n400ce9:  mov     ecx, ecx\n400ceb:  add     rcx, rdx\n400cee:  mov     edx, eax\n400cf0:  mov     esi, 0x40101a  \"%02X\"\n400cf5:  mov     rdi, rcx\n400cf8:  mov     eax, 0x0\n400cfd:  call    sprintf\n400d02:  add     dword [rbp-0x50], 0x1\n400d06:  cmp     dword [rbp-0x50], 0x4\n400d0a:  jbe     0x400cd4\n\n400d0c:  mov     esi, 0x401018\n400d11:  mov     edi, 0x0\n400d16:  call    strtok\n400d1b:  mov     qword [rbp-0x48], rax\n400d1f:  cmp     qword [rbp-0x48], 0x0\n400d24:  jne     0x400d2d\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I guess where I'm stuck is RAX is 2 until after STRTOK happens then RAX becomes 0 which gets moved into rbp-0x40 causing the program not to continue on to  where '0x400d2d' is  Is strtok returning the zero value? What would that mean if so?</span>",

Your input to that code obviously needs to be longer than you currently provide. The ESI register at a call to strtok points to a string that contains the token separator chars. Note that you pass into strtok how the token you want to get now <i>ends</i>. This means the separator before the token that strtok should return is in ESI at the <i>previous</i> strtok call.</span>",
