The rest of the message is data.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've tried running lines of data through various CRC calculations but getting nowhere fast. Any help would be appreciated. csv on the link below\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've been running lines of this through reveng and getting the odd match but it's a bit hit and miss\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1w7diZetSim7hVV1P-2Qls3DfFkB-57vT\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://drive.google.com/open?id=1w7diZetSim7hVV1P-2Qls3DfFkB-57vT\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Data here is:\nID,B0,B1,B2...,B7 in Hex\n </p>\n <p>\n  40F8000000C0000000\n409C010000C0000000\n4030020000C0000000\n4054030000C0000000\n4047040000C0000000\n4023050000C0000000\n408F060000C0000000\n40EB070000C0000000\n40A9080000C0000000\n40CD090000C0000000\n4061100000C0000000\n4005110000C0000000\n4016120000C0000000\n4072130000C0000000\n40DE140000C0000000\n40BA150000C0000000\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks in advance,\nD\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
