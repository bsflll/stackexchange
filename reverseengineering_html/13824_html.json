For VSA, see e.g.\n  <a href=\"https://research.cs.wisc.edu/wpis/papers/wysinwyx.final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The blog author writes\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   I’ve been trying to get to the point where the example in\n  Balakrishnan’s dissertation works. I chose this example because I\n  don’t know of any others!\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  I was wondering how one would test a custom VSA implementation. How can one find test cases?\n </p>\n <p>\n  My guess is one could run & trace a simple application and record (concrete, i.e. run-time) values for some memory areas or registers. These values then should show up in the result of the corresponding memory / registers after having done the static VSA, right?\n </p>\n <p>\n  For the beginning, it would be easier to have some examples. Are you aware of any examples (other than those in the official papers)?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
