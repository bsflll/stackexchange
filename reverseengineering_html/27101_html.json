    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a weird bug that causes this crap:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7bKJU.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e86b24be-f278-4a53-9719-c5319596a6a2?upload=true\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7bKJU.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  There are plenty of dumb \"solutions\" a-la \"turn it off and on\" but none of them work and/or relevant, the shell apps simply refuse to cache icon for Vivaldi. I confirmed it by checking cache data at:\n  <code>\n   %localappdata%\\Packages\\Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\\TempState\\\n  </code>\n  It contains 3 binary files:\n </p>\n <pre><code>TileCache_125_3_PNGEncoded_Data.bin\nTileCache_125_3_PNGEncoded_Header.bin\nStartUnifiedTileModelCache.dat\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  For us, only\n  <strong>\n   TileCache_125_3_PNGEncoded_Data.bin\n  </strong>\n  and\n  <strong>\n   TileCache_125_3_PNGEncoded_Header.bin\n  </strong>\n  are relevant.\n </p>\n <h1>\n  WHAT I KNOW\n </h1>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   [TileCache_125_3_PNGEncoded_Data.bin]\n  </strong>\n  Contains raw binary PNG data in chunks, smallest chunk seems to be 1024b, padded with\n  <code>\n   0\n  </code>\n  if PNG data is smaller than chunk size. If PNG data is bigger than chunk size it is expanded by 2x i.e. becomes 2x by 1024 - 2048 and so on. Probably optimized for binary reading. Extracting all PNG data reveals it is missing\n  <strong>\n   exactly that one Vivaldi icon\n  </strong>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   [TileCache_125_3_PNGEncoded_Header.bin]\n  </strong>\n  The layout is also fairly simple, first 40 bytes is some header/meta data, 4bytes integer at offset\n  <code>\n   12\n  </code>\n  describes amount of entries, in my case 18, but should be\n  <strong>\n   19\n  </strong>\n  . After the header, there are entries itself, 18 entries, each 112 bytes:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9EvEd.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9EvEd.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Highlighted in red are:\n  <code>\n   [offset]\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   [all chunks size]\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   [padding size]\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   [height]x[width]\n  </code>\n </p>\n <h1>\n  WHAT I DONT KNOW\n </h1>\n <p>\n  The data highlighted in blue is unknown to me, but I'm fairly sure it is somehow describes the relation between cache entry and the Start Menu tile. I assume some of them might be GUIDs, especially 16bytes long ones, but quick search for these guides in Registry resulted in nothing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Knowing how that relation works could help me to manually insert the entry and fix this shit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or I could reinstall whole system like a buffon, yes.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
