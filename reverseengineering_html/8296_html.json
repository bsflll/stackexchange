And you can omit the\n  <code>\n   & 0x00000000FFFFFFFF\n  </code>\n  from the first expression if\n  <code>\n   v12\n  </code>\n  is an\n  <code>\n   int\n  </code>\n  , since the high bits will be zero anyway in a 32 bit integer. But the java compiler will probably optimize these away anyway, and i wanted to write the statements in a way that makes clear which bits are taken from\n  <code>\n   fMax\n  </code>\n  , and which from\n  <code>\n   v12\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   v13\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
