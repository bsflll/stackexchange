So, I installed Burp Suite Community Edition and set it up with Firefox. I opened Instagram and tried to login with these details (just for testing):\n </p>\n <pre><code>Username: admin\n\nPassword: 123456\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However, when I intercepted the request in Burp, although the username was still admin , the password had been encrypted to something else. This means that somewhere in the code of the website, a formula tells Firefox how to convert 123456 to that string. How can I find this 'formula'?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
