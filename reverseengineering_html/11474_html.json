    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I need to analyze a memory dump of a malware module, unfortunately the sample is not the original dll, but the dump of the dll from the memory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now fixing the\n  <code>\n   sections headers\n  </code>\n  is fairly easy - i just need to match the\n  <code>\n   Virtual address \\ size\n  </code>\n  to the\n  <code>\n   Raw address \\ size\n  </code>\n  because this is what the PE will get once loaded to memory (Which is the case for the dump)\n </p>\n <p>\n  But now there is a different problem, when i open the file on IDA-PRO for example, the memory isnt aligned correctly thus the analysis is incorrect and not all\n  <code>\n   call\n  </code>\n  functions with relative addresses work properly (they dont point to the right location - or to a location which makes sense in terms of PE size)\n </p>\n <p>\n  I feel like the solution of Re-basing the PE on ida is incomplete and does not fix everything as i need it to be.\nAlso i would like to fix the PE so i can dynamically load it later with ollydbg (as if i had the original)\n </p>\n <p>\n  So my question is:\nHow exactly would you recommend me to fix the PE Headers and Rebase the program so i can load it successfully?\n </p>\n <p>\n  For the VirusTotal-Intelligence users, the Sample MD5 is:\n3bb85abe51b0f96f501d2bb32ec4edef\nSHA256:\n83c95637712cacc0ca280892465a75a3a10a2d8df48dd816ae703bccb15db51d\n </p>\n <p>\n  Samples:\n  <a href=\"https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/search?query=vxfamily%3AGen:Variant.Terkcop\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/search?query=vxfamily%3AGen:Variant.Terkcop\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   2015_12_08_ExtraInfo\n  </strong>\n  :\n@ubnix, I havent yet read the content of the materials you sent me, but im much aware of the importance of IAT - By the way this is exactly the problem when im loading the file on IDA.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The dll is being loaded at address 0x10000000 (Thus every section is loaded at 0x10001000 - depending on size and so on respectively, 0x10000000 and forward.)\n </p>\n <p>\n  The code of the malware is expecting the IAT to be located at 0x05320000, which is not the case obviously. When i try on IDA-PRO to change the location of the IAT Segment (Ctrl + S or ALT + S if i recall) it is crashing my IDA client.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Obviously changing the Address would only work as a temporary solution to see the malware statically on IDA pro and not as a solution to run the malware with ollydbg. If i would want to run the malware with olly, i need to somehow make the dll run under the correct address of 0x5320000\n </p>\n <p>\n  When changing the BaseAddress of the PE from 0x10000000 to the address i want (Using CFF Explorer), it is still being loaded at 0x10000000 at ollydbg.. no idea why\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Edit2 2015_12_15\n  </strong>\n  :\nExample of a sample i \"fixed\" his headers, yet its still not working properly (Problems with all CRT fucntions)\n </p>\n <p>\n  The original sample:\n  <a href=\"https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/53dd790b1bd0588e542d33bde49dbf33c6fb7828e91a8d13c416c831108d642c?environmentId=1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/53dd790b1bd0588e542d33bde49dbf33c6fb7828e91a8d13c416c831108d642c?environmentId=1\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  After i fixed the sample:\n  <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/6dz7athzdja94p4/53_fixed_rebase.dll?dl=0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   https://www.dropbox.com/s/6dz7athzdja94p4/53_fixed_rebase.dll?dl=0\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Please note that both of these files are samples of malware and might cause antivirus to alert.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The sample i fixed is definitely working more properly, and ida can instantly recognize all the functions - yet i think i missed something, because only the CRT functions or functions such as \"Init operation\" (Like c++ classes initialization) are failing.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Precisely, you need to be sure that the Import Address Table(IAT) and the Export Address Table(EAT) are correct. If the notions like IAT and EAT are foreign to you I suggest you to read about those tables in the official\n   <a href=\"https://download.microsoft.com/download/e/b/a/eba1050f-a31d-436b-9281-92cdfeae4b45/pecoff.doc\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    PE file format specification\n   </a>\n   under \"The .idata Section\" and \"The .edata Section\".\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Also, since this question is closely related to PE file format, I suggest You to read the following documents:\n   <a href=\"http://www.bandwidthco.com/whitepapers/compforensics/binary/eff/An%20In-Depth%20Look%20into%20the%20Win32%20Portable%20Executable%20File%20Format.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    An In-Depth Look into the Win32 Portable Executable File Format Part 1\n   </a>\n   and\n   <a href=\"http://reversingproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/an_in-depth_look_into_the_win32_portable_executable_file_format_part_2.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n    An In-Depth Look into the Win32 Portable Executable File Format Part 2\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I know I just posted a lot of material to read but believe me, I am talking from my personal experience, and these resources are a must if You want to understand the PE file format and the procedure of dumping PE files correctly. If you have any more questions feel write to ask and I will answer ASAP.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Check the Characteristics field in the IMAGE_FILE_HEADER to see does it contain the IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_DYNAMIC_BASE flag. What this means is that the DLL will be loaded on a random address in memory and for it to work correctly, the relocation table must be specified and correct. So, is the relocation table specified in your malware sample?</span>",
