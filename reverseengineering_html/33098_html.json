    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  About 15 years ago Sandisk released their \"Sansa SlotRadio\" thing. Basically, it's a regular mp3 player with an sdcard preloaded with music.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Well, the music mafia being the music mafia, there's DRM involved, which would make an interesting project to try and defeat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the sdcard is a sticker. And behind the sticker is... A grid of pins!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Infact, it looks SUSPICIOUSLY similar to the ones data recovery centers use when doing low level stuff on physically broken cards.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyone have any info on this? It's three rows and seven columns, with (2,2) missing and (2,5) much smaller.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jyr3360F.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"The SDCARD in question.\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jyr3360F.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
