    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to reverse-enginering a Win7 32bit legacy driver.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If I break when the system is loaded I can see that the driver is loaded because the corresponding DRIVER_OBJECT is created (\n  <code>\n   !drvobj name\n  </code>\n  show a real object).\n </p>\n <p>\n  But I can't see the driver name in the module list with\n  <code>\n   lm\n  </code>\n  command. Is there an explanation for this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Because of this I am also unable to break when this module is loaded with\n  <code>\n   sxe ld name\n  </code>\n  but I think that the driver is loaded just after the loading of umbus (because at this time the corresponding DRIVER_OBJECT is created).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Searching on internet I found that this is the \"User mode bus enumerator\" but I don't understand because it is a kernel mode driver (.sys file).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I tried also\n <code>\n  bu module_name+offset of EntryPoint\n </code>\n with no luck. I think the problem is windbg does not know what \"module name\" is before I do\n <code>\n  .reload\n </code>\n and so is unable to break on EntryPoint. Any clues?\n</span>\n</body></html>",
