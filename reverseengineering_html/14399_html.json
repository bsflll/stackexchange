Is the disassembly incorrect? How do I interpret one single row?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   DCB \"0000000000000000 l    df *ABS*\",9,\"0000000000000000 gic.c\",0xA\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The row above doesn't seem to be continuous data even. How are the columns  (space/tab and comma separated) significant? I can locate the following column values:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   DCB\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   0000000000000000\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   1\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   df\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   *ABS*\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   9\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   0000000000000000\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   gic.c\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   0xA\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Look at the\n  <code>\n   dcb\n  </code>\n  and double quotes; unprintable characters are included outside the double quotes, in hex.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Presumably there is a zero-terminator at the very end, which is how IDA Pro identified it as a\n  <em>\n   string\n  </em>\n  : all it contains are printable characters, plus the characters Tab and LF.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It's broken up at the linefeeds so it is slightly better readable, but that's for display only. If you press the\n  <code>\n   *\n  </code>\n  \"Define array\" key somewhere inside this, you will see it's indeed a single long array of bytes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The starting address is only repeated for your convenience. \"The\" address of a larger structure is in general the address of its first byte.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you'll hit the plus (\n  <kbd>\n   +\n  </kbd>\n  ) key IDA will spread the structure across multiple lines, displaying extra details about each member of the structure.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
