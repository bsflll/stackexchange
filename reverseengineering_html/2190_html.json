    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  IDAPython is great plugin in IDA. It is so handy to write small script to decode, decrypt or fix (patch) a binary in IDA.  I can just write, load and run a script, and can use\n  <code>\n   print\n  </code>\n  for the usual shotgun debugging. But when I develop a bigger IDAPython script, I need a way to debug it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have searched and found that I can debug IDAPython with\n  <a href=\"http://wingware.com/doc/howtos/idapython\">\n   WingIDE\n  </a>\n  but I want to find another that doesn't require WingIDE. Is there another way to debug IDAPython scripts?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You only need to tell\n  <code>\n   pdb\n  </code>\n  what python code to execute, and it'll spawn a debugger interface similar to\n  <code>\n   gdb\n  </code>\n  , the command line debugger lets you set conditional breakpoints, manipulate and analyze python code, and use most of the usual debugging tools.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Using the python debugging framework\n  </strong>\n  \n\n  the python debugger is built on top of python's\n  <code>\n   bdb\n  </code>\n  (basic debugger), it is a class implementing debugging functionality and can be used from within IDA's python command line. If you're going to use the\n  <code>\n   bdb\n  </code>\n  you'll have to create your own tools and UI around these utilities.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit:\nI saw WingIDE only now. since OP didn't specify what exactly is the issue using WingIDE, I hope at least one of the methods will be relevant.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
