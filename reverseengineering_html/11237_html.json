    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm currently reversing file that is packed with PECompact packer. I'm interested in actual algorithm how it unpacks itself rather than having unpacked file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It uses SEH for modifying program flow. So I would like to ask about SEH.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So what I have:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0Z6fi.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Step 1\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0Z6fi.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I add breakpoint at\n  <code>\n   0x4517E4\n  </code>\n  after I pass exception into app I go here\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0B4eP.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0B4eP.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  It does some code modifications and returns\n  <code>\n   0\n  </code>\n  (\n  <code>\n   ExceptionContinueExecution\n  </code>\n  from\n  <code>\n   EXCEPTION_DISPOSITION\n  </code>\n  enum). It returns to kernel function, but where should execution be continued from, after it goes back into app? I have tried putting breakpoint at\n  <code>\n   0x401016\n  </code>\n  because it is a point where exception occurred and it stopped there, I would like to ask if this is just a coincidence, or it should work this way?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I believe it is related to\n  <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363082%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   EXCEPTION_RECORD\n  </a>\n  structure\n  <code>\n   ExceptionAddress\n  </code>\n  value. Am I right?\n </p>\n <p>\n  So that I really want to know how exception handling determines point, from which program execution should be continued according to different return values from handler function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://www.filedropper.com/8b977be6928c30a5fe3886f6906c9e0fd83e85a75643eee5688c32461a96bcd9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Also file I'm working on can be downloaded here\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I really recommend that you read it because it will explain to you everything about SEH. To answer your question about continuing execution, I will quote one paragraph from the article:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   When the operating system sees that\n   <strong>\n    ExceptionContinueExecution\n   </strong>\n   was\n  returned, it interprets this to mean that you've fixed the problem and\n   <strong>\n    the faulting instruction should be restarted\n   </strong>\n   . Since my _except_handler\n  function tweaked the EAX register to point to valid memory, the MOV\n  EAX,1 instruction works the second time and function main continues\n  normally. See, that wasn't so complicated, was it?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
