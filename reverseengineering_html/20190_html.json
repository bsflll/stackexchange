Appcall mechanism highly depends on the type information\n  of the function to be called. For that reason it is necessary to have\n  a correct function prototype before doing an Appcall, otherwise\n  different or incorrect results may be returned.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  I have an example of using Appcall or rolling your own on my blog\n  <a href=\"https://www.remkoweijnen.nl/blog/2013/04/08/decrypting-dell-vworkspace-pit-files/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
