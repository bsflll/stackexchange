    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have two x86-64 UEFI applications\n  <code>\n   original.efi\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   patched.efi\n  </code>\n  . I want to find out what have been changed in\n  <code>\n   patched.efi\n  </code>\n  and what these changes do.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have tried to use the Radare2 framework to solve this task:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   $ radiff2 original.efi patched.efi\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <pre><code>Buffer truncated to 283136 bytes (1024 not compared)\n0x000000d8 e129 => d52e 0x000000d8\n0x000099d0 35 => 00 0x000099d0\n0x0000eefb 3637 => 3730 0x0000eefb\n0x0000ef03 3031323538 => 3330353136 0x0000ef03\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I have then opened two windows side by side and run radare2 on each file:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   $ radare2 original.efi\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <pre><code>[0x0000a66c] aaa\n[0x0000a66c] s 0x000000d8\n[0x000000d8] pd 10\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   $ radare2 patched.efi\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <pre><code>[0x0000a66c] aaa\n[0x0000a66c] s 0x000000d8\n[0x000000d8] pd 10\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  In this case there is a difference at the address, but it looks like there is something wrong:\n </p>\n <pre><code>0x000000d8    d5           invalid            |     0x000000d8    e129         loope 0x103\n0x000000d9    2e05000a0000 add eax, 0xa00     |     0x000000da    05000a0000   add eax, 0xa00\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However, in many cases I have found that even though radiff2 reports a difference at a memory location, when I try to compare like described above, no differences are found and the lines are identical.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can anyone explain if I'm doing anything wrong or maybe a better way to do this?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unfortunately, I do not have access to a Windows system, so I can only use tools available for Linux.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
