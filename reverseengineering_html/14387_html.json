If the high order bit is set, take only the low 7 bits, and prepend the next byte before that. For example,\n  <code>\n   ac 02\n  </code>\n  :\n </p>\n <pre><code>1010 1100 0000 0011       => remove 1st bit from 1st byte and prepend 2nd byte\n0000 0011 010 1100        => fill a 0 bit from the left and write in standard nibble notation\n0000 0001 1010 1100       => this is 1AC hex, or 428 bytes, which is the length of the note\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  It seems that the length of the file (minus some header) is encoded in the same way starting at position 11. This explains why file\n  <code>\n   9\n  </code>\n  is different: it's the only one short enough to have a length < 0x80 (0x7b), so it needs only one byte here, so everything else is shifted left one byte.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And actually, I guess that the \"first glance\" was wrong; the real length of note 9 is 23 (hex 17), and it consists of 2 lines of 3 unicode characters each (utf-8? This translates those bytes to hebrew characters, or maybe integers in the same encoding as above, yielding unicode code points), ended with a newline, and it's an unfortunate coincidence that the\n  <code>\n   0a\n  </code>\n  newline looks like the length byte for the numbers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, to extract the text, seek to position 11, read a number which can be 1 or 2 bytes according to above, skip one byte which should be\n  <code>\n   12\n  </code>\n  , read the length of 1 or 2 bytes, then read the text. Actually, i suspect that bytes 4 and 5 are some integer as well; so maybe you should start with byte 4 and adjust the offsets depending on whether it has bit 8 set or not.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
