Malware can protect itself against these by running some checks to detect such environments before performing any malicious actions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm looking for ways for a malware analyst to bypass these protections to overcome this anti-VM (anti-hypervisor) stuff?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

There are a myriad of anti-hypervisor and anti-anti-hypervisor techniques. Example: a search for\n <code>\n  CXPInspector\n </code>\n will give you a number of papers (from 5 years ago) that were made into a commercial product. The idea there was to provide introspection into hypervisor guests using shadow page tables (CPU feature!) and knowledge about the system running as guest. No artifacts need to be\n <i>\n  inside\n </i>\n a sandbox created this way. The papers provide a good starting point for own projects.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Then the best way to bypass them is to patch them with some other instructions, so when you run the program there code doesn't get executed.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
