Figured out how to install plugins, but I want to run a script for specific program to help me with the reverse. It seems like I need script loader. Tried installing Ollyscript, but that came up with error for missing .dlls\n </p>\n <p>\n  My question is: Can you please recommend any other script loader for Olly and if possible with installation guide for it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks in advanced.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
