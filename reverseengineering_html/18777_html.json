So, in the command line you used to run the Linux debugging server I would just add the redirection of the file with the inputs for the get, like this:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   $ ./linux_server unlink < your_file\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  For some reason, I never got to work the redirection in parameters with remote debuggers.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
