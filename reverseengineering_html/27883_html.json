    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I want to set a breakpoint at an offset within a file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can do this fine if I launch the app, check where it is loaded with\n  <code>\n   image list testapp\n  </code>\n  and then add the offset of where in the binary I want the breakpoint e.g.:\n </p>\n <pre><code>breakpoint set -a 0x10100cff4\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Is there a way whereby I can set the breakpoint in one go without first checking the offset it is loaded at so that I can automate a task more easily. e.g. something similar to:\n </p>\n <pre><code>breakpoint set -a ((image list -o testapp)+0x100168ff4)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I suspect I could do it with Python however that is not working for me at the moment on Ubuntu so would prefer a way it can be done with lldb commands.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Alternatively, I can add a breakpoint with:\n </p>\n <pre><code>breakpoint set --name function_name\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  but it is only one instruction I want to break on so still need to add an offset to that address as I then have a command that is performed when it is reached and then resumes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
