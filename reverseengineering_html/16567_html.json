Process Hacker iterates over the mapped parts of the processes virtual memory and tries to parse everything it finds as a string.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When you use WinHex to look at your binary, these sections have not been mapped yet and are cramped together into the binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  tl:dr;\n </p>\n <p>\n  Use another program to check for strings (e.g. exe explorer, pe studio, ida, binaryninja, ...), use a debugger to find the strings at the adresses process hacker tells you, or calculate the file offset utilizing the section information.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Could you clarify what you are trying to do?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   edit\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  if you want to find references to strings in code, you are best off utilizing a decent disassembler (binaryninja, radare2, ida pro).
