    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  As the title suggests, I am interested in serializing/deserializing xpc_object_t type objects. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be an official or private API that supports this in a robust fashion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I came accross the private functions:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   xpc_object_t _CFXPCCreateXPCMessageWithCFObject(CFTypeRef)\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   CFTypeRef _CFXPCCreateCFObjectFromXPCMessage(xpc_object_t)\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  To my understanding, these functions should represent exactly what I am looking for. However, the resulting Dictionary is nil, suggesting that the objects can't be serialized. Initially I thought, maybe this does not work for nested Dictionaries. Unfortunatelly, a testcase with a very simple Dictionary resulted in nil as well.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since these are private functions, there does not seem to be any (public) useful information available. Is there anything that I am missing?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Alternatively you could try to identify the library those functions are implemented in and decompile them using Ghidra, IDA or a similar tool.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

All I would like to do is to store an xpc object to a file. I was looking at potential Apple API's because I assumed, that Apple would surely provide such an API.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
