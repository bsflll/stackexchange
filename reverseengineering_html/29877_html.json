One of this files is this:\n </p>\n <p>\n  file.c:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n        char s[15] = \"disassemba\";\n        int x;\n        x=555;\n        printf(\"%d\",x);\n\n        if (x == 2000) {\n                printf(\"You win\");\n        } else {\n                printf(\"You lose\");\n        }\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So i compile with: gcc file.c -o file\n </p>\n <p>\n  open the file with radare: r2 -w file\n </p>\n <p>\n  The commands i use is the following, in radare2, in order:\n </p>\n <pre><code>aaa\ns main\nV\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  in visual mode, i need modify the line of code where sets x=555 to x=2000. So i navigate in visual mode to:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vYZ0N.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vYZ0N.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  And i hit shift+a, but when i try insert\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov dword [var_4h], 0x7D0\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  the file is not patched (no changes in asm code).\n </p>\n <p>\n  any hint?\n </p>\n <p>\n  note:Preferably in some easy way where i can write the code in asm and not in machine code.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So you can:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Use\n   <code>\n    r2 -w\n   </code>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Reopen the file in read-write inside the r2 shell with the\n   <code>\n    oo+\n   </code>\n   command\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Actually, if you do what you said, it shows an error message saying exactly what i said above to do (-w or oo+). Hope that helps\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
