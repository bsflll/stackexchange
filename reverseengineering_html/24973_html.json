For That I modify this code :\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   number_of_rotors is a number between 3 and 6 logically it's will be a loop [3, 4, 5, 6]\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   rotates_amounts is all the possibilities numbers for the originally list ([3, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19, 23])\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  code :\n </p>\n <pre><code>def create_configuration(number_of_rotors, rotates_amounts):\nresult = []\n    for i in range(number_of_rotors):\n    rotor = \"\".join(random.sample(string.ascii_uppercase, 26))\n    rotates_amount = rotates_amounts[i]\n    result.append([rotor, rotates_amount])\nreturn result\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I added The generator function to generate all the possibilities as (i am using itertools): \n  [3,3,3,3,3,3,3],[3,3,3,3,3,5],...\n </p>\n <pre><code>def generators():\nvalues = []\nval = [3, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19, 23]\nfor _set in product(val, repeat=7):\n    values.append(_set)\nreturn values\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  This part of code also generate randomly ascii list :\n </p>\n <pre><code>rotor = \"\".join(random.sample(string.ascii_uppercase, 26))\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So my questions is :\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   I don't know if it's the good approach for this problem ? If people have ideas.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Thank you very much.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
