I was going through a program and noticed that IDA does make some mistakes on what it decides what on its pseudo code will be.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a list of common mistakes by IDA and do you think that it would be possible to get something to a compilable source?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I thought I would test it out on some programs and one thing weird I noticed is that it will do:\n </p>\n <pre><code>v1 = thiscall();\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Where as in source I just have the\n  <code>\n   thiscall();\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I also noticed that it bloats a lot of things which is from the assembly itself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So my questions are:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Is there a list of common IDA mistakes ?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Can once I have worked back fairly close to source will IDA produce a header file ?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Is it possible to get back to a source that I could at least compile code from?\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Its looking like I might be able to providing if I knew the libraries and outline of the program well. Let me know what your thoughts and experiences from using IDA on this subject.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Edit:\n  </strong>\n  I found a project that actually did this. All functions are byte for byte in 100% accuracy. So yes my past self, it is indeed possible.\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/diasurgical/devilution\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://github.com/diasurgical/devilution\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
