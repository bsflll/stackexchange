(BTW I knew that it encrypts string being entered and compares it to the another encrypted string)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Odds are, it's one of the windows API functions that Ahmed mentions in another response.  But, step 1 would be figure out what it's doing, and then using the debugger, just jump OVER that code.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
