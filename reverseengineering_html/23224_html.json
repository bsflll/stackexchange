    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Using\n  <code>\n   radare2\n  </code>\n  , I am reverse engineering a custom language interpreter.  It stores compiled functions as a list of pointers to language primitives.  I would like to\n  <code>\n   seek\n  </code>\n  to these locations, but typing in the hex addresses is very frustrating.  I can't seem to find any syntax for saying \"seek to the address stored at the current location\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  E.g., say I am looking at the following in visual mode:\n </p>\n <pre><code>; UNKNOWN XREFS from entry0 @ 0x400382, 0x400384\n; UNKNOWN XREF from entry0 @ +0x82\n;-- section..text:\n0x004000b0      .qword 0x00000000004002f3 ; aav.0x004002f3    ; [01] -r-x section size 736 named .text\n0x004000b8      .qword 0x0000000000000064\n0x004000c0      .qword 0x0000000000400301 ; aav.0x00400301\n0x004000c8      .qword 0x000000000040032e ; aav.0x0040032e\n0x004000d0      .qword 0x000000000040030c ; aav.0x0040030c\n. . .\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The \"current location\" is at\n  <code>\n   0x004000b0\n  </code>\n  , and it stores the value\n  <code>\n   0x4002f3\n  </code>\n  , which is where I'd like to seek.  For now, I have to type\n  <code>\n   g\n  </code>\n  followed by reading and typing out, or selecting and pasting, the address\n  <code>\n   0x4002f3\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there some efficient way to say \"seek to the value stored at\n  <code>\n   $$\n  </code>\n  \"?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
