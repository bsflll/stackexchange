But when I launched the exe, surprise :\n  <code>\n   We noticed an attempt to crack this program, shutting down..\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm thinking that there's somewhere a call to ReadProcessMemory or a more simple fopen/fread that computes an integrity sum and checks it with an hardcoded value.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What I would like to do, with IDA, is find where these system functions are called. Is this even possible ?\nI tried debugging the application, but there seem to be anti-debugger techniques as the crackme instantly exits.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any suggestion appreciated. I'm using IDA Pro 6.6.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Your best bet is to put a hardware breakpoint (on read) on the address you modified and check what's reading it.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
