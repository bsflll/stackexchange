    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  For the source generated by Hex Ray's decompiler in IDA, is it possible to highlight matching braces once I place the pointer at the beginning of a block?\n </p>\n <p>\n  As an example, in the screenshot below, the\n  <code>\n   if\n  </code>\n  block begins at line#\n  <code>\n   263\n  </code>\n  and ends at line#\n  <code>\n   269\n  </code>\n  . What I want is, if I place the cursor at line#\n  <code>\n   263\n  </code>\n  , IDA should highlight the block end at line#\n  <code>\n   269\n  </code>\n  . Is such a feature available? Many code editors provides similar feature to make code browsing easier for larger blocks of code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SpddM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SpddM.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
