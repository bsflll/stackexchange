I can run it and extract many addresses:\n </p>\n <pre><code>[0x5579ca2e2196]> afl~[0]\n0x5579ca2e2060\n0x5579ca2e4fe0\n0x5579ca2e2090\n0x5579ca2e20c0\n0x5579ca2e2100\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  How do I do run another command on each of those addresses? Let's say I want to print first byte of each of them or set a breakpoint with\n  <code>\n   db\n  </code>\n  on each address.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I read about iteration, but it looks like it only works on flags with something like\n  <code>\n   sym.*\n  </code>\n  , but not on arbitrary outputs, so I can't do this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>p8 1 @@ `some command which produces many addresses`\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I know that I can save output to a file and then use something like\n  <code>\n   p8 1 @@.my_file\n  </code>\n  , but it looks strange that I need to create a file for that.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Basically, I want a way to run a single radare command (possibly with parameters) for every line of output of another radare command.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
