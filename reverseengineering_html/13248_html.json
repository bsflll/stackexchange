Running it again now or manually compiling before execution should yield a relatively short output.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    firmware-mod-kit did not simply fail with \"No supported filesystem found\". It failed with a python error that caused a premature termination of the tool.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    The python error was\n    <code>\n     str() takes at most 1 argument (2 given)\n    </code>\n    , which is an error widely known to come from trying to run python3 code with a python2 interpreter.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
