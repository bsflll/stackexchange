    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I need some help reverse engineering a function in MIPS assembly. It was compiled for the PlayStation 2's\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_Engine\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   EmotionEngine\n  </a>\n  CPU. My goal is to produce a matching decomp of the function; it is the proof-of-concept for a project of mine that I am hoping will get the ball rolling for PS2 decompilation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The function is very simple; it takes two floats,\n  <code>\n   g\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   absLimit\n  </code>\n  , and limits the absolute value of\n  <code>\n   g\n  </code>\n  to\n  <code>\n   absLimit\n  </code>\n  .  Here is the C++ source code I have written so far (not matching):\n </p>\n <pre><code>// Limits the absolute value of g to absLimit\nfloat GLimitAbs(float g, float absLimit)\n{\n    float result = g;\n    if (g > absLimit)\n        result = absLimit;\n    else if (g < -absLimit)\n        result = -absLimit;\n    return result;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://decomp.me/scratch/AbP3I\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Here\n  </a>\n  you can see the target assembly on the left, and the current compiled source on the right. The compiler is\n  <code>\n   ee-gcc 2.96\n  </code>\n  with standard optimization (\n  <code>\n   -O2\n  </code>\n  ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/F9YUZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/F9YUZ.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  As you can see, the target assembly has this confounding pattern of\n  <code>\n   c.lt.s\n  </code>\n  instructions followed by\n  <code>\n   nop\n  </code>\n  s, whereas my code produces\n  <code>\n   c.olt.s\n  </code>\n  instructions sans\n  <code>\n   nop\n  </code>\n  s.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My research has not turned up much as there are very few resources for PS2 reversing. One thing I've learned is that the OLT compare \"\n  <a href=\"https://www.cs.unibo.it/%7Esolmi/teaching/arch_2002-2003/AssemblyLanguageProgDoc.pdf#page=82\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   does not signal an exception for unordered values\n  </a>\n  \" while the LT compare does. However, I don't fully understand what that means or what kind of code pattern would result in one over the other.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there some change to the source that I'm missing that would produce a matching decomp of the function? Or could perhaps the only explanation be that I'm using the wrong compiler/assembler/etc? Any help would be appreciated.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Also OLT is faster than LT. Try compiling with less optimization than O2, and play around with math modes like -ffast-math or its negation.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
