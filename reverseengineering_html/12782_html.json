    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a memory dump of a VM running Windows server 2012 R2. The dump is of the entire RAM (4 GB).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I want to extract as many features as possible from this dump. Mainly I want to extract all stacks of all threads running on the machine and exist in the memory. Alternatively, I want to extract call sequences of all threads.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Are there any tools / tutorials / books etc. which can help me perform this task?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am familiar with both Volatility and Rekall, are there any specific plugins that can help me achieve my goals there?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
