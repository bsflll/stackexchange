This means there are paths listed with offsets and sizes.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Header structure is 64 bytes for the game identification (magic number + a whole lot of 0x00), then a uint32 for total file size, then a uint32 for the offset where the first block of data ends\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Data follows, the first block takes up more than 90% of archive size. This is where the resources have to be located. This seems to be ciphered/encrypted.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   What is left is what I call the \"Resource Table\" - a chain of either 64 or 120 bytes long blocks until the end of file. I believe this is where the paths are registered\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  So far, so good. However, this is where it get's tricky. The first twelve bytes of each of those blocks are readable, they are always three uint32.\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Length of the block including this int (either 64 or 120)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Some offset, this seems to link the blocks in a LinkedList style (actually proved that using a small program I wrote).\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Offset of the last 4 bytes of this block.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  And this is where I'm currently stuck, since the rest seems to be encrypted/ciphered data. I dumped the data from the 64 and 120 long blocks seperately, without those twelve \"header\" bytes. Each block is seperated by line break.\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"http://paste.ubuntu.com/25247256/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Long Blocks\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <a href=\"http://paste.ubuntu.com/25247255/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    Small Blocks\n   </a>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Now there are obviously some repeated patterns here, so I'm thinking that it might be some XOR-ish cipher, though I haven't been able to figure out a key or even a structure.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   What I expect to find in this data\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Two uint32, offset and size\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   A string path\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Unused space filled with 0x00\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Also, I know that these (partial) strings should be in there somewhere in some way or another (got those from the executable):\n </p>\n <pre><code>data\n../../../data/g\ng/img/inv_Lf._img\ng/img/inv_Rt._img\ng/img/inv_All._img\ng/img/mcUse._img\ng/img/mcTalk._img\ng/img/mcTake._img\ng/img/mcLook._img\ng/img/mcArrow._img\ng/img/fntOtherSpeakers._img\ng/img/fntBig._img\ng/img/fntWhite._img\ng/img/fntYellow._img\ng/img/fntGray._img\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  That is all I have been able to figure out up to now. Any help in figuring this out would be\n  <em>\n   much\n  </em>\n  appreciated!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you for your time!\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   EDIT:\n  </strong>\n  Posted the binary in the comments\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Since you did not make the binary available, the only option is making guesses based on eyeballing the ASCII hex dumps of the long and small blocks.
