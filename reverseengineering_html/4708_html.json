I cannot really contact the business that is using the app as they will not tell me where it was made ,as they are a small business , who would not want to give away such info...i have dissamebled the code and had a look through using the beta of Android  stuido , but nothing really in there , is there a particular part of the libarys that might contain the info ?!?</span>",
