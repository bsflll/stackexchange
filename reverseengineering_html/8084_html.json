I wrangled with Microsoft's LIB tool to make a suitable import lib from a .def file for a few functions but now IDA says 'not IDA DLL file'...\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, is there a .DEF file or a VC++ import lib for IDA 5.0 free?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Now the plugin works perfectly fine in IDA 5.0 free... Without the fix, the build stops with the following message:\n </p>\n <pre><code>error C2370: 'PLUGIN' : redefinition; different storage class\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The problem of obtaining a decent .DEF or .LIB still remains, though. Reversing the WLL to identify the functions behind the ordinals is a bit cumbersome and slow going... There are plugins for IDA free around, so the libs must be out there somewhere (unless they were got under a gag agreement).\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   UPDATE\n  </strong>\n  : for VC++ there's a much easier way to accomplish the same thing, without evil macro trickery:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#pragma comment (linker, \"/export:PLUGIN=_PLUGIN\")\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  or simply\n </p>\n <pre><code>#pragma comment (linker, \"/export:_PLUGIN\")\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  since the leading underscore seems to get stripped automatically.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
