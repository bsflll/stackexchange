When it comes to renaming a subroutine in IDA it can be achieved either using idc scripts or by using idapython.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Although renaming class methods in IDA automatically can be a tough task because you have to provide much more information to IDA such as object-name, calling conventions etc. However, a more general occurrence of a subroutine can easily be renamed using idc script.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have provided a script below which can solve this problem. Although it can be modified to extract the subroutine offset\n  <code>\n   B00BA\n  </code>\n  from\n  <code>\n   sub_B00BA\n  </code>\n  and rename (or rather append) to a name of your liking, but I left that approach so that this script can more flexible (i.e you can change to any name and not just\n  <code>\n   SomeSubName_Offset\n  </code>\n  ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  idc script:\n  <code>\n   rename_method.idc\n  </code>\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <idc.idc>\n\nstatic main(void)\n{\n    auto ea, fncname, fstatus=-1;\n    auto findsub=\"sub_B00BA\";           // [1] Subroutine to find\n    auto newsubName=\"CMyClass__B00BA\" ; // [2] New name for the subroutine \n    for (ea=MinEA(); ea != BADADDR; ea=NextFunction(ea))\n    {\n        fncname = GetFunctionName(ea);                \n        if (fncname == findsub) \n        {\n            auto errcode = MakeNameEx(ea, newsubName, SN_PUBLIC|SN_CHECK|SN_NOWARN);\n            if (errcode)\n            {\n                Refresh();\n                RefreshLists();\n                Message(\"[*] disassembly/subroutine-list refreshed..ok\n\");\n            }\n            fstatus=1;\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n        if (fstatus == -1)  // if we don't have such function in disassembly\n        {\n            Message(\"[*] subroutine:\" + findsub +\n            \" not found.\nplease check name of the subroutine/method again.\n\");\n        }\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Please make sure you change subroutine name at [1] and [2]. I have tested this script using IDA 6.6 and it will definitely work with IDA 7.x.\n  </em>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
