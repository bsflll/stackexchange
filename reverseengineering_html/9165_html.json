    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  After using IDA analysing a dll file, I replaced a call with another one. That is, replacing\n  <code>\n   CALL xxxx\n  </code>\n  with\n  <code>\n   CALL ds:yyyy\n  </code>\n  . (\n  <code>\n   ds:yyyy\n  </code>\n  has been referenced by other locations already). And I used IDA to patch the binary.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But the problem is, when executing the module,\n  <code>\n   ds:yyyy\n  </code>\n  is not updated based on the module imagebase, and therefore an invalid address.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How can I deal with this kind of situation? Need I patch the reloc section too?\nThanks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
