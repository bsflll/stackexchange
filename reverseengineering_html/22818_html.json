You'll have to compare these word values against a running game to find out what they represent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finding the bitmap text \"D.P. Gray 1994\" in the map leads me to believe you are looking at\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitemare_3D\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   Nitemare 3D\n  </a>\n  , and with that information you can find\n  <em>\n   several\n  </em>\n  map editors, such as the one at\n  <a href=\"http://wolf3d.darkbb.com/t1981-nitemare-3d-mapeditor\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   http://wolf3d.darkbb.com/t1981-nitemare-3d-mapeditor\n  </a>\n  , which conveniently also tells you the same details I describe above (do note that that post is from 2011).\n </p>\n <p>\n  <sup>\n   It took me less than 5 minutes to recognize \"the format\", and another 5 or so to google \"D.P. Gray 1994\".\n  </sup>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
