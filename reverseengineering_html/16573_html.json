I also found that it couldn't sample it fast enough for such a short program.\n  <em>\n   oprofile\n  </em>\n  seemed to have a similar issue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I used\n  <em>\n   radare2\n  </em>\n  to generate a call-graph of the executable, but that created the full call-graph and was independent of any arguments/execution, nor does it give exact positions of the instructions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'd like to use this tool to compare the execution of two binaries i.e. show the difference in execution between ./gcd 5 10 and ./gcd 128 24\n </p>\n <p>\n  Does a tool like this exist?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

PIN from Intel is one example of a framework which allows you to make tracing tools. It uses\n  <em>\n   dynamic binary instrumentation\n  </em>\n  to achieve reasonable speeds and you can likely use one of the examples shipped with the library with little or no modification. Many debuggers also support instruction trace recording (usually by software stepping every instruction which is rather slow but generally reliable). Some may even have support for\n  <em>\n   differential debugging\n  </em>\n  which records several executions and shows differences between them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you have a recent Intel CPU, you may be able to take advantage of\n  <a href=\"http://halobates.de/blog/p/410\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Intel Processor Trace (PT)\n  </a>\n  with\n  <code>\n   perf\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
