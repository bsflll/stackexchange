    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  When I define data as a structure with IDAPython, it appears in IDA View in a collapsed view. Out of curiosity,\n  <strong>\n   is it possible to\n   <em>\n    programmatically\n   </em>\n   expand the view of the structure?\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  For example, if I run\n  <code>\n   MakeStructEx(0x400000, -1, \"IMAGE_DOS_HEADER\")\n  </code>\n  , I see:\n </p>\n <pre><code>IMAGE_DOS_HEADER <5A4Dh, 90h, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0FFFFh, 0, 0B8h, 0, 0, 0, \\\n                  40h, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0E0h>\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  But I would like to see:\n </p>\n <pre><code>dw 5A4D                ; e_magic\ndw 90h                 ; e_cblp\ndw 3                   ; e_cp\ndw 0                   ; e_crlc\n... (lines removed) ...\ndd 0E0h                ; e_lfanew\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I am using IDA 6.2.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I think that it should work in IDA 6.2 too.
