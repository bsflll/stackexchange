    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I would like to automate a process of enabling buttons with\n  <code>\n   cond bp\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  First, I found that function\n  <code>\n   user32.EnableWindow\n  </code>\n  is called from\n  <code>\n   mfc110u.dll\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I went there and set\n  <code>\n   cond bp\n  </code>\n  on the second arg of the function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This\n  <code>\n   arg2==0\n  </code>\n  when you want the button to be disabled and\n  <code>\n   arg2==1\n  </code>\n  when enabled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So what I did ?\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   I set\n   <code>\n    cond bp\n   </code>\n   with condition\n   <code>\n    [EBP+8]==0\n   </code>\n   and now want to run something like this each time the bp is hit:\n   <strong>\n    A (EBP+8) DD 1\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   I downloaded the plugin\n   <code>\n    CLBPlus!\n   </code>\n   and for this plugin is identifier CLBP so final command become:\n   <strong>\n    CLBP A (EBP+8) DD 1\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  But for some reason this does not work. Maybe the command A is not implemented. I downloaded the two another plugins \"Command Line v1.10\" and \"Command Bar v3.20.110\" but unfortunately I do not know the identifiers for these plugings.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So any ideas ?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Now I tried it again and hopefuly it seems working. In olly command line when I wrote\n  <strong>\n   A (EBP+8) DD 1\n  </strong>\n  I saw it worked. The syntax for script is\n  <strong>\n   asm eip, \"mov eax, ecx\"\n  </strong>\n  , so I tried to write\n  <strong>\n   asm (ebp+8), \"dd 1\"\n  </strong>\n  , but did not work. So I tried\n  <strong>\n   asm ebp+8, \"dd 1\"\n  </strong>\n  and it seems working. I put conditional breakpoints manualy and constructed this nice dirty code:\n </p>\n <p>\n  START:\nasm ebp+8, \"dd 1\"\nrun\njmp START\n </p>\n <p>\n  it works nicely. Thanx for the tip again\"!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
