    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  In some of my IDA scripts, it would be useful to be able to reason about which variables were stored in which registers at a given place in the program. One example is the following:\n  <code>\n   mov     rdx, [rbp+client]\nmov     rax, [rbp+channel]\nmov     rsi, rdx\nmov     rdi, rax\ncall    sub_41002D\n  </code>\n  It would be useful if I could deduce that, at the time when sub_41002D is called, rdi contains the variable called \"channel\" and rsi contains the variable \"client\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there any IDA scripting feature which allows me to do this, or will I need to roll my own solution? If so, is there a name for what I'm trying to do? Do algorithms for this already exist? Any pointers would be appreciated.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
