But consider memory layout alone, ASLR, randomly created base addresses for DLLs on Windows (and that's just the usermode view of the memory). On Windows, all \"Windows subsystem\" processes are registered with the subsystem at startup. Intel PT (the mentioned underlying CPU feature) probably doesn't need <i>everything</i>. But it needs a meaningful subset and the help of the OS/debugger to facilitate collection. Intel PT <i>does</i> allow that sort of revival. What I wrote was that a <i>memory dump</i> alone isn't sufficient. You need something like Intel PT.</span>",
