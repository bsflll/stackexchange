It showed something like below.\n </p>\n <pre><code>for ( i = 0; i < 6; ++i )\n{\n  v7 = (int)&val_253;                         \n  for ( k = 1; k < key[i]; ++k )\n    v7 = *(_DWORD *)(v7 + 8);\n  v4[i] = v7;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I can't understand what is happening in\n  <code>\n   v7 = *(_DWORD *)(v7 + 8);\n  </code>\n  line. After executing this line the value of v7 changes from\n  <code>\n   0xC\n  </code>\n  . I can't understand how it happens. I thought the value should change from\n  <code>\n   0x8\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  And I thought\n  <code>\n   *(_DWORD *)\n  </code>\n  should return a value. But instead, it returns another pointer. How is that happened (The both values of the memory,\n  <code>\n   0xc\n  </code>\n  away from\n  <code>\n   &val_253\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   0x8\n  </code>\n  away from\n  <code>\n   &val_253\n  </code>\n  are zero).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
