After copy, I added the mp4 extension to the newly copied file. As a result, the new mp4 file cannot be opened even though it has the same content as the old file, so what did I miss when copying it, a header for example?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Opening and saving binary file in a text editor very often ends up in changes to the content because of charset de-/encoding. Why don't you simply copy the file? If you want to manually edit a file use a hex editor.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

If you want to copy mp4 or any binary non-printable content as if it was a text file then the closest option is to open the file using a hex editor (ex. HxD for Windows), instead of a text editor like Notepad++.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This will not help if the file is damaged in any way.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
