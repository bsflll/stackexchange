It relied on a plug-in framework, and the order in which the plug-ins were acquired changed the behavior of the resulting variant.  We didn't require a name for that.There were viruses going back to DOS days, such as BadBoy, which changed the order of their subroutines so affect the appearance of the layout, but the call flow remained the same.  We call those \"block-swapping\" viruses.</span>",
