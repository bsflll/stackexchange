(there are 56 unique chars with the few given examples, so it's a fair bet).\n </p>\n <p>\n  After that, it's \"just\" a substitution cipher. Having a plaintext/ciphertext couple would tremendously help. Otherwise, if the plaintext has enough constraints (only digits/uppercase as you might hint?), you'll have to guess enough about the plaintext (most propable tuples, etc) until you're able to bruteforce it.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you'd like a little more information, there's a paper that describes this sort of thing at\n  <a href=\"https://security.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/Obfuscation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   https://security.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/Obfuscation.pdf\n  </a>\n  .
