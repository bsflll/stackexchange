    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm a newbie to reverse engineering, so pardon my ignorance. I am trying to extract the complete filesystem from a Netgear router's firmware. Using\n  <code>\n   binwalk\n  </code>\n  , I was able to extract the kernel and a\n  <code>\n   squashfs\n  </code>\n  file system. So far so good. The issue is that the file system is incomplete. Many directories (e.g.\n  <em>\n   /etc\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <em>\n   /mnt\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <em>\n   /var\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <em>\n   /www\n  </em>\n  ) are only symbolic links to non-existent directories in\n  <em>\n   /tmp\n  </em>\n  , which itself is empty.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm guessing that (as I've seen on other routers) the contents of\n  <em>\n   /tmp\n  </em>\n  will be another filesystem that is created on startup and stored in RAM. Am I correct? And is there some way of determining the contents of the temporary filesystem from the firmware?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The tmp folder is generally a ramfs, which is mounted from rc with the following line:\n   \n\n  </p>\n  <pre><code>mount(\"ramfs\", \"/tmp\", \"ramfs\", MS_MGC_VAL, NULL);\n</code></pre>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
