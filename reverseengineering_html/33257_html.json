They just have to be present (loaded) when the native method is called. I would first check the .so files for exported methods that match the JNI method naming scheme (start with\n <code>\n  Java_\n </code>\n and the package and class name). Note that AFAIK it is also possible to define native methods in an .so e.g. in\n <code>\n  JNI_OnLoad\n </code>\n , therefore native method implementations are not always exported functions.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
