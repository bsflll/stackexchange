You'll have to use WinDbg.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You need to set IFEO Debugger for your process name to run CDB\n  <strong>\n   as server\n  </strong>\n  (e.g.\n  <code>\n   cdb.exe -server tcp:port=12345 -noio\n  </code>\n  ) and the run WinDbg as a client and connect to your server (\n  <code>\n   windbg.exe -remote tcp:server=localhost,port=12345\n  </code>\n  ).\n </p>\n <p>\n  You'll probably want to change the\n  <code>\n   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\ServicesPipeTimeout\n  </code>\n  Registry value to be a bit longer. This is the time the SCM waits for a service it runs to talk to it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you don't have to debug the initialization you can simply attach to the service after it starts, and then you can use ollydbg.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All of this and pretty much everything you need to know is documented under the MSDN page titled\n  <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff540613(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Debugging a Service Application\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Edit:\n  </em>\n  If patching the binary is possible you can add an infinite loop in the entry point like\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/users/1876/gandolf\">\n   gandolf\n  </a>\n  suggested and then attach a debugger after you log in.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or, if the binary doesn't do any SEH tricks that interfere with it: Add an exception to the entry point (0xCC - int 3 is the obvious choice), set\n  <code>\n   AeDebug\n  </code>\n  to a long running process (such as\n  <code>\n   notepad.exe\n  </code>\n  ) and then attach a debugger. This is what\n  <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0735662789\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Inside Windows Debugging\n  </a>\n  proposes (p. 139).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Or, what's even easier and makes even more sense: Add the same INT3, and set\n  <code>\n   AeDebug\n  </code>\n  to the same\n  <code>\n   cdb.exe\n  </code>\n  command-line as you would put in IFEO and connect WinDbg to it after you log in.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
