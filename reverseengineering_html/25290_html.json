    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to break execution when a string is loaded in memory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can´t find the string by using the\n  <code>\n   search for -> string references\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I press\n  <code>\n   Alt + M\n  </code>\n  and press\n  <code>\n   Ctrl + B\n  </code>\n  to search my string once is loaded, I can see it.\nI try to right click on the address and set a hardware breakpoint but the software closes as soon as that string is shown so it doesn't break on the next run.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How can I set a condition so if a string appears a break happens?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried\n  <code>\n   shift + F4\n  </code>\n  like with ollydbg and then I try to create an expression like this\n  <code>\n   UNICODE[EAX] == \"myString\"\n  </code>\n  but it says\n  <code>\n   invalid expression...\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I also tried the same expression using traceInto, but it definitely is not matching for the string, because I can't see it int he dump and even if I compare with a huge string, it doesn't do anything at all.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any suggestions or ideas?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
