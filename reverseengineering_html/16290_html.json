    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I was searching through my routers admin page some time ago and I've noticed that it doesn't support firmware updates by the user(\n  <em>\n   it's an ISP's\n   <strong>\n    speedport entry 2i\n   </strong>\n   router(zte variant)\n  </em>\n  ). So long story short, after searching through tons of forum comments about that particular model, I've figured that I could probably reverse engineer its firmware(that \"they\"[isp guys] for some reason have available for download at their website) and check how the updates are delivered, a way to disable tr 069 etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Having no experience with reverse engineering I've used google to find some kind of tutorial that would get me started and I kinda did.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So after reading a few things about every tool referred there I figured I could probably do it.\nBut my firmware wasn't like the one at the example(not sure if it's easier or harder though) so after trying some other things that I thought might work I hit a dead end. Here is a\n  <a href=\"https://mega.nz/#!ScBQQJBI!9yC8jr96WijP1BlJkrjheT7z2mNHjiS8XSpVsmY-_yY\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   link\n  </a>\n  with all the files I've got so far in case someone want to check them out and maybe point me to the right direction or even try it him/her-self. I would also love any pro-tip in general.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Binwalk gives me the following output\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hyIyJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"this\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hyIyJ.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  so after I found a way to extract the lzma archive I got these 2 files that I don't know how to approach (.7z file is an lzma archive but I've tried unpacking it with binwalk without any luck). I am probably missing something due to the lack of knowledge on the subject, so if any of you out there can help me, please do.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you in advance for your time :)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

On the board you can notice 4 not mounted pins. You'll have to solder the pins there probably. I assumed this is UART, unfortunately it doesn't seem to work, when I connected to it before powering up, the device won't even start. If connected when powered up, nothing gets transmitted. The pins are connected to pins marked as TEST on the PCB. As Gogeta70 mentioned, using bus pirate with SPI sniffer it's possible to read FW from Flash. Device has GD5F1GQ4UAYIG NAND Flash memory (at least mine has). I'll update when my bus pirate arrives.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is picture of the PCB, for anyone interested.\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VnyJL.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Speedport Entry 2i PCB\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VnyJL.jpg\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The serial port works fine, yet the cfe bootloaded seems locked (while is booting dosen't give you the opportunity to stop the process). After the boot process they did provide a shell but they ask for login credentials. Which still don't know.\nI took a look at the firmware update. Extracting from the jffs2 partition didn't work very well for me. I see the formal linux structure (etc, root, bin ..) yet the only folder having files is the /bin which is not particular useful. Did anyone had any success extracting the /etc folder ?\nMy guess at this point is that a nand flash dump is the way to proceed or a exploit in the web ui that can give us root and continue for there.\n </p>\n <p>\n  that the boot log:\n </p>\n <pre><code>----\nBTL1\nV1.1\nCPUI\nL1CI\nPMCI\nPMCS\nAFEL\nPWRZ\nMEML\nPMCD\nCPUI\nL1CI\nZBSS\nCODE\nDATA\nL12F\nMAIN\nOTP?\nMFGZ\nOTPP\nUSBT\nSNAN\nPASS\n----\nHELO\nCPUI\nL1CI\n4.1602-1.0.38-116.118\nPMCI\nPMCM\nDRAM\n----\nPHYS\nPHYE\nDDR1\n400H\nSIZ4\nLMBE\nRACE\nPASS\n----\nZBSS\nCODE\nDATA\nL12F\nMAIN\nMGIC\nRAM1\n\n\nBase: 4.16_02\nCFE version 1.0.38-116.118 for BCM963381 (32bit,SP,BE)\nBuild Date: Thu Nov 16 19:47:34 CST 2017 (xialei@localhost.localdomain)\nCopyright (C) 2000-2013 Broadcom Corporation.\n\nChip ID: BCM63381B0, MIPS: 600MHz, DDR: 400MHz, Bus: 300MHz\nMain Thread: TP0\nTotal Memory: 134217728 bytes (128MB)\nBoot Address: 0xb8000000\n\nSPI NAND flash device: Winbond W25N01GV, id 0xefaa block 128KB size 131072KB\npmc_init:PMC using DQM mode\nboard_device_init, set not used GPIO to 0 OK!\nInfo: get a version head, the integrality is OK!\nInfo: start_block:[120],kernel_magic_head at :[120], i:[257],ver_blocks:[137]\nInfo: get a version head, the integrality is OK!\nInfo: start_block:[288],kernel_magic_head at :[288], i:[425],ver_blocks:[137]\n\nEntering norm mode ...\nInfo: start_block:120\nInfo: bad blocks before fs:0\nInfo: pL->dwFsStartPhyAddr:10a0000\nInfo: pL->fs_len:f80000\npara->BootParaCksum=0001e693\nDecompression OK!\nEntry at 0x803976c0\nStarting program at 0x803976c0\nLinux version 3.4.11-rt19 (xialei@localhost.localdomain) (gcc version 4.6.2 (Buildroot 2011.11) ) #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Mar 19 17:38:03 CST 2018\n963381REF2 prom init\nCheck boot para cksum...\nboot para cksum OK!\n********************BOOT INFO**************************\nversion_sum:             :      2\nversion_nummax:          :      2\ndwCurrVersionIndex:      :      0\ndwBackVersionIndex:      :      1\n\ndwVersionStartPhyAddr   0:      f00000\ndwHeadRealPhyAddr       0:      2020000\ndwIsCurrentVersion      0:      1\ndwVersionIsBad          0:      0\n\ndwVersionStartPhyAddr:  1:      2400000\ndwHeadRealPhyAddr:      1:      3520000\ndwIsCurrentVersion:     1:      0\ndwVersionIsBad          1:      0\n******************************************************\npdt_verinfo_init: tcVerInfo->RunMode[3]\nbootPara.bootWhichImg=0\nbootPara.img_info_tbl[0].flashOffset=0x       0\nsHardVersion=V1.0\nbootPara.runmode=3\nCPU revision is: 0002a081 (Broadcom BMIPS4350)\nDSL SDRAM reserved: 0x132000\nDetermined physical RAM map:\n memory: 07ece000 @ 00000000 (usable)\nInitrd not found or empty - disabling initrd\nZone PFN ranges:\n  DMA      0x00000000 -> 0x00001000\n  Normal   0x00001000 -> 0x00007ece\nMovable zone start PFN for each node\nEarly memory PFN ranges\n    0: 0x00000000 -> 0x00007ece\nOn node 0 totalpages: 32462\nfree_area_init_node: node 0, pgdat 804b1750, node_mem_map 81000000\n  DMA zone: 32 pages used for memmap\n  DMA zone: 0 pages reserved\n  DMA zone: 4064 pages, LIFO batch:0\n  Normal zone: 222 pages used for memmap\n  Normal zone: 28144 pages, LIFO batch:7\nPERCPU: Embedded 7 pages/cpu @81103000 s5632 r8192 d14848 u32768\npcpu-alloc: s5632 r8192 d14848 u32768 alloc=8*4096\npcpu-alloc: [0] 0 [0] 1 \nBuilt 1 zonelists in Zone order, mobility grouping on.
