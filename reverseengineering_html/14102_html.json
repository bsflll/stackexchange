I have extracted out said assets from the game package, they are in formats of\n  <code>\n   .json\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   .png\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   .lua\n  </code>\n  . However, they are encrypted. Inspecting the files in hex view, I noticed something particularly interesting: all of their bytes start with\n  <code>\n   4448 4741 4d45 53\n  </code>\n  , which in ascii corresponds to the publisher of the game.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   What I have done\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Ran a\n    <code>\n     strings\n    </code>\n    command on the game binary to extract all the strings out, one of which should be the decryption key\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    Wrote a python script to try each of the possible keys on these encrypted assets using AES, XXTEA and XOR. The key is validated if the decryption result is a valid json/lua text file.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Usually these two steps alone would find me the key for many other games, but this time to no avail.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What other steps can I do to try to decrypt these assets statically without having to gdb into runtime?\n </p>\n <p>\n  ** The link to assets can be found here\n  <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7pqhvpsa0ems0q9/AAA8lHrudeix3hJ0Rz2tXPSxa?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7pqhvpsa0ems0q9/AAA8lHrudeix3hJ0Rz2tXPSxa?dl=0\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Remember the encryption key might be any binary byte sequence as well, or even generated on runtime, so you can't really assume to find it using\n  <code>\n   strings\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
