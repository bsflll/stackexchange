Unfortunately, I wasted several hours but still couldn't make it working with gdbserver. Here are the steps I'm following:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Note that, I actually need to attach the GDB, I can't run the program using GDB for several reasons.\n  </em>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   I run\n   <code>\n    hopper-gdb-server-v3\n   </code>\n   . As far as I can see it's not possible to pass any parameters to this, it just doesn't care about arguments. So I think there's nothing to do wrong here.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   I run\n   <code>\n    hopper-v3\n   </code>\n   and opening the ELF binary I want to reverse.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   I'm running\n   <code>\n    Show debugger screen\n   </code>\n   and it wants me to choose GDB server. Unfortunately, the list is always empty.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I am stuck at this point. Basically I can't select the\n  <code>\n   hopper-gdb-server-v3\n  </code>\n  in the Hopper itself. I cannot see any documentation in its webpage.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can anyone help me with this?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you can't get it to work I suggest you contact the developper, he's usually quite responsive. Also I don't think it's currently possible to attach to a running program.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
