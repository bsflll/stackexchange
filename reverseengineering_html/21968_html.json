    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm using Termux(root) on LineageOS 16 (Android 9) with radare2 (v3.6.0 linux-arm32). When i attach to a process with 'r2 -d pid' the app freezes properly but doesn't continue with 'dc'. I'm not sure in which condition the debugger is exactly but when i try to step in code (F7/F8 in visual) some errors are flickering (SIGILL somewhat..). The Zygote instance (we are connected to) seems to be corrupted by r2.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On IDA you attach the remote debugger (android_server) to the pid and you'll land somewhere in the code, can set breakpoints, continue execution and so on. I'm trying to achieve the same with r2.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How is it meant to be done to debug Android native code with radare2 at runtime (dynamic analysis)?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I wanted to observe a static initializing library loading (step through the JNI_OnLoad function), so I set the app as debug application and told the OS to wait for the debugger. After launching the app, I attach gdbserver and connect to it with r2. Then I do <code>dc</code>, but the app is still frozen and I don't get my prompt back in r2.</span>",
