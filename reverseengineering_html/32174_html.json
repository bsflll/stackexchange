This doesn't happen merely with this byte: a lot of others in the\n  <code>\n   .got\n  </code>\n  are wrong. However, the\n  <code>\n   .text\n  </code>\n  section is completely correct.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It also doesn't happen only with these flags: doing\n  <code>\n   objdump -d -s test | less\n  </code>\n  shows the same bytes wrong in the same place.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm willing to provide the binary: it is a simple\n  <code>\n   printf\n  </code>\n  for me to play with.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Edit: Here is the full contents from the\n  <code>\n   .got\n  </code>\n  , obtained with\n  <code>\n   objdump -d -s test | less\n  </code>\n </p>\n <pre><code>Contents of section .got:\n 3fb0 c03d0000 00000000 00000000 00000000  .=..............\n 3fc0 00000000 00000000 30100000 00000000  ........0.......\n 3fd0 40100000 00000000 00000000 00000000  @...............\n 3fe0 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000  ................\n 3ff0 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000  ................\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And here are the bytes at the same offset, as obtained from xxd:\n </p>\n <pre><code>xxd -s 0x3fb0 -l 0x50 test\n00003fb0: b03f 0000 0000 0000 b02f 0000 0000 0000  .?......./......\n00003fc0: 5000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  P...............\n00003fd0: 0800 0000 0000 0000 0800 0000 0000 0000  ................\n00003fe0: 0601 0000 0100 0000 0300 0000 0000 0000  ................\n00003ff0: 0040 0000 0000 0000 0030 0000 0000 0000  .@.......0......\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Why are the values different?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
