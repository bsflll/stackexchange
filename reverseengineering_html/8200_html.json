I was able to use GDB to change the memory values being stored for the PIN to the reverse, and when I run the program it works as intended. The only issue is that I can't save these changes to the executable. Once I exit the debugger it reverts to normal. I've tried using \"set write on\" and \"gdb -write \" before making changes, but the changes still wouldn't stick. Does anyone know if what I'm tyring to do is even possible, or where I might be going wrong?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

In Vim you can edit hex by typing \":%!xxd\" followed by \":%!xxd -r\" when finished. I guess I will stick with Vim for editing and GDB for debugging. Thanks for the help.</span>",

This allows me to revert to the original easily if i mess something up. Of course, use the workflow that fits your need best :)</span>",
