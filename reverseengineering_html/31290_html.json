I also tried getting the oldest version of the game available on apkpure, to see changes, unfortunately they are obfuscated+encrypted. As for for the link you've sent, it might be useful in the future but sadly i cant find the xxxtea decryption key. Im new to this domain\n</span>\n</body></html>",

Short after this, I realized that this game has plenty of stuff server side, so I couldnt do anything 'edgy' like changing my fightpower, diamonds, tickets, even if I was to send some hacky net message, server would check, i mean fair enough.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried bypassing the payment request, that i saw while looking through lua files (PayCallBackModelEntity.lua)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyways, I think i'm dropping this, can't do much, was a great opportunity for me to learn though :)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
