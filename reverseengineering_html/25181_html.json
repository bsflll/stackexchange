Normally this is used to go back from a function to where the function was called, as the address of the next instruction was pushed into the stack by the\n  <code>\n   CALL\n  </code>\n  instruction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However,\n  <code>\n   RET\n  </code>\n  can be misused: a\n  <code>\n   PUSH\n  </code>\n  before a\n  <code>\n   RET\n  </code>\n  instruction is a typical obfuscation technique. In this case, when executing the\n  <code>\n   RET\n  </code>\n  , instead of coming back to the caller function, it behaves like a jump to the previously pushed address. This is not something your decompiler expects, which may result in a jump to a memory zone that hasn't been decompiled or has been incorrectly decompiled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   PUSH PUSH RET\n  </code>\n  can be used to implement a\n  <code>\n   CALL\n  </code>\n  as you mention. In that case, the first\n  <code>\n   PUSH\n  </code>\n  pushes the return address into the stack (the one after the\n  <code>\n   RET\n  </code>\n  ). The second\n  <code>\n   PUSH\n  </code>\n  pushes the function address. The\n  <code>\n   RET\n  </code>\n  (as explained before) jumps to the function address (and removes this address from the stack). When the function address executes its\n  <code>\n   RET\n  </code>\n  , it jumps back to the address currently located on the stack (the one of the first\n  <code>\n   PUSH\n  </code>\n  ), coming back to the caller of the function. Note though that this is not your case. In your case the first address pushed is not in the current function. This means that this is not implementing a\n  <code>\n   CALL\n  </code>\n  . Most likely this it is used as an obfuscation technique, making more complicated to follow the calls and maybe tricking your disassembly to show you the code incorrectly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also, note that executing a\n  <code>\n   PUSH\n  </code>\n  doesn't lead you anywhere. It just pushes the address into the stack. It is the\n  <code>\n   RET\n  </code>\n  instruction which actually jumps to the last pushed address. This also means that the second pushed address is visited before the first one. This means that the code you are looking for is reached from\n  <code>\n   A4DB49\n  </code>\n  (the first address to which\n  <code>\n   RET\n  </code>\n  jumps) that is another\n  <code>\n   JUMP\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  I recommend you to check the Anti-Disassembly chapter of the\n  <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B007ED2XDS\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   Practical Malware Analysis Book\n  </a>\n  , where this kind of techniques are covered in detail and with examples.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
