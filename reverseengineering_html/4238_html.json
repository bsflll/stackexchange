If the archiving data structure was properly designed, in the header you must find either the start offset & the size or the start & end offsets of each file entry in the header, unless the files are all stored one after the other. In that latter case all you need to know is the start offset of each file because (suppose file0 comes first, followed by file1) file1's start offset is file0's end offset.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The example below shows the latter case :\n </p>\n <pre><code>  Offset00:file0\n  Offset10:file1\n  Offset30:file2\n  Offset35:file3\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Most file formats have their size specified in the header somewhere. That would allow you to carve the file from the archive, without even knowing the archive structure.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is what tools like\n  <code>\n   scalpel\n  </code>\n  are doing to carve files. They match the header to a known file type, and then lookup the file size in that header.\nSome file formats have specific endings which you could also use to carve them out (for example, every\n  <code>\n   png\n  </code>\n  file has\n  <code>\n   IEND\n  </code>\n  and the end).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Try your luck with\n  <code>\n   scalpel\n  </code>\n  and similar file carving tools.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Anyway, knowing the <i>supposed</i> file size ties nicely in to yaspr's answer of how and where to locate the archive's own metadata.</span>",
