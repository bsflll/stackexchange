For background: this software will communicate with an external server in order to determine if the boot sequence should continue or not.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My current understanding is as follow\n  \n\n  UEFI/BIOS ->\n  <strong>\n   Pre-boot environment\n  </strong>\n  -> Windows(after booting)\n </p>\n <p>\n  I found that the pre-boot environment operates using the so called \"mini kernel\". Is it true and is this mini-kernel the same Windows kernel with just limited stuff enabled?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Are you talking about\n <code>\n  bootmgfw.efi\n </code>\n which to my understanding\n <i>\n  does\n </i>\n run in the context of the UEFI ... or what is it you mean? There is something called minwin, but I think it's related to WinPE not the early boot stages.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

I am talking about the phase that operates Bitlocker, which must run from a bare bone disk partition (unencrypted), with enough drivers to operate. Once it decrypted the main c: it \"pivots\" to the \"real\" Windows kernel (with full drivers). This is analogous to the initramfs booting step in Linux. But it is likely very different hence my request to find information.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
