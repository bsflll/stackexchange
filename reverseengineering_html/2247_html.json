I spent a good day mapping trace by trace, node by node but still some node connections wouldn't make sense. I know designers use software to reroute PCB traces, making them compact and planar, also render them hard to decipher.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was wondering if there is any software that helps me translate single sided PCB traces with components to schematics?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
