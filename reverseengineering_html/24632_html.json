I'm new to reversing software and to hooking, so I may have missed something big here.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm trying to use this function as a hook:\n </p>\n <pre><code>typedef  int (__thiscall* func_type)(LPVOID*, LPVOID*, DWORD, BOOL);\nLPVOID hookaddr = 0;\n int __fastcall testhook(LPVOID* pThis, void* _EDX, LPVOID* object, DWORD hp, BOOL self)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Hooked\"  << std::endl;\n\n    func_type originalFunc = (func_type)hookaddr;\n\n    return originalFunc(pThis, object, hp, self);\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The problem lies in the fact that the hooked function seems to follow\n  <code>\n   __thiscall\n  </code>\n  convention and Detours doesn't seem to be allowing this? I tried mixing\n  <code>\n   __thiscall\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   __stdcall/__fastcall\n  </code>\n  conventions in my injected dll, but couldn't get anything working. I either end up with a wrong\n  <code>\n   ecx\n  </code>\n  value or a crash due to an invalid\n  <code>\n   esp\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Any idea what I could try here?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

            "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have found the solution to this problem, which is quite simple. I got confused with the hooked function signature and the\n  <code>\n   __fastcall\n  </code>\n  trick to get a non member function to work with the\n  <code>\n   __thiscall\n  </code>\n  convention. In my initial post, the two first arguments in the function signatures are the one passed using\n  <code>\n   ecx\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   edx\n  </code>\n  , but I forgot about one of the pointer passed using the stack. The correct function definition is the following:\n </p>\n <pre><code> int __fastcall testhook(LPVOID* pThis, void* _EDX, LPVOID* object, LPVOID* object2, DWORD hp, BOOL self)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Hooked\"  << std::endl;\n\n    func_type originalFunc = (func_type)hookaddr;\n\n    return originalFunc(pThis, object, object2, hp, self);\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  As the callee is responsible for cleaning the stack, providing an incorrect number of parameters lead to a stack corruption (in my case, one of the parameter was still on the stack after my function returns).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
