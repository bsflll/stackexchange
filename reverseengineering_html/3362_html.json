For example, C has the CRT which implements file I/O operations (\n  <code>\n   fopen\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   fread\n  </code>\n  etc.), Delphi has compiler helpers for its\n  <code>\n   string\n  </code>\n  type (concatenation, assignment and others), ADA has various low-level functions to ensure language safety and so on. By comparing the code of the program and the runtime libraries of the candidate compilers you may be able to find a match.\n </p>\n <p>\n  IDA implements this approach in the\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/tech/flirt/in_depth.shtml\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   FLIRT technology\n  </a>\n  . By using the signatures, IDA is able to determine most of the major compilers for DOS and Windows. It's somewhat more difficult on Linux because there's no single provider of compiler binaries for it, so signatures would have to be made for every distro.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, even without resorting to the runtime library code, it may be possible to identify the compiler used. Many compilers use very distinct idioms to represent various operations. For example, I\n  <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/qnyy9/duqu_trojan_written_in_mystery_programming/c3z8qhg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   was able to guess\n  </a>\n  that the compiler used for the Duqu virus was Visual C++, which was later\n  <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/duqu-mystery-language-solved/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   confirmed\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
