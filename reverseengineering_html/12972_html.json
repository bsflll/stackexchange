    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have an exe on my desktop that i began debugging a while ago, so i have a lot of notes/breakpoints stored in the udd file. I now need to move that exe to a different directory but Olly sees it as a new exe because of the change in directory, so it creates a new udd file.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After a bunch of searching i see that Olly v1 has an option \"Debugging options -> Security -> Ignore path and extension\" but i don't see this in Olly v2. Per\n  <a href=\"http://ollydbg.de/version2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://ollydbg.de/version2.html\n  </a>\n  , the ability to do this has been present since OllyDbg 2.01 alpha 3:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Option to load .udd information even when path, file name or file checksum is different.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  does anyone know how to do this?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
