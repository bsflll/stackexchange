After loading the binary the menu which contains \"MPC860\" will appear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Please note that image probably should be rebased for the proper disassembling. I loaded modem.bin into Ida and I see some reasonable code.\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <em>\n    Small addition #0\n   </em>\n   : when I rebase this image to\n   <code>\n    0xFFC40130\n   </code>\n   I see some very consistent pointers to strings in the code, which means that probably this should be address to rebase the image to.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <em>\n    Small addition #1\n   </em>\n   : I'm not sure that the map file is really related to this binary - some of the functions in it are not match to the function prologue addresses.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <em>\n    Small addition #2\n   </em>\n   : I can confirm that the code is not packed, and that the loading address is correct.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <em>\n    Small addition #3\n   </em>\n   : Just for completeness,\n   <code>\n    r13\n   </code>\n   value is\n   <code>\n    0xD410\n   </code>\n   (Options --> General --> Analysis -->Processor specific analysis options -->SDA (r13) address) . As far as I can see setting this value is very much compatible with addresses of the strings used for printing.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
