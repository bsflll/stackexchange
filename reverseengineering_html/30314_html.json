Actually when I step into the program I can see the beginning of memory part of \"Hello, world!\" been overwritten by \"Goodbye!\" and there was no segfault (unlike in Linux there IS segfault and\n  <s>\n   I'm still trying to figure out why, but that's a different question\n  </s>\n  when checking\n  <code>\n   c53.o\n  </code>\n  in IDA it tells me the string \"Hello World!\" is in\n  <strong>\n   rodata\n  </strong>\n  so that segfault makes perfect sense):\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Zg7jG.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Zg7jG.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  To verify that the strings are indeed in data segment, not in rodata segment, I checked the assembly code:\n </p>\n <pre><code>_DATA   SEGMENT\n$SG10125 DB 'Goodbye!', 00H\n    ORG $+3\n$SG10126 DB 'Result: %s', 0aH, 00H\n$SG10129 DB 'Hello, world!', 0aH, 00H\n_DATA   ENDS\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
