    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm examining an iOS framework (extracted from a dyld shared cache) and there are a lot of branch-link instructions to functions which don't exist.  For example,\n </p>\n <pre><code>bl #-0x50e7e04\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Performing the arithmetic based on the next function address, that's a call to 0x194151e140.  However, running\n </p>\n <pre class=\"lang-sh prettyprint-override\"><code>otool -l <framework> | grep addr | awk '{print $NF}' | sort\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  reveals the lowest memory address corresponding to a mapped file is 0x1990da000.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is this some RE countermeasure?  What's going on here?\n </p>\n <p>\n  For context, this is from the private framework CMCapture from iOS 14.5.  The machine code is\n </p>\n <pre><code>7f 60 bc 96\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  at address 0x199245f44.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

You can then right-click on the reference (which will be highlighted in red), and click \"References -> Add to Program\".  It is important to note that the \"Add to program\" option will only appear if you imported in the manner described.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
