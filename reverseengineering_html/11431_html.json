I've tried using Android SSL TrustKiller with Cydia substrate on both the Genymotion virtual machine, and the default Android virtual machine, and I've also tried with different versions of android, and even my physical phone, but I continue to ONLY pick up traffic from apps that don't use Certificate pinning. Please share what setup you are using?</span>",
