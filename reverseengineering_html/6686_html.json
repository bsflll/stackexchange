Kik doesn't officially support saving conversations, but can I do \nit using my setup?\n </p>\n <p>\n  My thoughts: when I take a snapshot of Andy (my VirtualBox Android \ndevice), that snapshot should contain my last n Kik conversations in \nsome form. Kik doesn't store conversations permanently, but does let \nyou scroll back through some number of them (the storage is local on \nyour device, not remote on their servers).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I tried \"shared folders\", but I couldn't get this to work, even after \ntrying to install \"guest additions\" (which didn't appear to work \neither: I'm guessing they're only supported on certain platforms).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Has anyone looked into doing something like this? Thoughts?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
