The argument is usually a reference to the symbol being resolved in the dynamic symbol table. It can be either an index, or a raw offset (index multiplied by symbol entry size).\n </p>\n <p>\n  In “normal” binaries the dynamic symbols reside in the\n  <code>\n   .dynsym\n  </code>\n  section, but it is not actually enforced by the loader. It actually uses the DT_DYNSYM/DT_STRTAB entries from the dynamic table (PT_DYNAMIC segment type). Since your binary is packed, it could be obfuscated even further and use the pointer to the dynamic table from the first entry of the GOT.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you can debug the binary, it may be easier to step through the resolver code and see how it decides which symbol to resolve than trying to deduce it statically.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
