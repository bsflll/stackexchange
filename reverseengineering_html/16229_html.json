    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I met the unknown (for me) method of anti-debugging today, while debugging in IDA Pro. This method delete fast all branches in file and the programm will look similar like on the image:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/6VDNm.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/6VDNm.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also many parts of code became unrecognized bytes, but I can fix this with Make Code command (only code, not branches). What it can be and how I can bypass this? The programm works fine after that, but I can't use breakpoints.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
