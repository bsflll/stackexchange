I can attach the new process to a debugger (e.g., ollydbg or the one featured by IDA Pro) and read the assembly code. However, I was wondering whether it is possible or not to take like a snapshot of this so I can later on analyze the code offline (as any other binary).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
