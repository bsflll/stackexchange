Because of its use of obfuscation, the code is difficult to read. But I know that the constant is returned from a function after confusion, and I am sure that it is a fixed value. I think smalivm can find out the return value of this function, but I can't find a sample article that fully describes how smalivm is used except for\n  <a href=\"http://calebfenton.github.io/2016/04/30/dalvik-virtual-execution-with-smalivm/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   this article\n  </a>\n  . This got me into trouble.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I don't know much about simplify. Does simplify work equally well when not using smalivm?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
