On Page 33, the author compiles a program with a symbol reference and no definition,\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Let's take a look at the source code:\n  </p>\n  <pre><code>_start()\n  {\n    foo();\n  }\n</code></pre>\n  <p>\n   We see that it calls the foo() function. However, the foo() function is not located directly within that source code file; so, upon compiling, there will be a relocation entry created that is necessary for later satisfying the symbolic reference:\n  </p>\n  <pre><code>$ objdump -d obj1.o\nobj1.o:\nfile format elf32-i386\nDisassembly of section .text:\n00000000 <func>:\n0: 55 push %ebp\n1: 89 e5 mov %esp,%ebp\n3: 83 ec 08 sub $0x8,%esp\n6: e8 fc ff ff ff call 7 <func+0x7>\nb: c9 leave\nc: c3 ret\n</code></pre>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  **Even after changing\n  <code>\n   _start() {}\n  </code>\n  to\n  <code>\n   void start() {}\n  </code>\n  , what flags do I use to compile the same thing? When I try, I get..\n </p>\n <pre><code>gcc -nostdlib app.c -o test\napp.c: In function ‘_start’:\napp.c:3:3: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘foo’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]\n   foo();\n   ^~~\n/tmp/ccMBITVZ.o: In function `_start':\napp.c:(.text+0xa): undefined reference to `foo'\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

To generate an executable ELF file, you then have to invoke the linker separately\n(app.o is the default output file name, so the \"-o app.o\" parameter can be omitted).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
