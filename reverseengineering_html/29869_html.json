Question is if you want/need to develop your own solution or whether something like\n <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PunkBuster\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n  Punkbuster\n </a>\n suits your needs. Matter of the fact is that any hackers/crackers can only be deterred and delayed, not prevented, unless there is\n <i>\n  some part\n </i>\n (of the logic) which doesn't reside on the client side. That said, this form of protection should not be your first and foremost thought. I've seen products (not necessarily games) whose authors spent considerable time in \"protecting\" their code, and neglected overall software quality.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
