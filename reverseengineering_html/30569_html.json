You'll have to find references to that string, then work backwards a little. Usually the \"badboy\" string will be almost immediately after the license check.\n </p>\n <pre><code>if (check_code() == 'valid')\n    print(\"goodboy\")\n    continue\nelse\n    print(\"badboy\")\n    exit \n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
