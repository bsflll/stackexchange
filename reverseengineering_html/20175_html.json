This means that the existing binary now forwards calls down to the new binary rather than handling them directly; the forwarding can be static (the export table shows the redirection), or runtime (the dll has a stub routine that calls down to the new binary). This will impact low-level applications such as security and backup applications that are dependent upon internal APIs and offsets.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Reference:\n  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/Win7AppQual/new-low-level-binaries\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/Win7AppQual/new-low-level-binaries\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  See the example below.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is the disassembly of OpenProcess in Kernel32.dll which redirects the OpenProcess to Kernelbase.dll\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LGQli.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LGQli.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Disassembly of OpenProcess in Kernelbase.dll that call the Native API NTOpenProcess\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LCeam.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LCeam.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
