Krakatau is designed specifically for working with obfuscated Java bytecode, although the decompiler doesn't support lambdas and isn't very user friendly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That being said, renamed identifiers is not something any tool will able to help you with. You'll just have to reverse engineer it and change them to more meaningful names yourself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If decompilation fails, you can also try the Krakatau disassembler. The advantage of disassembly is that it always works, no matter how heavily the bytecode has been obfuscated. It lets you see what's really in the bytecode without the risk of things getting messed up by decompilation. The downside is that it's generally a lot harder to read.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

They'll just have different filenames than you might expect since Krakatau forces the output source to have ascii filenames in order to avoid shenanigans. Look closely at the files the decompiler outputs. They will be there, just with weird filenames.</span>",

That's usually a good first step, although sometimes doing that breaks code because some obfuscators use reflection from strings (not necessarily encrypted) and that's enough for recaf not be able to deal with the translation correctly.</span>",
