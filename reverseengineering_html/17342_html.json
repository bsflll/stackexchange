    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm owning a CarPlay head unit from Volkswagen called RCD330 plus. It is possible to upgrade/downgrade to any available firmwares. For example here are two firmware versions:\n  <a href=\"http://rcd330plus.com/rcd/variantconflict_Eror.rar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   http://rcd330plus.com/rcd/variantconflict_Eror.rar\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The firmware file itself is a *.tar file and can be extracted. I found a linux file structure (var, etc, opt, ... folders).\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   My goal:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The head unit supports only a few languages like Chinese, Mexican, US English, ... and I want to add support for German language.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   What I tried already\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  (1) I checked nearly every file with a HEX editor (iHex for Mac OS X) and found one 9.4MB big file called\n  <strong>\n   <em>\n    hmi\n   </em>\n  </strong>\n  (without extension) in folder\n  <em>\n   /opt/\n  </em>\n  and this file contains all labels:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9In6E.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9In6E.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  (2) I checked this\n  <strong>\n   <em>\n    hmi\n   </em>\n  </strong>\n  file with binwalk and get this output:\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4mKmK.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4mKmK.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aDr0b.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aDr0b.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Where can I get information/knowledge to add an additional language. Maybe also with adding german language flag in the setup menu of the radio?\nOr is this just impossible?\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Is this\n   <em>\n    hmi\n   </em>\n   file a compiled file or is it kind of some archiv which can be somehow extracted?\n  </strong>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

As to whether or not it's possible to add a new language with a reasonable effort, consider the following:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Since it's a multi-language application, it's likely some sort of locale management framework is used. In some cases it can make addition of a new language easier.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   If you modify this binary, you'll need to make sure all the internal data references and pointers still point at correct locations. This can be quite hard to do, especially for a C++ application written with Qt.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I think an easier way would be replacing strings from one of existing languages:\n </p>\n <pre><code>$ strings hmi | grep ias\ndias\nSolo emergencias\nncias na conex\nPuede haber interferencias\nMemorias\nLista de memorias FM\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The downside here is that translated strings can't be longer than original ones (which is unfortunate for German), otherwise data offsets would change. However, it's certainly easier than remapping the whole executable.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I think it's possible to rebuild the binary with changed string lengths (and offsets), but I'm not sure how complex this task can be. I would start by disassembling the binary and writing a linker script to assemble it back from section data. Since it's not encrypted or otherwise protected there's a chance it will work.</span>",
