I'm guessing \"no\" since they don't usually post it, but I'm not aware of any open source firmware, except for things like Tomato, though that's more like an OS for a wifi unit, so I'm just trying to make sure I understand the question better.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

I think the guys behind the\n  <a href=\"http://www.devttys0.com/blog/\">\n   /dev/ttyS0 blog\n  </a>\n  also tried opening a forum a couple months ago but it wasn't very active and apparently has been closed down.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I guess the problem is that the area is somewhat nebulous and trying to cover everything won't really work. However, there are numerous forums that specialize in a specific type of firmware, manufacturer, or even just one product, and some of them are pretty big on their own.
