    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm currently enjoying a forensics CTF challenge. We were provided a PCAPNG file. When opened in Wireshark, the file contains a sequence of URB_INTERRUPT packets from two devices - but no GET_DESCRIPTOR info that identifies either device.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first device give a sequence of 8-bit data like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00\n00:00:04:00:00:00:00:00\n00:00:04:15:00:00:00:00\n00:00:00:15:00:00:00:00\n00:00:08:15:00:00:00:00\n00:00:08:00:00:00:00:00\n00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00\n02:00:00:00:00:00:00:00\n02:00:2d:00:00:00:00:00\n00:00:2d:00:00:00:00:00\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Guessing that this was a keyboard, I decoded the sequence to this message:\n </p>\n <pre><code>scanlines-are-real-cool-guys\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Which seems like a hint, right? The second (much longer) sequence of URB_INTERRUPT packets from the second device is 7-bit data like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>01:00:01:00:02:00:00\n01:00:00:00:02:00:00\n01:00:00:00:01:00:00\n01:00:00:00:02:00:00\n01:00:01:00:01:00:00\n01:00:01:00:02:00:00\n01:00:00:00:02:00:00\n01:00:01:00:01:00:00\n01:00:01:00:00:00:00\n01:00:00:00:01:00:00\n01:00:ff:ff:01:00:00\n01:00:fe:ff:00:00:00\n01:00:ff:ff:00:00:00\n01:00:ff:ff:00:00:00\n01:00:ff:ff:ff:ff:00\n01:00:ff:ff:ff:ff:00\n01:00:ff:ff:ff:ff:00\n01:00:ff:ff:ff:ff:00\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I guessed that this could be a mouse - even though most mouse data seem to  only contain 4 bits, based on the fact that:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Only two of the bits seem to change in any significant way - all other bits seem to only ever be\n   <code>\n    00\n   </code>\n   ,\n   <code>\n    01\n   </code>\n   , or\n   <code>\n    ff\n   </code>\n   - thus potentially being the x and y coordinates\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The variable data stays in between 0 and 255\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Mice and keyboards seem to be the most common devices using URB_INTERRUPT\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Acting on that guess, I sent the data through AWK:\n </p>\n <pre><code>awk -F: 'function comp(v){if(v>127)v-=256;return v}{x+=comp(strtonum(\"0x\"$3));y+=comp(strtonum(\"0x\"$5))}$1==\"01\"{print x,y}' hexoutput_second-part.txt > mouse1.txt\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  And then through GNUPLOT - hoping to get a traced message or something from an on-screen keyboard. But no luck - the plot ends up as:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/B8RCu.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/B8RCu.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Not especially helpful.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So my question is - how would I go tracking down what other devices could be sending 7 bit URB_INTERRUPT data? What is the best way to attack this identification process?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
