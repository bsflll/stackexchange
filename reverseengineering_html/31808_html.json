    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm trying to figure out why\n  <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssavepanel?language=objc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   NSSavePanel\n  </a>\n  fails in my SwiftUI app. I tried every possible documentation, or asking on the Swift programming forums - to no avail.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm originally a Windows programmer, and I am also a reverse engineer. The way I can see why some API doesn't work (on Windows) is usually by stepping into it with a live debugger/disassembler. This is what I want to do with the\n  <code>\n   NSSavePanel.runModal()\n  </code>\n  call. But I'm kinda new to macOS.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So to test the concept, I built a simple C++ app with the Xcode (natively for ARM64 architecture, with the \"release\" configuration):\n </p>\n <pre><code>int main(int argc, const char * argv[])\n{\n    if(argc > 2)\n    {\n        int a = atoi(argv[1]);\n        int b = atoi(argv[2]);\n        int c = a / b;\n        \n        printf(\"v=%d\n\", c);\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I then configured Xcode to \"Debug -> Debug Workflow -> Always show disassembly\" and set a bp at the start. So I get this:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PvvJP.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PvvJP.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can somewhat step-over and -into ARM64 assembly instructions with ^F6 and ^F7 keyboard shortcuts, but the Xcode UI is not really showing values of registers (one needs to type\n  <code>\n   p $register\n  </code>\n  into the console) and to see memory one needs to use \"Debug -> Debug Workflow -> View memory\" option, which is very clunky.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In other words, Xcode is not the best for this type of low-level debugging.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I'm wondering, if there's another live debugger/disassembler that can be used for this purpose?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
