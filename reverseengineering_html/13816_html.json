The codecs I want to use are all in\n  <code>\n   .so\n  </code>\n  format, but I don't know how to separate the codecs from the rest of realplayer and use the\n  <code>\n   .so\n  </code>\n  files directly.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Is there a way to do this so that I can just plug the codecs into a new mediaplayer, without having to decompile and recompile the binaries?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Understanding the input (and output) parameters is a bit more difficult, you'll need to disassemble the functions you're interested in and understand the parameters from the code.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That is of course, if you don't have access to that library's SDK, which usually contain header files for all shared objects.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
