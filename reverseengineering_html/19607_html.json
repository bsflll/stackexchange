That mechanism works whenever IDA successfully resolves a reference, which may not always be the case (think of\n  <code>\n   call eax\n  </code>\n  where\n  <code>\n   eax\n  </code>\n  is not easily resolved staticly). You should use that interface for all types of calls.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The function that best suits your use case is probably\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/idapython/src/blob/master/python/idautils.py#L68\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <code>\n    idautils.CodeRefsFrom\n   </code>\n  </a>\n  which accepts two parameters\n  <code>\n   ea\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   flow\n  </code>\n  and returns a generator for all code references from given\n  <code>\n   ea\n  </code>\n  .\n  <code>\n   flow\n  </code>\n  is a boolean used to control whether you wish the next instruction included.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There are a bunch of other related functions, such as\n  <code>\n   CodeRefsTo\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   DataRefsFrom\n  </code>\n  ,\n  <code>\n   XrefsTo\n  </code>\n  , etc...\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
