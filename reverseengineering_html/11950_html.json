    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  Is there any way to add instructions to a library in IDA? My predicament is that there is no room in a game library (.so ELF, android) to fit my own code. There is an empty bss segment but IDA doesn't like to write to it, and I believe the game needs it for it's variables.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've tried adding additional bytes to the end of the file with a hex editor, and then opening it with IDA, but IDA will not show it possibly because it's not in a segment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can I make my own library / modify the existing one so that the code segment is larger? My own library would need to be imported by the other library in order to work, I believe, because it needs functions and such from the original library.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

There are basically 3 ways to do it, and it seems you're already mentioning all of them in your question :\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Search for a code cave big enough to fit your payload\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Create a new section in your executable with a sufficient size for your payload\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Proxify your library and add functions or hook existing ones\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Now depending on what exactly you're trying to inject and how you're reaching it, each method has its specific pro/cons and will require a different approach. They should all be fairly well documented on the Internet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  (Without more context/details about what you're trying to do, it's hard to tell you which one to pick though)\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
