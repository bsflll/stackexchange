I am trying to debug a binary on windows with radare and have tried the following:\n </p>\n <pre><code>radare2 -d a.exe\nfork_and_ptraceme/CreateProcess: The request is not supported.\nw32_dbg_maps/w32_OpenProcess: The parameter is incorrect.\n[w] Cannot open 'dbg://a.exe' for writing.\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I also tried to use gdbserver and use radare to connect remotely. It connects but it gets stuck and I am not able to give it any commands or see anything.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I am going to try windbg remote as well, however, I am starting to wonder, do I need to install another set of libraries or another type of debugger, or do some additional configuration to make debugging work with radare2. Any suggestions?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The link is to the 32-bit application, but you need to open\n  <a href=\"http://radare.mikelloc.com/get/2.5.0/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   the directory\n  </a>\n  and download the 64-bit radare2 version.\nJust encountered this issue myself.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
