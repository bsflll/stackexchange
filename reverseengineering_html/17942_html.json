I have tried Dynamic Analysis on exe files using IDA. But I never got to know how could I use dynamic analysis on Linux using IDA where I could play with ELF on the fly.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

For example there's Lighthouse plugin for IDA which is crossplatform, and allows you to load code coverage data into IDA to see which paths of code were actually executed.\nAlso there's Ponce plugin, which works for windows, linux and mac, and allows to trace data flow in runtime. I.e. it will mark all the instructions and functions which are accessing some buffer.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you just want to debug Linux binary in IDA, there's \\IDA70\\dbgsrv\\linux_server executable, which you can run to debug of you ELF file remotely.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
