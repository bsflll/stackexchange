All these values correspond only to particular process' virtual memory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  PE files may have different image bases than the default ones. So if a dll has\n  <code>\n   ImageBase = 0x20000000\n  </code>\n  , you can expect it to be loaded at this address instead. Note however, that it is only the\n  <em>\n   preferred\n  </em>\n  address - it may be changed if, for example, second dll that is loaded into the same process already occupies this space.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you have any more doubts regarding PE format, you can either follow the docs linked above or slightly more compact description\n  <a href=\"https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/PE-Portable-executable\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
