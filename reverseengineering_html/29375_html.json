So, if as in my case you are building the proxy dll, then you will get it's base address.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While the function which I was trying to hook was in the .exe file of the program, which that dll will be hooked at.\nSo, what you really want is:\n </p>\n <pre><code>baseAddressPtr = (DWORD_PTR*)GetModuleHandleA(\"<YourProgram>.exe\");\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
