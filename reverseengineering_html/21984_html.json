Are\n   <code>\n    DLLEntryPoint\n   </code>\n   and\n   <code>\n    DLLMain\n   </code>\n   similar functions for Dlls?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  This is almost correct.\n  <code>\n   Start\n  </code>\n  <em>\n   is\n  </em>\n  the symbolic name of the entry point in this case, true. However, whether it performs some kind of initialization depends entirely on the library. I wager IDA has recognized some runtime library (such as the Visual C++ runtime) by way of a FLIRT signature and used that information to point out\n  <code>\n   DllMain\n  </code>\n  to you.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Conceptually\n  <code>\n   DLLEntryPoint\n  </code>\n  and\n  <code>\n   DLLMain\n  </code>\n  mirror what you found for\n  <code>\n   .exe\n  </code>\n  files, yes.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
