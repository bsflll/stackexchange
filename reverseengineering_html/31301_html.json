(Don't worry this is free software not under any license anymore).\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Good news:\n </h2>\n <p>\n  I already decompiled the code to C++ code (I got the assembly code to work as well but then I have no idea how to call the functions I need from C++ so I'm choosing to work with the decompiled C++ code).\n </p>\n <h2>\n  The problem:\n </h2>\n <p>\n  How do I convert the decompiled C++ code to writable C++ code as the decompiled C++ code is practically machine C++ code. I know there have been similar questions but no clear solutions.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  To provide a diagram as to where my problem is check below:\n </h2>\n <p>\n  (outdated)DLL > Disassembled ASM > Disassembled C++ nearly 85% writable but uses Qword Dword, precision integers like int32 or int64. > convert to writable C++ code\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you know any software that can translate decompiled C++ code into writable C++ that would be helpful as I have gotten too close to making this work.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

During the compilation the following information was\n  <strong>\n   completely and almost unrecoverably lost\n  </strong>\n  (if you don't have the corresponding .pdb file with debug information or RTTI inside):\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   function names (part of which can be recovered from mangling data, but still)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   data types such as structures and classes (both names, inheritance if it was used and internal layout)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Templates data\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Inline functions\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Reverse engineering of C++ code is recovering this information from the usage context.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   there is\n   <strong>\n    absolutely no software\n   </strong>\n   that would immediately generate a\nwritable C/C++ listing\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  here means that you can not automatically generate the lost information out of nothing, so you'll need to perform some reverse engineering manually.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
