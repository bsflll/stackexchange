I also tried to edit the code in Reflector but after editing and trying to save it says that it cannot save mixed mode assemblies. Maybe i would be able to edit the binary in HEX editor?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

When i tried decompiling the program to C# in ilspy it generated bunch of useless files that contained meaningles junk. If i could edit the code directly in ilspy and recompile that would be great. EDIT: I now exported IL code from ilspy and edited it but how do i assemble the snippet back into the .exe?</span>",
