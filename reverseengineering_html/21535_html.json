Apparently that is not part of the ZIP specification itself but an invention of WinZip. They have documented their format modifications and all details on this page:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://www.winzip.com/win/en/aes_info.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   https://www.winzip.com/win/en/aes_info.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Important to notice here is how key derivation works. It feeds the given password through PKBDF2 with an iteration count of 1000 to derive the real key used in AES.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Using PEiD I checked for crypto signatures and found 4 references to AES (via their sbox). I then checked the surrounding code where these AES functions are used and stumbled upon a function call that got 1000 as an argument.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So then I just ran the binary with an attached debugger, breaking on that call. Then I inspected passed arguments and the first argument appeared to be the key.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I successfully decompressed the female zip file with the key to confirm.\n </p>\n <h1>\n  How to derive that key?\n </h1>\n <p>\n  Note that the algorithm used by the program seems to be a bit more complex. If you check the zip files, not all files in there are encrypted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two XML files are unencrypted and contain an XML property named\n  <code>\n   encryption key\n  </code>\n  , which looks similar to the real one above, but different bytes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The application probably uses this property to deduce the above key which is eventually fed to AES to decrypt the encrypted files in the same archive. I do not know how this internal derivation works. You would have to find the code, probably by following the XML parser if you want to write a generic tool to decompress these encrypted files.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
