The information about arrays and more complicated data types is lost during compilation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However there are several ways to restore this information from the context (and none of them will work in your specific case because it is too much simple and thus very much optimize-able).\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   From allocations. If something is allocated using malloc or new [] operator it may be an array or class/structure object, and the element size may be revealed by observing the access to this memory.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   From access patterns. If you see a loop accessing the memory it may be an array\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   By not accessed gaps in memory, both stack and global (was previously mentioned as \"holes\"). If compiler will not be able to detect and \"unroll\" the access to the array, it will compute the accessed element's offset on the fly and will add this offset to the address of first element of the array. If you'll try to analyze such kind of code and its variable allocation you'll see the \"base\" of the array and some not referenced memory after it which will be accessed as *(base +computed_offset) = something.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Regarding \"hidden instructions\":\n </p>\n <p>\n  They are not needed in optimized code. Both of your variants are functionally equivalent. Compiler just computed the needed index during the compilation, \nso nobody hides anything here.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
