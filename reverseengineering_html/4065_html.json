Academia doesn't have a ton of papers here, but there's some powerful ones.  I'm looking at trying to improve the communities tools in terms of NVIDIA's fermi ISA, (since AMD published theirs!)\n </p>\n <p>\n  To date, I've not found any fermi disassemblers, but one ONE fermi assembler:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/asfermi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   asfermi\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Are their any plugins/disassemblers that this community is aware of, that my google searches have apparently turned up zilch?  NVIDIA's supplied tools don't work for binaries compiled with vs2010.\n </p>\n <p>\n  =============[Updated Context]===================\n </p>\n <p>\n  Appears that to a certain extent, my assumptions were wrong.  NVIDIA's disassembly tools (nvobjdump, nvdisasm) are designed only to work with their *.cubin (maybe *.ptx) intermediate assemblies.  Which is bad, from a malware analysis perspective.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After searching extensively I found a dead project called\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/laanwj/decuda\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   decuda\n  </a>\n  .  (I say dead because it hasn't had a commit in years.)  AND it doesn't seem to be able to handle disassembling *.cubin binaries from the latest releases, 5.5 and 6.0.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So you can extract *.cubin files from PE or ELF files like this:\n </p>\n <pre><code>C:\\ProgramData\\NVIDIA Corporation\\CUDA Samples\\v6.0\\Bin\\win32\\Debug>cuobjdump -xelf all simpleAtomicIntrinsics.exe\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Then use\n  <code>\n   nvdisasm\n  </code>\n  on your target *.cubin file:\n </p>\n <pre><code>C:\\ProgramData\\NVIDIA Corporation\\CUDA Samples\\v6.0\\Bin\\win32\\Debug>nvdisasm NVIDIA-CUDA-simpleAtomicIntrinsics.sm_50.cubin\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Oh, by the way,\n  <code>\n   nvdisasm\n  </code>\n  does actually use control-flow disassembly.\n  <code>\n   cuobjdump\n  </code>\n  uses linear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By playing with the provided tools you can extract opcodes, but unfortunately there's snakey instructions like\n  <code>\n   S2R\n  </code>\n  which according to NVIDIA's\n  <a href=\"http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-binary-utilities/index.html#fermi\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   documentation\n  </a>\n  does this:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <code>\n   S2R    Special Register to Register\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  With no documentation I've seen yet as to what the special registers even ARE on this architecture.  The best documentation on this so far is\n  <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/asfermi/wiki/FAQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
