    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I've been checking out metaverse-sensation Decentraland (play.decentraland.org) and I'm interested in how they've implemented the massive multiplayer netcode to work well for tens of players at the same screen. So I decided to monitor the network.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I logged in with 2 browsers, got both on the same game screen looking at each other, and monitored the network tab on my browser to see what was being sent. To my surprise, when I move the character on one window, the other one sees the movement, but no data is sent over Chrome's network tab.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm surely missing something. How can I see what data it's sending and where it's sending to? Are there some types of connections on browser that do not trigger the network tab? How can I debug them?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
