After you finish with the patch, just execute it and attach the debugger and restore the initial bytes back. You can continue from here to do what ever you want. As to bypassing debugger protection, there are plenty of plugins for debugger to help you: for OllyDbg -\n   <a href=\"http://tuts4you.com/download.php?view.3392\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    OllyExt\n   </a>\n   ,\n   <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/aadp/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    aadp\n   </a>\n   and regarding\n   <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2082/debugger-hiding-plugin-for-windbg\">\n    Windbg\n   </a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   If Tls calls are present (you can also check it using CFF explorer) which will be executed before the entery point code, you can patch them too, and try to attach debugger too.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  To debug child processes, you can use\n  <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   procmon\n  </a>\n  to inspect the whole flow and get the information regarding the parameter that the child processes are executed with.

Programs can call\n  <code>\n   IsDebuggerPresent\n  </code>\n  or have a different way of dealing with debugger detection.
