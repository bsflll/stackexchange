I'm trying to call the ingame function for printing to the console, I'm doing this via an Injected DLL.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The function call looks like this\n </p>\n <pre><code>mov eax,tesv.1095FB8\nmov edx,dword ptr ds:[1B10B58]\npush eax\npush tesv.1095FAC\npush edx\ncall <tesv.ConsoleLog>\nadd esp,C\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  When called the arguments look like this\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JSQij.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JSQij.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  I believe the typedef for this function would be\n </p>\n <pre><code>typedef void(__cdecl *f_ConsoleLog)(uintptr_t ptr1, const char* ptr2, ...);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  However calling the function causes an access violation, I've even tried to call it using inline ASM exactly as the aforementioned assembly does.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm quite stuck and don't know where to look next, could anyone point me in the correct direction?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
