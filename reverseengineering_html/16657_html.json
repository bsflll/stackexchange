It lets you load Stored Value (money) and a variety of passes for travel across 24 transit agencies. No more fumbling for change.  Just load the type of fare you want on your card, then tap it each time you board a bus or train.  It’s way faster than cash!\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  It is some sort of contactless smart card, but looking around using that as a search term, TAP seems not to be listed as using the ISO 14443 standard.
