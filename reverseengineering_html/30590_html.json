    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm currently debugging a .net application by using dnSpy. There is a function where I have call like this\n </p>\n <pre><code><Module>.X.Y.Z.Initialize(ptr, ptr2, flag);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The function belongs to a DLL and appearently is a C(++) function call as I could find this by going to the module:\n </p>\n <pre><code>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.Unmanaged | MethodImplOptions.PreserveSig)]\ninternal unsafe static extern void Initialize(byte*, byte*, [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.U1)] bool);\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  So my question is how can I analyze this function (Initialize)? Logically dnSpy is skipping it and IDAPro doesn't help me further since the DLL itself is a .net so I can't start a debugging session within IDA.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I've tried to create a Debug Time Travel Trace with WinDBG but it throws me an error when I'm ending the session and can't open the trace anymore.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Are there any suggestions how I can figure out or debug this function Initialize is doing?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
