I suggest you look at existing Q&As with the\n <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/law\">\n  law\n </a>\n tag or search for Q&As with \"legal\" as search term on this site. To answer the question one would have to take your jurisdiction into account as well as the (original) jurisdiction of the copyright owners for the game etc. You can probably always do anything in private. But once you intend to publish your findings you should consult a lawyer. Probably few if any community members\n <i>\n  are\n </i>\n lawyers. And even if they are, jurisdiction may differ and they're unlikely to render legal advice gratis.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
