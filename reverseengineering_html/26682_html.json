While the sizes seem to match the\n  <code>\n   uintX_t\n  </code>\n  counterparts, I would appreciate it if someone can explain the reasoning for introducing\n  <code>\n   uintX_n\n  </code>\n  types and the difference they have with the well known\n  <code>\n   uintX_t\n  </code>\n  types in which\n  <code>\n   X=8,16,32\n  </code>\n  .\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
