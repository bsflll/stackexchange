    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I am using radare2, I have disassembled the function:\n  <code>\n   sym.loop\n  </code>\n  , it contains a\n  <code>\n   switch\n  </code>\n  witch has 4\n  <code>\n   cases\n  </code>\n  that calls different functions. After any of the function call, the program exits the\n  <code>\n   loop\n  </code>\n  function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is my problem: after the first\n  <code>\n   exit\n  </code>\n  displayed in radare the disassembled code stops. I am not able to see the rest of the function's code, although there are jump indicating there is more content after the exit function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Do I have to press or do anything to display the rest or is it a bug?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is the code of the loop function:\n </p>\n <pre><code>void loop(int a) {\n    type[0] = a;\n    while (true) {\n        switch (type[0]) {\n        case 1:\n            function1(arg);\n            break;\n        case 2:\n            function2(arg);\n            break;\n        case 3:\n            function3(arg);\n            break;\n        default:\n            printf(\"Command unrecognized.\n\");\n        case 4:\n            function4();\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Note: if there is any bug in the code, I may have caused trying to clean the code from debug messages or whatever... But the idea is that the main code has no bugs, it is just the disassembler that doesn't print the entire function.\nand the disassembly code stops after the case1's break (exit function).\n </p>\n <p>\n  (UPDATE:)\nHere is an example of the error I am talking about (not the above code, but the same error):\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fPkHR.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"Function is not displaying the entire code.No function return.\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fPkHR.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  No return value is displayed.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
