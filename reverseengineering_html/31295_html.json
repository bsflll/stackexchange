I agree that the issue comes up in practice, but answers have a size limit (trust me, I\n <i>\n  know\n </i>\n !) and no one wants to read a book when coming to a Q&A site such as this one.

Many CRC, SHA etc standard\nchecksum calculators could be recognized.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Often the hashes are\ncalculated across the whole image of e.g. a critical DLL.\nIn that case, you could look for\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   LoadLibrary calls (in Windows)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Magic numbers of the DLL itself, like (again Windows) the MS header \"MZ\", present in all DLLs and exe's produced with MS tools.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  If you could find an algorithm, have a look where it stores values. This gives a hint about the location of the checksum.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And if you found the address where the hash is residing, set a \"read\" breakpoint (hardware breakpoint) on it and wait until it triggers. This could be the hash-checking routine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Windows\" here of course as an example only. Similar strategies exist for other platforms.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
