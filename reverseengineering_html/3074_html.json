    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have some crucial data written decades ago by an ancient 16bit DOS application. There are no docs, no source, and no information about the author. Just the 16 bit exe. I guess it's time for me to learn how to decompile stuff, since it seems the only way to restore file format. I've tried OllyDbg, it looks really great, but it can't 16 bit.\nIs there a disassembler/debugger capable of working with such executables?\n </p>\n <p>\n  I know DOSbox, the app runs in it all right. The problem is, I don't need to run it, I need to understand the file format in which it writes data. Do you think starting some old 16bit DOS debugger/decompiler in DOSbox sounds like an idea? If yes, could you please name a decent DOS debugger?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  P.S.: I copypasted this question from StackOverflow, because I didn't know about ReverseEngineering section when I was asking it. Please delete it if it's against the rules.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

If you have a general idea what to look for -- magic values, constants, data structures, etc. -- you can concentrate on relevant parts only, rather than disassembling some huge routine that turns out to only calculate the width of a dialog box.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

You need to know assembler to understand the output, but it is a very strong utility to look trough a programs code.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

The best feature in Gametools is its memory scanner that can scan memory for exact values, for greater values than previous time and for lesser values than previous time. Then you can set hardware memory breakpoints on the matching memory addresses (when you have sufficiently few memory addresses left, usually after some rounds) and that way you can find the essential routines that access those memory addresses. If I had to reverse-engineer a DOS application, I would definitely start with Gametools.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
