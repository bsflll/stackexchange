I didn't even notice it, because radare2 and gdb were able to execute it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After reading\n  <a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/133389/no-such-file-or-directory-but-the-file-exists\">\n   stackoverflow 1\n  </a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2716702/no-such-file-or-directory-error-when-executing-a-binary\">\n   stackoverflow 2\n  </a>\n  , it seems that the problem is that my 64 bit system can't handle the 32 bit executable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After running the following command, I got the executable to work.\n  <code>\n   sudo apt-get install lib32z1\n  </code>\n </p>\n <p>\n  And also edb started working.\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  Edit: Another reason why it might not work for you is that you have not marked it as executable.
