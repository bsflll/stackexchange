Get the configured base address here: menu\n <code>\n  Window\n </code>\n ->\n <code>\n  Memory map\n </code>\n ->\n <code>\n  house icon\n </code>\n (Set Image Base). That is the base address you need to substract from the address shown in Ghidra. Afterwards add the base address you got by Frida at run-time e.g.\n <code>\n  Module.findBaseAddress(\"main.exe\");\n </code>\n</span>\n</body></html>",

I calculated the difference in addresses and just add this difference to frida. Rather, I will now use your approach. Thank you.\n</span>\n</body></html>",
