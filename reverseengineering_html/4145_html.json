Second, what is the leave instruction do?\n </p>\n <pre><code>cmp    BYTE PTR [esp+0x12],0x0 <---\nmov    eax,DWORD PTR [esp+0x20]\nmov    DWORD PTR [esp+0x1c],eax\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Third, how does the compare instruction make sense?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Last, what does this do?\n </p>\n <pre><code>rep movs DWORD PTR es:[edi],DWORD PTR ds:[esi]  \n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Also, how I can tell if this file is statically or dynamically linked? I mean, when executed, if it's statically linked it must've been compiled that way. If dynamic there must be other program running. Basically, this is suppose to be the first executable on boot of a PE.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
