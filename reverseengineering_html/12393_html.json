I'm a noob when it comes to reverse engineering, and so far my attempts have been unsuccessful. Here's what I've done so far.\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Run apktool on the APK. I got a few XML files, including the AndroidManifest, but no source. Apparently this is because there is no classes.dex in the package.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Noticing that there's a KnoxAttestationAgent.odex in the arm64/ folder, I tried to run baksmali 2.1.1 on it. However, this version apparently doesn't support Android 5 versions of oat. The S6 firmware I'm working on is 5.1.1.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   I tried an earlier version of baksmali 2.0.8 which doesn't have the limitation, but I get another error \"KnoxAttestationAgent.odex is not an apk, dex file or odex file.\"\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   I tried to run AndroGuard on the APK, but was also unsuccessful. A bunch of errors.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Is there a way for these tools (or others) to work on system apps such as the Samsung Knox ones?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks!\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

An odex file is basically an optimized version of the classes.dex\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, in order to disassemble this app, you have to deodex it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here is an HOW-TO guide (I haven't tested it personally):\n  <a href=\"http://www.naldotech.com/how-to-deodex-applications-on-android-5-0-lollipop/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   http://www.naldotech.com/how-to-deodex-applications-on-android-5-0-lollipop/\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eventually, if you follow all the steps correctly, you will have an apk ready to be reversed using APKTool. \nGood luck.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
