    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  No matter what I do, I can't seem to be able to get my Windows 10 (64-bit, build 1607) to apply any patches in custom SDB's (as described in the\n  <a href=\"https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-14/materials/Erickson/WP-Asia-14-Erickson-Persist-It-Using-And-Abusing-Microsofts-Fix-It-Patches.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   article of Jon Erickson\n  </a>\n  from 2014).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I'm using Jon's\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/rustyx/sdb-explorer/releases/tag/0.9\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   sdb-explorer\n  </a>\n  to generate a patch SDB from the following source (assuming calc.exe's PE checksum is 0000BE15 and the entrypoint RVA is 0x2900):\n </p>\n <pre><code>!sdbpatch\nAPP=calc.exe\nDBNAME=calc_test\nP:calc.exe,0xbe15\nR:calc.exe,0x2900,CCCCCCC3\n!endsdbpatch\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The exact commands are:\n </p>\n <pre><code>sdb-explorer.exe -C calc-test.txt -o calc-test.sdb\nsdbinst.exe -p calc-test.sdb\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  The install is successful but has no effect -\n  <em>\n   calc.exe\n  </em>\n  still starts and runs normally.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hence my question - has the PATCH mechanism been removed or somehow crippled in Windows 10?\n </p>\n <hr/>\n <p>\n  <sup>\n   p.s. I need this for legitimate reasons - I'm trying to patch the touchpad utility which is posting mouse wheel messages which don't work in Windows 10 UWP apps, but the utility is signed with uiAccess=\"true\", so I can't just patch the executable.\n  </sup>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
