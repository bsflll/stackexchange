    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I'm working on reverse a binary from a MIPS based router. In order to do it I'm emulating the binary with qemu, but the binary executes some routines before stating with the logic that skips the execution if it's not loaded on the router.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I confirmed that if I skip the execution of those routines by editing some bytes I can run the binary locally and dynamically debug it. For now I'm doing it manually but I want to patch it so I can run it faster.\n </p>\n <p>\n  My problem comes once I change some bytes and try to export it in IDA I tried the idc script to write the changes, also ida_patcher with a DIF file and the built in function to export the changes (Edit>Patch Program...) but the changes are not applied to the binary and I can't generate a new one.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I was thinking in edit the binary with an hex editor but I was wondering if I can do it with IDA.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
