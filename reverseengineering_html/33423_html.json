But first I also ran binwalk on the full image, and it detected a JFFS2 filesystem.  However, running binwalk -e firmware.bin just gives me an empty folder, same as Jefferson.  Any idea what I should try next? Could this be a Ubiquiti-specific layout issue?  Thanks again!\n</span>\n</body></html>",
