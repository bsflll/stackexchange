    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have heard of disassemblers like IDA and debuggers like OllyDbg but honestly, when you give both of them a binary file it gives me the assembly code. I know that the decompiler gives the source code if you provide it a binary. However, I don't know how they differ in terms of mode of operationand I ask myself questions like \"Why can a android/python code be decompiled but a C code be only disassembled?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Can anyone give a precise difference between these 3 kinds of tools?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

Every machine code instruction disassembles to precisely <i>one</i> assembler instruction (I'll not mention the data/code dichotomy here, which is a kind of a Halting Problem). When <i>decompiling</i>, on the other hand, a single instruction may be translated into a number of expressions, and conversely, any number of instructions may be gathered into one high level expression â€“ all at the discretion of the decompiler. Different decompilers may yield different results.</span>",

Meaning that not every binary could be decompiled but every binary could be disassembled. .NET assemblies and JAVA files for exemple once decompiled could be transformed to their original C#/Java code.</span>",
