You end up with a relative jump in the binary. Unfortunately you can only perform one jump.\n </p>\n <pre><code>Return Address before:                     0x1122334455667788\nReturn Address overridden:                 0x112233445566????\nReturn Address overridden (case string):   0x11223344556600??\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  As you described your problem the bufferoverflow is triggered by a string that is NULL-terminated, so that lowers the possible jump-locations but maybe you are lucky and find a good location. like\n </p>\n <pre><code>call rax   (there surely is an equivalent instruction on ARM, but idk)\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  Maybe there are references to the shellcode on the stack or in some registers an you can perform a indirect branch to that pointer and execute the shellcode on the stack.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

I hope you find at least one of these useful.\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Place shellcode\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the overwritten return address. This depends on the length of the buffer (plus any additional data on the stack) but might be enough (at least to jump or copy another piece of code, located someplace else).\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Take the\n   <code>\n    ret2libc\n   </code>\n   approach one step further - jump to a gadget that performs some register manipulation and\n   <em>\n    then\n   </em>\n   calls a useful function (such as system) either by directly calling\n   <code>\n    system\n   </code>\n   or calling/jumping to a register you can control.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Keep in mind you don't necessarily have to\n   <em>\n    overwrite\n   </em>\n   the remainder of the stack. It may be enough to have some limited control over it. You know the stack back-trace and have some control of the code being executed next, make sure there're enough stack pops (a single instruction in ARM) and a branch or some other useful gadget.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   use JOP. It is possible (albeit harder) to construct sequences of gadgets that, instead of falling-through using\n   <code>\n    ret\n   </code>\n   instructions are connected using a series of jump/branch instructions. This requires searching for gadgets that end with a\n   <code>\n    call\n   </code>\n   /\n   <code>\n    b\n   </code>\n   /etc instruction (preferably one that uses a register) instead of with a\n   <code>\n    ret\n   </code>\n   instruction.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  Note that for a more general answer, certain primitives can be used to gain code execution without bypassing ASLR although that really depends in the scenario (and you usually have to be extremely lucky).\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
