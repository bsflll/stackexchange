No OS-level drivers beyond basic serial, so all the decoding is done in the app.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have the ability to capture bidirectional wire traffic and generally snoop on the serial port (good ol' Sysinternals\n  <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/bb896644.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n   Portmon\n  </a>\n  to logfile, with some perl post-processing (parsing out\n  <code>\n   IRP_MJ_(READ|WRITE)\n  </code>\n  events) to get raw byte dumps).\n </p>\n <p>\n  From this I've gotten the basic wire protocol details (baud rate, settings, etc)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Messages appear to be in the format\n  <code>\n   { $body }\n\n  </code>\n  , where sent commands are usually a single byte or 2 in the body, responses are much more complex.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They span several messages, and appear to have additional structure, something like:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Header (\n   <code>\n    {IDCOMPLIANCE ...}\n   </code>\n   )\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Metadata?

I found USBpcap (hxxp://desowin.org/usbpcap/) which can generate wireshark traces, but digging though it for the actual serial data was tedious, and capture isn't realtime.\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    What would people suggest my next moves be (keep hacking at black-box csv/wire-data, decompile, or debug?)\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    If debug, is ollydbg capable of breakpointing on serial port read (and where might I find n00b-level docs on how to do so?)\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    If decompile, what approach should I take (forward from port read, or back from csv/strings? Again, pointers to how to do that would be great.)\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    If black-box, any inspiration as to the structure of the\n    <code>\n     {DL20...}\n    </code>\n    messages in particular?\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  I suspect it breaks down something like:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <code>\n     DL20\n    </code>\n    - not sure what the 20 indicates. Length of some kind?\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <code>\n     I000020\n    </code>\n    - clearly some sort of index/address\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <code>\n     V\n    </code>\n    - Marker for 'vector'/array data to follow?\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <code>\n     FF140200DE070900010001000D000100\n    </code>\n    Entry #1\n   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <p>\n    <code>\n     FF0C0200DE076E006E000300A5075904\n    </code>\n    Entry #2\n   </p>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Each entry contains a date (dd/mm/yy, probably in a weird format like 'fractional number of fortnights since first summer solstice following the Fall of Rome'), and a bunch of integer and fractional (fixed point rather than float, probably)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some fields are I think 16 bit, and little-endian (Entry#2 last 4 bytes is 0x0459 which matches observed data)\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <code>\n    C953\n   </code>\n   - Not sure, maybe checksum or CRC?
