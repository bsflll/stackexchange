I found\n  <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1684/are-there-any-free-or-low-cost-disassemblers-for-the-renesas-h8-family-of-proces\">\n   this question\n  </a>\n  that mentioned objdump supports H8300 but when I use the command I get the following error:\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   objdump: can't use supplied machine h8300\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  I guess the files does not have the right format. From what I can see, they have the following format:\n </p>\n <pre><code>BeginLine\nAddress:HexData:ChecksumByte?\nEndLine\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  I also tried to export the HexData to a bin file but I still get the same error. What is the expected format?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VgmOw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VgmOw.png\"/>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/E2eUV.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/E2eUV.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
