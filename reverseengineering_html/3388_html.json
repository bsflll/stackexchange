Or is this something I will have to manually do every time?\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

However, when I run it via terminal line with the -S flag. It comes out without the translated instructions. Is it something wrong with the way I am calling ida?   <code>./idal -B ~/Desktop/test_binary.dump -S script.py</code>?</span>",
