    "content": "<html><body><div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n <p>\n  I have a\n  <code>\n   text.txt\n  </code>\n  file and I want to read it and print its content in the Output Window of IDA Pro (Free version).\n </p>\n <p>\n  I wrote an .idc script as follows:\n </p>\n <pre><code>#include <idc.idc>\n\nstatic main() {\n    auto fp;\n    auto toPrint;\n\n    fp = fopen(\"C:\\Users\\bob\\text.txt\", \"r\"); // fp is a file handle\n\n    toPrint = fgetc(fp);\n\n    Message(\"%s is the string\n\", toPrint);\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UcTXV.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   <img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UcTXV.png\"/>\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  But it gives me an\n  <code>\n   unknown character\n  </code>\n  as shown above. I also tried using\n  <code>\n   toPrint = readstr(fp)\n  </code>\n  , but it does not work. (same unknown character)\n </p>\n <p>\n  PS: I'm analysing a 32 bit PE file. I could not use IDAPython, as I'm using the x64 free version, so I have to resort to IDC. Any help appreciated.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

This is probably an initial cause of your problem: symbols preceded by single slash are interpreted as\n   <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequences_in_C\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n    escape sequences\n   </a>\n   which means that the file name was interpreted incorrectly and was not opened.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Using\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/321.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   fgetc\n  </a>\n  in a way you did is also incorrect because it returns long or character, not a string, and Message function probably interprets is as a pointer.\nI checked this on IDA 6.9. In a later versions it is probably better to detect an EOF by\n  <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/1221.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   value_is_string\n  </a>\n  function for this.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",
