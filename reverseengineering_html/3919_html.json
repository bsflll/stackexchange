I did some really extensive testing, printing out and feeding the machine a handful of barcodes, and\n  <em>\n   it would seem\n  </em>\n  there are six bits in the barcode, not four, that control the amount. The data is available\n  <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_uBt_U6h3ikUW98nolEZqYE-iGY2-3JgZYizDbAbS6k/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  at Google Docs. The 6-bit range in question is in the middle: last 3 bits of the first byte and first 3 bits of the second byte (big-endian). Because Google Docs don't support in-cell colours, there is also a more nicely coloured Excel file uploaded\n  <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/0B6R95Kw26afzd1ZmNkk4aEljbjg/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115083121392060786441&resourcekey=0-nzaUqZo7kDoGgsgfdzwfqA&rtpof=true&sd=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\n   here\n  </a>\n  at Google Drive.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I identified two 6-bit sequences that resulted in 300 ml for Crema.\n  \n\n  For the sake of interest, I took one of the sequences and put it into the respective place of the original Espresso barcode. And there it is, I got 300 ml of Espresso.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While this was sort of a success (I'm now able to produce barcodes with correct volumes for the drinks I'm interested in), I'm still completely lost as of exactly how this works. As you can see from the experiment table, the pattern is rather fuzzy, and there are entries that give same volume from different combination of bits. I'm also not sure I'm getting the same brewing parameters with the barcodes I made.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Please share your ideas on how to understand this further.\n </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>",

So this may or may not change anything. Also, the patent mentions different cartridge charges - with soak, without soak - which may affect the volume of water in the cup, as well as steam/no steam, which isn't mentioned in the patent. Last, the blog author mentions that american cartriges seem to have high first digits while europeans have zero; this might mean some bits have no effect on the apparatus, but serve as licensee/vendor identification.\n</span>\n</body></html>",

The first one reads the barcode on the side of the T-Discs. This code is formatted using\n  <em>\n   Interleaved 2 of 5\n  </em>\n  .\n  \n\n  The other type of machine (I think it's only the T43xx, and the T55xx) reads the barcode from the front of the T-Disc, as shown in the picture from User perror. We already discovered, that this code is kind of invalid, all scanner apps and online decoder I found couldn't convert it into readable text.\n  \n\n  During my research I discovered a\n  <a href=\"http://board.gulli.com/thread/739924-s-tassimo-t-disc-barcode-von-grosser-tasse/?p=14918070#post14918070\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   german forum post\n  </a>\n  , telling that's an\n  <em>\n   invalid UPC-E\n  </em>\n  .
