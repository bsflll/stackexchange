    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Ok so let's say that a program obfuscated its IAT and i can't see it in IDA Pro. In OllyDbg there is a plugin where you press <code>Ctrl+G</code> you can search for a library function and set a breakpoint even though that function is not listed in the IAT. My question is how can i do this in IDA Pro?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n</div>",
