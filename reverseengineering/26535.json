If you want to know when the library is loaded, you may look for references to <code>System.loadLibrary(string)</code> or <code>System.load(string)</code> java functions. You might for example hook it using <a href=\"https://frida.re/docs/android/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Frida</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to see when particular functions exported by the <code>libusbhost.so</code> are called, you also may use Frida. There is prebuild tool called <a href=\"https://frida.re/docs/frida-trace/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">frida-trace</a>. For example using <code>frida-trace -U -i “Java_*” [package_name]</code>, will print out all the calls to JNI native functions from your app, along with their timestamp.</p>\n<p>If you want to alter the parameters of the called functions, modify the way they work, or replace their return values - you may find the <a href=\"https://frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#interceptor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Frida Interceptor</a> module useful.</p>\n</div>",

It probably has some problems with that, because it destroys the process immediately (from logcat, what I've seen)</span>",
