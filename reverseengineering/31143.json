    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Recently I have been given a set of assembly instructions which I must learn to understand. I know an <strong>extremely</strong> basic level of x86 assembly but I'm starting to come across more nuances that are very difficult for me to 'just google'. So I have to ask you <em>lovely</em> people.</p>\n<p>Below are the instructions</p>\n<pre><code>mov     ecx, [esp+10h+arg_0]\n...\n...\nmov     [esp+10h+arg_8], eax\n...\n...\nand     al, 0E0h\n</code></pre>\n<p>Are arg_0 and arg_8 arguments supplied to the program at runtime or arguments supplied to a function within the program? Also please help me understand what 0E0h is in the last instruction. Is that a function, memory address, or hex value? Thank you.</p>\n</div>",
