    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to make some changes to .Net dll (note: dll is mixed mode module) used by an exe, ProtectionID detected nothing, so I happily jumped into dnSpy and made changes. </p>\n<p>I ran executable with dnSpy debugger and everything was working as expected. However when I saved module and tried to run executable, it worked as if no changes were made. </p>\n<p>I double checked, but module saved correctly, and x64dbg shows that it is loaded on runtime. So how is this possible?</p>\n</div>",

I even opened modified dll in Reflector instead, changes are there. they just don't seem to affect execution if I don't use dnSpy debugger.</span>",
