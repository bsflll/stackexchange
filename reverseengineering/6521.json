    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I keep coming across a compiling pattern that IDA doesn't automatically handle well.  Consider the following example:</p>\n<pre><code>mov rax, rsp       ; Set rax at the start of the function\n...\nlea rbp, [rax-5Fh] ; Shortly afterward, set rbp as the frame pointer at a nonstandard offset\n...\nmov [rbp+3Fh], rcx ; Reference all stack offsets from rbp for the rest of the function\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example, it appears that IDA has lost track of <code>rbp</code>'s state as an offset into the stack frame, presumably because of the additional indirection.  (We copy from <code>rsp</code> to <code>rax</code> to <code>rbp</code>, rather than just from <code>rsp</code> to <code>rbp</code>)</p>\n<p>I would like the above example to look something more like this:</p>\n<pre><code>var_20= qword ptr -20h\n...\nmov [rbp+5Fh+var_20], rcx\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, as one would expect, if I change the type of <code>3Fh</code> to be a stack offset, I get the following:</p>\n<pre><code>arg_37= qword ptr 3Fh\n...\nmov [rbp+arg_37], rcx\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which is obviously not correct.  I have two questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is it possible to generate the desired output?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>If not, how would one normally deal with this?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Solutions I am aware of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I could create a structure for the stack frame and specify the offset delta (occasionally also adjusting for <a href=\"http://www.hexblog.com/?p=63\">negative offsets</a>).  The downsides are that I would have to create a structure for each stack frame I analyze, and I would also not have cross-references.</li>\n<li>I could just use the incorrect offsets in the stack frame.  This would give me cross-references, but I would expect things to break when touching <code>r</code>, the offset storing the return address.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also relevant: I'm using IDA Pro 6.2.</p>\n</div>",
