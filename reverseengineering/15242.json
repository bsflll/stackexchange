However whenever I tried to dump with ollydump, it sends error message like \"unable to read memory of debugged process\"and then \"Bad DOS signature!\"message. The question is...\n1. Is there any decent unpacking tool for aspack2.12? \n2. How to fix problem of \"unable to read memory of debugged process\"and then \"Bad DOS signature!\" in ollydbg?</p>\n</div>",
