After a highly active startup <code>WaitForDebugEvent</code> will time out(Return false) unless I click a button in B. </p>\n<p>Question: How do I get rid of the Debugger(Process A) and attach my own debugger to B ?</p>\n<p>I tried to call <code>DebugActiveProcessStop</code> by injection code into A (DLL Injection) as well as by debugging A and calling it from the thread that debugs B. (inline code injection) both ways I get <code>ACCESS_DENIED</code>!</p>\n<p>If you try to attach a 2nd debugger you get <code>Error 87 (ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER)</code>.</p>\n<p>Environment: Win 7 x64 </p>\n</div>",

Then after you have to find call GetCurrentProcessId and modify input parameter with your dummy process id. Second process you have to done before starting of new thread then after you can attach your debugger to that child process.\nI've fetched same situation in all-in-one keylogger</p>\n</div>",
