            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Frida was split into two PIP packages.  </p>\n<p>The package <code>frida</code> only contains the python bindings, while <code>frida-tools</code> also contains the familiar command line tools from earlier releases.<br/>\nThis is explained in <a href=\"https://frida.re/news/2018/07/12/frida-12-0-released/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the news post for the 12.0 release</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>CLI tools</strong></p>\n<p>One thing that caused a bit of confusion in the past was the fact that\n  our Python bindings also came with some CLI tools. Frida is a toolkit\n  for building tools, and even though we provide a few sample tools it\n  should be up to you if you want to have them installed.</p>\n<p>Up until now this meant anyone building a tool using our Python\n  bindings would end up depending on colorama, prompt-toolkit, and\n  pygments, because our CLI tools happen to depend on those.</p>\n<p>Well, that changes now. If you do:</p>\n<p><code>$ pip install frida</code></p>\n<p>You will now only get our Python bindings. Nothing more. And this\n  package has zero dependencies.</p>\n<p>The CLI tools might still be useful to you, though, so to install\n  those do:</p>\n<p><code>$ pip install frida-tools</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
