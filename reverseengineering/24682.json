    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I want to make a small tool that analyzes text from console in online game and I'm stuck at reading a string from a function and sending it to another program. I managed to find function that takes string as argument and calls function responsible for showing it in game and it looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>void Game::processTextMessage(Otc::MessageMode mode, const std::string&amp; text)\n{\n    g_lua.callGlobalField(\"g_game\", \"onTextMessage\", mode, text);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also, using Cheat Engine and x96dgb i found address of this function:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8XCSc.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"asm code\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8XCSc.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>String I need to capture is \"Czerw pozostawia po sobie: 3 robaki\". \nI tried .dll injection but I don't know how to hook to that function.\nAlso I found something similar to what I want to do: <a href=\"https://github.com/ur0/DotATranslator/blob/master/Injectee/dllmain.cpp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/ur0/DotATranslator/blob/master/Injectee/dllmain.cpp</a>\nbut I don't know what to change to make it work. What steps should I take?</p>\n</div>",
