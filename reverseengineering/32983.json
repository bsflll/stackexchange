    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I want to export the symbol addresses from all loaded modules in x64dbg. I know I can do this DLL-by-DLL from the Symbols tab (click on one module &gt; right click in table &gt; Copy &gt; Export Table), but I want to do all of them at once. It doesn't matter if they're exported it one big file, or one file per module.</p>\n<p>I can't find any command that does this. Have I missed one? <code>labellist</code> only shows labels I've defined myself.</p>\n<p>I tried exporting the database, which is easily parseable JSON, but I don't see labels from system DLLs there, only labels in the main EXE module. This seemed promising but is missing the key info I want.</p>\n</div>",
