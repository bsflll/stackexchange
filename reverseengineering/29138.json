    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have the code below, derived from the reversed function in the original application:</p>\n<pre><code>gladius::world::World::create(*(gladius::world::World**)(*(char*)(this + 0x5e8) + 0x50));\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <em>create</em> function looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>void __thiscall gladius::world::World::create(World *this) {\n</code></pre>\n<p>Could someone please describe the way the function is setup and may be simplify the notation above if possible?</p>\n<p>So, this is a <em>create</em> function call, which takes as an argument the pointer to a particular address.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How the pointer address is calculated in this case?</li>\n<li>What is the exact meaning of (this + 0x5e8) + 0x50 - 0x5e8 offset to <em>this</em> and then 12th element of the structure (i.e. structure of 4 bytes - address 48? )</li>\n<li>What 0x5e8 represents in this case (apart of being an offset, I mean what this offset could possibly point to)?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is how it looks further in the code:</p>\n<pre><code>    this_01 = GUI::getWorld(*(GUI **)(this + 0x88));\n    gladius::world::World::create(this_01);\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>GUI::getWorld(*(GUI **)(this + 0x88));</code> points to the following function:</p>\n<pre><code>World * __thiscall gladius::gui::GUI::getWorld(GUI *this)\n\n{\n  return *(World **)(*(longlong *)(this + 0x5e8) + 0x50);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is where the address (this + 0x5e8) + 0x50) came from.</p>\n<p>I still don't understand the significance of these addresses, as <em>create</em> is a member function of World and it is called with an instance of that class as a parameter?</p>\n<p>And the address of that instance is stored in class GUI on the address: (this + 0x5e8) + 0x50)?</p>\n<p>Or I am confusing the above and this + 0x5e8 points to some structure in the World class, which must be somewhere at 58/4 or at 58/8 address and then within that structure I am looking at 50/4 member?</p>\n</div>",
