    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a PE executable (32 bit) GUI program and I tried to reverse engineer it. I opened it in Ghidra and discovered the <code>entry</code> calls <code>wWinMainCRTStartup</code>. However, when I checked <code>wWinMainCRTStartup</code> all the bytes are filed with <code>??</code> and when I tried to disassemble it Ghidra says <code>Can't disassemble uninitialized memory</code>. I'm confused... if the memory is uninitialized then how can the program run at all? But the program does run.</p>\n</div>",
