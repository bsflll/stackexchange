    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have the STM32L151's firmware that I extracted via JTAG, but I cannot find a start point in IDA. I have tried two methods:</p>\n<p>1) I start IDA, drag the binary into the workspace, select ARM Little-endian for the processor type, click ok, the disassembly memory organization window appears, entered in relevant information found <a href=\"http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/66/71/4b/23/94/c3/42/c8/CD00277537.pdf/files/CD00277537.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00277537.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> on page 48, click ok, windows pops up saying \"IDA can not identify the entry point...\", in the workspace I see \"RAM:08000000        DCB [some hex number]\"</p>\n<p>2) Converted the binary to elf using my arm toolchain's objcopy, used \"readelf -h [my binary file]\" to find the entry point, got <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/55NPVDhh\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> output where the entry point is 0xff810000, dragged the elf into IDA's workspace, selected ARM Little-endian processor under processor type, clicked ok, and the workspace shows lines that look like \".data:0000002C        [several hex values separated by commas]\"</p>\n<p>If I try to jump to the entry point address (0xff810000 from readelf) I get an JumpAsk fail. How do I find my start point so I can start reading the disassembled ARM assembly code?</p>\n</div>",
