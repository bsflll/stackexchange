Using this setup I have been able to acquire good pcap from most samples, but this one is a bit vexing.</p>\n<p>I can see that my sample is reaching out over TCP to the correct C2 server, but ICMP returns \"destination unreachable (network unreachable)\". I went ahead and used route/iptables as described in this post: <a href=\"https://techanarchy.net/blog/installing-and-configuring-inetsim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://techanarchy.net/blog/installing-and-configuring-inetsim</a> but now I'm finding it difficult to find the traffic since it's all to my IP in wireshark, and it seems to be ssl encrypted.</p>\n<p>Where do I go from here?</p>\n</div>",
