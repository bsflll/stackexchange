    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am planning to do some reverse engineering on an application that was written in a object oriented way. And now I'm kind of curious what a C++ class would look like in assembly. I already found out the basics about functions and their calling conventions. But classes are probably way more complex, right?</p>\n<p>So let's say we have this class:</p>\n<pre><code>class Rectangle {\n    int width, height;\n  public:\n    void set_values (int,int);\n    int area() {return width*height;}\n};\n\nvoid Rectangle::set_values (int x, int y) {\n  width = x;\n  height = y;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>and this object:</p>\n<pre><code>Rectangle rect;\nrect.set_values (3,4);\n</code></pre>\n<p>What would/could it look like in assembly?</p>\n</div>",
