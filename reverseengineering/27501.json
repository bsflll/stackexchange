    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>My research requires processing memory traces of applications. For C/C++ programs, this is easy using Intel's PIN library. However, as suggested here <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51835532/use-intel-pin-to-instrument-python-scripts\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51835532/use-intel-pin-to-instrument-python-scripts</a>, I may need to instrument the Python runtime itself, which I'm not sure will represent the true memory behavior of a given python script due to some overheads(If this is not the case, please comment). Some of the existing python memory profilers only talk about the runtime memory \"usage\" in terms of the heap space usage, etc.</p>\n<p>I ended up making an executable from my python script using PyInstaller and running my PINTool over it. However, I'm not sure if this is the right approach.</p>\n<p>Is there any way(any library or any hack into the python runtime) that may help in getting the memory traces accessed by the python scripts?</p>\n</div>",
