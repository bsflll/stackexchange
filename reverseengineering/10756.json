This undocumented number was a way for the system to differentiate the different types of Windows binaries, something that became a requirement for Windows RT as part of its requirement to prohibit the execution of Windows “desktop” applications.</p>\n<p>How this signature level are determined on what basis ? Is that flag passed to CreateProcess or kernel handles this ?</p>\n</div>",

There are no special flags passed to <code>CreateProcess()</code>, but <code>PspCreateProcess()</code> (a kernel function that's executed as a result of <code>CreateProcess()</code>) extracts and validates the signing level from the executed image's certificate.</p>\n</div>",
