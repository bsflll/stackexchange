(the 4 bytes after \"data\")<br/>\nThe key changes every 512 bytes, so if they are set in advance you would need 625520 stored keys. This is of course very unlikely.<br/>\nI think only the first key is frozen, the others can be just the XOR of the first 2 bytes of each group of 512 bytes.<br/>\nTo verify it would require a greater number of data, at least 1Mb, or better the complete zipped file.</p>\n</div>",
