The specific MSR is IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS2 and I believe unrestricted guest is bit 7 in the secondary proc controls VMCS field.\"</p>\n<p>i don't know if powershell or wmic will show it.  I know win7 32bit has debug(which might possible show it?  I know debug can show some registers, I have once used debug to move a value into the AX register), though i'm on win7 64bit and that doesn't have debug.  </p>\n<p>Perhaps somebody that knows a bit of assembly can show what assembler one needs to install and what lines to run, to display the bits of that register?</p>\n</div>",
