    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am currently writing a plugin for the Hex-Ray's Decompiler to be used on IDA 6.2. The basic gist is that it is supposed to get the decompiled functions and run some automated analysis on it, nothing exceptional.</p>\n<p>My issue is that apparently IDA redefines the function <code>vsscanf</code> in the <code>pro.h</code> file, which is already defined in <code>stdio.h</code>.</p>\n<p>Precisely, the snippet that does this is as follows (lines 426-428 in the <code>pro.h</code> file):</p>\n<pre><code>// non standard functions are missing:\n#ifdef _MSC_VER\nAS_SCANF(2, 0) int idaapi vsscanf(const char *input, const char *format, va_list va);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, I am honestly at loss as to how to resolve this issue and could not find any decent leads searching the web. I tried compiling this with MS Visual Studio 2013 on Win7 x64. But, with no success.</p>\n<p>My best lead is that IDA will try this definition when compiling with MSVS. \n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70013/how-to-detect-if-im-compiling-code-with-visual-studio-2008\">As seen here</a>.</p>\n<p>One of my considerations is to try and change the <code>pro.h</code> file. But, I am really not sure how that would work out.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your time in advance.</p>\n<p>Edit: I solved this by reverting to MSVS 2010. Apparently IDA 6.2/sdk 6.2 is not compatible with the modern MSVS 2013.</p>\n</div>",

After some search in the pro.h preprocessors i found that apparently when running in MSVS IDA will include stdio.h on its own, which is very curious to me by setting the USE_DANGEROUS_FUNCTIONS variable. These are my includes:  #include &lt;hexrays.hpp&gt; #include &lt;kernwin.hpp&gt; #include &lt;ida.hpp&gt; #include &lt;idp.hpp&gt; #include &lt;funcs.hpp&gt; #include &lt;gdl.hpp&gt; #include &lt;segment.hpp&gt;</span>",
