Is it encrypted or decrypted? How do we determine this?</p>\n<p>Please kindly advise and assist.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DCxRvA4E.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Bluetooth\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DCxRvA4E.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

If Xamarin/MAUI is used it is getting more complicated, and even worse if react native is used. You have to see is and which framework is used in your app.</p>\n<p>The HCI snoop log is a good start, but personally I prefer a rooted device and some <a href=\"https://frida.re\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Frida</a> hooks like <a href=\"https://github.com/optiv/blemon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">blemon</a> to capture Bluetooth traffic. In combination with the knowledge from decompiling you can extend the frida script with own hooks to see the data before it is encoded into the BLE packets.</p>\n</div>",
