    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have been discussing the effectiveness of GNU libc's <code>fclose()</code> function to thwart successful exploitation of trivial vulnerabilities due to segmentation fault when called without a valid pointer to a FILE data structure (implementations of libc on other operating systems fail silently). For instance, given a simple vulnerable function using <code>strcpy()</code> such as:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\nvoid\nfoo(const char *str)\n{\n  char buffer[256];\n  int ret = 123456;\n\n  FILE *fp = tmpfile();\n  strcpy(buffer, str);\n  if (ret != 500)\n    fclose(fp);\n}\n\nint \nmain(int argc, const char **argv)\n{\n  foo(argv[1]);\n  return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Even when compiled with most memory-protection mechanisms disabled:</p>\n<pre><code>cc -m32 -ggdb -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -z norelro main.c\n</code></pre>\n<p>The function, regardless of being overwritten up to <code>EIP</code> would never return since:</p>\n<pre><code>(gdb) r $(python -c \"print 'A' * 286\")\nProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n0xf7e3e307 in fclose@@GLIBC_2.1 () from /lib/libc.so.6\n(gdb) ba\n#0  0xf7e3e307 in fclose@@GLIBC_2.1 () from /lib/libc.so.6\n#1  0x080484bc in foo (str=0x41414141 &lt;error: Cannot access memory...\n#2  0x41414141 in ?? ()\n#3  0x41414141 in ?? ()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Could there be a way to achieve code execution for such trivial function?. Since the <code>ret</code> variable can be overwritten, can it be set to 500 so that the if condition which determines if <code>fclose()</code> is called or not could be bypassed?</p>\n</div>",

The assumption of the ordering was on purpose, the overflow should rewrite <code>fp</code> address. Regarding <code>fclose()</code> always throwing an exception when invalid pointers are given, I couldn't bruteforce a single address that did not ended on SIGSEGV, but sometimes advances up to FILE-&gt;_IO_file_close.</span>",
