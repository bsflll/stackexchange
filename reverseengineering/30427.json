    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>The program I'm messing with has builtin logging. Using a proxy DLL, I managed to activate it by calling the right functions from the real DLL. However, I got stuck at using the actual logging functions, as the program crashes with Error 0xC0000142 whenever I get close to using them.</p>\n<p>Here's what I'm doing in my proxy DLL:</p>\n<pre><code>typedef void (*FDLAddr_t)(void);\nFDLAddr_t ForceDebugLog;\n\ntypedef void (*LIAddr_t)(char const *, ...);\nLIAddr_t LogInfo;\n\nvoid setupFuncs() {\n    HMODULE trueDll= GetModuleHandleA(\".\\\\trueDll.dll\");\n    ForceDebugLog = (FDLAddr_t)GetProcAddress(trueDll, \"?ForceDebugLog@@YAXXZ\");\n    // LogInfo = (LIAddr_t)GetProcAddress(trueDll, \"?LogInfo@@YAXPBDZZ\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, I can just do <code>ForceDebugLog();</code> and logging gets enabled. However, as soon as I uncomment the <code>LogInfo</code> line, the program crashes on startup with Windows showing the error 0xc0000142.</p>\n<p>Further experimentation shows that <code>GetProcAddress</code> returns the address of <code>LogInfo</code> in the DLL. Also, the line appears to be fine if <code>LogInfo</code> was a <code>FARPROC</code>, as that works without a problem. As soon as I add the cast to <code>LIAddr_t</code>, the error comes back.</p>\n<p>How can I work around this issue? Or do I need to take a different approach? All binaries involved are 32 bit.</p>\n</div>",

As it turns out, some old object files from earlier experiments were accidentally linked into the DLL. One of the experiments was a reimplementation of LogInfo which caused the compiler/linker to produce an incorrect result.</p>\n</div>",
