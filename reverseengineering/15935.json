After setting a genymotion station and made a proxy, I've discovered that the game won't start if the certificate doesn't match with the one that is set in the app.</p>\n<p>So my question is how I can go further?</p>\n</div>",

As an aside, you could statically analyze the APK by unpacking/decompressing it, then comb through its files looking for relevant strings.</p>\n<p>Back to Cheat Engine, you could ultimately write a script in Assembly or Lua to automate certain tasks--or you could just change certain values in memory if there is weak server validation (or none at all).</p>\n<p>Perhaps a significantly easier solution all around is to use something like <a href=\"https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">AutoIt</a>, which would allow you to script mouse movements and keystrokes. At that rate, all you have to do is install the game in the emulator, then script whatever process(es) you need to script for automation.</p>\n</div>",
