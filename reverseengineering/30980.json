    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am working on a <strong>highly obfuscated</strong> driver that is <strong>virtualized</strong>. In an attempt to work on this driver I asked a question about some python scripts which turned out not to be effective at all so I decided to delete that question and ask my question directly by explaining all the details so maybe I can find a better solution for my problem.</p>\n<p>Driver size is about <code>3mb</code> and it is <strong>packed</strong> and when it's loaded on memory it gets around <code>6mb</code> which shows how much <strong>garbage code</strong> is actually there, it used anti static analysis methods like <strong>jumping to different locations by register</strong>, calling <code>API</code> functions using <code>push</code> and <code>ret</code> instructions and getting <code>API</code> addresses using <strong>brute force</strong> and many more methods that I am not aware.</p>\n<p>Now when I am using <code>windbg</code> to analyze the driver I tried the <code>ta</code> instruction which was suggested in the previous question about python script, <strong>even 6 hours</strong> was not enough to get to that address. As a result I thought about the ideas below but I am not sure if they are working or if there is any open source tool for these ideas so I would really appreciate it if anyone can give me a solution to this problem.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Using <code>DTrace</code> is one of the ideas that I tried, the problem is, driver detecting both\n<strong>debugger</strong> and my <strong>virtual machine</strong> so when I am using <code>sc</code> command to run the driver, its getting\nclosed immediately so I do not know how can I use <code>DTrace</code> since I am not familiar that much\nwith the tool.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Using or writing an <code>IRP</code> tracker so I can find out what functions get called when I am using <code>sc</code> command. I found out\nOSR has a tool for this purpose but sadly it is not working for windows 11 but maybe there\nis an open source tool for this idea.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Tldr; Working on a virtualized and heavily mutated driver with tons of fake calls that hide all import functions and getting addresses using brute forcing memory I need a way to find all those functions.</p>\n</div>",

I say driver but this sounds like a rootkit or endpoint security product.</span>",
