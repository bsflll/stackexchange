Hex Rays found that there's a variable which is set to specific value, thus there's no need to display the branches where the code will never be run, so it warns me about the optimizations:</p>\n<pre><code>conditional instruction was optimized away because of '%var_8.1==0'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is there any way to make it show all the code branches and stop optimizing it?</p>\n</div>",

See the image bellow:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lVJKO.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"hexrays optimization\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lVJKO.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Either <code>code_compress_magic</code> or <code>Signature</code> must be set as a <code>volatile</code> type. This will make Hexrays decompiler happy.</p>\n</div>",
