I know I can create patches in OllyDbg and similar tools, but they all have one thing in common: I have to overwrite some present code in file. I wonder if it is possible to somehow enlarge the executable, put the code in the appended part, and then just change a few instructions in original part to <code>jmp</code> to the new part? I searched over the Internet, but I haven't found an obvious solution (well, some propose writing code in NOP sections, but my code i longer than the longest of them).</p>\n<p>Note that the PE is 64-bit, so the solution must work for this architecture.</p>\n</div>",
