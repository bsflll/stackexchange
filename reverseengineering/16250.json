The original shellcode does not include any <code>ret</code> (<code>0xc3</code>), so there are none in the decompiled asm. The thing is that when you ask <code>gdb</code> to disassemble 14 instructions, it disassembles 14 instructions interpreting the content of the memory as if it was instructions.</p>\n<p>As a proof of what I say, here is a disassembly of the instruction <code>add %al,(%ecx)</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>$ rasm2 -a x86 -C 'add %al,(%ecx)'\n\"\\xc0\\x00\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which is, in fact, <code>\"\\x00\\xc0\"</code> (because of the endianness) and where the first <code>\"\\x00\"</code> is, in fact, the final character of the shellcode string.</p>\n<p>The following characters are very likely the code of the <code>main</code> function or whatever is in the memory at this place.</p>\n<p>Anyway, reread more carefully the answer of Igor (he's right!).</p>\n</div>",
