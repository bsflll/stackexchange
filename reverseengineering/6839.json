The \"root/jailbreak\" solution is true but as per my knowledge the jailbreak is not yet available for Windows Phone 8.  I have been searching since long and have come to the conclusion that currently my question has no solution unless any jailbreak is available or else the device has a zero-day ;-).  The only solution left is to get the Developer version of the app in order to proceed further.</span>",

You can read the first comment to that question. It is true, I tried it. New formats come encrypted and can't be simply renamed and opened.</span>",
