    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Got this Digital Keychain Photo viewer thingy. Comes with the DPFMate.exe software, which does not run under Windows 10. So far I've confirmed, that it runs perfectly on what they avertise - Windows XP. But no-one has that nowadays, so windows &gt;7 would be great to get working. Have tried compatibility mode, to no success.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know where or how DPFMate places the images on the keychain, so I could possibly write my own program to do the move? I've heard it's some special protocol aswell... Or happens to have a version that runs on newer systems?</p>\n<p>Program available here: <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qym0okbfrndl8cx/AAADqBjp_i5PyJ8yyAo_YVWDa?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qym0okbfrndl8cx/AAADqBjp_i5PyJ8yyAo_YVWDa?dl=0</a></p>\n</div>",

A good starting point would be to attach the program to this thread.</span>",

If you download oracle virtualbox and set up a winxp guest you can use the DPFMate software. Just preload your photos on the VM and attach the USB photo frame USB device to the VM.</p>\n<p>Note; my antivirus says that DPFMate is a trojan virus, you may have issues with your antivirus disabling the usb. If despite this warning, you still want to go ahead, you can also set up your XP guest to discard changes when you reboot. You can just delete the virtual disk when you are done too. Also disable the network on the VM, trojans allow remote access.</p>\n<p>However, unless you know what you are doing and accept the risks, don't disable your antivirus! :)</p>\n<p>Another idea, if anyone wants to test this, is a winPE or bartPE environment. Make a XP PE CD and boot from that.. (basically a lite windows environment that boots from cd, so it's readonly! Unplug your HDD.) Let us know if it works!</p>\n</div>",
