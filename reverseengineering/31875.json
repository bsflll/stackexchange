    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>While reverse engineering an Android process, I wanted to explore the openat function. I noticed that there is a symbol \"openat\" and another symbol \"__openat\". What is the difference between these two?</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if I use <code>info function openat</code>, I can see more openat related symbols. Can someone also explain what are the differences between these?</p>\n<pre><code>__dl___openat_2\n__dl___openat\n__openat_2@plt\nopenat\nopenat64\n__openat_2\n__openat\n__openat_2@plt\n__openat_2@plt\nopenattr\n__openat_2@plt\nsun.nio.fs.UnixNativeDispatcher.openatSupported\nopenat@plt\nJava_sun_nio_fs_UnixNativeDispatcher_openat0\n__openat_2@plt\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n<p>Suppose I want to get a function pointer to openat, I can do this inside Android Studio</p>\n<pre><code>    int (*getptr)(int, const char*, int, ...);\n    getptr = openat;\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, I cannot do it for __openat since this function does not seem to exist.</p>\n<p>At least this is one difference between the two that I know.</p>\n</div>",
