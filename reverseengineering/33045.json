Apparently it's part of their anti-debugging attempts. (On Linux some such software I've seen drops a <code>coredump_filter</code> instead, in <code>/proc</code>.)</p>\n<p>I've looked at the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmiadap\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Win docs</a> for <code>wmiadap</code> but I don't quite understand the point:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The WmiPerfClass provider updates WMI Performance Counter Classes only when a new performance object is added. You still can run Wmiadap with the /r switch to parse the Windows Driver Model drivers to create performance objects. The /f switch still forces an update of the WMI classes from the performance libraries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <code>/t</code> flag is not documented (there, by MS).</p>\n<p>How does that <code>wmiadap.exe /f /t /r</code> help with anti-debugging?</p>\n</div>",
