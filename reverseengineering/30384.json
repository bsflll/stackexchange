    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm currently practicing with WinDBG by playing around with a notepad trace. During recording the trace I have opened notepad, typed in \"AAAABBBB\" waited a few secs and then stopped the recording.</p>\n<p>Now I'm trying to find this string or byte pattern x41 x41 x41 x41 x42 ... in the memory trace.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know if this it is possible to search the whole trace (instead current memory image)? I looked at the commands using dx @$curprocess.TTD  but there wasn't something useful, so maybe I can modify a query like this:</p>\n<pre><code>dx @$curprocess.TTD.Events.Where(t =&gt; t.Type == \"ModuleLoaded\").Where(t =&gt; t.Module.Name.Contains(\"bcrypt\"))\n</code></pre>\n<p>But there aren't any helpful commands at first sight. So in the end I would like to search for pattern which appears at any time in the memory.</p>\n<p>I would be grateful for any suggestions.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n</div>",
