Technically this is also true for Windows at the NT native API level - much more so than it lets on - but this means first and foremost that a path can be accessed uniformly through a common root. This is true on Windows (<code>\\ </code> -&gt; <code>\\REGISTRY</code> and <code>\\GLOBAL??\\C:</code>) as well as Unix. My guess is that a driver exists that populates whatever is in there and you can use standard read/write to interact with that data. <code>/proc</code> and <code>/sys</code> are not much different in that respect. But I didn't see <i>that</i> exact system, no.</span>",
