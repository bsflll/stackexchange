I'm unclear on what the author means in this line of disassembly <em><strong>\"lea edi,[ebp-0xcc]  ; getting the lowest address of stack frame\"</strong></em>. Dumping the headers of the executable I see the following in the OPTIONAL HEADER VALUES: <em><strong>100000 size of stack reserve 1000.</strong></em> Windows Threads default stack size is 1MB so I'm believe the values from dumpbin are in units of Kilo.</p>\n<p>Can you please clarify this statement:\n<em><strong>lea edi,[ebp-0xcc]   ; getting the lowest address of stack frame</strong></em></p>\n<pre><code>push ebp            ; establishing stack frame \nmov ebp,esp         ; save stack pointer in ebp\nsub esp,0xcc        ; creating stack frame for local variables\npush ebx            ; saving registers that might be used\npush esi            ; outside\npush edi            ;                                     \nlea edi,[ebp-0xcc]  ; getting the lowest address of stack frame \nmov ecx,0x33        ; filling stack frame with 0xCC\nmov eax,0xcccccccc  ; \nrep stosd           ;\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
