Aditionally, some critical applications run on the baremetal, while common user programs run on virtual memory</li>\n<li>RAM contents are unencrypted. Using a hardware set-up, I have memory dumps.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, I have the memory dumps. What would be an efficient approach? </p>\n<p>First I believe loading it with IDA (or r2) could be helpful.

I can find strings, references to strings of programs that run in the system, etc... I guess I can also find code (like .text sections in PC but whatever are called in this system) which I should be able to reverse. Is this theory right? if so, how to put it in practice? how can I find pieces of code? I have tried entropy, which seems to be quite useful; code tends to have high entropy. Technically speaking, how would I load that code in IDA properly?</p>\n<p>Everything is welcome</p>\n<p>EDIT: Run binwalk over the ram dumps.

I think there is a MMU, because the system is known to have NX bit / DEP protection. Also some apps or small apps (applets) run in virtualized memory, while important applications, like system settings, updates.. run in the baremetal. Concerning your answer, this thing you say about retrieving page tables sounds very interesting, how would that work? Btw, my dumps are raw physical dumps of the RAM chip (actually a FCRam chip). I also have FCRam dumps done via exploit by other person and they are the same thing.</span>",

I think that (obviously) the RAM dumps are not enough to have a 100% insight of the system, but sure a lot of information since most programs memory is there. Other devices (hmm for example the NAND memory, other flash memories, etc..) should be accessible through physical addresses, so obviously those contents are not in my dumps. This is pretty interesting!</span>",

I can't provide a concrete example at the moment, sorry. Something easier: you could force to disassemble every words, trying with both Arm and Thumb. Arm instructions usually contain the 0xEX on the instruction, like: XXXXXXEX XXXXXXEX XXXXXXEX ...</span>",

The idea is just to see if there's code inside your dump. You will probably have to start from scratch and define code more precisely afterward. Regarding the image base, I'd suggest to find jump table (switch) and from the case code below and the jump table addresses you could figure the image base.</span>",

It should be a standard package in your Linux distro of choice, so a simple yum install or apt-get install should do it.  That might identify full binary files in your dump, which will be easier to analyze.</span>",
