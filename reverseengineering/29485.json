Is there any way to quiet it so it won't show the context automatically (unless prompted <code>context</code>)?</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<h1>UPDATE</h1>\n<p>Since there's no out of the box answer, I'll take, for the bounty, a custom or roll-your-own solution (e.g. a script or special command).</p>\n</div>",

In the absence of that, we can invoke those commands manually.  Note that gdb doesn't seem to allow nested <code>define</code>s, so we can't script the (re)<code>define</code>s themselves.</p>\n</div>",
