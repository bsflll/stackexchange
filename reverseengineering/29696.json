    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a custom chromium browser build which has a bunch of \"native\" functions which I would like to have definitions for.</p>\n<p>Apparently, these are registered as en extension using this function: <code>Chromium.Remote.CfrRuntime.RegisterExtension(System.String,System.String,Chromium.Remote.CfrV8Handler)</code> which I was able to find in the ChromiumFX.dll.</p>\n<p>I found this in the definition:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Register a new V8 extension with the specified JavaScript extension\ncode and handler. Functions implemented by the handler are prototyped\nusing the keyword 'native'. The calling of a native function is\nrestricted to the scope in which the prototype of the native function\nis defined. This function may only be called on the render process\nmain thread.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm a total reverse engineering noob so don't really know what I'm doing. I found the function using dnSpy but that's about it.</p>\n<p>I tried looking into extracting the function definitions right from Chrome but apparently in the build they're using you can't do that. Or at least I couldn't find a way.</p>\n<p>Is there a somewhat easy way of achieving what I want?</p>\n</div>",
