    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>As I am using the radare2 for reverse engineering, I find it very difficult to get all the register values instruction by instruction with the help of the Radare2 tool. Could someone please help me to identify the solution for the above said with the help of Radare2?</p>\n<p>If it is not possible with radare2, could you please suggest some other tool that can do it (apart from OllyDbg. Since it is available in GUI mode, I need some tool that can be handled from the terminal (CLI))</p>\n</div>",
