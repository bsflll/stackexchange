    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Sometimes, I see how someone puts on the github, some reverse engineering project for some famous game.</p>\n<p>By researching these projects - I come to the conclusion that:\npeople just took the code from the <strong>exe</strong> and brought it gradually to an external <strong>dll</strong> - so they gradually tested the code.\nIn the end, from the main <strong>exe</strong> - they had only a small launcher and <strong>crt</strong>, and the rest of the place, of course, was filled with <code>nop</code> instructions.\nThey took out the code itself via copy / paste to <strong>MASM</strong>, and then, the resulting <strong>COFF</strong> obj-files, were added to the project with their new <strong>dll</strong>. (<code>code reuse</code>?)</p>\n<p>I also have a game project in which I found 3 statically linked libraries in the exe.</p>\n<p>Thus, I would also like to get acquainted with this technique in more detail and take it into my arsenal.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>If any of you are very familiar with this technique, please share your experience.</p>\n</div>",
