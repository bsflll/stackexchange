However, while the Mac version has export symbols, the Windows version exports by ordinal. The Mac version uses the PPC architecture making it more difficult to reverse.</p>\n<p>Is there any way to heuristically compare these subroutines and copy the export symbols from the Mac version to the Windows version so that I can view them within IDA Pro for the Windows version?</p>\n</div>",
