    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am thinking of buying IDA Pro for my Linux programming environment after reverse engineering a bit with OllyDBG (under <a href=\"http://winehq.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">WINE</a>)... But before I endorse into such a costly purchase I ask the following question(s):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If I have native IDA Pro on Linux, can it disassemble/decompile a Windows PE (or Mac OS X apps as a bonus)?</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If not, when I multi boot Windows, can I download the Windows version of IDA on the Windows without purchasing it again?</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Motive</h1>\n<p>Some renowned programs I'd like to reverse (for fun) are Windows executables, so if it can't disassemble a Windows executable from Linux, I'll have to multi boot (tedious)</p>\n<h1>Note</h1>\n<p>If it helps, I have a 32-bit machine with a x86 processor</p>\n</div>",

You can disassemble <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/file_formats.shtml\">all file formats</a> on all three platforms. You can definitely analyze PE and Mach-O files on Linux. Most debuggers are also <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/debugger/index.shtml\">available on all platforms</a>.</p>\n<p>A couple of features are available only in the Windows version:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WinDbg and Symbian debuggers</li>\n<li>WinCE debugging over ActiveSync</li>\n<li>PDB symbol parsing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: the last function is available on Linux and OS X if you can run the <code>win32_remote.exe</code> debugger on a Windows system/emulator.</p>\n</div>",

There are .pdf forms that break out the pricing for IDA/IDA Pro. You must purchase the Linux and Windows version separately. As far as I understand, the disassemblers for IDA/IDA Pro are the same across platforms. You can see the differences in included disassemblers per edition <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/processors.shtml#starter\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. As one of the other answers to this question has pointed out, some of the integrated debuggers are not included on non-Windows versions.</p>\n</div>",

IDA uses some Microsoft dll's for parsing.</p>\n<p>Another point:\nAs IDA is a 32bit application (even the 64bit disassembler) you always have to use remote debuggers for handling 64bit applications.</p>\n<p>IDA works well for me with Wine under Linux. So I bought the Windows version to have all the features and use it either native under Windows or via Wine(Crossover) under Linux.</p>\n</div>",
