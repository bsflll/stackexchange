    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Need help in figuring out the checksum used for this small data packet.\nPacket is 48 bits long, I already have figured out most of the bits. Least 8 bits change even if there is a single bit change in rest of the packet. So I'm guessing this must be some sort of checksum. Tried all checksum algorithms I know of and nothing fits.</p>\n<p>The packet is question is RF transmission being send by a motion sensor (history below). The bits are,</p>\n<pre><code>4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np p p p p s s s 0 0 m t 1 i i i i i i i i 1 i i i i i i i i 1 i i i i i i i i 1 c c c c c c c c\n\n\np = Preamble (11111), helps is demodulating the signal by providing enough transitions.\ns = Some sort of status (only changed when sensor was initializing after power up)\nm = '1' When motion is detected.\nt = '1' when tamper switch is pressed.\ni = Unique sensor ID which is also printed on the back of the sensor.\nc = These bits change whenever any of the other bit change. I'm guessing this is checksum.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed 0's and 1's may very well be some other status reporting, which\njust don't change in case of motion sensor.</li>\n<li>ID (i) is embedded in the packet at non-byte offsets. It seems like\nID is embedded as '1' followed by 8-bits, maybe the protocol\nwas originally designed for octadecimal.</li>\n<li>This transmission does not seem to be using any rolling code. Its\nalways the same.</li>\n<li>This is over 10 years old system, I don't expect it to using anything\ncomplicated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example packets that I have captured for three different sensors are,</p>\n<pre><code>FA 19 D4 3E 3B A7 (11111010 00011001 11010100 00111110 00111011 10100111)\nF9 29 D4 3E 3B EE (11111001 00101001 11010100 00111110 00111011 11101110)\nF9 39 D4 3E 3B 44 (11111001 00111001 11010100 00111110 00111011 01000100)\n\nFC 29 D4 C7 11 D4 (11111100 00101001 11010100 11000111 00010001 11010100)\nF9 39 D4 C7 11 19 (11111001 00111001 11010100 11000111 00010001 00011001)\nF9 29 D4 C7 11 B3 (11111001 00101001 11010100 11000111 00010001 10110011)\nFA 19 D4 C7 11 FA (11111010 00011001 11010100 11000111 00010001 11111010)\n\nF9 29 AE 8E DF 57 (11111001 00101001 10101110 10001110 11011111 01010111)\nF9 39 AE 8E DF FD (11111001 00111001 10101110 10001110 11011111 11111101)\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>This is no hacking or anything like that.

I can try to code something up to make sure I didn't miss anything. Regarding steady state change, as I mentioned there is no counter/rolling code sort of thing. Once the motion stops or tamper switch is back to original state, it re transmits the same old data and the same old checksum (I know its not really good for a security sensor)</span>",
