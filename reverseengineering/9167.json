    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am currently working on both a plugin and an ida-python script that export fairly big JSON files.</p>\n<p>I just noticed, that both will at times cut off the output files with no error message. Sometimes they will cut off at 8192 Characters and sometimes at roughly 220000 Characters. What is of particular interest to me is the fact that the files are constructed differently.</p>\n<p>In the C++ Plugin I open a filepointer and construct the JSON-Data while cycling through my sample like this:</p>\n<pre><code>FILE *fp;\nfp = qfopen(\"C:\\\\output.json\" ,\"w\");\nqfprintf(fp,\"{\\\"filename\\\": \\\"%s\\\", \\\"functions\\\":[ \", filename);\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the Python Script I construct a (big) dictionary and use </p>\n<pre><code>fn=GetInputFile()+'.json'\nf=open(fn,'w')\nf.write(json.dumps(jsonfunc))\n</code></pre>\n<p>Of course I will need my output file intact, but I can't find any help googling. Still I feel like I'm missing something really trivial.</p>\n<p>Best regards</p>\n<p>Edit: Fixed by using </p>\n<pre><code>qflush(fp) //&lt;-within the workloop\nqfclose(fp)\n</code></pre>\n<p>and for the python script respectively:</p>\n<pre><code>f.close()\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
