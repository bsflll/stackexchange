    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>There have been numerous sites stated in this wonderful <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/206/where-can-i-as-an-individual-get-malware-samples-to-analyze\">post</a> that one could retrieve malware samples. However, I am having a difficult time (sorry D:) locating Linux-specific malware from those sites as mostly are samples for Windows (I think). Where can I find and download these Linux samples that I seek?</p>\n<p>BTW, this is for learning to create ClamAV and YARA signatures.</p>\n</div>",
