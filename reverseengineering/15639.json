    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So, lately I've been working on a project involving malware which gets spread via MS Office documents and, among other things, I need to detect the VBA code in appropriate document streams.</p>\n<p>I've read most parts of the <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/cc313094(v=office.12).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Office VBA File Format Structure</a>, from which it seems to me that the correct way of detecting the beginning of the compressed code is by parsing the <code>dir</code> stream which contains the <code>PROJECTMODULES Record</code> and which contains the <code>MODULEOFFSET Record</code> whose element <code>TextOffset</code> contains the actual offset to the compressed source code inside the appropriate <code>ModuleStream</code>. I've also found a project <a href=\"https://github.com/unixfreak0037/officeparser\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">officeparser</a> which performs the VBA code detection in the following way, but according to the project site on Github, there hasn't been any work on the project in the last few years.</p>\n<p>However, I've also found two other projects that deal with the same problem in a different way and which are more up to date. The projects are <a href=\"https://github.com/DidierStevens/DidierStevensSuite/blob/master/oledump.py\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">oledump</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/tree/master/oletools\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">oletools</a> and the way they detect the beginning of the compressed VBA code inside a stream is by searching for the pattern <code>\\x00Attribut</code> and then positioning 3 bytes back from that position. I haven't found any official documentation on this method so what I would like to know is if this method is some heuristic way of searching for the compressed code or am I missing some parts of the documentation?</p>\n</div>",

The oledump project, however, only uses the heuristic one. I've implemented both methods in my project so guess that is the way to go. Thanks for the help.</span>",

Evidently more detail is available from MS if you sign an NDA. With just a hex editor, it is possible to find and edit a string literal (change the characters, not the length) in the p-code section of a file, and then open the file in VBE, and you'll see the p-code version of the string literal appears in the code-pane, and not the source-code's string-literal.</span>",
