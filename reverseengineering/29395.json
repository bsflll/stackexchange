Most Google results show that it should be <code>__vbaVarIndexLoad</code>.</p>\n<p>If so, it is a function reserved for internal use and you shouldn't care too much about it. Judging by its name it probably pushes a variable on the VM stack by the index.</p>\n<p>While working with Visual basic programs, you should check if it is p-code compiled or native code compiled, then choose correct tools, since usually you don't want to reverse the whole VM.</p>\n</div>",
