    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Recently the Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 compiler finally complied with the C++ standards mandate to generate thread-safe code for function local statics. For the most part this works just fine but I ran into a situation on Windows XP where the following 3 instructions led to a blow up:</p>\n<pre><code>mov     eax,dword ptr fs:[0000002Ch]\nmov     ecx,dword ptr [MyModule!_tls_index (102eea44)]\nmov     ecx,dword ptr [eax+ecx*4]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Obviously the compiler seems to implement thread-safety by first poking into the TLS slot of the current thread. <code>fs:2Ch</code> is supposed to lead to the TLS array per documentation. However on Windows XP, <code>fs:2Ch</code> doesn't seem to be set. This returned 0 for me and so did the next instruction (<code>_tls_index</code> was also 0.) That led to the 3rd instruction blowing up as it was accessing invalid memory.</p>\n<p>Does anybody know why <code>fs:2Ch</code> might not be set on Windows XP? Function local statics are used all over our code and I can't imagine no one else running into this.</p>\n</div>",

This is in direct contradiction to the existing Portable Executable format documentation, which states that \"Statically declared TLS data objects ... can be used only in statically loaded image files.
