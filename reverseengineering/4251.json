I'm wondering because there is challenge in hacking lab which is to extract file from ZIP with passwd protection, and it's category is reverse engineering but when I look at the HEX dump I only see the file name.</p>\n</div>",

In this particular case, you reverse engineer the zip file (learning file headers, magic numbers etc) to get the idea of how the file is organised IN ORDER to get something (change file contents, circumvent the file protection, like password etc). So, I don't understand the first comment here.</span>",

It does not matter how long and\n  complex the password is! If you have a file from the encrypted ZIP\n  archive in your hands, the whole archive can be usually unlocked in\n  minutes by applying the known-plaintext attack.</p>\n<p>After carefully analyzing the algorithms and implementations of\n  password protection in different versions of WinZip, ElcomSoft\n  developed a work-around solution to allow quick guaranteed decryption\n  of certain ZIP archives instead of performing lengthy attacks. If an\n  encrypted ZIP archive was created with WinZip version 8 or earlier,\n  and if the archive contains 5 or more files, Advanced Archive Password\n  Recovery can unlock the archive and decrypt its content â€“ guaranteed!\n  A modern PC takes just under one hour to finish the job.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If those special cases don't apply, you'd need to apply standard brute-force techniques. Either way, you'd want to use <a href=\"http://www.elcomsoft.com/archpr.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Advanced Archive Password Recovery</a> or a <a href=\"http://www.password-crackers.com/en/category_98/\" rel=\"nofollow\">similar tool</a>.</p>\n</div>",
