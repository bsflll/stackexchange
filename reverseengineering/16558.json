Assuming the <code>pid</code> of the program is <em>317</em>:  </p>\n<pre><code>$ radare2 -d 317\n= attach 317 317\nbin.baddr 0x00400000\nUsing 0x400000\nasm.bits 64\n\n[0x7f2e51727230]&gt; pd @ &lt;address&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>pd</code> is a subcommand of <code>p</code> and stands for <strong>p</strong>rint <strong>d</strong>isassembly. You can check <code>p?</code> and especially <code>pd?</code> for more relevant subcommands. Adding <code>?</code> at the end of most of the commands in radare will print its help and its subcommands. By default, <code>pd</code> prints <em>b</em> instructions from the specified address where <em>b</em> is the default basic-block size. The default size of <em>b</em> is 0x100 but you can change it easily using <code>b &lt;size&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>@</code> sign is radare's temporary seek address so whenever you want to print the disassembly in a specific address you should use it. The number specified before the <code>@</code> sign is the number of instructions to print. A common mistake is executing <code>pd</code> with the address before <code>@</code>. Thus, executing <code>pd 0x400000</code> would print <strong>0x400000 instructions</strong> from the current seek.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>The exception</h2>\n<p>You received <em>\"Unknown exception e06d7363\"</em> which is an exception generated by <em>Microsoft Visual C++ compiler</em>.  </p>\n<p>As stated in Microsoft's <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/185294/prb-exception-code-0xe06d7363-when-calling-win32-seh-apis\" rel=\"noreferrer\">support page</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Cause</strong><br/>\n  All Visual C++ exceptions thrown from code generated by the\n  Microsoft Visual C++ compiler contain this error code. Because this is\n  a compiler-generated error, the code is not listed in the Win32 API\n  header files. The code is actually a cryptic mnemonic device, with the\n  initial \"E\" standing for \"exception\" and the final 3 bytes (0x6D7363)\n  representing the ASCII values of \"msc\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To continue your analysis I'd suggest you to read <a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100730-00/?p=13273\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Decoding the parameters of a thrown C++ exception (0xE06D7363)</a> and its <a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160915-00/?p=94316\" rel=\"noreferrer\">revisited</a> article.</p>\n<p>Note that the addresses of the executable in the memory might change in each run, depends on your system and the program itself. Therefore, sometimes you won't be able to predict what would be the address which causes the exception.  </p>\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/content/debugger/migration.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Migration from ida, GDB or WinDBG</a> page from <em>radare2 book</em> to see radare's corresponding commands to WinDBG's.</p>\n</div>",
