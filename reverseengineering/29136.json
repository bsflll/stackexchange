    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've been doing some stuff with a pre-compiled <code>.NET</code> executable. It is my first time reversing something, so I don't know much.</p>\n<p>I got a bunch of programs like ILSpy, dnSpy and dotPeek. They all do as much as they can, not 100% accurate, but quite enough. I found that it is best to use dnSpy as I can easily change some methods without having to recompile the whole project.</p>\n<p>However, it takes so much time to decompile some classes with this piece of software. It takes about 20 seconds to decompile <code>Main.cs</code> (&gt;50k lines, perfect engineering yeah) with ILSpy, and it takes an eternity (more than 5 minutes) to decompile it with dnSpy.</p>\n<p>The codes these programs give out are pretty much the same. I have a pretty weak PC, but according to the task manager, my 6 core CPU never goes above 50% on any of the cores while decompiling. Moreover, whenever I go into editing mode to edit some classes or methods, the editor goes stop-motioning, with response time about 3 seconds with that <code>Main.cs</code> file and quite a low performance on smaller files.</p>\n<p>So I am thinking that maybe there are some settings I need to tweak for better performance?</p>\n</div>",
