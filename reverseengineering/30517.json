            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>IDA doesn't stores hotkeys in registry rather it stores gui, terminal user interface(tui), analysis etc. related settings in configuration files which have <code>.cfg</code> extension, this approach provides flexibility in fine tuning/exporting configurations to user.</p>\n<p>These configuration files are stored in <code>cfg/</code> directory which you can easily find in your IDA installation directory.\nFor example\n<code>IDA_DIR/cfg/ida.cfg</code></p>\n<p>However, plugin related configurations are stored in  <code>IDA_DIR/plugins/plugins.cfg</code></p>\n<p>But the most important configuration files are those that govern the use of IDA and they are the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>ida.cfg</strong> - stores most common configuration options (parsing/analysis/processors etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>idagui.cfg</strong> - applies to the graphical user interface (GUI behaviors, keyboard hotkey mappings etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>idatui.cfg</strong> - applies to the command line version of IDA (configuration for console version of IDA)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I assume you want to change or reuse your IDA hotkeys. Therefore, you can open <code>idagui.cfg</code> files in any text editor and change settings as per your preference.</p>\n<p>All configuration files are well documented using comments and so does the <code>idagui.cfg</code> file, it has been divided into three sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>default GUI behaviors</li>\n<li>keyboard hotkey mappings</li>\n<li>File extension configuration for the <code>File-&gt;Open dialog</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, if you do not feel comfortable editing <code>idagui.cfg</code> directly, then you should create <code>idauserg.cfg</code> in the same directory and add to it all of the options that you wish to override. In this case you only need to edit the last line in <code>idagui.cfg</code> to contains a directive to include <code>idauserg.cfg</code> file. For example:</p>\n<p><code>#softinclude &lt;idauserg.cfg&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Next time in case you upgrade/reinstall/use IDA on some other platform, you can simply copy <code>idauserg.cfg</code> into <code>cfg/</code> directory. Similar method can be applied for <code>ida.cfg</code> but user provided configuration file should be named as <code>idauser.cfg</code> and include directive in <code>ida.cfg</code> should be appended as above.</p>\n</div>",
