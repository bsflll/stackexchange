Neither do I recognise the manufacturer.\nThe IC is actually very small, so I cannot take a better photo of it.</p>\n<p>What I already found out:\nThe IC is connected to six touch keys, the upper five pins and the first pin on the lower left are connected to the touch pads. Then there are 3 data lines connected to an ST32. May be I2C.</p>\n<p>Thanks for any hint!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qcGl8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"unknown IC\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qcGl8.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

If there is a real concern about private data, sure you can flag it and we can redact old revisions.
