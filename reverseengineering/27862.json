Looks like labels are located dynamically, so I can't get its text using OllyDbg, let alone changing the text. What should I do?</p>\n</div>",

So <i>if</i> the forms are contained in the resources you may be able to see/manipulate them there, but it's a different story from other controls.</span>",
