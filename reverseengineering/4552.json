    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm currently researching my home router (D-Link 2760-U) which has a (kind-of) proprietary ISP firmware. What I'm trying to achieve is understanding how the router is persisting it's configuration settings across reboots.</p>\n<p><code>mount</code> output:</p>\n<pre><code>/dev/mtdblock0 on / type squashfs (ro,relatime)\n/proc on /proc type proc (rw,relatime)\ntmpfs on /var type tmpfs (rw,relatime,size=420k)\ntmpfs on /mnt type tmpfs (rw,relatime,size=16k)\nsysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,relatime)\n</code></pre>\n<p>I did <code>nvram show</code> and it does contain some wireless configuration such as the encryption in use, wireless modes, pre-shared key but that's about it. Obviously the router has other configurations (such as DNS, PPP, Port forwards etc) that must be stored elsewhere. \nAs it can be observed, all mounted filesystems are volatile and thus configuration cannot be stored in them.</p>\n<p>Where can the information be saved besides filesystem and NVRAM? How do I go about finding this out?</p>\n</div>",
