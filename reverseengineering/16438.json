    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>On a jailbroken iOS device, I have successfully decrypted an app, and disabled ASLR, thanks to the hundredth of tutorials available. </p>\n<p>But then, none explain how relaunch the app once ASLR has been disabled. How to do that ?</p>\n<p>I have tried copy and paste the app binary in the installation folder, but this fails to start. </p>\n<p>If I understand correctly, disabling the ASLR is useful to be able to find procedure's adresses using, say, Hopper, and then put breakpoints at these adresses in the app while using it. Am I wrong ?</p>\n<p>I wonder if my workflow is the correct one. At the end I would like to use Hopper as a static analyser and setting breakpoints using lldb dynamically. Is it the correct way ?</p>\n</div>",
