    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I need help to <strong>unpack</strong> or create python script to unpack automatically the type of this firmware, someone already unpacked this firmware, and it contains: boot.bin, aboot.bin and system.bin files. (possible to have <em><strong>others partitions</strong></em> in other firmware).\nI analyse the firmware.bin with Hex Editor and i see on the Header the information of: size, offset and name of the partition.  I compare it with the extracted partiton files and i get this information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"aboot\"  size: 00 47 10 00 / offst partition address start : 00 00 8B 00</li>\n<li>\"boot\"   size: 00 47 10 00 / partition address start offset: 00 07 6B 00</li>\n<li>\"system\" size: 02 0A 00 00 / partition address start offset: <strong>00 4E FB 00</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>i make some analyse and verification also that next offset or next partition address 'start' is getting on:  hex address inverse on <strong>black color</strong> ( + ) the offset of preview partition.</p>\n<p>ex: to get the start partition of \"system\" : 00 4E FB 00 = <strong>00 47 90 00</strong> + 00 07 6B 00</p>\n<p>_ partition size: <strong>red color</strong>  / length of byte who contains infos is: <strong>1C</strong>, which starts with <strong>01</strong> for other partitions except the first or start of partition <strong>(aboot is 08)</strong>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FXHQ4cVo.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FXHQ4cVo.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>So, i want to understand, where or how to <strong>know the offset of partition address start</strong>  because it needed to calculate the offset of next partition ?</p>\n<p>Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>(there is some  byte also in start of aboot 03 00 00 00)</p>\n<p>sorry, if my explanation is not clear.\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OY0A5U5IRtuZLtzMraLOv_FlLON_B0j4/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">firmware link</a></p>\n</div>",
