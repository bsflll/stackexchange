    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm attaching to a simple program and the new thread breaks at DbgBreakPoint as expected. I'm using x64dbg (32-bit). The problem is, when I go to the Threads window it shows all the threads' EIPs as being within ntdll. If I click on a thread and switch to it it shows in the disassembly that EIP is on the line after calling into WOW64 (syscall). If I put a break on that line and run nothing happens.</p>\n<p>What's going on here? How can I switch to a thread and continue single-stepping from where its EIP is actually at?</p>\n<p>It doesn't seem to make sense that all the threads would be blocked in the kernel, because this always happens every time I attach, no matter when. It makes no difference whether I suspend the threads or not. On the other hand, if I just put an infinite loop in and then attach, I'm able to gain control at the infinite loop as expected. I guess that must mean that the threads actually are blocking. But why?</p>\n<p>What can I do to regain control over the threads considering how I can't just break on the line after the transition to WOW64 (that is, where the kernel returns from the blocking call, back in the 32-bit code)?</p>\n</div>",
