    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So I just got Zyxel nas326 and I looked from internet how to protect nas from bruteforce attack and I found that fail2ban can protect my nas.</p>\n<p>Then I found that I can't download any programs to nas326. So now I ask how I can Install fail2ban to Zyxel nas326.</p>\n<p>I know in theory I can use wget to download it from my own ftp server and run it, because that nas have python by default, but command <code>pip</code> doesn't work\" (<code>python</code> work). Commands like <code>sudo</code> and <code>apt-</code> dont work</p>\n<p>Anyone have done this before? Any other suggestions for bruteforce protection?</p>\n</div>",

Try placing the files where required manually... you don't really need the docs, so you could ditch those.
