It has great scripting\n  capabilities, it runs on all major platforms (GNU/Linux, Windows\n  *BSD, iOS, <strong>OSX</strong>, Solaris…) and it supports tons of architectures and file formats. [...] radare2 is absolutely libre. [<a href=\"https://www.megabeets.net/a-journey-into-radare-2-part-1/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Source</a>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can find most of the features you have in IDA in radare (including the option to edit a binary that you debug) and in case you lack some feature you can always open a request on the <a href=\"https://github.com/radare/radare2/issues\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Github</a> page or develop it by yourself. Note that, in my opinion, the learning curve of r2 is pretty steep and it'll take some time to get use to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Installation</strong><br/>\nIt’s recommended to use the current git version of radare2.<br/>\nSimply run:</p>\n<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/radare/radare2.git\ncd radare2\n./sys/install.sh\n</code></pre>\n<p>You'll need to perform <a href=\"https://github.com/radare/radare2/blob/master/doc/osx.md\" rel=\"noreferrer\">several more steps</a> in order to sign radare and make it ready to debug applications without the need of root permissions.  </p>\n<p><strong>Beginners guides</strong> </p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gitbook.com/book/radare/radare2book/details\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Radare2 Book</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gitbook.com/book/monosource/radare2-explorations/details\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Radare2 Explorations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnpBy3wWabA\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Radare Demystified</a> (Talk)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This should be enough in order to learn the basics of radare.  </p>\n<p><strong>User Interface</strong><br/>\nradare2 has a powerful command line visual modes to help you go through the program and super useful while debugging. This is how the Visual Graph Mode looks like:   </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/sp7ML.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Visual graph mode\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/sp7ML.png\"/></a> </p>\n<p>The official graphic user interface of radare2 is called <a href=\"https://github.com/radareorg/cutter\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Cutter</a> (originally named Iaito). Cutter is built on top of Qt and C++.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9mPrB.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9mPrB.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
