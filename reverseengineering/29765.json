This firmware is often included as part of BIOS updates (and can be extracted from them).</p>\n<p>For example, at Recon 2011 Alexandre Gazet presented a talk <a href=\"https://recon.cx/2011/schedule/events/102.en.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Sticky fingers &amp; KBC Custom Shop</em></a> which described analyzing a \"keyboard controller\" (but more likely EC) firmware to embed a backdoor code which would infect the host BIOS's SMM handler and (in theory) take over the machine on the lowest level. I was not able to find the English slides or video of the talk but there is a <a href=\"https://www.sstic.org/media/SSTIC2011/SSTIC-actes/sticky_fingers_and_kbc_custom_shop/SSTIC2011-Article-sticky_fingers_and_kbc_custom_shop-gazet_1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">French paper</a> from SSTIC 2011.</p>\n<p>It in turn refers to the 27C3 (2010) talk <a href=\"http://events.ccc.de/congress/2010/Fahrplan/events/4174.en.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>The Hidden Nemesis: Backdooring Embedded Controllers</em></a> by Ralf-Philipp Weinmann which instead the EC into a keylogger.
