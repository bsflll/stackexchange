            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>In the last year or so, I think I have only encountered a single malware sample that was using a virtualized packer (VMProtect in that case).  Most of the samples I look at use stupid packers that allow easy dumping of the original PE from memory.  I don't spend all of my time looking at malware, but I typically look at a couple potentially malicious samples a week, just to give some perspective on the volume I'm talking about.  Also, I seem to remember that the SpyEye author used VMProtect to protect the malware builder, I'm not sure if other's who sell those kind of kits have used it as well.  I've heard the Citadel builder has some pretty gnarly protection, but I'm not certain of what it is.</p>\n<p>Regarding the second part of your question, I am no expert, but a couple of sites came to mind to potentially check out if you are interested in trying to learn to unpack this stuff.  <a href=\"http://www.softwaresprogramming.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">This site</a> has some posts about unpacking various things, including VMProtect and Themida.  I haven't gone through those posts in particular, just noticed that they are on there.  I think there are some tutorials dealing with some versions of these specific packers on <a href=\"http://www.tuts4you.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">tuts4you.com</a> as well if you are interested to check some of those out.</p>\n</div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>To the first part of your question: It really depends on the domain. Malware samples that leverage virtualization-based packers are generally easy to detect, which is a drawback from the malware author's perspective. If avoiding detection is crucial, which is especially the case in targeted attacks where your sample is probably custom anyway, virtualized packers are not a good idea. I assume that's why only very few samples make use of them. I have seen only one (themida protected) in the last year or so.</p>\n</div>",
