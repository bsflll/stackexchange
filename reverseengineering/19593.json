The pointer to it is stored in the <code>GuardCFCheckFunctionPointer</code> field of the <a href=\"https://lifeinhex.com/tag/control-flow-guard/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">load configuration directory.</a></p>\n<p>I guess in the newer files it may contain some additional pointers (see below). The zeroes are probably just padding to the default section alignment (512 or 1024 bytes, not sure which).</p>\n<p>P.S. found a recent x64 PE with more pointers. Apparently the following is the full layout for a 32-byte section:</p>\n<pre><code> __guard_check_icall_fptr       dq offset _guard_check_icall_nop\n __guard_dispatch_icall_fptr    dq offset _guard_dispatch_icall_nop\n __guard_ss_verify_failure_fptr dq offset __guard_ss_verify_failure_default\n __guard_ss_verify_sp_fptr      dq offset __guard_ss_verify_sp_default\n</code></pre>\n<p>First two pointers are part of the <a href=\"https://lucasg.github.io/2017/02/05/Control-Flow-Guard/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Control Flow Guard</a> implementation, the other two are from the now-deprecated <a href=\"https://xlab.tencent.com/en/2016/11/02/return-flow-guard/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Return Flow Guard</a>. All four are referenced by fields in the load configuration directory, i.e. in theory they don't have to be in this order or even placed together.</p>\n</div>",
