Since these are both\n  arrays of integers, each element is of size 4, although the instructions at 1\n  and 2 differ for accessing the two arrays. In both cases, <code>ecx</code> is used as the\n  index, which is multiplied by 4 to account for the size of the elements. The\n  resulting value is added to the base address of the array to access the proper\n  array element.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
