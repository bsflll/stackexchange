If so, what alternative are there to help understand how the application works?</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

If I remember correctly during that time several new Dalvik opcodes / smali commands have been added. You can try to decompile the apk using an apktol version that was released at the time smalisca was still maintained.</span>",
