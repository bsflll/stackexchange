The software vendor has the private key, the public key is embedded in the software. This means you just can't write a key generator from the information that's publicly available. If the key checking itself is heavily protected against modification, it may be easier to roll your own private/public key pair, have your keygen use the private part of this pair, and replace the original public key in the software with yours.</p>\n</div>",
