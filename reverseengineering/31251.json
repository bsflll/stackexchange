In order to make this code a function (which will make it black) by defining it as a function yourself, you can press <kbd>P</kbd> when the cursor is located on address <code>0x00405fd0</code> where the function prologue starts, or select all the functions' instructions and press <kbd>P</kbd>.</p>\n<p>When this code becomes function, the graphs and decompilation should start working.</p>\n</div>",
