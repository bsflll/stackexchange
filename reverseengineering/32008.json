It is not a chinese BT speaker but a Hama soundbarrel. I can't disassemble it to reveal the circuit board. Any way to pull the firmware to my PC and then push back the modified firmware? I only have an AUX, USB and a Type C port.</p>\n</div>",

I suggest you always do it on a device you will not use or you are not currently using because there is always a chance of bricking the device or shorting circuitry so if you want to do it on your speaker just buy another one and try it on that second one.</p>\n</div>",
