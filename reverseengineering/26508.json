To look for a given function, do that recursively for all the references from the list. A more time-saving method though would be setting two breakpoints in a debugger and logging all the in-between callers.</p>\n</div>",

For what I known IDA don't allow to show the path of  x selected functions. But exist some old python plug-in that allow it, but I never used it and I don't known how install it.</span>",
