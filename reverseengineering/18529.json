There may be more recent versions.  The short version: R0-R3 are for passing arguments, R12 is a scratch register for procedure calls (linker things, etc) and everything else must be preserved by functions that use it.</p>\n</div>",

It is extremely frequent to see these way of doing in compiler generated assembly code.</p>\n</div>",
