I have written IDAPython code to produce the same result as number of BB's and number of instruction in each BB etc. and address as well.</p>\n<p>When I compared my result with the one already generated by the BN tool, they are different. Number of BB's are almost 1000 less compared to BN.</p>\n<p>May anyone guide me to understand the issue? Regards.</p>\n</div>",

Sir, there were many files for the different verion of carbanak. I have found 1 version of the malware which result is almost equal to my results in case of number of basic blocks. but now no of instructions per BB is different. I am working on it yet but no useful outcome.  static analysis of binary with different binary will be different but difference of 1000 BB is not possible.</span>",
