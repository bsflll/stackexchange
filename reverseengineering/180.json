Now it appears to be dead, I get 404's for each of the links on the MS research page, so it seems to me that this project was discontinued.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in using LLVM/CLANG on Windows you might want to have a look at <a href=\"http://www.ishani.org/web/2011/crowbarring-clang-into-vs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a>, which offers an extension to use LLVM from within VS. I gave it a short try and cannot say much about it, but it should allow you to compile and build extensions for LLVM on Windows.</p>\n</div>",
