    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Ghidra shows in my decompile window the following warning at the top:</p>\n<pre><code>/* WARNING: Globals starting with '_' overlap smaller symbols at the same address */\n</code></pre>\n<p>When looking at my decompilation I notice that sometimes there is an underscore and sometimes there is none:</p>\n<pre><code>void UndefinedFunction_00000014(void)\n{\n_DAT_fffffa00 = 0x63cd;\n_DAT_fffffa04 = _DAT_fffffa04 | 0x4000;\nDAT_fffffa17 = 0xf7\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>(It seems that only word addresses are having an underscore, not byte addresses.)</p>\n<p>The warning tells that \"smaller symbols\" are overlapped, so I checked the Symbol Table. It is empty. I also checked the Memory Map, but there is nothing defined for that address range. And I also checked the labels, but there are no labels defined at all.</p>\n<p>So why do I receive this warning? What does it refer to? And why do some of my assignments start with an underscore while some don't?</p>\n<p>In case that there is no added value in that, how can I unify it?</p>\n</div>",

May be the struct or the symbol do not really exist (misinterpretation of something) or they do not exist at the same time.</span>",
