    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Recently I asked a <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/q/168/214\"> question about detecting UPX compression</a>. <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/users/245/0xc0000022l\">0xC0000022L</a> wanted to know if it was plain UPX. However until that point I only was aware of <a href=\"http://upx.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">plain UPX</a>. So my question is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What versions/modifications of UPX exist?</li>\n<li>How do they differ? What features do they have?</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

It's not very effective at counteracting reverse engineering.</p>\n</div>",
