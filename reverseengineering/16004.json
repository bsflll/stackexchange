It might be just enough for you but there are some cases where it would not. </p>\n<p><code>netstat</code> has some blind spots -- it only shows connections at a certain point in time. Therefore, connections which closed quickly and every connection which was closed before or started after the execution of <code>netstat</code> will obviously not be shown.  </p>\n<p>A solution for this is to use <code>strace</code> which can help you monitor the connections which created by a process.</p>\n<p>To start a process and monitor its connections:<br/>\n<code>strace -f -e trace=network -s 10000 &lt;process [arg1] [arg2] [...]&gt;</code></p>\n<p>To monitor an already existing process:<br/>\n<code>strace -p &lt;pid&gt; -f -e trace=network -s 10000</code><br/>\n<em>if you don't know its PID use <code>pidof &lt;processname&gt;</code></em></p>\n<p>Then use some <code>grep</code> magic to print only the IP addresses:<br/>\n<code>strace -f -e trace=network &lt;process [args...]&gt; 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep -oP 'connect.*inet_addr\\(\"\\K[^\"]+'</code> </p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Windows</h2>\n<p>In windows you also can use <code>netstat</code> or the improved version of it <a href=\"https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh826153(v=wps.630).aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>Get-NetTCPConnection</code></a> via <code>powershell</code>.

This often includes IP addresses and ports used for existing connections. If you want to list existing connections and their owning processes on linux, running the <code>netstat</code> command.</p>\n<p>By providing it some command line arguments you can get the desired information, consulting man pages is always recommended but for your specific case running <code>netstat -ape</code> to list all connections with their pid and username.</p>\n</div>",
