    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>-- Edit with latest update on the problem, it is not solved yet :( --</p>\n<p>While playing with an ARM embedded Linux system (Version 3.8.13), out of curiosity, I created a small \"debug\" kernel module.</p>\n<p>This \"debug\" module branches a specific flow in another kernel module to a function in this \"debug\" module, which executes some logic and then resumes execution peacefully.</p>\n<p>To avoid clutter of the stack area, the first executed logic is changing SP to point at an empty area inside the \"debug\" module <strong><em>code</em></strong> section.</p>\n<p>The system crashes couple of seconds after executing <code>mov sp, r2</code>, and entering an infinite loop. (<code>r2</code> holds the address to the empty area).</p>\n<p>Note that the crash happens before the \"debug\" module executes any stack-related opcode (or actually any other opcode, for that matter).</p>\n<h3>So I conducted the following checks:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Made sure the address is 4-byte aligned</li>\n<li>Changed area to write-able, and big enough to hold a full context switch that is saved on the stack (about 0x300 bytes)</li>\n<li>Changing <code>sp</code> value by small amounts (+-0x100) - did not crash the system</li>\n<li>Changing <code>sp</code> to some arbitrary value - crashed the system.</li>\n<li><strong>Changing <code>sp</code> momentarily and then immediately restoring its value does not crash the system</strong></li>\n<li><strong><em>Changing <code>sp</code> momentarily, executing an STMFD operation and then immediately restoring <code>sp</code>'s value does not crash the system!</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><s>From the last test, it's pretty clear that when a context-switch happens, some values are being saved on the stack. If it points to that free area, the system crashes</s></p>\n<p>It seems that there isn't any problem with using stack operations on the free area, but yet when some context-switch happens, the system crashes.</p>\n<h3>Feasible ideas</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a constraint on possible values of the <code>sp</code> register? (Kernel configuration, perhaps? Specific bits of the address?)</li>\n<li>The code section has some sort of protection against being used as a stack <strong>when used outside of the current module</strong>?</li>\n<li>Context-switch requires more than 0x300 bytes of space?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div>",

Take a look at the memory access control section under the virtual memory system architecture chapter for the ARM architecture reference manual.</p>\n</div>",
