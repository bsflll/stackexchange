    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>so I have this problem of me not understanding how to convert this one function into useable code in C#. Problem being that I am currently hooking into a game via C# and I want to rebuild a function that is very much required on the C# side of my modification, the game is of course written in C++</p>\n<pre><code>void __fastcall CachedReader::OutOfBoundsError(CachedReader *this, unsigned __int64 a2, __int64 a3)\n{\n    ulong totalSize = a2 + a3;\n    if ( totalSize &gt; (*(__int64 (__fastcall **)(_QWORD))(**((_QWORD **)this + 3) + 48i64))(*((_QWORD *)this + 3)) )\n    {\n        //TODO: Error logging here\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Any help converting this is greatly appreciated :)</p>\n</div>",
