It is an instruction designed to fetch a piece of memory and load it into a register in an optimized manner. It may also be used to perform an addition when you see:</p>\n<pre><code>lea eax, [eax+4]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which is equivalent to:</p>\n<pre><code>add eax, 4\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, the <code>call @UstrLAsg</code> refer to a symbol (<code>@UstrLAsg</code>), which give a static address in the executable memory. The best way to find out where it does jump in memory would be to execute the program and to look at the symbol while running. It should unveil the static address.</p>\n<p>Hope this helped you a bit.</p>\n</div>",
