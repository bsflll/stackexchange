    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm currently debugging a .net application by using dnSpy. There is a function where I have call like this</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;Module&gt;.X.Y.Z.Initialize(ptr, ptr2, flag);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The function belongs to a DLL and appearently is a C(++) function call as I could find this by going to the module:</p>\n<pre><code>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.Unmanaged | MethodImplOptions.PreserveSig)]\ninternal unsafe static extern void Initialize(byte*, byte*, [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.U1)] bool);\n</code></pre>\n<p>So my question is how can I analyze this function (Initialize)? Logically dnSpy is skipping it and IDAPro doesn't help me further since the DLL itself is a .net so I can't start a debugging session within IDA.</p>\n<p>I've tried to create a Debug Time Travel Trace with WinDBG but it throws me an error when I'm ending the session and can't open the trace anymore.</p>\n<p>Are there any suggestions how I can figure out or debug this function Initialize is doing?</p>\n</div>",
