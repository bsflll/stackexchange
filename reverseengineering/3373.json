    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am using BinDiff 4.0 as a plug-in for IDA Pro 6.5. I know that it is possible to save the results as a <code>.BinDiff</code> file, however is there a way I can format this into a more easily accessible file type? I have been searching for a solution for several days and so far the two best solutions I have discovered are to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Copy and paste the matched functions window (this is simply too inefficient for what I am looking for).</p></li>\n<li><p>Export the data as a <code>.BinDiff</code> and then access through an SQL database manager and try to export from there. However it seems to change the data to incorrect values and not what I am looking for. (I want the exact information from the matched functions window).</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Additional Information</strong>: I know that BinDiff 3.x had a <code>save_to_log</code> function which (I think) did what I am looking for, and saves the information in the matched function window to a <code>.txt</code> file. I have tried contacting both Zynamics support, and Google/Zynamics support with no reply.</p>\n</div>",
