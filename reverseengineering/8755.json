    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Z80 was a popular 8-bit processor with a 4-bit ALU.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Z80 ALU\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5tueN.png\"/></p>\n<p>Implementing a zero flag for a register should be straight forward, it would be a logical <code>NOR</code> of all the bits on the register.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Gigantic NOR\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RG7f4.png\"/></p>\n<p>Something like that would work for a small number of inputs. As for a 64-bit processor you cannot make one gigantic <code>NOR</code> gate with 64 inputs. The fan-in would be too high. 8 transistors would be in series. The circuit capacitance would be high thus slowing down everything else.</p>\n<p>I can see some other options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The zero flag could be generated directly from the 8-bit result using 2 level logic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"two level logic\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tLlMR.png\"/>\n<img alt=\"two level logic\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OOodj.png\"/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The zero flag could be generated directly from the 8-bit result using 3 level logic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"three level logic\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2xBFt.png\"/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The zero flag could be generated from each nibble and then put together, like if there was a \"half\"-zero flag. The result for the lower would be saved using a flip-flop while waiting for the high nibble result to be calculated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Nibble\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/anAW5.png\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.righto.com/2013/09/the-z-80-has-4-bit-alu-heres-how-it.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ken Shirriff</a> wrote a nice article about reverse engineering the Z80 ALU. However when it comes to the zero flag he states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not shown in the block diagram are the simple circuits to compute parity, <strong>test for zero</strong>, and check if a 4-bit value is less than 10. These values are used to set the condition flags.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, although they are simple circuits I would like to know exactly how they were implemented and if they used any of the implementations proposed above or something else completely different.</p>\n</div>",

The zero flag can be located anywhere (ALU,Register file,any of the data BUS,...)  and also would need some gating because not all operations change ZF. The truth can be found only by examinaning the DIE (which is time consuming) or ask someone that created the Z80 circuitry/die masks inside Zilog Company ...or the clones copies like U880A ...</span>",
