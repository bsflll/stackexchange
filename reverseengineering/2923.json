Here's how a typical TLS access to a <code>__declspec(thread)</code> variable looks like:</p>\n<pre><code>mov eax, DWORD PTR __tls_index    ; load TLS index for current thread\nmov ecx, DWORD PTR fs:__tls_array ; load the TLS array pointer (FS:[2Ch])\nmov edx, DWORD PTR [ecx+eax*4]    ; fetch the pointer to the TLS block for current thread\nmov eax, DWORD PTR [edx+4h]       ; load the thread variable at offset 4 in the TLS block\n</code></pre>\n<p>(The <code>__tls_index</code> variable is pointed to by the <code>TlsIndex</code> (aka <code>AddressOfIndex</code>) field of the PE TLS directory.)</p>\n<p>The actual content of the TLS block is up to the program - the OS only makes sure that every thread gets a separate copy of the initial TLS template, and puts a pointer to it in the TLS array. So, to figure out what's in that memory chunk, you'll have to see how the program is using it.</p>\n</div>",
