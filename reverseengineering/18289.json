Since this is not a full class, but only a method, I can't get any of the available java reverse engineering tools to work with it. </p>\n<p>I'm now trying to inject this code into a separate class at runtime and then dump it out of memory. But I'm not sure if it's possible to do. even using a javaagent.  </p>\n<p>Is there any other easy way to accomplish what I'm trying to do?</p>\n</div>",

The instructions contain references to the constant pool, which is part of the classfile and shared between all methods in the class. The smallest executable unit of bytecode is the classfile.</p>\n<p>The question as written doesn't make sense, but if you post the actual data you are dealing with, perhaps we can figure out what is going on.</p>\n</div>",
