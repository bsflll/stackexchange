You'll most likely want to analyze the binary. To do this, press colon and then <code>aaa</code> or <code>aa</code>. Note, that <code>aaa</code> does could take more time, but does performs a more in-depth analysis.</p>\n<p>Once in debugging mode, use db [address] to set a breakpoint. For example, to set a breakpoint at main</p>\n<pre><code>db main\n</code></pre>\n<p>And you can get to main, enter <code>s main</code>. This jumps to main (s is for seek).</p>\n<p>Then, if you want to change the register <code>rdi</code></p>\n<pre><code>dr rdi=0x20\n</code></pre>\n<p>For more register options, see: <a href=\"https://r2wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/options/d/dr/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://r2wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/options/d/dr/</a></p>\n</div>",
