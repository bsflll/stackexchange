It does not provide enough information to IDA about available memory ranges, about which you usually get  a warning on startup:</p>\n<pre><code>---------------------------\nInformation\n---------------------------\nThe current debugger backend (gdb) does not provide memory information to IDA.\nTherefore the memory contents may be invisible by default.\nPlease use the Debugger/Manual memory regions menu item to configure the memory layout.\nIt is possible to define just one big region for the whole memory\n(IDA will display question marks for missing memory regions in this case).\n---------------------------\nOK   \n---------------------------\n</code></pre>\n<p>So IDA defaults to 0-0xFF000000 (addresses above 0xFF000000 are used by IDA for internal netnode IDs and may lead to issues if used in actual program). So there are two solutions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Edit the memory regions made by IDA (Edit-Manual memory regions...) and add  a new one covering the regions you need (e.g. 0 to 0xFFFFFFF0, or a few smaller ones).</p></li>\n<li><p>Instead of GDB, use IDA's own Linux debugger which can properly query the OS about available memory regions.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
