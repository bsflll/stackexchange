Here's <a href=\"https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/0e9c01fd87ae6cc5ba3474810eaa3c58499615ce/libavcodec/pcm_tablegen.h#L61\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the widely used (I think) Sun decode code</a>: search for bytes 0F and F0 near lots of shift instructions, and you might get lucky.</span>",

            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">If it's a simple enough compression scheme (ADPCM, uLaw, etc.), playing it as if it's PCM will sometimes actually work. You'll get something that's noisy as heck but the underlying audio (e.g. voice, music) will be audible under the noise. This lets you determine at least two things: the bitrate/sample rate of the audio, and where in the file the audio is. (I realize you've tried this - but maybe try listening very carefully to the noise!)</span>",

            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">I've used Audacity to convert a recording of the desired audio into a few different formats (with compression) to have something as a reference. Indeed, with some formats, the original audio can be recognized when playing back the raw data. Meanwhile, I have found out the audio actually comes from another IC... Must have been the cheapest option.</span>",
