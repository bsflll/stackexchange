    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>SysTracer from SysReveal.com (not from www.blueproject.ro) seems to be a very nice tool for live monitoring your system and check what executable files do at your system. I saw some videos on YouTube where sys-admins used it to show e.g. how Ransomware works. In this video on YouTube ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm5TbBKeFvU\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm5TbBKeFvU</a> ) by the well known company \"Trend Micro\", they mentioned (at 0:56) the website SysReveal.com, where you can download SysTracer. The website is on Google's SafeBrowsing blacklist and the tool \"SysTracer\" hits 8 (<em>.zip) or 9 (</em>.exe) of 55 at Virustotal.</p>\n<p>I would appreciate it, if you check this tool NOR share your thoughts about it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Website: sysreveal.com <strong>(Google's SafeBrowsing Alert!)</strong></li>\n<li>SysTracer:\nhxxp://sysreveal.com/download/SysTracer.zip <strong>(8 of 55 at Virustotal)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image of SysTracer</em>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9KjO2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9KjO2.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
