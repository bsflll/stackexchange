PS: Consider to save the state of your IDA Database before changing bytes with <i>Database snapshot manager(Ctrl+Shift+T)</i>. It will help you to avoid troubles if something will go wrong.  If you want to patch the binary that you dissect, there are a plenty of ways to do that. You may use <b>Edit -&gt; Patch program -&gt; Apply patches to input file</b> in IDA Pro. Alternatively you may modify a binary in a debugger or with some hex editor. What would you like to modify?</span>",
