You can find the software documentation <a href=\"https://segment.com/docs/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Also there seems to be a broad range of integrations to parse and read the data <a href=\"https://segment.com/catalog#integrations/all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Please also know that the system uses a WriteKey and a ReadKey apparently, but I can not deduce which one you have.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you want to write your own REST client, please refer to\n  StackOverflow for programming-guidance.
