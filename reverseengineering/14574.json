These days <code>/etc/mtab</code> is usually just a symlink to <code>/proc/mounts</code> but your mileage may vary.</span>",

Some filesystems such as <code>squashfs</code> are only read-only but <code>yaffs2</code> is not. Such situations when something is mounted as <code>rw</code> but writing fails also happens when using <code>NFS</code> or <code>CIFS</code> but it's not used in your case. Linux also automatically remounts disks to read-only when errors are found. Can you post output of <code>dmesg | grep -e mount -e roots -e read</code>?</span>",
