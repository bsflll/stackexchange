    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a script written to work with Ghidra. I am doing some analysis in the script and save the results in a file. Right now, I am passing the name when a prompt ask the file name to save upon running the script. Though this is ok for one, I need to run this script in more than 100 objects at once(using the headless analyzer) and I want the file name to automatically taken from the object name. How could I do this?</p>\n<p>For example, let's say I have an object file called <code>mqtt.o</code>. I need to take this name (<code>mqtt</code>) while saving the file which contains the results. I looked through the API, but still could not find a way to get the name of the object of analysis. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.</p>\n</div>",

If so, <a href=\"https://ghidra.re/ghidra_docs/api/ghidra/program/flatapi/FlatProgramAPI.html#getProgramFile()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>getProgramFile()</code></a> is probably the easiest way to grab it.</p>\n</div>",
