    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm a beginner to reverse engineering, I've read through a few tutorials and know my way around some basic GDB and assembly code. After working my way through a few trivial examples I'd like to try something a bit more 'real-world'. My goal is to reverse-engineer and 'crack' Introversion Software / Ambrosia Software's game 'Uplink'.</p>\n<p>Note that I am only doing this for the challenge, if I just wanted to play the game for free I would find a crack, not make one. The demo is freely available at <a href=\"http://www.ambrosiasw.com/games/uplink/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ambrosiasw.com/games/uplink/</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, I have learned a few important things through static-analysis, using the tools Hopper and class-dump. It soon became clear that the registration-related functions lived in <code>ASWRegistration.framework</code>, but after trying some static analysis, to no avail, I decided it would be best to throw GDB at it. Loaded it up, tried to set a breakpoint on one of the interesting-looking functions.</p>\n<pre><code>(gdb) b +[ASWRegistration isRegistered:]\nFunction \"+[ASWRegistration isRegistered:]\" not defined.\nMake breakpoint pending on future shared library load? (y or [n]) n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Aw, that's annoying. Let's try something else.</p>\n<pre><code>(gdb) b isRegistered\nFunction \"isRegistered\" not defined.\nMake breakpoint pending on future shared library load? (y or [n]) n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Hm, maybe I'm doing something wrong...</p>\n<pre><code>(gdb) b isRegistered:\nNo symbol table is loaded.  Use the \"file\" command.\nMake breakpoint pending on future shared library load? (y or [n]) n\n(gdb)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Well, that give me a different error message, it's still not working though...</p>\n<p>Upon further examination, I've found that I can't even properly break on functions inside the executable itself.</p>\n<pre><code>(gdb) b applicationDidFinishLaunching:\n[0] cancel\n[1] all\n\nNon-debugging symbols:\n[2]    -[SUStatusChecker applicationDidFinishLaunching:]\n[3]    -[SUUpdater applicationDidFinishLaunching:]\n&gt; 0\ncanceled\n</code></pre>\n<p>Two possible <code>applicationDidFinishLaunching</code>s, not one of them come from the actual game (I suspect they're from Sparkle.framework). It WOULD seem as though Ambrosia was smart and stripped all debugging symbols, but class-dump gives me full headers, nm gives me a bunch of symbols, and Hopper finds all sorts of methods. So I don't see why GDB can't use that. Again, I'm a beginner in all of this, maybe I'm doing something blatantly wrong. I also tried the same thing with a Mac App Store games, \"Hack RUN Free\", and got the same <code>No symbol table is loaded.  Use the \"file\" command</code> error. Of course, the file command doesn't help at all.</p>\n<p>Does anybody know how to fix this? I'd like to advance beyond the purely theoretical level in this ?</p>\n</div>",

The output from objdump is <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/wuaeMS2R\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> if you're interested. I know it's possible to figure out the symbols, since both Hopper and a demo version of IDA seem to be able to do this. I've gotten to a point with static analysis where while I'm pretty sure I'm in the right place, my assembly skills aren't good enough that I can follow what's going on once Hopper is no longer able to find the methods for me. There are some obvious _objc_msgSend calls going on but I don't know how to find the actual code those point to.</span>",

You have selectors in the <code>_ObjC</code> section which are used as arguments to <code>obj_msgSend</code> (which is how just about everything is invoked). There are no direct calls between functions. I suggest starting off with the Cameron Hotchkies <a href=\"http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/pub/chotchkies/Under%20the%20iHood%20-%20REcon%202008.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">slides</a> on this topic from REcon 2008.</p>\n</div>",
