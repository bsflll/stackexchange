    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am studying Computer Forensics in at a university in the UK and for my final year project, I wanted to combine my love of Microsoft products and Computer Forensics to see what kind of information a Microsoft band stores.\nTo do this I need to get a data dump from the \"Band\". As the band has no usb connectivity. The only way I can think of this is to JTag the motherboard.\nI am not very experienced when it comes to Jtagging and as part of my research I have to find out how to do this. The facilities are all there in the university so that isn't a problem.</p>\n<p>There has been very little research and the Microsoft band in terms of Forensic Analysis. So I was wondering whether anyone here knows their way around the band or JTagging in general.</p>\n<p>A picture of the motherboard and chip are available from the this link <a href=\"https://www.sparkfun.com/news/1681\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.sparkfun.com/news/1681</a> or <a href=\"https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/1/6/8/1/Microsoft_Band_Teardown-33.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/home_page_posts/1/6/8/1/Microsoft_Band_Teardown-33.jpg</a>\nAny help would be largely appreciated.</p>\n</div>",

The microcontroller looks to be in a BGA package, so you can't trace the pins from there. Same with the flash. It is almost certainly a multi-layer board as well.</p>\n<p>So there are a number of options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>It may never have used JTAG. Very small and light devices sometimes have the processors programmed off-board, or simply have a basic bootloader that can communicate using normal channels.</p></li>\n<li><p>The multi-way connectors may have been used for JTAG - the smaller one on lower right looks JTAG sized. However, those types of connectors are often rated for &lt;100 insertion cycles, so JTAG would be uncommon on these.</p></li>\n<li><p>There are a lot of test points. JTAG could be on these, but you would really need something like the JTAGulator to find it.</p></li>\n<li><p>Sometimes, light boards have a snap-off connector used for initial programming.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I would attack this from a broader perspective. Personally I would try and desolder the flash, reball it and then read it. This is not trivial either.</p>\n</div>",

You can find some like <a href=\"http://deadhacker.com/2010/02/03/jtag-enumeration/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one</a> or <a href=\"http://hsb.wikidot.com/arduino-jtag-finder-workshop\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one</a> .

History prove that Microsoft forget sometimes to fuse it (check XBOX360).</p>\n<p>If you can share chips model numbers it would be great as we could find some SPI to use, for example with Bus Pirate.</p>\n<p>BTW a back picture would be great.</p>\n</div>",
