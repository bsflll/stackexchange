Its just that your addresses have not been resolved properly in the first disassembly, while they have been in the second one. You can do </p>\n<p><code>info symbol 0x804810f</code> </p>\n<p>in  gdb and it would output something like</p>\n<p><code>puts in section .lib</code></p>\n<p>This way you can resolve all the functions being called. Alternatively you can use the <code>nm</code> utility.</p>\n<p>The second disassembly has prolog and epilog for stack management and function returns because it has been auto generated by the compiler. However in the first disassembly, it looks like the program author assembled the file with nasm and author used minimal code to do so.</p>\n</div>",
