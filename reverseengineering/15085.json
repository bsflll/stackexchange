    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I want flash regular(non branded) firmware on ZyXEL P-2812HNU-F1 router, which have branded version of firmware (customized for local MSO provider).\nTo do this, I should first replace the U-Boot image on the board. The full procedure is described in <a href=\"https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/zyxel/p2812hnu-fx#branded_and_nonbranded\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wiki</a>. However, this procedure is for installing <strong>OpenWrt</strong> on ZyXEL P-2812HNU-FX series. In my case I just want flash the regular unbranded firmware version from the manufacturer's repository, not OpenWrt. </p>\n<p>What's not clear: do I need another special U-Boot version, tailored to regular generic (nonbranded) ZyXEL firmware, or I can use U-Boot version created for OpenWrt?</p>\n</div>",
