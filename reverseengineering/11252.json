    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>(Alert: I'm new with all this)</p>\n<p>I'm trying to find out what the following (dis)assembly does: </p>\n<pre><code>MOV EAX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-54]     ; PTR to ASCII \"\\xDA\\x9Fb\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>I seem to understand that the value at address [EBP-54] is copied to EAX. And that OllyDbg figured out that value to be an ascii string containing \"\\xDA\\x9Fb\". Is that right? </p>\n<p>Can someone maybe explain to me what this Ascii string is supposed to represent, and how it fits in this code example? </p>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Since the information above seems not sufficient to give an answer, I'll try to add some instructions that might (or might not) shed some light. </p>\n<p>Shortly after the instruction above, there are multiple CMPs that each look like this: </p>\n<pre><code>CMP DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+(different hex)],0\nJE SHORT (position a few lines below)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This CMP exits with true which is not the desired condition. The left side should have another value than 0. </p>\n<p>I could not figure out what the <em>the string</em> means but it is being used as one of multiple arguments in many internal (private) functions of the disassembly while the other arguments would contain column names of a database. </p>\n<p>I am planning to do a lot more digging but I was just curious if this seemed familiar to anybody. </p>\n</div>",

It doesn't look as meaningful string, and generally speaking may represent almost anything imaginable from pointer to floating point number(except of meaningful string, of course).  The only way to determine what does it mean is to look what the program does with it.</span>",

The very beginning of your message agrees that \\x starts a hex escape sequence, but you misinterpret the string because you think the \\x is followed by <b>ONE</b> hex character, while it is in fact followed by <b>TWO</b>. The string does not start with <code>0x0D</code>, it starts with <code>0xDA</code>, and it does not contain <code>0x09</code>, it contains <code>0x9F</code>.</span>",
