I'm getting strange errors. (Using DJ Java compiler/decompiler). My question is does an easy editor exist for .class files ?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\n</div>",

This lets you edit classfiles at the bytecode level without a lossy (and potentially impossible) roundtrip to Java. You can even edit heavily obfuscated classes this way. Of course, this assumes that you're familiar with the classfile format.  If you don't understand bytecode, you're pretty much limited to either learning it (not that hard) or making do with decompilers.</p>\n</div>",
