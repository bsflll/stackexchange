    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Using IDA, can I specify 2 Sub-Routines (really, it's 2 WINAPI calls) and have IDA create a \"map\" between the 2 points? I want to know all the possible branches the EIP can take from one instruction to another instruction.</p>\n<p>I am using IDA-Pro 6.0 (or 6.1).</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>Edit - I can only use static analysis tools for this.</p>\n</div>",
