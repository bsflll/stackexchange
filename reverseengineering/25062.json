    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>For a specific Android library that I have loaded into IDA, I want to switch the THUMB/ARM mode to ARM, no matter the consequences that this is going to have to the code. Is there a way to efficiently do this in one go in IDA ?</p>\n<p>So far I found out that I can do it by setting a default segment register value, but that apparently works only for segments that do not have any set T value (and IDA seems to set a value by default). </p>\n<p>I also found out that I can modify the T register for a specific section through the Segment Register Value window (alt+G to open it), which indeed has the effect that I want, but it going to take months to do it one by one to all sections.</p>\n</div>",

If you have many wrong intermediate changepoints from previous analysis, you can delete them en masse from the \"Jump to segment register...\" dialog (<kbd>Ctrl-G</kbd>).</p>\n</div>",
