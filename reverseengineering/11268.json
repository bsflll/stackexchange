    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>another newbie question from me. </p>\n<p>Assuming I know that the application I'm reversing uses certain third party libraries that are publicly available, but it links them statically, is there any easy way to make the debugger recognize the respective function calls in the app? What I want to avoid is to waste a lot of time on analyzing library functions which I know from the start I'm not interested in (such as MFC libraries). </p>\n<p>If this is possible, an instruction how to do it in Ollydbg would be great though I'm grateful for any tips. </p>\n</div>",

So, I have access to source header and lib files, and also the dlls of the component. How do I go from here (i.e. how do I create the MAP file, then load it into and use it in OllyDbg)?</span>",
