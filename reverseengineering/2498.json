I don't even know if the <code>addss</code> lines are the correct ones where I can modify the step value (the one that increases or decreases the last <code>xmm0</code> value in <code>movss [eax+30],xmm0 | movss [eax+34],xmm0 | movss [eax+38],xmm0</code>).</p>\n<p>I am using<a href=\"http://www.cheatengine.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"> [CE's]</a> auto assembler tool to achieve this, modifying memory values.</p>\n</div>",
