And it does not work.\nYet I added the debugging symbols files related to the OS and I also modified the architecture of the instructions.</p>\n<pre><code>add-symbol-file ~ / Tinycore / vmlinux 0x100000\nadd-symbol-file bin / munich 0x18000\nset architecture i386: x64_32 // because the guest OS is compiled in 32 bits\n</code></pre>\n<p>But when execution passes the instructions vmresume, vmlauch and continues in the guest OS, Gdb gets confused, single-stepping does not work anymore and breakpoints end up at uncertain addresses.<br/>\nDoes anyone have an idea of ​​what I missed?<br/>\nOr is it really impossible?<br/>\nIs there another way to achieved this?<br/>\nThe hypervisor I'm working on is <a href=\"https://github.com/genodelabs/genode\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genode</a> and the guest OS is T<a href=\"http://tinycorelinux.net/10.x/x86/release/src/kernel/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">inycore Linux</a>.  </p>\n<hr/>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/~kauer/oslo/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">munich</a> is a 32 bits bootloader used to boot the Tinycore Linux.  </li>\n<li>hypervisor, vmlinux and munich are the binaries compiled with debugging symbols.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
