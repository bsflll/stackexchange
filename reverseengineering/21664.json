    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've disassembled and run auto-analysis on a .so file from an Android apk, and then hooked up the remote ARM debugger to an emulator. IDA then asked me if /data/app/com.package.name/lib/arm/libil2cpp.so is the same file as libil2cpp.so on my computer, which it is so I said yes. It took a few minutes to \"move database\", \"move functions\", etc. and now it's taking hours to perform auto-analysis all over again on the mapped files.</p>\n<p>Is there any way to speed this up, and will it happen every time I start a remote debugging session?</p>\n<p>Follow-up question: I learned that this is caused by IDA rebasing the program every time. Why can't it just use offsets from the start of the program and avoid rerunning the static analysis?</p>\n</div>",

Due to widespread use of ASLR, processes get loaded into a new address every time and IDA needs to adjust the database: move all segments to the addresses that the operating system assigned to them. This was a slow process that could take literally hours for big databases.</p>\n<p>In IDA 7.3 we implemented another approach for rebasing which is up to 40 times faster and usually takes only a matter of seconds. You no longer have an excuse to take a coffee break every time you start a new debugging session. This makes our debuggers even more pleasant to use ðŸ˜‰</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, I can't answer the follow-up question.</p>\n</div>",
