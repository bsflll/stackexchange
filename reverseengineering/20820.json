You may want to look at <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/firmware\">firmware</a> questions for related questions (and answers). A question like yours, however, is inherently unfair. For starters the Google Drive links are highly likely to go stale anytime. So visitors now will have no way to relate to the question or even answers implying knowledge of these files. Furthermore: <i>Questions asking for help reverse-engineering a specific system are off-topic unless they demonstrate an understanding of the concepts involved and clearly identify a specific problem.</i> ... which, I think, applies here.</span>",

I've had this with the entertainment system of my car and the conventional tools don't help a lot for VxWorks images, it seems.

Anyway I kind of understood that the question was to general and not specific enough for this forum but wort. It's just that any real documentation reversing software for a Renesas SH3 processor is lacking to say the least and very lacking for VxWorks as you say.</span>",
