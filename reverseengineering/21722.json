If so, they could be the spare or OOB(out of band) bytes which are present in most NAND chips for error checking or housekeeping (bad block management etc.) in most cases you can discard them and analyze just the “useful” data. See <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/15099/60\">my other answer</a> for some background. </p>\n</div>",
