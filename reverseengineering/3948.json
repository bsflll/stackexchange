    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to hit a breakpoint that I set in LLDB (CLI), but for whatever reason I'm not hitting my breakpoint.  I am messing around with the stock Calculator.app on OS X, and am trying to call / hit my breakpoint when I open the About dialog box of the Calculator.app.</p>\n<p>I launch the Calculator.app, then I start lldb from a Terminal window.  I find the process of the Calculator.app using ps and grep.  I attach to the running process using LLDB.  I then issue the <code>continue</code> command in LLDB to allow the Calculator.app to continue running.</p>\n<p>Then I set a breakpoint in LLDB when the following method is called, <code>showAbout</code></p>\n<p>I type the following command into LLDB,\n<code>(lldb) breakpoint set --method showAbout</code></p>\n<p>However when I click <code>About Calculator</code> from the menu bar it doesn't halt the program, but rather shows the About dialog box for the Calculator.</p>\n</div>",
