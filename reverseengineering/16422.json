The problem is that the trace is quite large and there are quite big chunks of the code that repeat (I assume they are loops).<br/>\nI would like to have some kind of tool that would be able to produce a graph or perform simple analyze/decompile to group loops into separate blocks and to simplify the flow.  </p>\n<p>Is there a tool like this or all of this should be done manually?</p>\n</div>",
