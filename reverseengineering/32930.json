    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a Motorola 68K binary file that contains a table of a few hundred function pointers. If I set their data type to Pointer32, Ghidra interprets them as pointers as shown:</p>\n<pre><code>00100000 01 20 96 94     addr       DAT_01209694\n00100004 01 20 96 b2     addr       DAT_012096b2\n00100008 01 20 96 d0     addr       DAT_012096d0\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, while the function pointers are stored as 32-bit values, they use a unique segment/address scheme:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>AA SA AA AA</code> (the segment in this project is always 2 and needs to be ignored when parsing the pointer address)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Essentially, I need to make a 32-bit pointer data type that \"ignores\" the S part of the address, such that the data would look like this if it was correct:</p>\n<pre><code>00100000 01 20 96 94     addr       DAT_00109694\n00100004 01 20 96 b2     addr       DAT_001096b2\n00100008 01 20 96 d0     addr       DAT_001096d0\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm somewhat new to Ghidra, so any pointers (pun intended) to where I can read up on creating custom pointer types would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n</div>",

There you can providing the correct address calculated [...]. If you have more than one, you can automate it via python script.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I've recorded a video detailing such situation in action <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvH7b_qLmbU\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvH7b_qLmbU</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[0] I think this would probably only matter if you want type propagation algorithms to handle this, e.g. if some struct will have a pointer of this type.</p>\n</div>",
