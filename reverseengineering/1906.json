    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>IDA Pro allows plugins to receive notifications for a number of events. These are defined in the <code>hook_type_t</code> enumeration inside <code>loader.hpp</code> in the SDK from what I saw. If I subscribe to <code>HT_IDB</code> events, I have a host of options for notifications I can subscribe to (<code>event_code_t</code> in <code>idp.hpp</code>).</p>\n<p>Now, if I wanted to patch up <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/collabreate/\" rel=\"nofollow\">collabREate</a> by Chris Eagle to support anterior and posterior comments - how would I go about that?</p>\n<p>colleabREate is a very useful piece of software, but in real collaboration scenarios these issues turn out to be real shortcomings.</p>\n<p><strong>In short: how can I receive notifications to events in my plugin which Hex-Rays doesn't make available through the SDK as of yet?</strong></p>\n</div>",
