    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>My situation is that I'm trying to find the send function of an online game. I found the buffer pointer and looked what accesses to it. It was obviously an instruction, which used the buffer pointer, but if I breakpoint on that instruction it doesn't contain the buffer ptr.\nWhy are the values different if I breakpoint?\nFirst Picture: edx stores the adress of the buffer.\nSecond Picture: Breakpoint on that same exact instruction, but edx is not the same, which doesn't really make sense.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HjoCx.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"edx stores the adress of the buffer\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HjoCx.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lRNbv.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"breakpoint on the same exact instruction\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lRNbv.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
