    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>When I load most windows NE/PE executables, IDA first warns me about the file being possibly packed, then it warns me with this dialog: \"<em>The input file has extra information at the end (tail &lt; hex &gt;, loaded &lt; hex &gt;), continue?</em>\". It loads the file, but only shows the \"<em>This program cannot be run in DOS mode.</em>\" DOS stub and that's it. No import/export tables, structs, etc. </p>\n<p>How can I force IDA to recognize the PE header and load that instead of the DOS stub?</p>\n</div>",
