More specifically, <code>$r</code> is a variable which holds the height of the console. This command is shown on Visual Disassembly mode (<code>Vp</code>) and usually is not executed by the user. The command is used by the mode in order to show <em>N</em> instructions from the binary where <em>N</em> is the height of the console (number of lines). This provides the user with a better, and more interactive, reverse engineering experience.</p>\n<p>To show the full list of variables you can use the command <code>?$?</code>.
