I don't need the entire answer, what I need is: what functions I should use, and I can figure out the rest on my own.</p>\n<p>The platform is ARM7 processors, specifically, mobile phones running the Android OS.</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance.</p>\n</div>",

When you self modify code, you end up changing instructions in the DCache but not necessarily in memory, or more importantly the ICache, therefor these caches become out of sync. You must take some steps to ensure these caches are \"clean\"/in sync. Flushing the DCache ensures that the changes made in DCache get written to memory.</p>\n<p>Flushing the DCache forces the ICache to re-fetch instructions (aka your modified code). On ARM linux there is a syscall call <code>cacheflush</code> that takes care of this. Depending on how you are modifying memory/in what context, there is an issue of chicken or the egg, as your newly modified code cant contain the cache flush as the caches will already be out of sync, therefor there are other ways to force a cache flush, such as forcing a context switch, i.e. a sleep, when you don't have the ability to programmatically flush the cache.</p>\n</div>",
