I think that in Windows operating system the most popular combo for reading files is probably <code>CreateFile</code> and <code>ReadFile</code> api calls. If you track every operation performed on the buffer filled using <code>ReadFile</code> call, you can reconstruct the algorithm that is used to make sense of the bytes stored in the file. You can do it using any debugger like <code>x64dbg</code>, <code>windbg</code> etc.</p>\n<p>Answer to your case:</p>\n<p>Sometimes it is worth to check if particular format was already reversed by someone. There is a community around a program called <a href=\"https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">QuickBMS</a> that targets unpacking game files. If you open your <code>fonts.pak</code> using hex editor, you can notice the very first bytes equal to <code>PKTB</code>. If you search for a script that can unpack <code>PKTB</code> files on the website, there is one result for a game called <a href=\"https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/pit_people.bms\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pit People</a>. The game is created by the same manufacturer as your Alien Hominid Invasion.</p>\n<p>Quick look on the script: <code>fonts.pak</code> contains 5 files (2 png, 2 bmf(?) and 1 txt). Unfortunately, this quick bms script can't read encrypted filenames (that are probably stored at the very end of <code>fonts.pak</code>, (but you can reverse it by yourself of course) what is funnier the header of the file is xored via key which is scrambled form of string <code>securitythroughobscurity</code></p>\n</div>",
