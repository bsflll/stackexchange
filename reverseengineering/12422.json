This does take a bit of effort and some resources (purchasing Internet addressable IP address). However, the advantage of this method is that you are virtually guaranteed to capture malware that are actively being used currently in the wild. There is the possibility that you might hit a jackpot and also get infected with a brand new malware that might even exploit 0-day vulnerabilities. This approach is very helpful for people who are already well-versed in the field of reversing. I have used Dionaea (<a href=\"http://dionaea.carnivore.it/\">http://dionaea.carnivore.it/</a>) in the past to set up my own honeypot with very good results. It's replete with instructions, background, and references.</p>\n<p>For beginners and for people who don't want to put too much effort gathering samples, I would advise taking the route of downloading the malware from the sites the other posters have indicated.</p>\n</div>",
