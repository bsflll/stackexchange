    "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/13969/ollydbg-how-to-set-conditional-breakpoint-on-a-register-value",
    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I want to set a breakpoint when the register EAX references a specific Unicode string, e.g. \"Enter\". In Ollydbg there is usually right beside the EAX value a string that says \"ASCII: Enter \".</p>\n<p>I read that I have to use Olly v1.10 for this purpose. When I go to \"Debug\" -&gt; \"Set Condition\" I can write in the text field \"Condition is TRUE\" for instance this:</p>\n<pre><code>EAX == 00000010\n</code></pre>\n<p>I press F9 (Run) and the breakpoint will work. So once EAX becomes 0x10 olly will stop. However when I do this:</p>\n<pre><code>UNICODE[EAX] == \"Enter\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>it doesn't work. What am I doing wrong? Doesn't matter which program I use and which Olly version, I can't get this to work. I would like to match strings like \"Enter text\" as well, so any appearance of \"Enter\".</p>\n<p>In the end I'm basically looking for a way to stop olly once a specific string is loaded into RAM. How can I achieve this?</p>\n<p>Any help is appreciated. Thanks!</p>\n</div>",
