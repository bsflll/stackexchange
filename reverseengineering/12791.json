    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm writing an IDA plugin using idapython in order to add comments (located in database) to variables of struct types. In order to do this, firstly, i need to get the list of cross-references to a given structure type (e.g. struct BITMAPINFO) which can be found in \"Structure\" subview in IDA. </p>\n<p>I know IDA provides this function from version 6.2 by right-button mouse clicking on the structure name and selecting \"List cross references to\". A window like the following will be popped-up:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CBI7A.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"example: xrefs to BITMAPINFO picture\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CBI7A.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Each item of the list in above picture is either an address where a global variable of type %structure name% (here is BITMAPINFO) is declared or a position where a local variable of type \"structure name\" is defined. The former is like</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KxBT2.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"example: global variable definition of type GUID\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KxBT2.png\"/></a>\n(here is type GUID, not BITMAPINFO).</p>\n<p>The latter is like\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/McC7c.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"example: local variable definition of type BITMAPINFO\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/McC7c.png\"/></a>\nThis is the position where IDA declare local variables based on its identified type.</p>\n<p>I wonder if there is a way to get these data by IDAPython.</p>\n<p>NOTE: This is different from cross-references to a(ll) member(s) of a struct type, which can be got by right-button mouse clicking on the structure member name, shown as the following</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XIcJe.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"example: XrefsTo GUID.DATA1\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XIcJe.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Before asking here, i do it like:</p>\n<pre><code>#CODE 1\nea = idc.LocByName(%structure name%)  \n\nfrm = [x.frm for x in idautils.XrefsTo(ea)]\n</code></pre>\n<p>I think i have got the whole list of cross-references to %structure name% using my above code. However, i found many EAs in the list seem like ineffective such as '0xff0052c9' (<b>MaxEA is 0x108f800</b>). However, i guess my code has got the desired result because the length of returned list is equal to the number of items in the list shown as the 1st picture. But i can't explain the result especially the (seemingly) ineffective ones. Also, when i add comments to the addresses in the list using the following code</p>\n<pre><code>#CODE 2\nfor ea in xrefs_list:\n    # each cross-reference to the given struc type\n\n    if repeatable:\n        # add repeatable comment 'cmt' at address 'ea'\n        idc.MakeRptCmt(ea, cmt)\n\n    else:\n        # add comment  'cmt' at address 'ea'\n        idc.MakeComm(ea, cmt)\n</code></pre>\n<p>i found i only added comments to the effective addresses which are between <b>idc.MinEA()</b> and <b>idc.MaxEA()</b>, and these addresses are places where global instances of the queried struct type are declared, as shown in the 2nd picture.</p>\n<p>My questions are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Is my above code (CODE 1) correct to get all cross-references to a struct type?\n  If it is, how to explain those seemingly ineffective addresses (above 0xFF000000)</li>\n<li>How to add comments to other cross-reference addresses other than the references to global instances of the struct type? </li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

As you mentioned, when trying to get the xrefs to the struct, you get two types of results:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Valid addresses, which are struct instances in the data section</li>\n<li><code>0xFF000000</code> and above addresses, where the struct is used as a stack variable.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In IDA the stack variables for a function are represented internally as a struct, with each stack variable a member of that struct.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>idaman struc_t *ida_export get_frame(const func_t *pfn);</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/sdkdoc/frame_8hpp.html#a538eae24587b7931ea67d9d110d68193\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Docs link</a></p>\n<p>Knowing that, we can infer that the weird xrefs are member-ids (which they are). To get the names of the containing structs we use <code>fullname = idaapi.get_member_fullname(mid)</code> and get something like <code>$ F4014B0.var_14</code>.\n<code>$ F4014B0</code> is the netnode name of the stack-frame struct for the function at <code>0xF4014B0</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>import idc\nimport idaapi\nimport idautils\n\nsid = idc.GetStrucIdByName('my-struct-name')\nfor xref in idautils.XrefsTo(sid):\n    if 0xFF000000 &gt; xref.frm:\n        # The struct is used as data\n        print 'Data xref from 0x{:X}'.format(xref.frm)\n    else:\n        # The struct is used as a stack variable.\n        mid = xref.frm\n        fullname = idaapi.get_member_fullname(mid)\n        function_ea = int(fullname[2:].split('.')[0], 0x10)\n        print 'Stack xref from 0x{:X}'.format(function_ea)\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Getting Xrefs to member Variables</h2>\n<p>(This is here because it was my initial answer, and it contains valuable information.)</p>\n<p>You were really close to the solution. Your code gives you the <code>sid</code>, so you only get references to the struct itself. What you need, is references to the different members, and this can be done using the <code>mid</code>. You can get it using fully-qualified member names. However, since there are many members to every struct, enumerating them is usually a better choice.</p>\n<pre><code>import idc\nimport idautils\n\ndef get_member_ids(sid):\n    offset = 0\n    while offset != 0xFFFFFFFF:\n        mid = idc.GetMemberId(sid, offset)\n        if mid != -1:\n            yield mid\n        offset = idc.GetStrucNextOff(sid, offset)\n\n\ndef get_member_xrefs(struc_name):\n    sid = idc.GetStrucIdByName(struc_name)\n    for mid in get_member_ids(sid):\n        for xref in idautils.XrefsTo(mid):\n            yield xref.frm\n\n\n# And the usage:\nfor xref in get_member_xrefs('my-struct-name'):\n    print '0x{:X}'.format(xref)\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong><em>edit to answer question in comment</em></strong></p>\n<h2>A Bit on Netnodes</h2>\n<p>This next bit is about IDA internals, so I might be off mark here. I am basic the information on SDK docs <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/sdkdoc/netnode_8hpp.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">see here</a></p>\n<p>As visible in my code, many APIs that are documented for use on effective addresses (<code>ea</code>s) also work on other IDA primitives - struct ids, member ids - without any difference.</p>\n<p>Internally, objects in IDA are mapped to netnodes. Lines in IDA are mapped linearly to netnode numbers, While other objects are mapped to numbers starting at <code>0xFF000000</code>. \nWhile addresses and struct ids might have a different semantic meaning, they are both netnode numbers. In IDA's APIs, this means that they are treated the same way.</p>\n<p>I hope this makes things clearer.</p>\n</div>",

What your code return is the union list of cross-references to each structure member, which can also be got by right-button mouse clicking on name of  a structure member.
