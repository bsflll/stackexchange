Even if it is using them, it is usually possible to just remove them and revert to the old behavior. Assuming that the class does not use <code>invokedynamic</code>, you can just change the version back to <code>49.0</code> and delete the StackMapTable attributes.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, version 51.0 mandates usage of StackMapTable, which is a pain to create when manually editing bytecode. If your class actually is making use of 51.0 features (i.e. <code>invokedynamic</code>) then your only option is to create the appropriate stack frames. In a simple case like this, you could do it by hand, but in general you're best off using a tool to generate the stack frames automatically.</p>\n</div>",

If you want to preserve debugging information, you also need to comment out lines 273-274 of disassembler.py. If you want to remove stack frames as well as changing the version, add the line <code>return {}</code> to the top of the getStackMapTable function.</span>",
