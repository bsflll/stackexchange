I would like to do the same thing under angr.  I don't need <em>any</em> symbolic execution, I don't need <em>any</em> Symbion: Just simply use angr as an emulator (which it's more than capable of).  How can I tell angr to run everything concretely, but still continue to hook the libs and replace them with angr's sims?</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, this turns out to not be simple.  What I found so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/angr/angr/issues/200\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/angr/angr/issues/200</a> - A discussion from  6 years ago how to do this</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://angr.io/blog/angr_symbion/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://angr.io/blog/angr_symbion/</a> Symbion, which does something similar, but much more complex: It runs the concrete side externally, interfaces to it via gdb, and syncs periodically with angr</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
