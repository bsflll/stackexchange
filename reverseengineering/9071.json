Static analysis by itself can be difficult if the binary is obfuscated and packed. There is a risk where the file could exploit a vulnerability in the program doing the analysis, but this is fairly uncommon, though you should still keep you systems up to date and run as an unprivileged user.</p>\n<p>Some disassemblers you could try:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>objdump</code>. You can use the <code>objdump</code> disassembler to dump the disassembly of the binary. The command <code>objdump -D yourbin</code> will disassemble all sections.</li>\n<li><code>IDA Pro</code>. You can grab a free trial of IDA Pro from their website. </li>\n<li><code>Hopper</code>. Hopper also has a free trial you can use. Its cost is much cheaper than IDA Pro if you do decide to purchase.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.backerstreet.com/decompiler/decompilers.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">This page</a> lists some decompilers you could try. I haven't tried any of them (except for IDA Decompiler, which is expensive), so I can't vouche for how well they work.</p>\n</div>",
