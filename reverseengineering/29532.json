Tracing is often a lot faster than interrupting the execution and yielding control to a user to handle the break point.</p>\n<p>This is probably the simplest solution for you. You could trace all allocations either using a debugger with tracing or scripting capabilities or using a specific tracing utility such as <a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ltrace.1.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>ltrace</code></a>.</p>\n<p>Once you have tracing set-up and running, you can search for the address of the allocated buffer you're interested in investigating, to find all calls it was involved in.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ltrace.1.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>ltrace</code> man page</a> is quite helpful but in your case simply <code>grep</code>-ing for the address will do just fine. <code>ltrace</code> has definitions for standard library APIs such as <code>new</code> and <code>malloc</code>.</p>\n<p>Tracing with <code>gdb</code> will require a bit of gdb-scripting but something like the following should do:</p>\n<pre><code>(gdb) b malloc\nBreakpoint 1 at XXXX\n(gdb) commands 1\nType commands for when breakpoint 1 is hit, one per line.\nEnd with a line saying just \"end\".\n&gt;silent       # don't stop on breakpoint being hit\n&gt;backtrace    # print current back-trace\n&gt;p $eax       # Pass the input to the call, should be the size allocation!\n&gt;fin          # execute till function's return\n&gt;p $eax       # print return value, should be chunk address!\n&gt;continue     # continue execution of the program\n&gt;end\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Memory access break point on the allocated region</h3>\n<p>Using a debugger such as <code>gdb</code>, you could place a <em>memory access</em> breakpoint (also called a <a href=\"https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Set-Watchpoints.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">watchpoint</a>) on the allocation's address. Thus by executing <code>awatch &lt;allocation address&gt;</code> you'll have a breakpoint hit every time the allocation is accessed (there's a caveat, though).</p>\n<p>This won't immediately give you the size of the allocation, but with some reverse engineering and back-tracking the address's origin, you can find the original allocation call that resulted in that buffer. A beneficial side-effect is easily seeing what's the allocation used for.</p>\n<p>As mentioned previously using memory breakpoints may have a caveat. If your hardware doesn't support the mechanisms required for implementing memory breakpoints efficiently, memory break points may be implemented in software which is pretty slow.</p>\n<h3>Looking up the size through heap data structures</h3>\n<p>This may be the most straight-forward way to answer your original question (how to find the size of an allocated heap chunk) theoretically but the most difficult to implement. It may still be of interest to future readers.</p>\n<p>As the heap is designed to manage allocations in different sizes, all heap implementations maintain metadata about the size of all allocated chunks. That metadata can be read or retrieved and heap-visualization tools will even help with that.</p>\n<p>Some heap implementations hold the chunk metadata in-bounds, and prefix each allocated chunk with a short header that either directly indicates of it's size, or points to a \"bin\" of allocations of a given size, or both. <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20190619034641/http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dlmalloc</a> is an example of such implementation.</p>\n<p>Some heap allocator implementations include:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20190619034641/http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dlmalloc</a> - Doug Lea's malloc</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jemalloc.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">jemalloc</a> - Jason Evans' malloc</p>\n<p>HeapAlloc - Visual Studio's allocator</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Side note: heap allocations don't necessarily originate from <code>new</code> calls. There are other possible APIs that request memory from the heap, <code>malloc</code> for example. You should find the lowest API that might interest you.</p>\n</div>",
