However especially with ASLR enabled, different versions, RVA vs file offsets and other nuances it may be more useful to reference an instruction relative to the function start address.</p>\n<p>In the case of <code>CRYPTSP.CryptDuplicateHash+0C</code>, we can easily see the address is at offset <code>0x0C</code> within the <code>CryptDuplicateHash</code> function inside a module called <code>CRYPTSP</code>.</p>\n</div>",
