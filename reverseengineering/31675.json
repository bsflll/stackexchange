The C++ code itself is not important. It is important to decompile the project architecture and generate the appropriate header and cpp files.</p>\n<p>I really don't want to invent it myself. But, if there is no other choice - apparently - it will be necessary. Because already 3 projects are pending.</p>\n</div>",
