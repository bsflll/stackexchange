    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So i'm trying to reverse an unity game using il2cpp to get the assets of it.</p>\n<p>After some reverse stuff i found that the asset's (especially here the png image) byte array get encrypted with a key and i need to use that key and the DecryptByteArray function to get the real data of the image but when i try to look at the DecryptByteArray in dnspy i got this: <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/6Uf6Y.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"decrypt function in dnspy\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/6Uf6Y.png\"/></a>\nTechnically this is not the right decrypt function and it also doesn't contain the function or code line where it is used.\nSo i decide to take a look at the assembly code to see what's the real function and what's the key but then i found out the the reference of that method is just the data offset: <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9kWhp.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\" the data offset\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9kWhp.png\"/></a>\nand the runtime function define: <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yWcg0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"runtime funtion\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yWcg0.png\"/></a>\nAnd when i go to pseudocode it show up like this<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/x1Iay.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"the pseudocode\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/x1Iay.png\"/></a>\nwhich i think it's not really matter but i'm not sure am i right or not.</p>\n<p>So i want to get some help to find the key of the encryption and if u can please help me with the DecryptByteArray function too cause i'm not good at assembly so it might took me at least 3 weeks if i wanna understand what is that assembly code doing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/17-7vybSn64V2hsizupEv7mfkWSGqaOF6/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here</a>'s the client of the game.</p>\n</div>",
