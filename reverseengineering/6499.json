Then you'd probably start with something like</p>\n<pre><code>void malware(void) {\n    ......\n    helper1(...);\n    ......\n    helper2(...);\n    ......\n}\n\nvoid helper1(...) {\n    .....\n}\n\nvoid helper2(...) {\n    .....\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, how can you copy the compiled code of these functions somewhere, especially to some memory block you got using VirtualAlloc(), and how do you know how much memory you need? That's exactly what your code does. At the end of the (one or more) functions that need to stay \"resident\" in memory, you place a function that does nothing, just to have a memory address.</p>\n<pre><code>void end_of_malware(void) { /* do nothing, just return */ }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, you know that the memory block from <code>malware()</code> to <code>end_of_malware()</code> contains the code you want to \"save\". The expression</p>\n<pre><code>size_t size=((char *) end_of_malware - (char *)malware)\n</code></pre>\n<p>is the number of bytes you need, and which you pass to <code>VirtualAlloc</code> and <code>memcpy()</code> (or whichever function you use to copy the memory). This is just what the <code>mov [somewhere], offset end_of_malware</code> and <code>sub [somewhere], malware</code> does. Except that IDA can't know the original names of the functions.</p>\n<p>IDA detects, however, that the <code>end_of_malware</code> function does nothing, so it names it <code>nullsub</code> - a \"null subroutine\". This helps a bit since, whenever you see a <code>call nullsub_*</code> in your disassembly. you know there's no reason to check what that function does. </p>\n</div>",
