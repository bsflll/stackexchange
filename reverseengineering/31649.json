However there is a cache directory <em>/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.miui.gallery/files/gallery_disk_cache/full_size</em> containing thumbnails in 750x1000 resolution.</p>\n<p>I identified a picture which is the preview for the above entry.

Because assuming the contained SHA-1 value is from the original image file it doesn't make sense to lookup the thumbnail by the hash of the original file data hash. Calculating the hash is pretty CPU intensive, especially for JPEG images it may be faster to load the JPEG image directly in a lower resolution than calculating the hash for looking up the thumbnail.</span>",

It is possible that the thumbnail file-name hash is not on the picture content but on its file-name and meta-data. To see how the database and the thumbnails are generated I would try to decompile the gallery app.</span>",
