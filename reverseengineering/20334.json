They're not operator locked. I'm trying to use them on an American network for 3G connectivity.</p>\n<p>Even though they state \"850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz\" bands in their specs, and my network supposedly has UMTS on 850 MHz, I can only get a 2G (EDGE) connection and furthermore, they all detect my SIM card as out of network and put me in \"roaming\" mode.</p>\n<p>I've found out that the radios in these things are usually universal but the band limits are only in software. Therefore I was wondering if there would be any way (through undocumented AT commands or firmware flashing) I could get either one of these modems to switch allowed bands and let me get 3G speeds in North America.</p>\n<p>Are there any resources where I can get AT command lists and/or different region firmware for these devices? Or is there anyone that could maybe point me in the right direction?</p>\n<p>These are the devices I have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Huawei E3131</li>\n<li>Huawei E353</li>\n<li>ZTE MF190</li>\n<li>D-Link DWM-156</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I tried flashing different versions of firmware and/or googling AT commands to change bands on some of these, but at the end, the moment I switch mode to 3G I get \"no service\"</p>\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated...</p>\n</div>",
