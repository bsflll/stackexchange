Just look for calls to <code>malloc</code> and similar functions, and find the corresponding argument for the buffer size.</p>\n<p>Buffers on the stack are a little harder to spot, but can often be identified. Usually, you can see the stack pointer address will be decremented to make room for the new buffer. This amount will sometimes not be the exact buffer size, but will be close.</p>\n</div>",
