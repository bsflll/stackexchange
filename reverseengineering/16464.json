I have a decent grasp of assembly, but I'm still learning. <strong>If this is a dumb question, let me know why it's dumb.</strong></p>\n<p>I'm looking to bypass a problematic DLL in an win32 application. I tried letting the DLL run, then setting all the jumps in the main app via debugging, but memory access errors are being thrown. I'm pretty sure it's doing more than just returning values in AX.</p>\n<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Is there a way I can run the program, save all the memory / stack ops done by the dll? Maybe a trace of some kind?</p></li>\n<li><p>What tool could do this (Ollydbg, IDA, MS Detours)?</p></li>\n<li><p>Is this a productive way to approach the problem?</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I did this, I would have a success case. I could then re-code the DLL with op code to do what it needs to do and replace the rest with no-ops. Haven't had much luck with this on Google.</p>\n</div>",

In your case I would create a DLL library and inject it to the target process (either when the target loads or whenever it is already loaded). Your library should then detour the calls to the original function to your proxy method.</p>\n</div>",

Does it store some variables or does it inject code on runtime (probably not, but I think u get the idea). Did u read about detours? You can set the detour at any given moment in the function, so you could first let the original code (partly) run and then call your own proxy.</span>",

I just want to get a high level understanding of how to solve the problem :) Detours is something I'm going to check out soon.</span>",
