The author himself does not comment on the strange BFC.W statement. This very statement has been commented in another blog <a href=\"http://johannesbader.ch/2014/06/practical-reverse-engineering-solutions-page-78-part-iii/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, as \"I don’t understand the purpose of setting the two most significant bits of the difference to zero. Those bits shouldn’t be set in the first place for any reasonable strings.\"</p>\n<p>Maybe that statement serves some purpose. If yes it might be rather obscure.</p>\n</div>",
