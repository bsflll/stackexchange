    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>The API is pretty old and is written in C#, I tried debugging the API calls with mitmproxy.</p>\n<p>This is the successful API call (manually uploading file)<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/necwI.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"successful API call\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/necwI.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>but when I tried curling it, it gave me this error which is apparently a common error from the C# language (that's how I'm able to know that the API is written in C#) \"Sequence contains no element\" im not sure but i think it's got something to do with SQL</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/o2kIN.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"fail\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/o2kIN.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I also tried insomnia and postman but it came to the same ending</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/cb2HK.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"same ending\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/cb2HK.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>so what is it that I can do to reverse engineer this file uploading API? It'd be perfect if you could briefly explain it so that I may understand and do better for the next API reverse engineering that I might do THANK YOU!!!!</p>\n<p>sources: <a href=\"https://products.aspose.app/video/compress\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://products.aspose.app/video/compress</a></p>\n<p>please ask for more sources, I don't know what screenshot is necessary for me to put here.</p>\n</div>",

You're giving the API an empty list when it's not expecting one, or e.g. it's generating an empty list from the data you've POSTed because you've left something out. Could that be the actual file upload? I don't know the tool, but it looks like you're actually posting a file upload in the first one but sending no data for the other two.</span>",
