The summary for the most common ones is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>db</code> - byte (8 bit integer)</li>\n<li><code>dw</code> - word (16 bit integer)</li>\n<li><code>dd</code> - double word (32 bit integer)</li>\n<li><code>dq</code> - quad word (64 bit integer)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>?</code> denotes that this value is unknown and will only be known at runtime. And example of this are variables inside an uninitialized data section.</p>\n<p>If you start a debug session with IDA, the address will eventually contain <em>some</em> value. But since you use static analysis without running the code, there is no information what value it will contain.</p>\n<p>And you can't know the value during static analysis. This is one of the big limitations of static (not running the code) versus dynamic (running the code) analysis.</p>\n</div>",
