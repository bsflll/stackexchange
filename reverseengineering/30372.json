    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm currently reversing a PowerPC Gekko program and saw a <code>bne</code> instruction that branched on the condition register after a <code>rlwinm</code> function. Perfect. That makes sense. <code>bne</code> is checking the third bit of the <code>CR0</code> bit field in the condition register. I assumed checking <code>CR0</code> was default and that made sense.</p>\n<p>In the next few lines, there was another <code>bne</code> instruction that followed a <code>cmplwi</code> instruction. Cool, I can probably guess that we're branching after the <code>cmplwi</code> (I'm pretty sure this is a loop, probably a for loop). However, my documentation seems to say that <code>cmplwi</code> modifies the <code>CR3</code> bit field in the condition register.</p>\n<p>Both instances of <code>bne</code> did not have a <code>CRx</code> argument as I saw in my documentation, so I'm lost as to which bit field it's checking.</p>\n<p>Which bit field in the condition register does <code>bne</code> check when the condition register is unspecified?</p>\n</div>",
