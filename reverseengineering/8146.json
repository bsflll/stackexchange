I've programmed in Java, C# and a little bit python but have no clue how to reverse engineer. I thought I'd modify the following source <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/236898/Screen-Brightness-Control-for-Laptops-and-Tablets\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">codeproject.com/Articles/236898/…</a> to lower the backlight even further yet I found out laptops have preset for backlight. So i guess this falls under reverse engineering.</span>",
