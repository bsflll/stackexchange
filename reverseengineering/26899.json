    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am working on Mad Max game [ APEX engine ]\nI do my best to explain the situation.</p>\n<p>so my target executes function like this:\nthere are commands like \" call [eax+XX] \" or \" call RX \" and these execute all functions.\nI was able to find some functions by referenced string but this particular function, I just can't, any name I guess ends up wrong.</p>\n<p>I want to unlock upgrades. I tried Cheat Engine's Ultimap and found nothing ( except the saving function which saves when a different addon/upgrade is selected ). it seems the checking function is run constantly maybe with different arguments.</p>\n<p>so as the calling routine is like this I cant trace back. it's so confusing. there was another game by this engine ( Just Cause 4 ) where I could trace back a string like \" X is locked\" and reach the deciding code but this one is just driving me crazy.</p>\n<p>I think the game uses Vtable but can't find it (i think even if I do, I need leaked SDK and symbols to recognize functions) I tried the IDA pro 7.5+ plugins with no luck.</p>\n<p>there are also strings like \" bla-bla\\bla-bla\\XXX_unlock_condition.gsr\" and i don't know if they are packed within exe (denuvo protected) or packed within .arc and .tab files. and if it's possible to dump them.</p>\n</div>",
