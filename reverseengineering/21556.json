But, I can not put breakpoint on any instruction in the program, the process simply closes with code 4000001f. I also tried a hardware breakpoint, but that doesn't help.\nI have installed TitanHide plugins etc. but also without result.</p>\n<p>I use x32dbg (32 bit target program). And recently read <a href=\"http://waleedassar.blogspot.com/2013/01/wow64-specific-anti-debug-trick.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a>.\nBut x64 debugger does not allow to open x32 application. What could be the problem?</p>\n</div>",
