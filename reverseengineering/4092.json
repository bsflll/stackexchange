    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rF0DW.png\"/></p>\n<p>The code of the functions is still valid but now the <code>_data</code> segment keeps losing 6 bytes everytime I fix it by pressing <code>G</code> going to <code>42A000</code> fixing what it undoes then I scroll down a bit and scroll back up and I'll notice <code>42A000</code> is completely gone when I go into Hex View I'll notice it doesn't show the 6 bytes.</p>\n<p>Also going bit lower I noticed my string started to get lost too when I started I had a bunch more strings then I have now the first string is cut half way with a bunch of fake assembly code.</p>\n<p>My strings keep disappearing one by one each time I work on re-factoring it.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to re-position / move this string / constants information or maybe keep it blocked from being de-synced.</p>\n<p>Whats the cause of it? I checked all the functions I've edited they all start and end with the same addresses as a fresh original none re-factored load of the same file.</p>\n<p>Here's a few pictures of the problems.</p>\n<p>There are the errors in the output that get generated as I scroll down.\n<br/></p>\n<p><img alt=\"0\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SE1Ng.png\"/></p>\n<p>This is how it looks good when I use <code>G</code> + <code>42A000</code></p>\n<p><img alt=\"1\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WvRoL.png\"/></p>\n<p>This is what happens when I scroll a full screen view away from <code>42A000</code> then come back 6 bytes are lost. I'd like to add that <code>align 800</code> I've added it only had <code>align 1000</code> but that's because there was a bunch of zero bytes there so I guess the <code>align</code> just hides em for now I'll use them if I need to later.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"2\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/inPYT.png\"/></p>\n<p>Here is the Hex-View after a screw up, you can see the first 6 are not in use.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"3\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Pu3b4.png\"/></p>\n<p>Here you can see the first String is <code>Player leaving game %s',0AH, 0</code> which isn't even on the strings of the Hex-View above that's how much strings are lost so far.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"4\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KKAyX.png\"/></p>\n<p>When you scroll down far enough then scroll back up it even makes more of a mess.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"5\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WpAug.png\"/></p>\n<p>Any advise what I should do? I'll probably start from a fresh revision of the exe and slowly start fixing things up and looking at the bottom each time to see if anything messes up. Or is there a way to find out what screwed it up? or maybe a way to prevent further screws up in the future? to be honest I recall it screwed up on a fresh project as well just the first time it messed up it just kept undoing my changes with Keys <code>A</code>'s and <code>O</code>'s and <code>D</code>'s</p>\n</div>",

Why is a commercial product misspelling \"analysis\"?</p>\n<p>I would suspect hardware or serious software problems.  Do you have unexpected computer crashes?  faulty memory?  corrupted disc structure?</p>\n<p>If none of those, and in the absence of any better advice I would reinstall IDA, check your hard drives, make sure you have sufficient RAM that is correctly configured in BIOS and check your IDA against a different project.</p>\n</div>",

You should get scared haha. I am almost done renaming from the screwed up project back to a fresh version. Might work better.</span>",
