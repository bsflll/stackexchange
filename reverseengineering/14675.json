    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to RE a Java application that uses an obfuscated loader program to load classes from a second, obfuscated archive-like file. I'm trying to get at these loaded classes for further analysis, but thus far I haven't had any success in figuring out the format of the archive file. Since the classes are loaded into memory anyway, and I used a Java profiler to get a short list of the specific classes and objects that most likely contain what I'm looking for, is there a way to intercept these classes from memory, a core dump, as they're loaded, or through any other means, and inspect/save them? Assume I have full control of the system, and I can stop or modify the program in any way.</p>\n</div>",

An agent is a tool that provides instrumentation capability for an application. Speaking of agents, there are two broad ways they can be developed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In pure java </li>\n<li>In C/C++ in the form of native agents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A native agent has more capability than a pure Java agent, but for your purpose it is sufficient. At some point in the execution flow, the class loader has to load and decrypt the encrypted classes. </p>\n<p>Sample code is provided below. The agent registers a callback (the <code>transform</code> method) to be notified whenever a new class is being loaded. Within the callback we simply dump the contents of the class to disk.</p>\n<pre><code>import java.io.*;\nimport java.lang.instrument.*;\nimport java.security.*;\n\npublic class dumper\n{\n  //A java agent must have a premain method which acts as the entry-point\n  public static void premain(String agentArgs, Instrumentation inst)\n  {\n    System.out.println(\"agent loaded\");\n\n    // Register our transformer\n    inst.addTransformer(new transformer());    \n  }\n}\n\nclass transformer implements ClassFileTransformer\n{\n   // The transform method is called for each non-system class as they are being loaded  \n   public byte[] transform(ClassLoader loader, String className, \n                           Class&lt;?&gt; classBeingRedefined, ProtectionDomain protectionDomain, \n                           byte[] classfileBuffer) throws IllegalClassFormatException\n   {\n     if (className != null)\n     {\n       // Skip all system classes\n       if (!className.startsWith(\"java\") &amp;&amp; \n           !className.startsWith(\"sun\") &amp;&amp; \n           !className.startsWith(\"javax\") &amp;&amp; \n           !className.startsWith (\"com\") &amp;&amp; \n           !className.startsWith(\"jdk\") &amp;&amp; \n           !className.startsWith(\"org\"))\n       {\n         System.out.println(\"Dumping: \" + className);\n\n         // Replace all separator charactors\n         String newName = className.replaceAll(\"/\", \"#\") + \".class\";\n\n         try\n         {\n           FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(newName);\n           fos.write(classfileBuffer);\n           fos.close();\n         }\n         catch (Exception ex)\n         {\n           System.out.println(\"Exception while writing: \" + newName);\n         } \n       }\n     }\n     // We are not modifying the bytecode in anyway, so return it as-is\n     return classfileBuffer;\n   }\n }\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have a writeup on this process here: <a href=\"https://1drv.ms/b/s!Akx1Hfr1ER7pgVv_ixpjTu-G6yer\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Reversing An Obfuscated Java Malware</a></p>\n</div>",

If you have the classfile, you can just diassemble it, find all calls to defineClass (or reflection methods that might potentially call defineClass), and insert a logging function before the call to dump the result. You could use <a href=\"https://github.com/Storyyeller/Krakatau\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Krakatau disassembler/assembler</a> for this.</p>\n<p>The biggest risk is if the obfuscated code is using introspection, it could mess things up. For example, the code might compute a checksum of itself, in which case modifying it at all will cause problems.</p>\n<p>If that is the case you have two options: 1) find all the introspection checks and remove/modify/mock them out, or 2) modify the JVM itself. The later approach would be completely invisible to the obfuscated code, but is harder to do.</p>\n<p>One other thing to try is to look into the Java Agent interface. I haven't used it myself, so I can't say much about it, but this will potentially let you access all loaded classes at runtime with no code modifications.</p>\n</div>",
