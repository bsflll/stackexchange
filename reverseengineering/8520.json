Find the hex bytes that you want to change and lookup the opcodes that you want to change them to.  Also, you can patch directly from IDA if you want as well, which is made easier with the idapatcher plug in. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thesprawl.org/projects/ida-patcher/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://thesprawl.org/projects/ida-patcher/</a></p>\n</div>",
