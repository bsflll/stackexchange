    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I recently got a hold of some free hardware from a company called Telylabs who had recently gone out of business. I got a Tely 200 which is an IP camera that's used for online conferences and presentations. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately it appears that the camera needs to phone home to Tely's servers in order to be operated but the servers were shut down along with Telylabs.</p>\n<p>It seems like such a waste of good hardware so I was hoping someone here might be able to help me unlock it.</p>\n<p>Cheers.</p>\n</div>",

Good luck.</p>\n</div>",
