    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I was just wondering what exactly causes a function without a prologue/epilogue to be generated? If a program is compiled with just stdcall/cdecl convention, why is it that there are some calls which lead to a subroutine that doesn't have the typical push ebp -&gt; mov ebp,esp. Are these just sanity checks generated by the compiler? Are these subroutines important? Or is that impossible to say without actually analysing it? For example, would a compiler produce a call to a subroutine which moves one value into eax and then returns or would that be the programmer changing the binary of the executable?</p>\n</div>",

In particular, <em>leaf</em> functions (those that don't call other functions) do not usually need a prolog (unless required by the ABI) and the compiler may safely omit it.</p>\n</div>",
