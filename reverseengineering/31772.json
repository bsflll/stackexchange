There is a feature which is called \"map to another variable\".\nbut it asks from me to map from the variable from a list. How do u know the exact variable to map into ? (I can assume which variable, but it could be a mistake and continuing in reverse engineering the program could lead to mistakes in next). In Ghidra, it figures the correct variable by itself.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Are there any tips for IDA users ?</li>\n<li>Is there any automation for IDA like in Ghidra ?</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
