    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am looking at the disassembly for iOS applications and need to figure out a way to analyze the cryptography used. I have tried using different plugins for IDA such as FindCrypt, IDAsignsrch, and IDAScope but none of them accurately analyze the cryptography. More specifically for iOS, developers use cryptography by using Apple's Common Crypto library. I have found calls made to methods in the library but what I really need are the function arguments for these methods that specify which crypt alg is used, length of the key, initialization vectors, etc. Backtracking to get the function arguments seems too complicated so is there any other way I can go about getting this information? Thanks for any help.</p>\n</div>",
