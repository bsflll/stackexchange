My question revolves on what happens in the loop.</p>\n<p>Let me explain what I exactly don't understand in the loop: Above the little loop <code>eax</code> is set to be <code>FFFFFFFFh</code>, which is basically \"1\" in all the 32 bits in <code>eax</code>(?). In the little loop <code>eax</code> is incremented. But <code>eax</code> is at max value? What happens when I increment <code>eax</code>? Will it go back to 0?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Nvjpq.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Nvjpq.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

However, by converting it into a do-while loop you can get rid of the unconditional jump and have only the conditional one at the end:</p>\n<pre><code>int pos = -1;\ndo\n{\n  pos++;\n} while (buf[pos]==0);\n</code></pre>\n<p>While a minor optimization, it can improve branch prediction and over a bug binary result in substantial performance improvements. \nThis is most likely why you see the initial value of -1 which is represented as 0FFFFFFFFh. </p>\n</div>",
