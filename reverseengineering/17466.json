    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm just learning to use IDA and according to the book, when using <code>Search</code> function (<code>Search&gt;text...</code>, for example) I should see a window with the found results, like this:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/A50N6.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"screenshot from the book\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/A50N6.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>However, when the search is over, if something is found, I only see in the bottom Search completed text and if I scroll the IDA View-A window, I can see that the text is highlighted. Text string <code>gethostbyname</code> was searched here:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kgNYx.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"screenshot of IDA in use\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kgNYx.png\"/></a>\nI cannot see all the instances at the same time as expected. </p>\n<p>The version I use is IDA 5.0, free version; it's the same version that the book was based on. How can I get the results to show? </p>\n</div>",
