There is a bit of info in idc.idc and the SDK headers, there's Chris Eagle's book (which predates quite a few advances in IDA), and there's the occasional juicy tidbit in the blogs of Ilfak, Igorsk, Daniele and the others.</p>\n<p>But by and large there's mostly Google, reversing IDA.WLL, and copious experimentation. Which means that it's often much slower going than we would like, and quite often things require a lot more effort than necessary because we're unaware of some trick, twist or workaround that somebody else has already discovered. </p>\n<p>The perfect solution would be a community wiki. <strong>So, is there a wiki for all things IDA?</strong> </p>\n<p>If so then all serious spelunkers needs to know about it: it ought to be linked from here, from IDA's home site and major RCE gathering places...</p>\n<p>If there's no wiki yet then we ought to do something about it (like badgering Ilfak).</p>\n</div>",

And where I can go look to find out what's really going on. E.g. why calling <code>set_idc_getattr</code> with the result of a previous call - or that of a call to <code>get_idc_getattr</code> - will fail and crash IDA when your plugin is unloaded (it's because IDA returns <code>\"\"</code> for an empty method but you have to pass 0 to reset, not <code>\"\"</code> which fails and leaves things as they are)</span>",

Or that <code>ltoa()</code> is really <code>ultoa()</code> (i.e., <code>ltoa(-1,10)</code> is not \"-1\" but \"4294967295\" or \"18446744073709551615\").</span>",
