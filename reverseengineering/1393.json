The problem I encounter is that it often bloats the size of the image.  It appears this happens during the <code>mksquashfs</code> step.</p>\n<p>If I'm just unsquashing a filesystem and then resquashing it with the same compression, with no modifications, why is the resulting image larger than the original?</p>\n</div>",
