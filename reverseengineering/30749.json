When I connect it to the usb port of my computer it immediately gets 5v from it, no? Should i do something about that?</li>\n<li>Would it be bad guess to try only connect pins 1-4 to the computer? I mean - should I also connect pins 6 and 8? (The \"none usb\" gnd+vcc ports).\nMore generally, what is a good guess of the 8 pins functioning? (Like what are the usb pins and does the usb-vcc is the only source of voltage)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n</div>",
