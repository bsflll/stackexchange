    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I recently got a copy of a space game and id like to be able to extract the audio/models from the game. </p>\n<p>I've attached an example .ovl file and a .aux file below. \nI have no knowledge on reverse engineering file formats.\nSo I'm sorry if I'm not the best at learning things. \nHowever i will try to do the best that I can.  I was able to gather a bit of information on the web. However no one has archived this yet.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>'The OVL and OVS files are compressed with zlib. OVL files make up\n  parts of a virtual serialized filesystem, and are partially\n  compressed. OVS files are completely compressed and contains most of\n  the bulk data. Can't give you more info than that at the moment as I'm\n  at work and I've not looked at them for a while.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here is the top of the .aux file in hex workshop.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/cjArV.png\"/></p>\n<p>Here is the .ovl file.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SsZx8.png\"/></p>\n<p>Quick Update: I was able to extract some of the files and get the proper name. However, I'm not able too play them. They're corupt.</p>\n<p>I used this quickbms script.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;p=74664#p74664\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;p=74664#p74664</a></p>\n<p><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9dW9Y.png\"/></p>\n<p>OVL FILE DOWNLOAD: \n/mega.co.nz/#!Cx5nHLTa!JgTCENPHMY4MD1LeOLFhwwt8DcZr8pngforLIdPibqs</p>\n<p>AUX FILE DOWNLOAD: \n/mega.co.nz/#!60YAkQ5Q!6M_aexZSx8JyE7GQAKi1K1qD17n9ULOMGKM7t26BaUs</p>\n</div>",
