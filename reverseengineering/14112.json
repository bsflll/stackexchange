In some of the sections the encoding is unknown to me. What I was able to figure out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 byte 0b00?????? \"6bit signed int\" (0x00 = 0, 0x3F = 63, 0x40 = -64, 0x7F = -1)</li>\n<li>2 byte 0xC? 0x?? \"12 bit signed int\" (0xC0 0x40 = 64, 0xC7 0xFF = 2047, 0xC8 0x00 = -2048, 0xCF 0xBF = -65)</li>\n<li>3 byte 0xD? 0x?? 0x?? \"20bit signed int\"</li>\n<li>4 byte 0xE? 0x?? 0x?? 0x?? \"28bit signed int\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Everything big endian, btw.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strings seem to be 0xF3 ... 0x00</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Does somebody know/recognize this encoding?</p>\n</div>",
