You need to do at least two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modify the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entry_point\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Entry Point</a> so that you bypass the execution of the code in the unpacking stub.</li>\n<li>Fix the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable#Import_Table\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">import table</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To do these two things, you need to have some basic understanding about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PE file format</a>. You can find some useful links about the PE file format in this <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/11478/12897\">answer</a>.</p>\n<p>If you know what type of crypter/packer is being used on the file, feel free to upload the sample or tell me so I can maybe give you some guidelines on obtaining the payload. You can check this with a tool like <a href=\"https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/PEiD\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PEid</a> or <a href=\"http://exeinfo.atwebpages.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ExeInfo</a>.</p>\n</div>",
