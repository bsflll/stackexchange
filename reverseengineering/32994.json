Where is it located? Please help.</p>\n<p>It is a question about reversing, not about other programs to use instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong><br/>\nWith suggested in the answer, I found the check after which a forced line break is made (it is <code>COMCTL32.dll+C6E44</code>), increased the limit using code injection, but the text goes out of the field and the scrollbar doesn't work for it. Please help.</p>\n</div>",
