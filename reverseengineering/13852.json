I guess it is some kind of corrupted file, however not sure, so asking if someone has any references to <code>SR</code> files.</p>\n</div>",

I suspect the malware either restores <code>MZ</code> before actually running the file, or uses a custom loader (a la RunPE) to map and execute it, and of course the custom loader can be coded to handle the <code>SR</code> signature in addition (or instead of) <code>MZ</code>.</p>\n</div>",
