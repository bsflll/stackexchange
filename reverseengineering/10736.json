    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have got a <code>custom.dll</code> which is utilized in a larger application. The application executable imports this dll to use its functionality. But this functionality is not used through out the life cycle of the application but only when a specific event occurs. for instance when I input something in the application console a new thread would be created and some of the functionality of the given dll would be used. Now the problem is I am unable to find out what is exactly going on in the dll without having that application executable. I only have the dll file. I want to reverse it. Just like debugging an exe file and go through the registers step by step to find out what is what and why something happens, simply perform a dynamic analysis on the dll instead of the static one.</p>\n<p><strong>To be more specific</strong>, the dll file creates a specific string, I want to know how that string is created and where it is stored for console usage.</p>\n</div>",
