    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>There is a structure with size of 16-Bytes, and an array of it is defined.\nThe disassembly code for navigation through the array is:</p>\n<pre><code>MOV     i, i,LSL#4\nLDR     R4, =arr_of_struct \nADD     i, i, R4\nLDR     var, [i] \n</code></pre>\n<p>But the decompiled code is:</p>\n<pre><code>var = arr_of_struct[4 * i];\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which is wrong and should be:</p>\n<pre><code>var = arr_of_struct[4 * i].field_0;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I think the problem is in first line of disassembly <code>MOV   i, i,LSL#4</code>. Obviously it is multiplying the array index by 16 which is the size of my struct. But IDA translated this line to <code>[4 * i]</code> !!!</p>\n<p>So the first question is what's the reason of this behavior in IDA?\nAnd the second is how can I fix this?</p>\n<p>EDIT:\nMore information:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZvbuD.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZvbuD.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
