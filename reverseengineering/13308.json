    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm working on a reverse engineering project with fat executables on OS X. So far I have established the structure of the <code>fat_header</code>, <code>fat_arch</code> and <code>macho_header</code>, but am having trouble finding documentation about the ordering of the <code>fat_arch</code> sections. Right now my project works by assuming that <code>fat_arch</code> sections appear in order of ascending offset fields. Is this assumption correct, or can the <code>fat_arch</code> sections appear in any order?</p>\n</div>",

The question is why would you expect a fixed order of <code>fat_arch</code> sections?</p>\n<p>The kernel simply loads the Universal Binary at execution time, parses the <code>fat_arch</code> structure(s) and selects a matching architecture type. So in my understanding there is no need for a fixed (or expectable) order of the <code>fat_arch</code> sections.</p>\n</div>",
