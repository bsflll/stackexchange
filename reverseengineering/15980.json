    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>In Android, JNI calls could be used to load native code from other sources. From the link <a href=\"http://bobao.360.cn/learning/detail/3765.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://bobao.360.cn/learning/detail/3765.html</a>, the following sample code shows how a smali code would look like when calling the function \"decryptString\" from a native library.</p>\n<pre><code>const/16 v3, 0x57\nnew-array v1, v3, [B\nfill-array-data v1, :array_2a\n.local v1, \"encryptedStringBytes\":[B\ninvoke-static {}, Lorg/cf/nativeharness/Cryptor;-&gt;getInstance()Lorg/cf/nativeharness/Cryptor;\nmove-result-object v0\n.line 21\n.local v0, \"c\":Lorg/cf/nativeharness/Cryptor;\n# v3 contains a String made from encrypted bytes\nnew-instance v3, Ljava/lang/String;\ninvoke-direct {v3, v1}, Ljava/lang/String;-&gt;&lt;init&gt;([B)V\n# Call the decryption method, move result back to v3\ninvoke-virtual {v0, v3}, Lorg/cf/nativeharness/Cryptor;-&gt;decryptString(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;\nmove-result-object v3\n</code></pre>\n<p>The original java code would look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>public class Cryptor {\n    private static Cryptor instance = null;\n    public static Cryptor getInstance() {\n        if (instance == null) {\n            instance = new Cryptor();\n        }\n        return instance;\n    }\n    public native String decryptString(String encryptedString);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>There seems to be no indication from the smali code that a native code is being loaded. What \"signatures\" in a smali code would be a good indicator that JNI calls are being made from the original java code?</p>\n</div>",

The definition of the <code>decryptString</code> method will contain the <code>native</code> access flag, similar to it's corresponding java declaration. e.g. Something like:</p>\n<pre><code>.method public native decryptString(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String\n</code></pre>\n<p>Additionally, you can look for calls to <code>System.loadLibrary</code> as an indication that the application is loading a library in order to perform JNI calls.</p>\n</div>",
