I am doing a forensic research on Windows Media Player for my Master's Thesis and I am having the same issue, I cannot understand the structure of the \"CurrentDatabase_xxx.wmdb\" file. If you have figured out about the structure and documented it. Can you please share it with me? It would be a great to me. Thanks in advance.</span>",
