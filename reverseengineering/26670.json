    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have modem Echolife HG8245H (V3R016C10S150). I'm using telnet to connect it. I need to read some files from this modem. There's a shell mode I can enter, but it is nerfed badly:</p>\n<pre><code>SU_WAP&gt;shell\n\nBusyBox v1.18.4 (2016-10-11 19:35:35 CST) built-in shell (ash)\nEnter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.\n\nprofile close core dump  \nWAP(Dopra Linux) # ?  \nexit  \ngetcustominfo.sh  \nrestorehwmode.sh  \n</code></pre>\n<p>These are all commands I can do in this mode. There is another way to look at the directories:</p>\n<pre><code>SU_WAP&gt;wap list path /    \nbin  \nboot  \ndev  \netc  \nhtml  \nlib  \nlibexec  \nlinuxrc  \nmnt  \nproc  \nroot  \nsbin  \nshare  \nsys  \ntmp  \nuer   \nusr  \nvar  \n</code></pre>\n<p>It works like 'ls'. But I can not read any file:</p>\n<pre><code>SU_WAP&gt;wap list path /var/wifi.txt  \n/var/wifi.txt  \nsuccess!  \n</code></pre>\n<p>Commands like 'cat' aren't working. Does anybody know is there any way to read these files if you're connecting modem through telnet? Maybe this is not possible with this firmware?<br/>\nThank you:)</p>\n</div>",

Analyzing the firmware is a good idea, maybe I can find some answers I'm looking for. I'll try it, thank you.</span>",
