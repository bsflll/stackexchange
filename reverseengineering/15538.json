The instruction <code>lea ebx,[eax*4+4]</code> will set <code>ebx</code> to <code>4*eax+4</code> or <code>4*(eax+1)</code>. </p>\n<p>I believe I found a revision online of that book which has:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For example, it is common to see an instruction such as lea ebx, [eax*5+5], where eax is a number, rather than a memory address. This instruction is the functional equivalent of ebx = (eax+1)*5, ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>so it seems as though it was corrected at some point. Note that, technically, <code>lea ebx, [eax*5+5]</code> is really implemented as <code>lea ebx, [eax*4+eax+5]</code>.</p>\n</div>",
