    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So I've set myself the goal of editing Crash Bash saves for the PS1.\nI'm using RetroArch + PCSX, so I'm editing memory card .srm files binary contents directly.</p>\n<p>Uploaded a zip with some save games, in case you want to look at them:\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xZgQGt4MmSoduK5lWjAT1osa1hBEbsEE/view?usp=drive_link\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xZgQGt4MmSoduK5lWjAT1osa1hBEbsEE/view?usp=drive_link</a></p>\n<p>After editing file contents, the game ignores the save. Through trial and error, I've seen that I can't modify anything inside the range [0x2200, 0x2850), so that must be CRC-checked.</p>\n<p>Anything before 0x2200 (e.g. file name, icons) is defined in the specs for the memory card file format in here:\n<a href=\"https://www.psdevwiki.com/ps3/PS1_Savedata\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.psdevwiki.com/ps3/PS1_Savedata</a></p>\n<p>The files end up with what looks to be a 32-bit CRC hash.\n0x2850: 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 E3 B6 0C E7</p>\n<p>Weirdly enough, the hash is at 0x285C, but the hash is not covering the gap between (0x2850, 0x285C), so I can edit those bits and the game recognizes and loads the save just fine.\nI think it's safe to say that the game data is in the [0x2200, 0x2860) range and that the game is the one (i.e. not the system) running the CRC-check over [0x2200, 0x2850).</p>\n<p>I've tried copying the hex values of the save into <a href=\"https://crccalc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://crccalc.com/</a> to see if any of the values would match, but no luck.</p>\n<p>I've also tried using <a href=\"https://reveng.sourceforge.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://reveng.sourceforge.io/</a>, <a href=\"https://crc-reveng.septs.app/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://crc-reveng.septs.app/</a> with options:\n-w 32 -l -s</p>\n<p>So that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>-w: Assuming that the hash is 32 bit</li>\n<li>-l: I think that PSX is little-endian, so I assume that this CRC should also be little endian</li>\n<li>-s: search mode from reveng</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since reveng seems to work better with more samples, I've been doing some additional saves, so I have 6 sample files.</p>\n<p>But that returns no results. Judging the usages I've seen (<a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2019/06/27/reverse-engineering-cyclic-redundancy-codes/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://hackaday.com/2019/06/27/reverse-engineering-cyclic-redundancy-codes/</a>), I think it should be fine with 6 saves, but all use cases I've seen have always been running over smaller data, so who knows.</p>\n<p>So I'm running a bit out of ideas here. Let me know if you have any recommendations.</p>\n</div>",
