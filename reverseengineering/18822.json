    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to understands how it works by decompiling my own Objective-C code. Here's the decompiled instruction:</p>\n<pre><code>var_8= -8\nvar_4= -4\n\nSUB             SP, SP, #8\nMOVS            R2, #1\nSTR             R0, [SP,#8+var_4]\nSTR             R1, [SP,#8+var_8]\nMOV             R0, R2\nADD             SP, SP, #8\nBX              LR\n</code></pre>\n<p>From my understanding (correct me if I'm wrong), by line:</p>\n<pre><code>SP=SP-8\nMove 1 to R2\nStore R0 into SP+8+var_4\nStore R1 into SP+8+var_8\nMove R2 into R0\nSP=SP+8\nNext Function\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the actual code:</p>\n<pre><code>%hook SomeClass\n- (int)somemethod {\nreturn 1;\n}\n%end\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now I don't understand why it needs <code>STR R0, [SP,#8+var_4]</code> and <code>STR R1, [SP,#8+var_8]</code> for, as I can't see it purposes. And if I were to <code>return 0</code>, a simple change to of <code>MOVS R2, #1</code> to <code>MOVS R2, #0</code> would do, wouldn't it? But that didn't works.</p>\n</div>",
