I realize tools like Radare and Ghidra do this, but it seems like they must be using heuristics because some things that \"look like\" the end of a function aren't. For example (in pseudo-asm):</p>\n<pre><code>foo:\n  sub r1,r2\n  jge something\n  ret\nsomething:\n  add r1,r2\n  ret\n</code></pre>\n<p>I would say this is one function that happens to have two different exit points, but how would a RE tool figure this out?</p>\n</div>",

The gist seems to match something I've been thinking about for a while - that if you can successfully decompile obfuscated code just enough to apply some optimizations, you should be able to generate something much less obfuscated.</span>",

Compilers are free to optimize the high level code in any way they like. For reference, you can see the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/25880860\">answer</a> provided here.</p>\n<p>Luckily, compilers usually output predictable patterns, so Ghidra, Radare and other disassemblers first locate what they believe is a function by pattern matching and analysis of other functions, then analyze the control flow of the instructions to establish the control flow graph of the function and determine which branches the function has, where it \"ends\" etc.</p>\n<p>There is also some good information here:\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41622226/assembly-function-recognition\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41622226/assembly-function-recognition</a></p>\n</div>",
