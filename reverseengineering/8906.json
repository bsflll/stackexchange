    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>On my keyboard, there's a button that opens Windows 7 calculator when pressed. How would you capture what's calling/opening it?</p>\n<p>Because it's a Logitech keyboard, common sense would say it's via SetPoint software/service, so I would normally start by observing those in Process Monitor. But because I'm doing this as a hands-on reversing exercise rather than merely reprogramming a keyboard button, I'd like to approach it as if I didn't have background knowledge of SetPoint or third-party keyboard software. </p>\n<p>Is there a way I could trace/capture the behind-the-scenes activity from keypress to calc.exe opening?</p>\n</div>",
