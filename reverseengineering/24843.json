    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to reverse engineer the protocol used by a fairly old video intercom. Using a UART logic analyser was able to guess the baud rate, data bits, start/stop bit. It idles at 14v and pulls to GND for 0.</p>\n<p>when I press the same sequence repeatedly of buttons I get the following bytes:</p>\n<pre><code>PREAMBLE (sent when waking up unit):\n0x02 0x16 0x10 0x10 0x10 0x10 0x10 0x10 0x11 0x11 0x18 0x03\n\nVIDEO ON:\n0x02 0x3c 0x31 0x09 0x38 0x25 0x11 0x6f 0x00 0x1e 0x71 0x03 0x02 0x3d 0x11 0x6f 0x00 0x1e 0x31 0x09 0x38 0x25 0x72 0x03\n\nMIC ON:\n0x02 0x4a 0x31 0x09 0x38 0x25 0x11 0x6f 0x00 0x1e 0x7f 0x03 0x02 0x4c 0x11 0x6f 0x00 0x1e 0x31 0x09 0x38 0x25 0x01 0x03\n\nUNLOCK DOOR:\n0x02 0x38 0x31 0x09 0x38 0x25 0x31 0x45 0x11 0x1e 0x74 0x03 0x02 0x3a 0x31 0x09 0x38 0x25 0x11 0x6f 0x00 0x1e 0x6f 0x03\n</code></pre>\n<p>Does this appear to be a protocol standard of any kind of control system?</p>\n<p>EDIT:\nHere is the best I could understand:\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQRyUafqa6CEMd9BOOyAWO4OKGXNKsGLvs6epR5PjqnqBRMbpWOqz2-ij51mFDz4lBUOcVSR7jxK505/pubhtml?gid=1867863786&amp;single=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQRyUafqa6CEMd9BOOyAWO4OKGXNKsGLvs6epR5PjqnqBRMbpWOqz2-ij51mFDz4lBUOcVSR7jxK505/pubhtml?gid=1867863786&amp;single=true</a></p>\n<p>It seems as though the format is as follows:\nBYTE1 = STX\nBYTE2 = COMMAND\nBYTE3,4,5,6 = SRC\nBYTE7,8,9,10 = DST\nBYTE11 = SUM of BYTE2 BYTE10 trimmed to 8-bit</p>\n</div>",
