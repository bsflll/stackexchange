    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>for a C/C++ program compiled on windows using the x86 architecture, what is the best way to find the main function within disassembled code?</p>\n<p>I've found various answers to questions similar to this, but they're answering questions that are far more specific to the OPs use-case. Is there any standard or go-to method for locating the main function when looking at disassembled code?</p>\n<p>NOTE: I'm new to disassembly / reverse engineering. If I'm saying something that doesn't quite make sense, all clarification is much appreciated!</p>\n</div>",
