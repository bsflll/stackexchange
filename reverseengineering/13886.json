To alleviate that, I wanted to use the custom resolution option in Intel graphics management panel, however, I cannot choose advanced options in the custom resolutions options and it is driving me crazy.</p>\n<p>I remembered Intel GFX drivers used some <code>*.inf</code> to enable some options and I believe it is in <code>igdlh64.inf</code>. </p>\n<p>Has any of you  tried to modify this or have some knowledge on this (and no there is not a documentation provided anywhere)?</p>\n</div>",
