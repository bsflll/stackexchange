    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a process that runs and does it's job sometimes (takes some files and does some work). However when I feed it some <em>incorrect</em> files, it fails. I'd like, if possible, to record every step the process goes through, twice and then compare them to see where the two runs diverge.</p>\n<p>My end game here is to force the process to work with the incorrect files; it doesn't really matter what then happens, assuming I can get past this issue - it's become more of a quest for an answer than any real usable outcome at this point.</p>\n<p>I'm tentatively OK with using IDA Pro Free, and reasonable comfortable using cheat engine. I'm happy to learn a new program, if there is one that does this task specifically that'd be great! If there's a program that can record the steps for one iteration and save them to a file I can read, I'm happy to write my own program to compare and find the differences!</p>\n</div>",
