    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I managed to log BLE communications with a Nordic chip based device I am interested in on my Android phone and loaded the log in Wireshark, applying <code>btatt</code> as filter.</p>\n<p>It uses some default BLE \"transmissions\" like \"Battery Service: Battery Level\" as well as UART for actual control. Wiresharks Info column shows e.g.:</p>\n<pre><code>Sent Write Request, Handle: 0x0011 (Nordic UART Service: Nordic UART Tx)\n...\nRcvd Handle Value Notification, Handle: 0x000e (Nordic UART Service: Nordic UART Rx)\n</code></pre>\n<p>How can I set a filter to get only the UART Rx and Tx raw data as a list?</p>\n</div>",
