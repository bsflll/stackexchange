Fortunately, the relocation table of the (ELF/PE) binary shows you where to do this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The upside of this approach is it can even work between operating systems, if they use the same processor architecture. You might need to write wrapper functions around the calls however, \nif the ABI is different.</p>\n<p>If you want to get fancy, don't call the functions directly; embed an emulator engine in your program and have the emulator execute the code. This can help you a lot to detect if\nsome code is missing, or where references to external data are. Once you get it running with an emulator, obviously, you can leave it in your final program, which may even enable\nyou to use some ARM routines in your new PC program.
