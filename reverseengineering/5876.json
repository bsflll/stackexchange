At any later time, you can revert to that state, even\n  though you may have changed the VM considerably since then. A snapshot\n  of a virtual machine is thus similar to a machine in \"saved\" state, as\n  described above, but there can be many of them, and these saved states\n  are preserved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img alt=\"VirtualBox Snapshots\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/k2Y4g.png\"/></p>\n<p>Please create a separate Stack Exchange question for your second question.</p>\n</div>",
