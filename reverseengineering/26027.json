That denotes the (usually random) base address of the executable.</p>\n<p>In IDA this base address is a fixed value e.g. <code>0x400000</code>. Scroll to the beginning of the IDA View and check the <code>Imagebase</code> value (hexadecimal). This value you have to add to every address shown in the Cheat engine.</p>\n<p>If debugging a process directly with IDA the database is automatically relocated to the correct address so you don't have to do the math yourself.</p>\n<p>Note: If I interpret the screen shots correctly 0x119EDD (0x519EDD) is the target address of the conditional jump command. Jump commands are used inside a sub, hence you don't leave the current sub and won't find this address in the sub list</p>\n</div>",
