Often it's just gzip/LZMA or a similar compression they're using (albeit sometimes with modified or stripped headers). </p>\n<p>Thus as a first step I would try something like <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/binwalk/\">binwalk</a> to search for known compression algorithms. If that doesn't help try tools for finding crypto constants such as <a href=\"http://www.hexblog.com/ida_pro/files/findcrypt2.zip\">Find Crypt</a> or <a href=\"http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz/signsrch.zip\">Sign search</a>. This only works if the crypto is a software implementation. If it's a more sophisticated device, say a set-top-box, with a hardware accelerated decryption engine and OTP memory for storing the key then you're out of luck without run-time access (unless they greatly screw up passing the key from OTP to the decryption engine).</p>\n<p>Finally you could try to find out if they use some proprietary algorithm and either emulate that algorithm using <a href=\"http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page\">QEMU</a> or <a href=\"http://gxemul.sourceforge.net/\">gxemul</a> or write your own decompressor in higher level language.</p>\n</div>",

So for example, this would encompass removing the compression that most packers are veiled under.  Doing so will require \"statically tracing\" the execution flow through the packer, whose code may be subject to self-modification.</p>\n<p>That explanation works for a traditional style of packing, wherein the sections of the binary are merely compressed/encrypted.  It might be the case that more sophisticated unpacking strategies are required, for example as described in my paper \"Unpacking Virtualization Obfuscators\" <a href=\"http://static.usenix.org/event/woot09/tech/full_papers/rolles.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a>.</p>\n</div>",
