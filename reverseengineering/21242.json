    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Sometimes I encounter pointers to the middle of a structure, and the code uses a negative offset to refer to earlier code.  This can result in assembly that looks like this, using MIPS as an example architecture:</p>\n<pre><code>lw -0x4($s0)\n</code></pre>\n<p>In IDA Pro, I can highlight the \"-0x4\" part of that instruction and press T to open a new dialog that allows me to set a \"delta\" (the feature is described fully in detail here: <a href=\"http://www.hexblog.com/?p=63\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.hexblog.com/?p=63</a>).  If I knew that $s0 pointed to the 4th byte of a structure, I could set the delta to -4 and get something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>lw struct.field0+4($s0)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is there an analogous way to operate on the middle of a structure in Ghidra?</p>\n</div>",
