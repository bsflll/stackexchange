    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>When I launch IDA for the first time, I move my windows to reflect my perfect window setup. Then I save the desktop and set it as default, plus I additionally save a named backup.</p>\n<p>After this, I close IDA, launch it again, and everything works.</p>\n<p>However, after some time (days-weeks) I get message: \"incompatible saved desktop has been ignored\" and my desktop is completely reset to default. Restoring the desktop from the backup results in the same message. This has already happened a couple of times and each time it was very annoying. What is the reason for this behavior and how can I keep my desktop?</p>\n</div>",

Having a named backup for this scenario certainly won't hurt.</p>\n</div>",
