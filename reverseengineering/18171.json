    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a problem using IDA SDK function <code>del_struc_member(struc_t *sptr, ea_t offset)</code> ,</p>\n<p>If i use it on a member, it creates a gap[4] on the offset ( for dword type), it doesn't recalc the struct and it doesn't shrink it.</p>\n<p>If i use another function from SDK, <code>expand_struc(struc_t *sptr, ea_t offset, adiff_t delta, bool recalc=true);</code> like so <code>expand_struc(struc, 4, -4, true)</code>; </p>\n<p>It does delete the member and shrink it, but it deletes other gap's that goes after (that are needed)plus it change the type of other members , for example:</p>\n<p><em>before</em>:</p>\n<pre><code>  int field_1204;\n  _BYTE gap4B8[4];\n  int field_1212;\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>after</em>:</p>\n<pre><code>  int field_1204;\n  __declspec(align(8)) int field_1212;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If i delete member manually by CTRL+E, it does shrink and doesn't create this problems with removing gap's.</p>\n<p>What is correct way of removing a struct member and shrinking it ?\nP.S.\nMaybe i should set new type for all other gap's that are correct and only after that remove the member i don't need and shrink the struct . Or it would create same problems if its array ? </p>\n</div>",
