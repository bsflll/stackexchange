The numbers next to the names of variables / arguments on stack are offsets with respect to <code>ebp</code>. </p>\n<p>So <code>[ebp-5Ch]</code> is the value of the variable counter.</p>\n<p>And since the variables are accessed via <code>esp</code>, not <code>rbp</code> and there is stack aligning instruction (<code>and esp, FFFFFFF0</code>), I <em>guess</em> IDA is not sure if that instruction will change <code>esp</code> or not, so it won't rename <code>[esp + offset]</code> to an argument or variable, since <code>esp</code> could have different values modulo <code>16</code> (i.e. <code>and esp, FFFFFFF0</code> will not change <code>esp</code> if <code>esp = 11111110</code>, but will change it when <code>esp = 11111118</code>) and thus different values with respect to <code>ebp</code>.</p>\n</div>",
