    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I want to be able to monitor when a memory address is read from on Android. The binary I am studying stores around 60 bytes to a memory location during initialisation and this buffer is used at some later point. My problem is that I can't seem to find where this is accessed by static analysis and would like to set a breakpoint so that I can track its access during runtime.</p>\n</div>",
