    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm hacking a game in my library (Mirror's Edge) to re-route where the save data is located. I've done this with <strong>many</strong> other games successfully, but this one has me stumped. Normally, I start with HxD and search for standard or unicode strings. If I can't find the string I'm looking for with a simple program like HxD, I move to more advanced programs like OllyDbg. In OllyDbg I use either the memory map or I search for all referenced strings in the CPU window. The game was obfuscated and had protection initially but I have since (successfully) removed it. I can't find the string with any of the methods I know, is there another tool or options with HxD or OllyDbg that can find strings that are stored differently?</p>\n<p>Currently the game saves it's data in:</p>\n<pre><code>%USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\EA Games\\Mirror's Edge\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
