    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am reversing an APK and there is a <strong>signature</strong> that needs to be found.\nThe function from where the signature is generated is present in the <strong>.so</strong> file.</p>\n<p>I did <strong>small debugging</strong>. While doing it, the debugger shows all other processes, and when it is actually creating a signature, it automatically returns from the <strong>.so</strong> file to the apk and give the result in byte array format which is 92 of length, and after converting it to hex, it returns 192 hash value.</p>\n<p>For all the input cases input length is 100 or 1000 the output hash value is 192.</p>\n<p>Can anyone help me like which encryption gives <strong>192 hash value</strong>?</p>\n<p>I got all the information except the actual signature generation part. I can also share the assembly code if someone wants to help me.</p>\n</div>",
