    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am learning <code>PE32+</code> (64 bit) files. I have added a new section to the <code>PE32+</code> file and made the new section as the entry point. Some simple instructions are added in the new segment. Now I want to go to the old entry point after executing the new segment, then continue execution from there. I read the articles for <code>PE32</code> that are using <code>assembly</code> language instructions. But I am not able get it working for <code>64 bit</code>(tried to add <code>.asm</code> files). Please help me with any useful information. Is it possible to do it in <code>C++</code>?</p>\n</div>",
