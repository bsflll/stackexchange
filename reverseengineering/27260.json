Then you can overwrite the variable by struct names such as for instance:</p>\n<p>If you have this code:</p>\n<pre><code>mov rax, qword [rsi + 8]\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can do:</p>\n<pre><code>\"td struct ms1 { uint64_t a; int member1; };\"\naht ms1.member1\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then the code will be documented:</p>\n<pre><code>[0x000052f0]&gt; pd 1\n0x000052f0      488b4608       mov rax, qword [rsi + ms1.member1]\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is nothing automatic in this process.</p>\n</div>",
