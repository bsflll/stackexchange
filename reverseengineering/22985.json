    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm currently analyzing a function that has a lot of indirect jumps looking like the following.</p>\n<p>LEA R10,[0x142000000]</p>\n<p>(some instructions that dont change R10)</p>\n<p>JMP R10</p>\n<p>The Ghidra decompiler just treats the indirect jump as a call and doesnt give any meaningful output. How do I go ahead and analyze a function like that? I guess ideally I would just like to change the JMP R10 instruction to JMP 0x142000000 in this example, however if I cant just do that since the opcode is larger and other jumps would no longer align.</p>\n</div>",

If you can manually calculate the jumps then its possible to specify these into Ghidra to override its default behaviour.</p>\n<p>There is a script called <code>SwitchOverride</code>, which can be found in the script manager window. Below is the documentation from the script:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This script allows the user to manually   specify the destinations of an indirect jump (switch)  to the decompiler, if it   can't figure out the destinations itself or does so incorrectly.  To use, create a selection that contains:  the (one) instruction performing the indirect jump to override  other instructions whose addresses are interpreted as destinations of the switch  then run this script</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
