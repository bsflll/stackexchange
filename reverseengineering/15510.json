You may create an <code>imported modules list</code>. Fill <code>imported module list</code> with every module you find in the main PE's import table. Then recursively parse the import tables of all DLLs you found that way. You'll have a list with all DLLs imported. Then, just compare it to the list of loaded modules.</p>\n<p>Discrepancies you find might be either injected DLLs or dynamically loaded DLLs.</p>\n<p>Identifying dynamically loaded DLLs might be a bit more challenging, but one way to identify those is to disassemble the executable and search for calls to <code>LoadLibrary</code>, <code>LoadLibraryEx</code> etc.</p>\n</div>",
