These directories are created by default in your home directory (<code>System.getProperty(\"user.home\")</code>). These directories contain preferences, script/application logs and other “cached” files. (This cache path is decided using <a href=\"https://ghidra.re/ghidra_docs/api/ghidra/framework/Application.html#getUserSettingsDirectory()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">getUserSettingsDirectory()</a>) divided by you Ghidra version.</p>\n<p>Also, if you reinstall, rerun Ghidra, they get recreated.</p>\n</div>",
