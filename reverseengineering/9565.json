    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I used to make maphacks for a game called Warcraft 3. I want to get back into reverse-engineering but with today's technologies (i.e. with the internet being fast enough to download data instead of it being pre-loaded) is it a lost art?</p>\n<p>Reverse-engineering applications and software does not interest me at all, can anyone recommend other games I might enjoy reversing? I always wanted to take a stab at reverse engineering games using the Quake engine but never got into it, could anyone recommend any tutorials?</p>\n<p>Also, my method usually involved writing a pure ASM DLL for injection (which just made it easier to create code caves, etc.). Would this work for other games, or are there different methods you have to go about injecting a modification?</p>\n</div>",

Some fun-to-reverse games are Battlefield, Call of Duty, Counter-Strike, DayZ, Rust... among others; it really depends on which games you enjoy playing. Injecting DLLs is the most common method of coding cheats, but I wouldn't code one and inject it straight into the game. You need to evade the anti-cheat first. You can mix C/C++ with ASM, no need to write pure ASM binaries.</span>",
