[...] </p>\n<p>We have implemented a prototype of UROBOROS in OCaml and Python, with\n  a total of 13,209 lines of code. Our prototype works for both x86 and\n  x64 ELF binaries. [...] </p>\n<p>We have presented UROBOROS, a tool that can disassem- ble stripped\n  binaries and produce reassembleable assem- bly code in a fully\n  automated manner. We call this tech- nique reassembleable\n  disassembling and have developed a prototype called UROBOROS. Our\n  experiments show that reassembled programs incur negligible execution\n  overhead, and thus UROBOROS can be potentially used as a foundation\n  for binary-based software retrofitting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Dyninst [10, 20]</strong> <em>(Static+Dynamic)</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>BUCK, B., AND HOLLINGSWORTH, J.
