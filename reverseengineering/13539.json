Multiprocessing/threading might complicate things for you if you're uneducated about those, to name one example.</p>\n<p>Another topic you should be familiar with if you're interested in reverse engineering and didn't mention is knowing assembly languages for the architectures you'll be reverse engineering (PCs are usually Intel's x86 and AMD's x86_64). There are instruction set manuals for both, which cover the assembly languages in depth and provide both a reverence manual and introduction to general approaches and concepts (such as registers, the stack, etc.).</p>\n<p>You can obviously learn as you go, and that's a valid approach towards learning reverse engineering, for that you should really learn by examples.</p>\n<p>you could head over to <a href=\"http://crackmes.de\" rel=\"nofollow\">crackmes.de</a> or <a href=\"http://www.tuts4you.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.tuts4you.com</a> and start on the beginner reverse-engineering binaries and read as many write-ups (solutions) as you can!</p>\n<p>Another good novice resource is <a href=\"https://tuts4you.com/download.php?list.17\" rel=\"nofollow\">lena141's series of dynamic RE videos</a>.</p>\n</div>",
