    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>First, sorry for my bad english.</p>\n<p>What I know about 0xCC instruction is a breakpoint instruction.</p>\n<p>But, when I see x64 binary, each functions are seperate by multiple 0xCC instructions.</p>\n<p>I think x64 uses 0xCC instructinon as not only breakpoint but also function's serperator.</p>\n<p>So, what 0xCC instruction means in this case? If this instruction are really means function's seperator, does it always placed between each function at least 1 single 0xCC instruction? (at least call in code section which is going to the function in code section)</p>\n<p>The reason why I ask this question is, I want to make my code to verifying every binary's call instruction automatically, but some call instruction pointing invalid function. (this invalid functions are made by packer)</p>\n<p>What I considering is, if every functions are seperate by 0xCC in x64 binary, (call_address - 1) must be 0xCC and this can be one of my verifying condition.</p>\n<p>I hope for your guide. thank you.</p>\n</div>",
