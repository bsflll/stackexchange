    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am a little bit confused with this strange issue with ARM firmware. My original firmware file has no symbols, so I need to find them by myself trough the internet. But here I have a certain function of which I am sure. I have some reliable xrefs to it. But sometimes, some function call the loc_'s following its start. Look here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KPBWB.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KPBWB.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>So, it should start from the STMFD as usual, but here is not the case. Why? </p>\n</div>",

Double-check your firmware load address and inspect the calling code; I think the call may have been bogus code too, which caused IDA to start disassembling at a wrong place.</p>\n</div>",
