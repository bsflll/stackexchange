At the end of this process i need to return to main exe and continue debugging to reach the OEP. I am unable to do it because the main exe refuse to be attached as process from any debugger.

If such is the case check whether you can attach to the main process before the loader process is created. If you cannot, then the main exe may well be <a href=\"http://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2856/how-to-attach-debugger-or-start-analysis-of-process-that-is-debugging-itself\">debugging itself</a>.</span>",
