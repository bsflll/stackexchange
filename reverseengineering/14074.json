Strangely, I could hardly find any information on how to do this, although some projects have to implement something like this (e.g. ida, angr, amoco, ...).</p>\n<p>In other words: I want to know where <em>elf imports</em> will be located in virtual memory. Of course, the sections should adhere to these relocations.</p>\n<p>Code snippets very appreciated.</p>\n</div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So after some toying around with elftools, I found the following solution for import-symbols:</p>\n<pre><code>    for section in self._elf.iter_sections():\n        if not isinstance(section, RelocationSection):\n            continue\n    symtable = self._elf.get_section(section['sh_link'])\n    for relocation in section.iter_relocations():\n        if not relocation['r_info_sym']:\n            continue\n        symbol = symtable.get_symbol(relocation['r_info_sym'])\n        yield ImportSymbol(relocation['r_offset'], symbol.name)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The code is inspired by <a href=\"https://github.com/eliben/pyelftools/blob/master/scripts/readelf.py\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"implementation\">pyelftools readelf implementation</a></p>\n<p>Although pyelftools offers some relocation handling, I've not yet seen a binary for which that actually works. It will complain it doesn't know some relocation types, but for the future, I'll post this snippet:</p>\n<pre><code>def _reloc_section(self, section):\n    rh = RelocationHandler(self._elf)\n    data = section.data()\n    relocation_section = rh.find_relocations_for_section(section)\n    if relocation_section:\n        try:\n            rh.apply_section_relocations(data, relocation_section)\n        except Exception as e:\n            print 'Could not relocate %s' % section.name\n    return data\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
