    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have the following lines in IDA PRO:</p>\n<pre><code> lea  eax, [ebp+Filename]\n push  offset Filename     ;lpString2\n push  eax                 ;lpString1\n call  ds:lstrcpyA\n ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, I know what the function <code>lstrcpy()</code> does. It copies the string at <code>offset Filename</code> into the buffer pointed to by <code>eax</code>. But when I click on <code>offset Filename</code> to navigate to the string, I see the following :</p>\n<pre><code>char Filename[]\nFilename      db 54h dup(0)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, I highlight that <code>54h</code> part of the line and click on the button A, but it causes the error message:</p>\n<pre><code>Command \"MakeAscii\" failed\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, what can I also do to find out the string which is copied to the buffer ? </p>\n</div>",
