This means that when a DLL changes it's location between executions you're still trying to execute the same absolute value, resulting in different types of errors depending on the content of the actual content in that address.</p>\n<p>Specifically to your question - <code>0xFF 15</code> is an absolute, near, 4 byte immediate call. <code>0xFF</code> is used for absolute calls, while <code>0x8E</code> is used for relative calls (as you can see in your image, at the yellow highlighted line).</p>\n<p>Replacing the single byte <code>0xFF</code> will turn the instruction to a relative instruction, meaning the call will be to <code>$+5e01d0e4</code> instead of to <code>0x5e01d0e4</code>. The dollar sign (<code>$</code>) is a conventional representation of \"the address of the next instruction\".</p>\n<p>Because how the x86 CPU (and many other CPUs) works, it is easier to first advance to the next instruction, and only then carry out any <code>EIP</code> modifying operations, thus having relative operations modify the <code>EIP</code> values of the <em>following</em> instruction.</p>\n<p>Replacing the four last bytes with any signed integer will make the call instruction add that number (thus negative numbers are used to call a smaller address value) to the address of the next instruction. For example, the byte code <code>FF 15 EA FF FF FF</code> will be translated to a six byte long instruction <code>call $-6</code>, creating a <code>call</code> that calls itself, eventually faulting on a stack overflow.</p>\n<p>A method simpler than manually editing instruction byte code could be using olly's assemble command with a <code>$</code> sign to indicate a relative instruction.</p>\n</div>",
