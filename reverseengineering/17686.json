So I wanted to try and change the framerate of applications (eg. this unity game) at an assembly level on iOS ( I have an 120hz iPad pro so I find it really important.) Therefore to learn how this was done I decrypted the binary of my very own app on the app store and then compared it with the C++ code that is created when unity exports to Xcode.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XlaCx.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XlaCx.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Note the highlighted area and the value of 120 (the framerate). This is in C++.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MFkxv.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MFkxv.png\"/></a>\nBut now in assembly note how the value is simply \"System.Int32\"\nSoo what happened to it? Maybe it's something to do with the /<em>hidden argument</em>/ in the C++ code? but for other apps I obviously won't have access to that. I'm still new to this and i've been trying to learn the basics of assembly. I'm just baffled as to what I should do and how the value can be changed? If someone could explain how to do so that would be great. If not a helpful pointer as to what I should learn and do next to solve this problem, maybe links to articles would be also helpful. Thanks in advance.</p>\n</div>",

Behind the scene there are two methods (called getter, and setter) but in the source code it looks like there is no function calls. This is how <code>TargetFrameRate</code> looks like:</p>\n<pre><code>public int TargetFrameRate { get; set;} // getter &amp; setter omitted for brevity\n</code></pre>\n<p>What you see in your assembly is in fact calling the setter (thus <code>set_targetFrameRate</code>). And as those are not method, there can only be one value that is passed to them (or assigned as in C# code they look like normal assignment operation i.e. <code>TargetFrameRate = 120</code>). </p>\n<p>Of course Obj-C/Swift and C++ are different and does not support those so that have to be mitigated and for some reason they were coded like that (method &amp; more than one value).</p>\n<p>So there is no issue that you see only one argument that <code>set_TargetFrameRate</code> takes.</p>\n<p>What more you can do is to open Unity3d in .net decompiler like <a href=\"https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dnSpy</a> and verify that this is in fact how <code>TargetFrameRate</code> looks like:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xv3kj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xv3kj.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Since it has an <code>InternalCall</code> &amp; <code>extern</code> you would need to dig a bit deeper to get to the actual implementation.</p>\n</div>",
