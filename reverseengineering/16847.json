    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I need to rename some memory address \"names\" in IDAPython. I'm talking about the dword_805672 formatted ones. Please see the screenshot below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/L5X6A.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/L5X6A.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I've placed red boxes around the names which I would like to rename with IDAPython. I've searched the API docs and I came up with: <code>idc.MakeName(ea,name)</code> however, as you can see, this only placed a name in the spots labeled <code>dynamic_1</code>, <code>dynamic_2</code> and so on. I want to rename the actual operand.</p>\n</div>",

I'm assuming that you did something like <code>idc.MakeName(0x123772cd, 'dynamic_3')</code> instead of doing the make name on the actual dword in the instruction.</p>\n<p>Something like this should be done instead:</p>\n<p><code>idc.MakeName(idc.GetOperandValue(0x123772cd, 0), 'dynamic_3')</code></p>\n<p>In this case <code>idc.GetOperandValue</code> will return the value of the zeroth operand (ie. 0x123ef5e0). That address will then be labeled 'dynamic_3' and IDA should update the UI to show the change. </p>\n</div>",

Do you have any tips on how to learn the little fine ins and outs of the API like this? This is the kinda stuff that's not really in the docs :(</span>",
