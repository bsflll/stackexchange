Try-Catch statements don't look nice.</p>\n<p>I've been searching and it seems like IDA does not support them so I was wondering if there is a way to either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hide sections of the Pseudocode</li>\n<li>Create extensions for Hex-Rays to support them</li>\n<li>Tell IDA how and where the exceptions are</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is how the thing looks like at the moment:</p>\n<pre><code>  v3.SavedRegs = &amp;savedregs;\n  v3.Handler = &amp;loc_43B24C;\n  v3.Next = NtCurrentTeb()-&gt;NtTib.ExceptionList;\n  __writefsdword(0, &amp;v3);\n  Controls::TControl::ReadState(Self, a2);\n  __writefsdword(0, v3.Next);\n</code></pre>\n<p>And I would like to end up with something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>  try {\n    Controls::TControl::ReadState(Self, a2);\n  } ... {}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or if I can just hide those parts...</p>\n<pre><code>  //try {          &lt;- Block comment (parts hidden)\n    Controls::TControl::ReadState(Self, a2);\n  //} ... {}       &lt;- Block comment (parts hidden)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Anything is good as long as I can hide those lines because they are distracting AF. Thank you very much!</p>\n</div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've considered doing this myself, but it's tricky for many reasons.</p>\n<p>First, exception internals are not standardized across languages, platforms, or implementations. 64-bit Windows programs use a data-driven exception model, i.e., the <code>RUNTIME_FUNCTION</code> (etc.) entries in the <code>.rdata</code> segment. In this paradigm, the binary pre-registers information about exception scopes and handlers with the operating system via standardized structures, which takes care of lookup and dispatch when an exception occurs. Your example shows 32-bit Delphi; 32-bit Windows programs use a code-driven exception model, where the code is responsible for adding and removing exception handlers on demand, using proprietary metadata formats. As a result, adding exception support would require a lot of platform and language-specific effort, and may involve reverse engineering undocumented exception implementations across multiple runtime versions for a given language. While there would be benefits to adding exception support, it would also require a lot of work to develop (and maintain as the runtime support evolves over time).</p>\n<p>Secondly, even if we were to decompile exception-related things into a simplified, language-independent representation, the most logical method of presentation would involve extending Hex-Rays to support things like <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code>/<code>finally</code> blocks as scoped constructs, and producing these things in the output. Unfortunately, extending the Hex-Rays <code>ctree</code> IR in this fashion is impossible for third-party developers. The valid <code>ctree</code> expression types are held in an <code>enum</code> called <code>ctype_t</code>. We'd need to add new entries like <code>cit_try</code> to this <code>enum</code>, we'd need to extend the <code>union</code> in <code>cinsn_t</code> to support an additional <code>ctry_t *</code> element, and we'd need to modify all of the existing <code>ctree</code> code in Hex-Rays to be aware of our modifications (for example, to print the <code>try</code> blocks in the decompilation listing). None of these things can be done by third-party plugins, as the existing, pre-compiled code will generate INTERRs upon encountering our <code>cit_try</code> instructions. Adding statement types to the <code>ctree</code> IR can only be accomplished via source-level modifications, not via plugins.</p>\n<p>Finally, even though Hex-Rays technically has an option not to eliminate exception-related code, I'm not completely sure how it works. Exception-related code often manifests itself as \"function chunks\" attached to a given function, which have no incoming control flow references. As a result, that code is eliminated by the optimizer very early into the decompilation process. You'd need to find a way to preserve it.</p>\n<p>It's a daunting prospect for a third-party developer; I myself abandoned the idea. It's also daunting for the first-party developers. I don't expect to see it in any major decompiler any time soon.</p>\n</div>",

Seems like a real pain in the ass to do from what you said so maybe I should stick to just putting comments here an there... But either way I think that a feature to hide lines or group of instructions just like the disasm does would be useful in the software.</span>",
