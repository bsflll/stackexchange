A jailbroken device can access an iOS device's root file system from a shell or any application (such as iFile).  As of iOS 8, the Applications directory has changed to <code>/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But from <a href=\"http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Seatbelt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a>, I shouldn't?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Well, not necessarily.  If the application is running as root (think iFile or Filza), you can have read and write access to any directory on the device.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Maybe I should write a App to scan the FileSystem on a normal iPhone and a jailbreak one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In theory, any application can ask to read or write a file to any directory.  This is frequently how jailbreak checks are done in production apps.  If the file manager does not return an error when trying to read from <code>/var/mobile</code>, then you know the application is being run as root on a jailbroken device.</p>\n</div>",
