Say I have a variable which is created in some function and it is argument to other functions.<br/>\nMy question is how to monitor this variable? In monitor I mean is there any way to set some kind of breakpoint and stop execution every time something is written or read from this variable? Or somehow trace the read/write operation on it? thanks.</p>\n</div>",

I have been looking at similar for a target without an IDA debugger. I have called an instruction set simulator dll from IDA Python, but hit performance problems early on with Python so need to write a plug in.</span>",
