However, I load some symbols manually using the symbols that I can download on my msdnaa account. The problem is that I've got several different version of d2d1.dll. My symbols are for the dll present just after the OS installation. As I update my OS and then remove some specific update so as to diff dll that were changed, my symbols are not the correct one anymore. </p>\n<p>What did I do wrong? How could I get the correct symbols for each version? </p>\n</div>",
