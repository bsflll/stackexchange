I also see a lot of this obfuscator on other dll, but protectionId scan result it wasn't being packed\nwith this note :</p>\n<pre><code>Section [0x0] 'SteveW  ' has a higher physical size than virtual size..\n</code></pre>\n<p>and also this :</p>\n<pre><code>Warning : Import Table is bad !!!\n</code></pre>\n<p>here is the dll link :\n<a href=\"https://github.com/appsec-labs/Advanced_Packet_Editor/blob/master/Source/PacketEditor/WSPE.dat\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">WSPE.dat</a></p>\n</div>",
