    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>the experiment is on Linux, <code>x86</code> <code>32-bit</code>. </p>\n<p>So suppose in my assembly program, I need to periodically (for instance every time after executing 100000 basic blocks) dump an array in <code>.bss</code> section from memory to the disk.  The starting address and size of the array is fixed. The array records the executed basic block's address, the size is <code>16M</code> right now.</p>\n<p>I tried to write some native code, to <code>memcpy</code> from <code>.bss</code> section to the <code>stack</code>,  and then write it back to disk. But it seems to me that it is very tedious and I am worried about the performance and memory consumption, say, every-time allocate a very large memory on the stack...</p>\n<p>So here is my question, how can I dump the memory from global data sections in an efficient way? Am I clear enough? </p>\n</div>",

In my understanding, you could write in your \"instrumentation code\" some logic like the one in my Ida script, enhancing it with a block counter and triggering the file write only when that counter reaches the requested value. A free memory area could hold the counter. I hope I understood you right.</span>",
