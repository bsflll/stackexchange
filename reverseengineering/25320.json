I found and populated a 20-pin header:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mfRh0.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"ARM JTAG 20-pin header\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mfRh0.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>but JTAGulator doesn't think it has a valid combination of TDI/TDO/TMS/TCK on either a IDCode or bypass scan. I put a logic analyzer on it and don't really see a steady clock:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HIEoZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"logic analyzer 20-pin jtag\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HIEoZ.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Is it possible the clock is elsewhere and some of the header pins are still TDI/TDO etc., or do any of the logic analyzer data seem they could be from JTAG?</p>\n</div>",
