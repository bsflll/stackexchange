            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">I've wondered about this myself. I think it's merely a sentinel value that shows whether the initialization was done. If you look for xrefs (<code>x</code> in IDA) to <code>WPP_GLOBAL_Control</code> you should see only two instances of <code>w</code> (write) with everything else being reads. In a driver I am reversing right now I see the writes only in <code>WppInitKm</code> and <code>WppCleanupKm</code>. Probably slightly different for user mode, but in all likelihood similar. Much of the WPP/ETW/tracelogging details can be gleaned from headers and the tools that preprocess your code, if you employ WPP.</span>",
