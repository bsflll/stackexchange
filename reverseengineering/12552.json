I don't know if the dots represent unprintable characters.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to adjust the format of the output?  Ideally, I am hoping to get the printable strings without the hexadecimal numbers.  I have looked through the objdump man page but could not see a way to do this.</p>\n</div>",

With most versions of <code>strings</code>, you don't need the <code>-a</code>, and you can select the character encoding with <code>-e</code>, 16 bit little endian in this case. See the manual page for other encodings.</p>\n<p>You can use some of the Linux text utilities to further postprocess the output, but as @JasonGeffner said, superuser.com is a better place to ask about them.</p>\n</div>",
