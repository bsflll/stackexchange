Specialized imaging software ? Chemical reagents, and others that are to buy for each check ? How much man-hours of work ? What else ?</p>\n<p>If it is easier to provide an answer for a particular case, you can assume that it is a <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/evalapply/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">K-machine</a> but made on a die at modern 22nm process.</p>\n<p>If you prefer a processor you are more familiar with, you can assume an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#Core_license\" rel=\"noreferrer\">armv6</a> processor but made on a die at modern 22nm process.</p>\n<p>You can assume that I will have access to all details of the fab to produce the processor, but that the particular physical processor I want to audit was made on the same fab line by the NSA.</p>\n</div>",
