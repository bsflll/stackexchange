    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have noticed many times whilst disassembling executables that often the compiler will produce jumps to other unconditional jumps, rather than simply jumping to the final destination. For example:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rlCkX.png\"/></p>\n<p>Notice instead of <code>jmp 0x100001634</code> it would have written <code>jmp 0x100001681</code> and skipped the two other jumps in between. Is there a particular reason for not doing so?</p>\n</div>",

At times, malwares can perform control flow obfuscations by making use of a lot of opaque predicates (in this case, unconditional jumps).</p>\n<p>In fact, if you perform an instruction trace using a pintool (DBI) on a malware, at times you will observe a lot of jmp instructions executed in sequence. You can observe these type of subroutines in malwares which make use of polymorphic engines. It can help deter reverse engineering as it alters the control flow while stepping through the code.</p>\n</div>",
