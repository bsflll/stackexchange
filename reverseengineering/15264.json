    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Currently I am stuck finding the base address for IDA to disassemble the boot image correctly.</p>\n<p>The <code>img</code> file is coming from <code>/dev/block/mmcblk0boot0</code> (<code>mcc_utils</code> is executing: <code>cat bootarea.img &gt; dev/block/mmcblk0boot0</code> to restore this image). And looking at the string output it shows that it prolly is U-boot <code>U-Boot 2011.12 (Nov 04 2016 - 12:13:11)</code> and the platform is running android 4.4.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CtDt1.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Start of image\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CtDt1.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>The image starts with <code>0x19034</code> and then zero's until <code>0x200</code> which seem to contain some sort of checksum.Then at <code>0x600</code> certain address appear all starting with <code>0xE004xxxx</code>.</p>\n<p>At <code>0x660</code> the first opcodes seem to placed and just before that <code>0xBACODE</code> is shown 3 times.</p>\n<p>I have tried to drop the image file until <code>0x600</code> and several different base addresses. But I don't seem to be able to get all offset correctly in IDA. There are a lot of strings at the bottom which could be matched.</p>\n<p>The image file can be downloaded <a href=\"https://ufile.io/18rbo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Hopefully someone can help me finding the correct offset and base address.</p>\n</div>",
