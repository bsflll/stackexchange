This is an example of 32 bit x86 calling convention (C).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Before a subroutine call, caller saves caller-saved registers on stack (registers eax, ecx, edx - \"if required\")</li>\n<li>Then it pushes subroutine parameters on stack in inverted order (in your case, 9 and address of \"%d\\n\")</li>\n<li>Then calls the subroutine (return address is pushed on top of stack)</li>\n<li>After return (return value goes in eax), caller removes the parameters, restores the stack and also restores caller-saved registers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now the I believe you got confused because of \"42a\" and \"42e\" instructions (mov). you must be familiar with \"push\" instruction - which is nearly equivalent to (sub esp, 4; mov [esp], reg32 - (this also affect flags unlike push))</p>\n</div>",
