    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to extract the sprites from Railroad Tycoon 2. Having successfully extracted the files contained in the data .paks it uses, I am now stuck at trying to extract files from the .imb files it seems to use to store the sprites. There are also .pal files, I presume these are connected somehow.</p>\n<p>I have uploaded a few of the .imb files here as an example: <a href=\"https://mega.nz/file/l3hxwADD#rcOwsQEUliZ3ypX95ZwW4BElLk5rPzrfr63QKXQ0dOA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://mega.nz/file/l3hxwADD#rcOwsQEUliZ3ypX95ZwW4BElLk5rPzrfr63QKXQ0dOA</a></p>\n<p>Hopefully someone can help.</p>\n</div>",

Perhaps include hex dumps (in text, not image format) of any headers or other interesting parts of the .imb and .pal files?  (Many people won't download files of unclear provenance.)</span>",
