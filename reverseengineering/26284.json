    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm working on a decompilation of a windows PE (with its full debug symbols in a PDB) and I'm using IDA to help with it.</p>\n<p>I want to know how I can get a list of all references to a given class member variable. When I press 'X' in a name that is a class member variable in the decompiler window it only shows xrefs to it within the actual function being decompiled. I want to see the references in all of the functions. Is that even possible without coding a script?</p>\n</div>",

Derive a class off of <code>ctree_visitor_t</code>, whose <code>visit_expr</code> methods looks for <code>cot_memptr</code>/<code>cot_memref</code> expressions. When such an expression <code>x</code> is found, compare <code>x-&gt;type</code> to your desired structure type. If it matches, you've found a place where that structure is used. To find accesses to a specific field, compare <code>x-&gt;m</code> against the offset of the field you want. To find this across the database, apply your <code>ctree_visitor_t</code> derivative to all functions in the database.</span>",
