    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have an ARM based Huawei router and Im trying to do injection vulnerability on page under diagnostics where's \"ping\" feature is. So first I tried this command <code>-c 1 127.0.0.1</code> and it worked</p>\n<pre><code>--- DNS Statistics ---\nServer Response = Non-Existent Domain\nWanIP = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nName = -c 1 127.0.0.1\nAddress = -\nAliases = -\nTime = 15ms\n--- Ping Statistics ---\nOperation failed.\n</code></pre>\n<p>then I tried this command <code>127.0.0.1; echo -c 4</code> but I get</p>\n<pre><code>Test failed.\n--- Ping Statistics ---\nOperation failed.\n</code></pre>\n<p>and after some more google-ing I found this command <code>ping -c 5 \"$(id)\" and when I click on </code>start ping` it seams that's get stuck in some loop\nI suspect that maybe shell is open, here is how it looks</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5xywJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5xywJ.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>So I want to recreate sending that command with curl, I created mine curl like this</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DePbs.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DePbs.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I think <code>maintenancend.cgi</code> is resposable for ping requests. In <a href=\"https://mega.nz/file/IdBTDIiC#PB6zyLxzUNzEQzvTx6lUW01JEmJX315ZF4LvyEh9JQA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">zip</a> you will find <code>Diagnose Ping Configuration.html</code> and ARM <code>web</code> utility which is responsible for\n.cgi web requests</p>\n<p>Edit:\nSo I made request directly to my web ping page and it look's like this</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xIVCd.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xIVCd.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>first button should be <code>start</code> and second <code>stop</code> but they are in java so I need a way to refer to them by name. Also I found example of POST method on web end here it is</p>\n<pre><code>curl -X POST -F 'name=linuxize' -F '<a class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"147179757d7829787d7a616c7d6e7154716c75796478713a777b79\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">[emailÂ protected]</a>' https://example.com/contact.php\n</code></pre>\n<p>but I need names of buttons/fields to supply and there is non in that \"java button's\". <a href=\"https://www.tazkranet.com/Esalny/HUAWEI-GPON/Route.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here</a> you can find emulated web UI</p>\n</div>",
