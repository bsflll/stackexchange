The register %eax has the value of \"12345678\" (string) under the address. I understand that in the second line we are moving the value of $eax to %bl (8 bits). So it is supposed to take the first two numbers from the string \"12\", right? I wish some clarify this line. Thanks a lot.</p>\n</div>",
