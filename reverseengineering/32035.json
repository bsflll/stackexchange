    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm a <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">git</a> addict. Whenever I develop a C++, Python application, I need to version control it. For example, the csproj file managed by Visual Studio holds the compiling configurations for a C# project, and I put the file into git.</p>\n<p>Now, as a newbie in reverse engineering, I'm using IDA. I like IDA's abilities to rename functions and variables, add comments, etc. I find an IDA project has a database, but it's not plain text.</p>\n<p>How would I save my reverse engineering progress in git? How would I share my comments, notes, renamings to others so that they can pick up and continue studying the same executable?</p>\n</div>",
