    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a contactless card which I'd like to know the capabilities. I assume the card works with NFC. However standard tools (<em>nfc-list</em>) do not seem to be able to retrieve regular informations from it (not even the UID), the phone can't detect it either. This may be because the chip may have a not common NFC type.</p>\n<p>Now my question is: how can I know what kind of chip technology this is so I can begin working on understanding how data is stored and what is the protocol ?</p>\n<p>What kind of additional hardware other than a simple reader (e.g ACR122U) may come handy to identify the card ?</p>\n</div>",
