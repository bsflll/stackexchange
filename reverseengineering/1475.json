Following a one-to-one relation, BinDiff selects these initial matches based on the above characteristics.</p>\n<p>The next step tries to find matchings on the call graph of each binary: for a verified match, the set of called functions from the matched function is examined in order to find event more matches. This process is repeated as long as new matches are found.</p>\n<h2>Drill Down</h2>\n<p>In practice, not all functions will be matched by the one-to-one relation induced by the initial matching strategy, so after the initial matchings have been determined we still have a list of unmatched functions.\nThe idea of the drill down phase is to have multiple different function matchings strategies which are applied until a match is found. The order of applying these strategies is important: BinDiff tries those strategies for which it assumes the highest confidence, first. Only if no match could be found, it goes on with the next strategy. This is repeated until BinDiff runs out of strategies, or until all functions are matched. Examples include MD index, match based on function names (i.e. imports), callgraph edges MD index, etc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sto.nato.int/publications/STO%20Meeting%20Proceedings/RTO-MP-IST-091/MP-IST-091-26.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MD-Index paper</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.zynamics.com/en//downloads/bindiffsstic05-1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Graph-based Comparison of Executable Objects</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.zynamics.com/en//downloads/dimva_paper2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Structural Comparison of Executable Objects</a></p>\n<p>(Disclaimer: working @ team zynamics / google, hopefully I didn't mess up anything, otherwise soeren is going to grill me ;-))</p>\n</div>",

Actually, the given file is disassembled, then it should be split into <strong>basic blocks</strong> (these are pieces of code that have straight way of execution, though this definition is right in that very case). It's clear (considering the x86 architecture, for example) that instructions like <code>jxx</code> change the control flow of a program. So basic blocks are usually terminated by them. This very process of splitting code into blocks isn't a complicated task, the more challenging part is determining jump destination.</p>\n<p>For example something like that:</p>\n<pre><code>...\njz eax\n</code></pre>\n<p>So we can't (easily) understand with automated static analysis where this call is pointed to. Trivial cases can be \"emulated\", but in general that work is very hard and frustrating. The other option is to trace program to look which paths does code execute (that can be done manually).\nWhen these blocks are found the only one thing left is to build human-readable graph.</p>\n<p>Anyway there is a pile of ways execution flow can be changed (exceptions, hot patching by another thread, system-dependent events etc).</p>\n</div>",
