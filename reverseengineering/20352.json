You are asking <code>angr</code> to figure out everything on it's own which may be feasible for simple and uncomplicated C programs but not for something like Go binaries.</p>\n<p>For example, the <code>fmt.Scanln</code> function will call multiple Go functions before you reach <code>libc.read</code>. Angr has SimProcedures for <code>read</code> but not for <code>fmt.Scanln</code>. To figure out what <code>fmt.Scanln</code> does it has to symbolically execute after which only it may able to discover the dependency between <code>stdin</code> and the program output. Symbolically executing <code>Scanln</code> is by no way a simple task.</p>\n<p>Instead, you should break down the problem in parts which you can ask <code>angr</code> to solve. Like if you have identified the buffer where the user input is stored you can mark that as symbolic and instruct <code>angr</code> to find the path to the \"good password\" branch.</p>\n<p>Further resources on Go reversing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://r3xnation.wordpress.com/2018/01/11/reversing-go-binaries-part-1/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://r3xnation.wordpress.com/2018/01/11/reversing-go-binaries-part-1/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://2016.zeronights.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/GO_Zaytsev.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://2016.zeronights.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/GO_Zaytsev.pdf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rednaga.io/2016/09/21/reversing_go_binaries_like_a_pro/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://rednaga.io/2016/09/21/reversing_go_binaries_like_a_pro/</a> </li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
