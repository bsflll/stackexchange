Otherwise it redirects to the Play Store to download</p>\n<p>How was that possible?</p>\n<p>I used Apktool and Ghidra to decompile but I couldn't identify where the cheat actually gets the game information</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HDBsu.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HDBsu.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">A non-rooted Android system uses sandboxes for each app so direct manipulation of the game is unlikely. But there techniques exist where you load a third party apk file (e.g. 8 Ball Pool) into a running app instance (e.g. Easy Victory). In such a case the whole app runs in the same sandbox as easy victory does so direct memory access is possible. If 8 Ball Pool has settings or a high score table those values should be different to the values you see when directly start 8 Ball Pool vs when you start it in easy victory.</span>",
