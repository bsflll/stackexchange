For instance, this sequence could involve UI events and actions using the MS Windows UI Automation accessibility framework. I was also interested in an answer along the lines of using a zero-day like you pointed out. Thanks</span>",

Therefore I'd keep my answer short.</p>\n<p>This <em>should</em> not be possible. Simply as malware would abuse this, what you could do if you want this is find a 0day in kernel space and get SYSTEM privileges. Back in 2010 there was someone from China who has posted a method on the code project(if I recall correctly). It's now hosted on the exploit-db..</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.exploit-db.com/bypassing-uac-with-user-privilege-under-windows-vista7-mirror/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.exploit-db.com/bypassing-uac-with-user-privilege-under-windows-vista7-mirror/</a></p>\n<p>Goodluck on your research.</p>\n</div>",
