    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Is there a GUI (or even a script for the CLI) for GDB that will annotate views of the stack with saved registers, each of the frames, etc?  It should be possible to gather this information on each call and add it to a view of the stack.  Currently, I just end up looking at the stack with something like <code>x/40wx $esp</code>, which isn't amazingly enlightening.</p>\n</div>",
