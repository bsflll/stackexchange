However you can compile your C into TriCore executable\n<li><b>JTAG Debugger:</b> <a href=\"https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/kit_miniwiggler_3_usb/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mini Wiggler</a> from Infineon or if your budget allows that, Lauterbach. However ECUs are safety critical devices, so they use a system of internal and external watchdogs. If you set a breakpoint in TriCore, after hitting the breakpoint ECU usually reset itself. So OCDS can be (on production ECUs) used only as RAM monitor at best.<br/>\nSecond problem which you will come across is, that most of TriCore ECUs has JTAG interface disabled because UCB0 is set.\n</li></li></ul>\n<p>It should be obvious that you should first buy some development kit, <a href=\"https://www.ehitex.de/en/application-kits/infineon/2523/aurix-application-kit-tc224-tft\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">like this application kit which has integrated debugger</a> and understand how TriCore's internals are working. It is going to be less frustrating for you than develop anything on security hardened production ECUs.</p>\n</div>",

Be prepared to study that and understand the features before delving in.</p>\n</div>",
