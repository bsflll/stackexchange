    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am using idapro 7.5 to get variable information from binaries.</p>\n<p>Consider following simple code:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n  int i, N, array[10];\n\n  N = atoi(argv[10]);\n\n  array[N] = N;\n  array[12] = N;\n  array[0] = 8;\n\n  for(i=0 ; i&lt;N ; i++)\n    array[i] = N;\n\n  printf(\"%d %d\\n\", array[12], array[5]);\n  return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using idapython, I can get function information like stack variables, their sizes, types, etc. using something like -</p>\n<pre><code>for ea in idautils.Functions():\n    for mem in ida_struct.get_struc(idc.get_frame_id(ea)).members:\n        name = ida_struct.get_member_name(mem.id)\n        size = ida_struct.get_member_size(mem)\n        offset = mem.get_soff()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Similarly, I can get global variable information like their name and addresses.</p>\n<p>Now, this works fine (particularly in above binary) and I can get array with a size of 12 on correct offset (this makes sense, as I have compiled binary using <code>-g</code>).</p>\n<p>But, when I strip the binary, I can't get array size correctly with the above code (this is expected). When I use hex rays -</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/x9sAw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/x9sAw.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Here, ida decompiler was able to recover correct array bounds using decompiler algorithms. And I can also synchronize this with disassembly interface using <code>Synchronize with</code> option in Gui (I assume synchronize function is used to apply predicted types or other information to disassembly interface - I maybe wrong here, please forgive my ignorance).</p>\n<p>I would like to know if there is any way I can do that using idapython (I can see some endpoints like <code>sync_sources</code> in <code>ida_kernwin</code>), so that I can use the above code to get variable properties predicted using hex rays. I am familiar with ghidra and you can apply ghidra decompiler predictions to the listing analysis (just like synchronization in ida) using:</p>\n<pre><code>HighFunctionDBUtil.commitLocalsToDatabase(high_func, SourceType.ANALYSIS)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thus variables get updated in the analysis.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Edit: I can manually get function variables using hexrays decompiler\ninterface like -</p>\n<pre><code>def get_local_vars(ea, stack_size):\n    # can be used to get member size, type, etc.\n    for var in ida_hexrays.decompile(ea).get_lvars():\n        print(var.name)\n        print(-stack_size + var.get_stkoff())\n        print(var.width)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Still, I was not able to find an automatic way to apply hexrays\ndecompiler interface or sync hexrays decompiler interface with\ndisassembly interface.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Generally speaking, it's not always possible to take the type information from Hex-Rays' stack variables and apply it to the disassembly stack frame. There are two main reasons for this, off the top of my head: mapped variables eliminating Hex-Rays stack variables, and forced variables creating more than one variable at a single stack location.</span>",

I am aware of the reasons you mentioned. but, I am doing this to check what results i could get on certain benchmarks. Also, as there is an option for sync in gui, I am interested in checking it's capability.</span>",
