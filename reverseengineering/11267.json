It's an an array of pointers to statically-imported API function addresses. The IAT entries gets populated at runtime.</p>\n<p>The format of the IAT is typically as follows, with all functions from a particular DLL grouped together, with a null-pointer separating each DLL's list of function addresses:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;pointer to DLL #1's function A&gt;, &lt;pointer to DLL #1's function B&gt;, &lt;pointer to DLL #1's function C&gt;, 0x00000000, &lt;pointer to DLL #2's function D&gt;, &lt;pointer to DLL #2's function E&gt;, ..., 0x00000000</code></p>\n<p>Note that this format isn't required, but it's the most common format.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now I don't udnerstand how he know where the end of the IAT just from looking on the dump?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I highlighted each IAT function below (with mspaint), with a different color for each DLL grouping. At virtual address <code>0x0049380C</code> we see the function addresses <code>0x735FE9D0</code>, <code>0x73654AC0</code>, etc. You can tell that they're likely from the same DLL because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There's no null-pointer separating them, and</li>\n<li>They're all in the same address range (<code>0x735F0000</code> - <code>0x7366FFFF</code>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/s75RT.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"IAT\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/s75RT.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>The DWORD at <code>0x00493850</code> (after the null-pointer at <code>0x0049384C</code>) is <code>0x1000176E</code>, so you can look up that address in your debugger and see if there's DLL code loaded at that address. If not, <code>0x0049384C</code> would mark the end of the IAT. If so, <code>0x00493854</code> would mark the end of the IAT since the data at <code>0x00493858</code> is the beginning of an ASCII string and clearly not a valid function pointer.</p>\n</div>",

Becuase on the names tab I see there is something that called \"ShowUpdateDialog\". It sound like a dll but its an export type not an import.</span>",
