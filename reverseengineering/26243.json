    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am looking for instruction-level hooking library for win32 x86/x64.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I want to write hook insertion and hook implementation code in C/C++ (compiled into dll).\n(Therefore instrumentation tools are out of question. Injection is not a problem in my case.)</li>\n<li>I need hooking onto arbitrary addresses.\nI want the hooking library saving registers, call my native function, and then restoring registers, and return/jump to specific addresses.</li>\n<li>It is very tedious to do this on manually at a per-site basis and therefore I want an existing library. Furthermore, x64 MSVC does not support asm. It seems that manual hook is impossible unless other tool-chain are used?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Does such kind of hooking libraries exists?</p>\n</div>",
