So in the binary, all calls to this subroutine should point to this address. Thus, it should be possible to list all calls to this address, am I wrong ? It seems to be a simple things to look for, yet I cannot find anything about that elsewhere.</p>\n</div>",

We can simplify it by relate to it as XREF-To and XREF-From. The referenced can be either Data or Code.</p>\n<p>XREFs are a valuable resource when we want to figure out exactly where a function was called from or what functions the current function calls. This, as you understand, can be quite useful, so we donâ€™t have to iterate the stack for frame pointers to look for the function that called the current function or alternatively searching by hand for a <em>CALL</em>s to specific addresses.</p>\n<h2>Hopper</h2>\n<p>In hopper disassembler you can can see XREFs-To addresses by pressing <kbd>X</kbd> while you mark the desired address. XREFs-From can be shown using <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>. Alternatively you can find the Cross References lists under <code>Navigate</code> in the Hopper's top toolbar.\nYou can also find the references to and from an adress by pressing Right Click on it and then choosing either \"References to...\" or \"References from...\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Ys1Sj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Ys1Sj.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Neverthless, when a program is analyzed, Hopper is adding a list of <em>XREFs-From</em> in the comments:</p>\n<pre><code>  j_puts:\n08048390   jmp   dword [puts@GOT]   ; puts@GOT,puts, CODE XREF=sub_8048662+15, sub_8048662+31, sub_8048662+86, sub_8048662+104\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
