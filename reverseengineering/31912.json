If you're researching a C++ binary, this is easiest done by finding the constructor(s) of the structure or its parent and then following all usage of the data across the binary.</p>\n<h2>Static analysis</h2>\n<p>To define a new structure type, open <code>Local Types</code> or <code>Structures</code> view and press <code>Insert</code> to add the structure definition.</p>\n<p>You can also create them from pseudocode view by right-clicking the desired variable name and choosing <code>Create new struct type</code> or apply an existing type with <code>Convert to struct *</code>.</p>\n<p>This could be automated using <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idapython_docs/ida_struct.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ida_struct</a> and/or <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idapython_docs/ida_typeinf.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ida_typeinf</a> modules.</p>\n<h2>Debugging</h2>\n<p>I don't think IDA has any utilities to help you identify or create structures at runtime, but there exist 3rd party tools such as <a href=\"https://github.com/ajkhoury/ReClassEx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ReClassEx</a> designed to help with raw memory dump structuring if you need it.</p>\n</div>",
