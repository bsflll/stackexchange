Manual inspection is acceptable too.</p>\n<p>I'm thinking that ASLR can be manually verify by restarting the application a few times and see if the base address changes. Am I correct? How about SafeSEH and DEP?</p>\n</div>",

(I am using Ollydbg 2).</p>\n<p>Just open the Memory Map window in Ollydbg, find the image (under Owner column) you want, look for the row with \"PE header\" (under Contains column) and double click the base address (under Address column).</p>\n<p>This will bring up the PE header mapping.  Look for the role that says \"DLLCharacteristics\" (a few rows after the IMAGE_NT_OPTIONAL_HDR32_MAGIC row).</p>\n</div>",
