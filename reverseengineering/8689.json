    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I keep seeing the same pattern in the code I'm analyzing. A call instruction is using a label \"off_\" which is just a pointer to the real address of the call (in this case: GetWindowTextW).  It would be much more convenient for me to see call GetWindowTextW (or user32_GetWindowTextW).  This much be an option I can set somewhere or a way to reanalyze the application... but I can't seem to find it.  How can I achieve this?</p>\n<p><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2kTQ9.png\"/>\n<img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/T6ErW.png\"/>\n<img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7Gstp.png\"/></p>\n</div>",

For all IDA knows, it might get modified dynamically, so the same call doesn't really always call <code>GetWindowTextW</code>. If you know the value is constant, you can rename the label, or write an idc/idapython script to search for these pointers and rename them for you.</span>",

            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">You raise a really great point.  I found that when I renamed off_10010AD8 to GetWindowTextW (well, first it said that name exists and renamed it to GetWindowTextW_0) it brough all of the parameter names to the calling function, which is really what I was looking for.  I suppose a script to hunt out these types of patterns might be my best bet.  I haven't had experience with writing scripts for IDA yet.</span>",
