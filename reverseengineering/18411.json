    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to reverse engineer an old native application written in Borland Delphi in order to modify it for my needs:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7JJsg.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7JJsg.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>The application interfaces with the special hardware and displays events that it receives in the <code>TDBCtrlGrid</code> control, that acts as a long list. Using the Spy++ tool I was able to see that it has a child window <code>TDBCtrlPanel</code>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IqWfW.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IqWfW.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>So both are placed in the actual application as such:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5WbSz.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5WbSz.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I need to add some custom functionality to this application and namely, to be able to track when a certain hardware-related event occurs. I am not the author of this application and the company who created it is long gone.</p>\n<p>So my only solution seems to be trying to patch the executable with my own code trampoline. My goal is to trap instances when a new line is added to that <code>TDBCtrlGrid</code> control and ideally get the text from it. (Example: <code>5/30/2018  9:30:00 PM  Beam Alarm Zone   Alarm Zone Armed</code> that is the last line from the screenshot above.)</p>\n<p>I've never done much in Delphi/Pascal. So I don't know its structure. To start, I need to find out how do those Delphi controls receive text for a new row to try to trap the part of the original code that does it?</p>\n<p>PS. If it was Windows common controls, I know that they receive most notifications via <code>SendMessage</code> API. I tried that approach with Spy++, but the only messages those two Delphi controls receive were <code>WM_PAINT</code> and <code>WM_STYLECHANGED</code>.</p>\n</div>",

I googled a bit:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At runtime, users can use the database navigator (TDBNavigator) to move through data in the TDBCtrlGrid object, and to insert, delete, and edit the data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>from <a href=\"http://docs.embarcadero.com/products/rad_studio/delphiAndcpp2009/HelpUpdate2/EN/html/delphivclwin32/DBCGrids_TDBCtrlGrid.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://docs.embarcadero.com/products/rad_studio/delphiAndcpp2009/HelpUpdate2/EN/html/delphivclwin32/DBCGrids_TDBCtrlGrid.html</a></p>\n<p>From my understanding, you define a data source (this is the part I didn't understand), connect it to a data viewer widget like your CtrlGrid and add a Navigator that handles the view into the data source.</p>\n<p>So either the program uses the TDBNavigator to add data and this might be your hook, or there is some other way to alter your data source.</p>\n<p>I'd probably look for simple example code using all the above to see how one typically implements it in Delphi, then it should be straight-forward to find the proper hook location.</p>\n</div>",
