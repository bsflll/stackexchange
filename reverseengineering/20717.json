Can someone please help me to dump dll?</p>\n<p>Dll is part of Watch Dogs game(It's called Disrupt_b64.dll) and it has VMProtector.\nWhen I opened dll in IDA I first got error:\nCan't find translation for relative virtual address 03ACF000, continue?\nAfter that I got error:\nThe imports segment seems to be destroyed. This MAY mean that the file was packed or otherwise modified in order to make it more difficult to analyze.</p>\n<p>When I opened dumped dll from Scylla I only got second error</p>\n<p>Someone on I read on this site <a href=\"https://blog.lms-dev.com/category/watch-dogs/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://blog.lms-dev.com/category/watch-dogs/</a> successfully got that lua functions(collectgarbage, dofile, error, gcinfo).
