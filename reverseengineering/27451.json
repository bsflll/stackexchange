You can also find a reference to <code>free</code> (often called indirectly by a function in the game itself) and look at the xrefs to the xrefs (to the xrefs) searching for functions that are called by something in the resource segment -- usually the destructor which is the first vtable entry.  There is also the Class Informer plugin, though that can certainly miss some of the vtables.</span>",
