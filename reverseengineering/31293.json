But could you explain what you have already tried and what you are stuck on? This sounds like a very broad question. And the answer is: probably yes. But I doubt that's the answer you are looking for. So What is it you <i>are</i> looking for?</span>",

Once the program has exited, the script will print out the executed instructions. Note that this is just a very basic example, and it is not robust enough for a real-world use case. In a real-world application, you need to consider factors such as handling multiple threads, exceptions and system calls, and more.</p>\n</div>",

As a side-note: <code>pydbg</code> from Pedram Amini and all continuations/successor projects I found is for Python 2.7, which is out of support. I used <code>pydbg</code> myself back in the day. If you are aware of a modern Python-3.x-enabled continuation or successor, please add a link, too.</span>",
