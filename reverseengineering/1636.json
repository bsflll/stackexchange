Historical one, actually.</p>\n<p>At end of 2001, when the first versions of Ollydbg were presented, there was SoftICE, which was at its end, and IDA was not that popular yet. So OllyDBG became sort of the de-facto replacement for the main black-hat tool for cracking\\patching\\keygen-writing. And OllyDBG 1.x is a good, handy tool.</p>\n<p>Since then, the development of OllyDBG became a slow process, with lots of delays. When it was finally announced, there appeared to be some problems, plug-ins compatibility etc. You may see the  story at OllyDBG 2.x <a href=\"http://www.ollydbg.de/version2.html\">webpage</a> on offsite.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, IDA Pro of Hex-Rays proved itself as a useful tool, very handy.</p>\n<p>The bottom line - when in June 2010 version 2.0 of OllyDBG was released, it was buggy, didn't support old plug-ins and there were no reason to change to the new version, at least for me. In addition, many manuals were available for version 1.x, and the benefits of version 2.0 for tasks OllyDBG was used for were not attractive enough, IMHO.</p>\n<p>End of story :)</p>\n</div>",

You just have no any idea to go on. So you have to search the answer in Internet, but most informations are all about Ollydbg 1.1, and there are lots of plugins to help you resolve the problem, enen though you don't know any secret inside the plugin or else. </p>\n<p>So, would you take your advantage to try the v2.0, face to helpless situation lonely ?</p>\n</div>",
