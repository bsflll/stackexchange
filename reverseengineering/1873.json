    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Environment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Host: Win7 SP1 x64: VMWare Workstation 9.02, VirtualKD, IDA Pro 6.4.13 (x64) and WinDbg</li>\n<li>Guest: Win7 SP1 x64</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have VirtualKD setup correctly in my guest and host.\nI say this because attaching WinDbg to the guest VM through VirtualKD works flawlessly.</p>\n<p>But when I try to connect IDA Pro's WinDbg interface using instruction on <a href=\"http://www.hexblog.com/?p=123\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this page</a>, IDA keeps throwing the following error:</p>\n<pre><code>Windbg: using debugging tools from '&lt;PATH&gt;'\nConnecting to debugger server with 'com:port=\\\\.\\pipe\\kd_Win7x64_SP1,pipe'\nConnect failed: The server is currently disabled.\n</code></pre>\n<p>VirtualKD's <code>vmmon</code> is running on the host and shows the following:<img alt=\"vmmon UI\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SFqc3.png\"/></p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Turns out, It's a problem with IDA 6.4. I happened to have IDA 6.3 installed on my machine too. That worked with no issues.\nHas anyone used IDA6.4 for live kernel debugging?\nCan someone please tell me how I can correct this issue <em>in IDA 6.4</em>?</p>\n</div>",
