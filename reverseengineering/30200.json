    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<br/>\nin oder to solve a CTF-Challenge I have to construct a small ROP-chain. The scope of the ROP chain is to print the content of the `flag` file. I already constructed the ROP-chain, but it seems that when I call the system function with the parameter `cat flag`, the result isn't printed to the console.\n<p>My ROP-chain:\n<code>payload = b'A'*80 + pop_rdi + addr_cat_flag + systemPlt</code></p>\n<p>As far as I know it should work this way, since it is a 64-Bit machine. But the strangest thing is that when insted of calling <code>system</code> I call for example <code>puts</code> then the content at address addr_cat_flag, which in this case is <code>cat flag</code>, is printed to the console. This means that the parameter is hand over corectly.<br/>\nThe address of systemPlt should also be correct.</p>\n<p>Does anybody know were the problem could be?</p>\n</div>",
