Personally me have some private IDA plugins for catching execution events (including memory or register modifications),and IDA doesn't have powerful enough command parser for that. IDA has not to have it actually. <code>Capstone</code> will unlikely help much here. <code>if</code> is your friend for this very specific tasks (i. e. detection of command that modifies anything as \"side effect\" not obvious from operands and opcode).</span>",
