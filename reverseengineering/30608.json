So the real function you need is <code>ftol2_sse_excpt</code>.</p>\n<p>This function doesn’t seem to be documented anywhere but the name is very close to <code>ftol</code> which is the standard CRT function for converting a <code>float</code> to a <code>long int</code>.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.masmforum.com/board/index.php?topic=15743.0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this MASM forum post</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ftol2_sse is an internal C function that is called when a cast or conversion is made from a floating point variable to an integer. It was first used in VC 2005 (8.0).  Before that it was ftol_sse and before that ftol.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <code>_excpt</code> suffix probably means it can raise an exception (e.g. if called with a NaN value).</p>\n<p>Because the function is internal, the function prototype is not known and the decompiler did not detect the arguments, probably because they’re passed in FPU registers and not on stack. If the function is really equivalent to <code>ftol</code>, you can try renaming it to that and the decompiler should recognize it. Alternatively, you can try specifying a manual function prototype using <code>__usercall</code> calling convention.</p>\n</div>",
