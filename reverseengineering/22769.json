If they are not equal, it will just return from the function.</p>\n<p>I have compared the output of Ghirda and IDA (free) and in IDA it looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>cmp dword ptr [ecx + 24Ch], offset unk_7C6BC0\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, what exactly is <code>DAT_007c6bc0</code>? I couldn't really find any information on it, and how does it compare to <code>ECX + 0x24c</code> since it just checks if the address is the same, right? </p>\n</div>",

It's just a pointer comparison (<code>dword ptr</code> means that we treat these numbers as <code>dwords</code> - <code>4</code>bytes each); in pseudo code it could look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>if (*(ECX + 0x24c) != DAT_007c6bc0)\n    return;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In other words, if <code>d</code> is the data located at <code>DAT_007c6bc0</code> in memory (<code>d = *DAT_007c6bc0</code>), then the code will check whether data at <code>ECX + 0x24c</code> is a pointer to <code>d</code>.</p>\n</div>",
