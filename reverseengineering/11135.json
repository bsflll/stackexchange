    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Are there any tools, tutorials, or resources out there for helping to make sense of NaCL binaries? They have some features that should make things easier – most crucially, fully decidable disassembly and code/data disambiguation. But looking at them in a disassembler, it's hard to make sense of what's going on because most of the interesting stuff is done by calls into the NaCL runtime, and I can't seem to find good documentation on what functions are available there or how to resolve the calls in a disassembly.</p>\n<p>There's a lot of code like (sample from <code>hotword-x86-64.nexe</code>):</p>\n<pre><code>   21d70:       81 c4 b8 00 00 00       add    esp,0xb8\n   21d76:       4c 01 fc                add    rsp,r15\n   21d79:       41 5b                   pop    r11\n   21d7b:       0f 1f 44 00 00          nop    DWORD PTR [rax+rax*1+0x0]\n   21d80:       41 83 e3 e0             and    r11d,0xffffffe0\n   21d84:       4d 01 fb                add    r11,r15\n   21d87:       41 ff e3                jmp    r11\n</code></pre>\n<p>And this makes it pretty hard to follow control flow.</p>\n<p>These binaries are of some interest because they're in some ways Google's answer to ActiveX, and they've been used to ship controversial features like <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/2940499/ok-google-hotword-detection-yanked-from-chromium-after-user-revolt.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">OK Google (aka hotwords)</a>.</p>\n<p>One resource I have found is a technical description of the SFI mechanism:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/reference/sandbox_internals/x86-64-sandbox\" rel=\"nofollow\">NaCl SFI model on x86-64 systems</a></p>\n<p>Which gives some helpful hints on (e.g.) what <code>R15</code> does, it's mostly about the what restrictions NaCL assembly code has to comply with, rather than how things work.</p>\n</div>",
