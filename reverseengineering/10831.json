Do you know good articles/books/advices or another resources where I could read this?</p>\n<p>I know that there are several function call conventions but it would be nice to know about artefacts of compiler code generation that aren't worth of attention while reversing.</p>\n</div>",

This is not your typical \"for beginners\" book. The author keeps adding content but the original title remains. It is actually <em>beginner to intermediate</em> level but of course that depends on who you are talking to :)</p>\n</div>",
