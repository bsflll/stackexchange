Assuming ecx is the class pointer, then it's ecx+4, not ecx, that gets passed to the inner constructor. So the inner class pointer is behind the vtable pointer of the outer class, which suggests something like:</p>\n<pre><code>class a {\n    int i1, i2;\n    short s1, s2;\n    int i3, i4;\n\n    a::a(int x) {\n        i1=0; i2=0;\n        s1=x;\n        s2=0; i3=0; i4=0;\n    } \n}\n\nclass b : public a {\n    // whatever;\n}\n\nclass outer {\n    class b someelement;\n    // more variables;\n\n    outer::outer() {\n        someelement=(b) new a(48);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'd assume the <code>sub_106C0A0</code> function allocates a class instance, then casts that to another class. The cast to the other class makes the compiler replace <code>a</code>'s vtable with <code>b</code>'s vtable. However, i'm not 100% sure how that makes sense - if <code>b</code> is a real superclass of <code>a</code>, then casting <code>a</code> to <code>b</code> isn't safe, because the additional members aren't there; if <code>b</code> is a subclass of <code>a</code>, then there's no reason to replace the vtable when casting.</p>\n<p>Looking at the size and entries of the vtables might help - maybe the programmer used some weird method of abstract classes and implementation classes, where the class members of one class are the abstract classes (<code>b</code>), but what gets instantiated by <code>new()</code> are the implementations (<code>a</code>). (That still wouldn't be a good reason to replace the implementation vtable with the abstract class vtable, however).</p>\n</div>",
