However, <code>GetVersion()</code> does anyway lie all the time unless your application happens to run with a manifest that proclaims full compatibility with the Windows release on which it runs. For the truth use <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/devnotes/rtlgetversion\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>RtlGetVersion</code></a> or consult <code>KUSER_SHARED_DATA</code>. Either way, what you encountered is more about API sets than about whether <code>GetVersion</code> is deprecated.</span>",
