    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm currently engrossed in penetration testing my Samsung SPH-M330. And to be fair, I have found a couple entry points (WHY ARE YOU PEOPLE USING STRCPY()!?)</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'm now taking a look at \"/brew/card1/DB/Ace.dat\" as it defines the installed J2ME programs and I've figured out a way to modify it.</p>\n<p>Problem is, I don't know what this \"AceDB\" format is. Interesting how the beginning of the file is: \"AceDB Created By Insun Kang,\"...\"SangJung Woo\". Not something you expect in a binary blob! Intriguingly, the phone is the one generating that text. Delete \"Ace.dat\" and restart the phone, all the listed games/apps disappear, but that string is still present in the \"now empty\" file.</p>\n<p>Anyone familiar with this? Here's a link to the samples I've uploaded: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12QpbYtsb6BlMgAw2A3nHM_bGzfi6tJzZ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12QpbYtsb6BlMgAw2A3nHM_bGzfi6tJzZ</a></p>\n</div>",
