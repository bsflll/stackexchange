    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So basically when I am using <code>objdump</code> and <code>readelf</code> to disassemble some GNU Coreutils, I find a very weird situation like this: </p>\n<pre><code>readelf -s pr | grep bkm_scale\n\n....\n176: 08050620   118 FUNC    LOCAL  DEFAULT   13 bkm_scale\n177: 080506a0    39 FUNC    LOCAL  DEFAULT   13 bkm_scale_by_power\n181: 08050a60   173 FUNC    LOCAL  DEFAULT   13 bkm_scale\n182: 08050b10    50 FUNC    LOCAL  DEFAULT   13 bkm_scale_by_power\n</code></pre>\n<p>and when I disassemble <code>pr</code> using <code>objdump</code>, I do see two definition of function <code>bkm_scale</code> and <code>bkm_scale_by_power</code>, and their disassembled asm code are different.</p>\n<p>So does it indicate some disassemble error? If not, then why there are two <code>FUNC</code> symbols have the same name?</p>\n</div>",

They're not global functions, which would be constrained to only appear (or be defined) once.</p>\n<p>Perhaps defined in several files, statically, so they're only used (or scoped to) in that particular file.</p>\n<p>I don't see those functions in the output of readelf -s, or objdump on my system's installed 'pr'.  I imagine you've compiled the coreutils yourself?</p>\n<p>Since you're playing with the source code of 'pr', you could grep for bkm_scale and bkm_scale_by_power to see where they're used and defined.</p>\n<p>Keep exploring!  Keep learning!</p>\n</div>",
