    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to reverse a portion of a game, that game loads a DLL file called \"ddraw.dll\".\nMost of the DLL file functions don't appear by their names but appear by their addresses</p>\n<p>for example:</p>\n<pre><code>; The function address '67415A6A' but no name\nddraw.67415A6A\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, I have known that can download the PDB symbols file for the \"ddraw.dll\" file to make all their functions appear by their names instead of their addresses.<br/>\nAnd that is what I did, I have downloaded the symbols for \"ddraw.dll\" using the command <code>symdownload/downloadsym</code> and download it to the path \"x64dbg\\x32\\symbols\", then I reopen the debugger again to see what happened but nothing happened, all functions still appear by their addresses.<br/>\nI tried to use <code>symload/loadsym</code> command to load \"ddraw.dll\" symbols but it always gives me \"invalid module\" although, I have written the command correctly <code>symload path\\game.exe, path\\symbols\\ddraw.pdb,0 or 1</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I solve that problem?</strong></p>\n</div>",
