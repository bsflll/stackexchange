However, just to know that a certain function is called at some point in the program you may use a tool like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objdump\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">objdump</a>, which will show you the function name followed by <code>@plt</code> like so:</p>\n<pre><code>call   720 &lt;printf@plt&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>why doesn't the symbol table contain the virtual address of these functions unlike functions inside the code? considering these are static libraries and are statically linked in that program, shouldn't they have a fixed address just like other functions?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because they <strong>are not</strong> statically linked (see first sentence of the answer for the first question). They don't have fixed addresses, since these will be resolved during the runtime.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>so why is it going into PLT instead of .text section and having a static address? i thought when i include a library in the beginning it basically copy and pastes it into my .text section?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It would be the waste of space if every executable contained copy of the same library. The <code>.h</code> files are included and they often contain <strong>just the declarations</strong>. So you don't include compiled definitions of functions declared in <code>.h</code> - just the prototypes. The <strong>linker</strong> is responsible for linking the program with the libraries used in it. They still may be linked either statically or dynamically and since dynamic linking avoids copying entire libraries' code into every single executable, it's often used instead of static one.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7096152/c-difference-between-linking-library-and-adding-include-directories\">this question</a> for further reference.</p>\n</div>",
