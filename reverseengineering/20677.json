Although ELF is a well defined executable format, its seems IDA tries to disassemble the file as <em>RAW</em>. This means it doesn't parse the file format and can not tell apart code from data.</p>\n<p>If you are utilizing IDAs free version, this is most likely due to the problem that is does not include arm support.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YJUfY.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YJUfY.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>However, you could use other tools, such as objdump, radare2 or even online services like <a href=\"https://onlinedisassembler.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">onlinedisassembler.com</a> for free.</p>\n</div>",
