    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have been fascinated by reverse engineering after making several emulators and  finding the <a href=\"https://github.com/pret\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pret</a> community. I love the idea behind decompiling old games and recreating source code that recompiles into a matching file. </p>\n<p>I recently found an old game that was hosted by Cartoon Network that I must have played around ~2001. I downloaded the source file and it is 514 Kb file with a <code>.dcr</code> extension.</p>\n<p>If this is anything like any other computer program, this file should store all of the games logic, images/sound, etc. that is interpreted by the Adobe Shockwave VM.</p>\n<p>Is it a feasible task to reverse engineer and extract data/code from a compiled <code>.dcr</code> file, or is this technology too outdated and proprietary to try and reverse engineer and test? Apparently the <code>.dcr</code> file is generated by the \"Director\" application. Does this mean that if I wanted to RE this game, I would have to find the exact Director version they used when creating the game so it compiles into the same bytecode? Is this too complex of a project for a single person?</p>\n</div>",

Recently I researched options again and I discovered that recently someone developed: <a href=\"https://github.com/ProjectorRays/ProjectorRays\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">github.com/ProjectorRays/ProjectorRays</a>  You can use this to decompile DCR files and also convert them into workable DIR files that can be opened with director. I used this program and it perfectly decompiled the game I was originally posting about. Good luck.</span>",

A great initial point of reference for you is <a href=\"https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=252\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this post on the ZenHAX forum</a>, where a script or two have been created for use with their program, <a href=\"http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">QuickBMS</a>. That won't teach you how to reverse the format, but if you spend some time reading <a href=\"https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-28180.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">what QuickBMS scripts are comprised of</a>, you'll end up travelling down the path of reversing file formats using archives themselves as the sample.</p>\n<p>I actually worked on reversing a Director application not too terribly long ago. I made notes and documented what I'd found at the time <a href=\"https://www.betaarchive.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=428167#p428167\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.betaarchive.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=428500#p428500\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, so those may be useful for ancillary points in regards to your studying.</p>\n<p>Finally, you'd probably be best suited to inquire around both the <a href=\"https://zenhax.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ZenHAX</a> and <a href=\"http://forum.xentax.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">XeNTaX</a> forums, since they both primarily focus on reversing file formats. That should all get you started quite nicely in the direction you're interested in heading. =)</p>\n</div>",
