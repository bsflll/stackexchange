The <code>user32.dll</code> relies in itself on other <code>.dll</code>, which are among others imported via the API Set schema.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/dqjsa.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"User32dll imports via api set schema\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/dqjsa.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Take a note of the exact naming of the imported function, that I marked: <code>EventActivityIdControl</code></p>\n<p>As it turned out, the functions for this particular API are found in the <code>advapi32.dll</code>.</p>\n<p>If I look at that DLL in CFF explorer, lo and behold there are the correct exports:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gRFFF.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"advapi32.dll exports the correct functions for the api\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gRFFF.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>However, when I manually parse, the <code>advapi32.dll</code> and look at the exports, I get forwarded exports from <code>ntdll.dll</code>, with the prefix <code>Etw</code>, which messes up my string comparisons.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/31WdQ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Exports of advapi32.dll parsed by my code\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/31WdQ.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>This prefix seems to be omitted by CFF explorer and other similar software.</p>\n<p>I cannot find any information about this behaviour/schema. Can anyone explain, why this is or where I can find out more about this?</p>\n</div>",

An example of that is visible in the last screenshot of my original question.</p>\n<p>I was under the impression, that the name after the dot is also the name of the function as it is exported by the forwarding DLL itself.</p>\n<p>This is wrong. There is still a valid export name entry in the Export Names Table (EAT), that must be read to accomplish correct import to export name mapping.</p>\n<p>I hope this explanation helps some other poor soul, that wastes hour on the same wrong assumption.</p>\n<p>Here is a picture of the mapping from the forwarded function name to the name, that is used to export that forwarded function in the <code>advapi32.dll</code>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kSfgV.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Forwarded function name to exported function name\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kSfgV.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can seen the export in the <code>ntdll.dll</code> has the <code>Etw</code> prefix, that I was talking about and the named export in the <code>advapi32 dll</code> does not have this Prefix, which led me to my initial assumption, that CFF explorer was omitting the prefix.</p>\n</div>",
