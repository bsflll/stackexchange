Maybe it's trying to reference some function from the .got?

At runtime, it is patched by the dynamic loader to point to its resolver function (<code>_dl_runtime_resolve</code> or similar). That function uses information in <code>$t8</code> (symbol/relocation offset) to look up the symbol in  one of the dependent shared objects and jumps to it. It also usually patches the corresponding GOT slot so that next calls go directly to the destination function and need not go through the resolver again.</p>\n</div>",
