    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have encountered this twice recently where I am trying to list the external symbols for an iOS mach-o binary and none of the tools can provide any output.  The following is an example of the output from jtool:</p>\n<pre><code>jtool -S BinaryName -arch arm64\n             U \n             U \n             U \n             U \n             U \n             U \n             U \n             U \n</code></pre>\n<p>This particular binary was a fat binary hence having to pass it the arch but I also tried thinning it and running the command on just the arm64.  The previous binary I had encountered this was not a fat binary though. Unfortunately I can't actually share either of the binaries, which I appreciate makes it harder to answer, as they are from a client.</p>\n<p>I thought I had a reasonable understanding of the mach-o format although very inexperienced reversing.</p>\n<p>I don't know if this is a trick I'm not aware of, how are these symbols resolved at runtime if they can't be parsed by any of these tools?  Is there a way to \"undo\" this and list the symbols normally without running the binary?</p>\n</div>",

Second, it's possible that you didn't thinned the binary correctly, as <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/40997366/12941478\">someone</a> suggested that only using xcode working.</span>",

Unfortunately this was a client's app that I wasn't able to share, if I come across another instance that I can do though I will provide more details.  Regarding your second point, I had tried with a number of different tools, on the fat and thinned binary, all of which gave the same results.</span>",
