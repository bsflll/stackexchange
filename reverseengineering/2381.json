IDA Pro does offer everything one might need to annotate your work and keep it organized. IDA Pro offers four types of comments: </p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Regular Comments.</strong> <em>Regular comments</em> are placed at the end of each assembly line and pretty straight forward to use. In order to insert regular comment you could just right-click in the right margin of the assembly or press colon (:) hot key.</li>\n<li><strong>Repeatable Comments.</strong> <em>Repeatable comment</em> is a comment which automatically appears in multiple locations. It behaves in cross-reference like manner. For example, <em>repeatable comment</em> put on <code>je short 121212</code> would not only show next to the instruction, but will also propagate to <code>121212</code> address. Basically, original comment gets echoed to the referenced location. One can place <em>repeatable comment</em> by pressing semicolon (;) hotkey.</li>\n<li><strong>Anterior and Posterior Lines.</strong> <em>Anterior and posterior lines</em> are full-line comments, which one can place before or after disassembly line. These type of comments is not prefixed with semicolon character.</li>\n<li><strong>Function Comment.</strong> <em>Function comments</em> are comments grouped on the top or the bottom of the function. Those are very useful to create notes on function prototypes. <em>Function comments</em> are created by highlighting function name and creating <em>regular comment</em> or <em>repeatable comment</em>. Please note, in case you create <em>repeatable comment</em>, it will get echoed to every location the function is called from.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It almost feels like you are trying to find ways to improve your workflow. What makes the most sense to me is to have your workflow organized in certain predetermined and structured way, get consistent with it, and constantly improve on it.</p>\n<p>Several things might help you organize your workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create predefined sub-directory for each project you work with. You can create an empty template sub-directory structure, which you can copy to new project. It will stay consistent  through out different projects and will make it very easy to store, navigate and search for stuff. Think of what makes sense to you. Ultimately, it needs to make sense to you and work for you. </li>\n<li>Create report template. Again, you can have it anyway you like it. The important thing is to have a template. You can build and improve on it as you go. As an example, I have my working version of a report divided into two main sub-sections: static analysis and execution. I describe everything 'stationary' about a binary in my static analysis. In addition, I use 'execution' section to describe what happens whenever binary runs. </li>\n<li>Maintain notes in organized manner. You can run a file where you maintain your notes in a structured way. Again, it is very much arbitrary thing. Whatever works for you. I prefer not to clutter IDA with excessive comments. For example, I like to create C-style representation of stuff. I usually keep it at the end of the 'notes' file. Other comments go in front. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Eventually, we are users, who 'drive' tools. \nRemember, at times a great tool is as good as one who uses it ;)</p>\n</div>",
