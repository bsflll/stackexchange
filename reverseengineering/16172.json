Right now I am able to run a function by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Opening the remote process;</li>\n<li>Allocating memory in remote process;</li>\n<li>Relocating our image according to the address of allocated memory;</li>\n<li>Using <code>CreateRemoteThread()</code> giving it the address of my declared function.  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, right now I am just executing a <code>_MessageBox_</code> which is surely uninteresting. What I want to do right now is to execute a function which will load a DLL into its own address space and execute it, like how a traditional PE loader works. I took a reference code and tried but I am getting an access violation when I inspect using Olly. </p>\n<p>Please tell me, is it even possible?</p>\n</div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Well as you already pointed out the usual process of a simple DLL injection is</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the target process and aquire a handle</li>\n<li>Allocate memory for your code</li>\n<li>Create a thread which calls <code>LoadLibrary</code> with your payload library path as parameter</li>\n<li>Close the target process</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You said you already managed to create a thread and open a message box.\nTo load your payload library you just need to call <code>LoadLibrary</code> instead of <code>MessageBox</code>.</p>\n<p>That would be, in my opinion, the easiest way to inject a library into a process. However, sometimes you need to use a different technique since Anti Virus / Anti Cheat Software (depending on your work area) can block this method easily.</p>\n<p>A more advanced method is <code>Manual Mapping</code>. Basically you are loading the payload library yourself, without the help of the operating system, and map it into the target process' memory. Instructions for this method can be found <a href=\"http://www.rohitab.com/discuss/topic/40761-manual-dll-injection/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Another little <code>trick</code> when working with low level Windows stuff is to take a look at the <code>reactOS</code> documentation. <code>reactOS</code> is a different operating system, but implements the Windows API. It's not garuanteed to be fully compatible but it should give you an idea how the functions are implemented.</p>\n<p>For example, you can find the implementation of <code>LoadLibrary</code> <a href=\"https://doxygen.reactos.org/d7/d55/ldrapi_8c.html#a7671bda932dbb5096570f431ff83474c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>There are more ways to get your code into your target. Let your creativity run free.</p>\n<p>By the way, a neat library I like to use for this tasks is <a href=\"https://github.com/DarthTon/Blackbone\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BlackBone</a>.</p>\n</div>",
