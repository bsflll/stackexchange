            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">Well not really. .NET are IL with a lot of metadata before they get JITed. That's why it's easy to see managed code in tools like dnSpy. After they are JITed they are compiled to native binary and it's no longer a C# code so it's hard to extract it's original C# code at that time.</span>",

            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">@PawełŁukasik So since we know that the non-.net files don't have those metadata and probably AOT, can't we just \"make up\" those metadata and plug the code in C# into its body!? Just a thought.</span>",
