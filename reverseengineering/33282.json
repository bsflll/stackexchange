Otherwise there appears to be no common signature other than perhaps <code>0039 0039 0039 0039 0039 0039</code> at offset 22 and <code>0002001C58B1000A</code> at offset 88.</p>\n<p>It appears to be a composite or container format that can include data in blocks, for example it can include plain text or image data in a variety of formats, such as GIF.</p>\n<p>I see many four-byte human-readable tags such as <code>MLIP</code>, <code>DSET</code>, <code>FNTM</code>, <code>CUTS</code>, <code>DSUM</code>, <code>HDNI</code>, <code>STYL</code>, <code>8BIM</code>, <code>HASH</code>, <code>LKUP</code>, <code>NAME</code>, <code>CELL</code>, <code>RULR</code>, <code>GRPH</code>, but I am unsure of their purpose, as they do not all seem to introduce blocks of embedded data. At the end of the file are two font names in plain text, <code>Helvetica</code> and <code>Geneva</code>.</p>\n<p>The files are from a Macintosh environment in 2001 and 2002. Unfortunately their resource forks have not survived. I found them alongside Microsoft Excel files (Compound Documents format) and FileMaker Pro 5.x (or 6) files.</p>\n<p>I tried opening these files in Excel (also Word and PowerPoint) from MS Office 98 for Mac on a G3 running OS 9.2. No luck - \"unknown file format\" or something like that.</p>\n</div>",

My other files in this format replace the <code>BOBO</code> string with <code>CWKJ</code> which threw me off. Maybe I should have known that <code>CWKJ</code> stands for the Japanese version of ClarisWorks. I was able to open these <code>CWKJ</code> files in the Japanese version of AppleWorks 6 (running under the Japanese version of Mac OS 9.2 in a SheepShaver VM) and save them as AppleWorks 6 documents, then open them in LibreOffice as suggested by matja.</p>\n</div>",
