Once you set the hardware breakpoint you can go to <code>Breakpoints</code> tab, right click the breakpoint on which you want to set condition, and select <code>Edit</code>. Now you can set the break condition.</p>\n<p>Let's say your value is written to the memory in such way <code>mov dword ptr ds:[edx],eax</code>, so you can set the <code>Break condition</code> to <code>EAX==2F</code>, and then the program will be interrupted only when the value to write is equal to 2F.</p>\n</div>",
