Is there a way to get the address of sound.dll+1AE0 (or linkage) when the DLL is loaded without having to to do GetModuleHandleEx and calculate the address dynamically?</p>\n<p>Maybe with some imports or some linkage artifact?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n<p>The GetModuleHandleEx approach will look like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DWORD mem1AE0=0; <br/></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Load mem1AE0 with sound.dll+1AE0 address</p>\n<p>and then in my function:</p>\n<pre><code>_declspec(naked) void MyFunction() { \n    __asm { \n        mov edi,edi \n        push ebp \n        mov ebp,esp \n        mov eax, mem1AE0 \n        mov eax, [eax] \n        push eax \n        mov ecx,[ebp+08] \n        mov eax,[ecx] \n        mov eax,[eax+0C] \n        push eax \n        call sound.dll+7C640 \n        pop ebp \n        ret 0004 \n    } \n} \n</code></pre>\n<p>The problem is when I have a call [sound.dll+XXXX] instruction</p>\n<p>In that case I need to create a variable which will point to that memory</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DWORD memXXXX=0;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Load it with the correct address and also create a proxycall DWORD</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DWORD memXXXX_content=0;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and then do:</p>\n<pre><code>push eax \nmov eax, memXXXX \nmov eax, [eax] \nmov memXXXX_content, eax \npop eax \ncall memXXXX_content \n</code></pre>\n<p>which is totally inefficient unless I am doing somehting wrong?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n<p>EDIT: I believe there is no way to get static links if you are dynamically loading your DLL. </p>\n</div>",
