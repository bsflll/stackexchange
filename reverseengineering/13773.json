If I disassemble the SO with <code>objdump -d</code> I only see (what I believe to be) the exported symbols. I would like to be able to see also the other symbols that are described in the debug library. Is there any way to do that?</p>\n<p>(in a sense I would like to \"merge back\" the data that was stripped during compilation)</p>\n</div>",

Personally I'd probably write a wrapper for the lib and then use that to import, say, the map file generated by IDA.</span>",
