    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am using retdec to decompile a piece of software. It has a \"kill switch\" to detect if it's being run in an untrusted environment, in the decompiled code it just a simple</p>\n<pre><code>if (env_untrusted() == 1)\n   abort()\n</code></pre>\n<p>so i'd like to remove that statement, thing is, the decompiled C code has <em>many</em> compilation errors. Is it possible to see what assembly corresponds to that function, and then change that assemlby to \"return 0\"?</p>\n<p>also, using objdump i can generate assembly, but not in a usable format, is there a way how i can make it print in a usable format so that i can compile that assembly?</p>\n<p>so in summary:\ni have decompiled an executable file using retdec into a C file. in that C file i found a function that i'd like to edit, but i cant compile the C file, so i need to find that function in the assembly, how can i do that?</p>\n<p>and as a by producct: how can i make objdump only print out assembly</p>\n</div>",
