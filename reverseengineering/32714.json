    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I want to capture packets from Android apps. I need an packets forwarder on phone that creates a VPN to redirect all TCP packets to PC, then capture them with 'mitmproxy'. I want to use mitmproxy because it supports python addons, and it's free/opensource.</p>\n<p>But I can't find a suitable packet forwarder. Here are what I've tried so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Postern: sometimes it causes DNS error, I can't ping sites when it's enabled, unable to modify DNS server in settings, project abandoned.</li>\n<li>ProxyDroid: fails to resolve dns somehow</li>\n<li>TunProxy: http only, not support tcp</li>\n<li>burp, http_toolkit: non-free, not possible to save packets without paying</li>\n<li>HttpCanary/Reqable/PacketCapture/PCapDroid: doesn't collaborate with other apps like mitmproxy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any suggestion?</p>\n</div>",
