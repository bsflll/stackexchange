It would be helpful if you could recommend me what languages, tools and skills I should learn and provide me with your favorite sources: blogs, books, articles, Wikipedia; whatever you find suitable.\nIn my search I found procedural reverse engineering material but they were really old (2005; 2014), none should work as I expect nowadays, or so I interpret.</p>\n</div>",
