    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Since I started reverse engineering I've found multiple DLLs that when being debugged(IDA + WindDBG) would be unloaded and reloaded continuously without any evident reason.</p>\n<p>Most of the time I use rundll32.exe to load and debug any DLL and I just get this behavior with a few binaries.</p>\n<p>The current lib I am debugging is quite simple, most of the logic of the program is executed by a thread created at the DLL's entry point. Then, its single export(DllRegisterServer) has a loop which checks if a flag has been set to finally call ExitProcess.</p>\n<p>When I enter the main's logic thread I suspend any other thread and single step through it as always. As I go, randomly the DLL is unloaded, reloaded, and the dbg sets me again at DllEntryPoint, which makes the RE job quite annoying.</p>\n<p>What could be the reason for that behavior?</p>\n<p>Edit: Within x64dbg this does not happen. Same file, same command line.</p>\n</div>",

If willing to play with a real file, samples can be found at MalwareBazaar under the IcedID tag and are easily unpacked by following a few VirtualAlloc calls.(Regarding the packing thing, the file I am working with is an unpacked standalone version.)</span>",

A DLL's entry point is called for 4 reasons, <code>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</code>, <code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code>, <code>DLL_THREAD_ATTACH</code> or <code>DLL_THREAD_DETACH</code>, so maybe you're just getting thread notifications.</span>",

In my case, the main thread calls some Windows networking functions that create threads, resulting on the program performing several calls to DllMain with the DLL_THREAD_ATTACH fdwReason.</span>",
