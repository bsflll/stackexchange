Ida doesn’t seem to have much of a problem with disassembly. After some fixings I tried the decompiler and found ida only supports 32 bits. Then I went down the google rabbit hole.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know of a 64bit mips decompiler?</p>\n</div>",

Reko came close and when I mailed that team they said they would implement it in the coming days. IDA only disassembles partly and cant decompile. Ret from Avast 32 bit only as well.  Once JDK 11 was installed disassembled and decompiled the .o elf easily. There is some problem with the dwarf analyzer not working or doing the symlinks, so ill have to find a fix for that.  I don't love Ghidra but I think I'm starting too.</p>\n</div>",
