Looking at the received title I guess that the game was encrypted using the xxtea algorithm.</p>\n<p>I searched and found that my case is the same as in <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/21759/decrypting-lua-files/21766#21766\">this article</a>. I followed and received the decryption key \"D2 22 82 7F E9 D3 72 A5 24 90 8C 6D A 96 CB A3\". However I can't decrypt the file, I don't know what I've missed, it's all almost right in front of my eyes. but then cannot decrypt.</p>\n<p>Please help me decrypt the lua file or at least pls help me get the key to decrypt it, I really need it.</p>\n</div>",
