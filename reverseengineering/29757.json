    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So, I need to call a constructor to start an action in a game made with Unity, compiled with Il2cpp.</p>\n<p>The constructor itself by Ghidra:</p>\n<pre><code>void Client.Model.Gameplay.Battle.Commands.CreatePveBattleCmd$$.ctor(longlong param_1,int stage,int *heroIds,undefined4 source,undefined8 numberBattles, undefined8 autoBattle,undefined8 presetId,undefined doubleRun)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The constructor in dnSpy after dumping it with Il2cpp dumper by Perfare:</p>\n<pre><code>public CreatePveBattleCmd(int stageId, int[] heroIds, BattleRequestSourceId source, [Optional] int? autoBattleNumber, [Optional] UserAutoBattleData autoBattleData, [Optional] int? presetId, bool doubleRunEnabled = false)\n{\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>That unknown param_1 at Ghidra's is the class pointer, I have been able to call methods of other classes with success but they were always already instantiated, so I'm kinda lost on how to approach this.</p>\n<p>My way of calling methods is as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>typedef type (__callMethod* _name)(type param_1, type param_2);\n_name name;\n</code></pre>\n<p>How to call the constructor without it's class?</p>\n</div>",
