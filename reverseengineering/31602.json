    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have installed Ubuntu 20.04 under Windows Subsystem Linux 2 and I want to perform some remote debugging with IDA Pro.</p>\n<p>As with other VMs I have used, I can perform remote debugging when send the executable <code>linux_server</code> and <code>linux_server64</code> to the VM and execute them. However, in WSL instance, when I run the server and use correct port and IP, there is still connection from IDA Pro to the VM, however, I kept receive this error:</p>\n<p>In WSL instance:</p>\n<pre><code>IDA Linux 64-bit remote debug server(ST) v7.7.27.
