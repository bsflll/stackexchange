    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am using <a href=\"https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/pintool/docs/98484/Pin/html/group__BBL.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Intel Pintool BBLs</a> to count the total number of static and dynamic basic blocks.</p>\n<p>The below is the distinguish between static vs dynamic basic blocks (bbls):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A dynamic basic block is defined as a sequential run of instructions\nthat starts with an instruction that is a target of a <strong>taken</strong> branch and\nends with the first taken branch in sequence. Thus, one dynamic basic\nblock may contain one or more static basic blocks that are defined as\nfollows: a sequential run of instructions that starts with an\ninstruction that is a target of a taken branch and ends with the first\n<strong>branch</strong> in sequence</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/pintool/docs/98484/Pin/html/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Intel Pintool User Manual</a>  defines their basic block (BBLs) as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pin breaks the trace into basic blocks, BBLs. A BBL is a single\nentrance, single exit sequence of instructions. Branches to the middle\nof a bbl begin a new trace and hence a new BBL</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am not clear if Pintool BBLs is static or dynamic bbls?</p>\n<p>Please advice!</p>\n</div>",
