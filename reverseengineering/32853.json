    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I would like to alter the behavior of some executable (in my case, a videogame). One way of doing this is to hook function calls (e.g., a function like <code>Player::ReceiveDamage</code>) and adjust parameters/return values.</p>\n<p>I know how to inject code and how to hook functions. <strong>The challenge currently is to <em>find</em> the address of the function of interest</strong>. The source code of the target is not available, neither are debug symbols.</p>\n<p>An approach I successfully used before is the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Find all function addresses in the target executable (e.g., with IDA, radare2, Pyew, ...)</li>\n<li>With the executable running, hook all functions</li>\n<li>Black-list (and un-hook) functions that are called during moments that are not of interest</li>\n<li>White-list functions that are called during moments of interest</li>\n<li>Repeat steps (4,5) until function list is narrowed down sufficiently</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unfortunately, I have misplaced the code I was using for this process. I can re-write it, but I noticed that there is already an <a href=\"https://www.capstone-engine.org/showcase.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">enormous offering of tools and libraries</a> that may do exactly what I need.</p>\n<p>Performance is a challenge: logging all function calls in a videogame introduces significant overhead. I noticed previously that it would take some time for my old tool to black-list enough irrelevant functions for the target to become responsive. This likely makes <a href=\"https://frida.re/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Frida</a> not a good choice, as it injects javascript.</p>\n<p><strong>Does anyone know of a <em>performant</em> tool/library, supporting Windows and x64, that I can use to find functions of interest in a target executable?</strong></p>\n</div>",

I've googled around a bit and indeed there appear to be some useful frameworks out there. I will update your answer to list a few of these.  For my use case probably these frameworks are overkill. I'll probably be quicker whipping up something myself compared to writing a plugin for one of those tools...</span>",

You can actually bypass this by patching both the <code>dbgeng.dll!AddBreakpoint</code> and <code>dbgeng.dll!InsertBreakpoints</code> functions. For v10.0.14321.1024, I've ended up using: <code>eb dbgeng+0005c055 ff; eb dbgeng+0005c7da ff</code></span>",
