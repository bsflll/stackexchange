    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I want to use IDA with the Hex-Rays decompiler plugin as part of automated static analysis, possibly on a large number of files without opening each one and telling it to produce a C file individually.  </p>\n<p>Ideally, I'd like to run IDA from the command line, and get the decompilation based on initial autoanalysis as output.  This way I can run it as part of <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/mastiff/\">Mastiff</a> or grep for certain functions in a set of binaries.   By my reading of <a href=\"http://www.hexblog.com/?p=53\">On batch analysis</a> from the Hex Blog, what I need is an IDA script that interacts with the decompiler plugin, but I can't figure out how to actually do so. </p>\n<p>So this leaves me with 2 subquestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How can I tell the Hex-Rays decompiler to \"Produce C file\" (decompile all functions) from a script?</li>\n<li>Does that script need to be IDC, or is IDAPython possible?</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

So you had these choices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.hexblog.com/?p=126\" rel=\"nofollow\">Add necessary functions to IDC</a> using a native plugin that calls the decompiler API.</li>\n<li>Use <code>ctypes</code> or similar to call the C++ API directly from Python. I posted a small PoC script doing it to the Hex-Rays forum a couple years ago.</li>\n<li>If you just want to have the decompiled text, you can use <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/decompiler/manual/batch.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">the command line option</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/6.6/index.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">IDA 6.6 (released in June 2014)</a> added official Python bindings for the decompiler, so it now can be scripted from Python. For sample code, see <code>vds*.py</code> scripts in the <a href=\"https://github.com/idapython/src/tree/master/examples\" rel=\"nofollow\">IDAPython repository</a>.</p>\n</div>",
