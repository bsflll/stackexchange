To reverse executables on Window learn the Disassembler (<a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">IDA</a>) and Debuggers (<a href=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/download-windbg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">WinDbg</a>, <a href=\"http://ollydbg.de/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OllyDbg</a>) as well as the Windows API , if you plan to reverse Windows specific software. Crackmes and keygens are great resource for learning and I would recommend <a href=\"https://tuts4you.com/download.php?view.3152\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">crackme.de</a>, as it contains lots of windows executables.</p>\n</div>",
