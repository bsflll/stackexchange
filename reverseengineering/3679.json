I would like to access the ERP's data but I don't know exactly how it's stored in the tables. I can guess but I was thinking it could be easier if I could do something like a snapshot, then do an operation in the ERP (like creating an order for a customer) and then be able to know which data changed since the snapshot (a bit like when we use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">diff</a> with source code).</span>",
