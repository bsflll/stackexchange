    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I know this question may be an ambiguous one and so may not be straightforward, so I apologize for that. Nevertheless, I believe that anti-debugging is responsible for the constant crashing of the program whenever the breakpoint is hit but I am not sure.</p>\n<p>I have tried to use other debugging tools but still the same trouble I am getting. So I believe whatever is going on is specific to the way the program is working. So any ideas as to what is responsible for this and how do I go around it</p>\n</div>",
