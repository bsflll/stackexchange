            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">Hi and welcome to RE.SE. How is it different than simply injecting? One method of injecting a DLL is to create a process yourself, which means you typically have all required rights to do whatever you like with it. Combine that with starting said process suspended and you have a recipe for injecting DLLs before the main entry point of the executable gets to run ... what am I missing? (duh, only saw the answer after I commented ... that answer embodies all I described)</span>",
