    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm looking for the maximum sampling rate of the Wii Balance Board for studying <a href=\"http://www.cq.com.pl/e_stabilograf.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">statokinesiograms</a> (2D path of the ground projection of the center of pressure). Some <a href=\"http://marcocardinale.wordpress.com/2011/04/21/nintendo-wii-fit-can-be-used-as-a-force-plate/\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a> indicates a sampling rate of 100Hz. <a href=\"http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/wii-balance-board2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Another</a> mentions 60Hz, and a <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096663620900664X\" rel=\"nofollow\">serious reference</a> is using the WBB at 40Hz !</p>\n<p>The related <a href=\"http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20090093305.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">patent</a> does not provide this information but mention 60Hz \"as an example\" (page 13). I suppose the bottleneck in frequency would be the microprocessor speed, as several pressure acquisitions could be transmitted at once with the bluetooth module.</p>\n</div>",
