    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Using IDA Pro, I tried to patch <code>int 2Dh</code> to <code>nop</code>.\nHowever, with the debugger, it seems that the original code is being loaded.\nWhat may be the reason for that? This might be related for some protections? I'm new to RE and to IDA. I did not yet analyze deeply the routines before the <code>int 2Dh</code> anti-debug technique.</p>\n<p>The view during static analysis is:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/juuW4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/juuW4.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>The view during debug is:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/k0GWi.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/k0GWi.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you may notice, the original <code>int 2Dh</code> command has been reverted.</p>\n</div>",
