The question is that <strong>at least some of APK are now encrypted</strong> and how to parse such APK without using of old Google Play that really allow to download encrypted APK in unencrypted format, because such old version may be disabled in future, and downloading of APK will become problematic.</p>\n</div>",

I don't use Fiddler, it has many adwares. You may use Fiddler and may find same result as I did. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Does anyone know how to unpack/decrypt APK file downloaded by modern Google Play Store version?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, Google doesn't encrypt the APK, at least I didn't found it to be encrypted. First install <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.greyshirts.sslcapture&amp;hl=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Packet Capture</a> from Play Store. Allow it to install a 3rd party certificate to intercept the SSL encryption. Open that application, click on the green play button, choose the \"Downloads\" or \"Downloads Manager\" or <code>com.android.providers.downloads</code> in that list. The application will be intercepting the packets from Downloads. </p>\n<p>Start to download any app from Play Store. There will be a small 2-3 KB packet first which contains the real download link. The second packet will be the compressed APK package. Stop the download and Packet Capture, open the first packet. You may see the link as follows in this HTTP GET <code>Location</code> tag:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/E7vjO.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"HTTP_Get_Request\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/E7vjO.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Copy the full link starting with <code>https://r6---sn-gwpa-jj0l.gvt1.com/play-apps-download-default/</code>, place it in any browser the file will be downloaded. Link may expire in some time, so do it quickly. Here comes the important facts. The downloaded file is a <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GZIPed file</a>, <strong><code>file</code> command</strong> shows this: <code>gzip compressed data, from FAT filesystem (MS-DOS, OS/2, NT)</code>. Extract the APK file from it with any decompresser tool (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.gzip.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GZIP</a>, <a href=\"https://www.7-zip.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">7ZIP</a> etc). </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Here is the full log of HTTP GET header:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>GET /download/by-token/download?token=AOTCm0QN_iloMjhxZLX8cMBfVXIpmMrUUTyJcDi2Aa1h_yJVIT_f6STKoVKrJWPR6qpAVsb6_0IRDjzNoneXmeliSL9Zx6IxXva7zFmP4_WNHlpo2Yaf9LUe6SXrR0r5TNzkqm79fA0LmPKB_TObJOnT1-seAI2Szdi4wVAu_3baecu_KHMeXmcV7cyHEGdrsnHbgC9VfQJKnq4Pt00WzpKhqziwLnGRRcOAKGr0gvbF_wBjbHfks2VQPNlMnhlgSS4miJomoeoKwBBPuyexDHNWrSyian1BReyBtV9liH3ueB5iJJFbuFFMRpH3cO4K8h-0MrvzHTMeYEpkcwBT8T3GhA&amp;cpn=w_2EoAbVy7CSoAaZ&amp;isid=VUNzEjxjRROS-g4UxpZC2A HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: AndroidDownloadManager/6.0.1 (Linux; U; Android 6.0.1; Model XYZ Build/XYZ123)\nAccept-Encoding: identity\nHost: play.googleapis.com\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nContent-Type: application/binary\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate\nPragma: no-cache\nExpires: Mon, 01 Jan 1990 00:00:00 GMT\nDate: Thu, 28 Jun 2018 17:48:45 GMT\nLocation: https://r6---sn-gwpa-jj0l.gvt1.com/play-apps-download-default/download/by-id/AF3DWBexsd0viV96e5U9-SkM_V5zc7aWOEqZi1rsPmGPvWj2reBV2c5DlYCXyzUoWZfcuw0RJcQLF2IKDQXYmWT3mpm_b2KkdGTOgw07z67jzPdSHFfRpJI?cpn=w_2EoAbVy7CSoAaZ&amp;ctier=L&amp;initcwndbps=710&amp;mm=31&amp;mn=sn-gwpa-jj0l&amp;ms=au&amp;mt=1530208077&amp;mv=m&amp;pl=18&amp;expire=1530380925&amp;ip=12.12.12.12&amp;ipbits=0&amp;sparams=expire,ipbits,ip,q:,initcwndbps,mm,mn,ms,mv,pl,ctier&amp;signature=5F361AC4E40D8665A674D9E71E971B867F0BBA71.C62F35F6BA6EE3B8D63258A950F70509544D36F2&amp;key=am3\nServer: ESF\nContent-Length: 0\nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nAlt-Svc: quic=\":443\"; ma=2592000; v=\"43,42,41,39,35\"\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
