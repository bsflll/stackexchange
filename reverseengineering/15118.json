You'll have something like this: <code>\"c:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA 6.95\\idaq.exe\" -B {full path to  the file you want to analyze}</code></li>\n<li>After running this command you should see the idb and assembly file in the same directory where your executable that you tried to analyze resides. Please note that you should run it on behalf of user that has write access permission for the folder where it resides. In addition you need to use appropriate IDA version: if the analyzed executable has 64 bit instruction set you have to use idaq64 executable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is how it works (and worked always) on my computer with IDA 6.95 (I analyzing 64 bit object file test.o, and corresponding ida database extension is not idb, but i64):</p>\n<pre><code>C:\\Users\\[censored]\\Downloads\\idatest&gt;copy z:\\test.o .\\\n        1 file(s) copied.\n\nC:\\Users\\[censored]\\Downloads\\idatest&gt;\"c:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA 6.95\\idaq64.exe\" -B .\\test.o\n\nC:\\Users\\[censored]\\Downloads\\idatest&gt;dir\n Volume in drive C is OSDisk\n Volume Serial Number is F88B-CF68\n\n Directory of C:\\Users\\[censored]\\Downloads\\idatest\n\n04/13/2017  04:20 PM    &lt;DIR&gt;          .\n04/13/2017  04:20 PM    &lt;DIR&gt;          ..\n04/13/2017  04:20 PM             2,985 test.asm\n04/13/2017  04:20 PM            65,992 test.i64\n03/22/2017  06:44 PM             1,424 test.o\n               3 File(s)         70,401 bytes\n               2 Dir(s)   8,296,001,536 bytes free\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let me know in comments if something doesn't work.
