    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>As per <a href=\"https://hex-rays.com/blog/igors-tip-of-the-week-122-manual-load/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this recent blog article</a> one can set the PE loader to default to loading all sections. I even knew that. So setting the following setting in <code>cfg\\pe.cfg</code> does the trick:</p>\n<pre><code>PE_LOAD_ALL_SECTIONS = YES\n</code></pre>\n<p>I often find myself needing to load at least the file header (<a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/q/30389/245\">sometimes in hindsight</a>) but there is no explicit option for the file header on the load dialog:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/okHf5.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Load new file dialog\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/okHf5.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Instead we have the \"Load resources\" checkbox, which -- if checked -- avoids having to do a full manual load, but seems to load <em>both</em> the resources (<code>.rsrc</code> \"segment\") and the file header (<code>HEADER</code> \"segment\").</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AXkeC.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"List of segments\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AXkeC.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>That <em>also</em> seems to be the effect of configuring <code>PE_LOAD_ALL_SECTIONS = YES</code>. Alas, if you set the configuration inside the <code>cfg\\pe.cfg</code>, the \"Load resources\" checkbox doesn't get default-checked or so.</p>\n<p>So my question is: are these two methods to load the file header and resources synonymous? If not, are they overlapping? What are the differences?</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Experiment: trying all combinations on handle46.exe from SysInternals</h3>\n<p>Here's the outcome of the various settings on a PE file with IDA Pro 8.2.221215:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>PE_LOAD_ALL_SECTIONS = NO</code> (default) and <em>no changes</em> on the load dialog:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/g8YJW.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Just: PE_LOAD_ALL_SECTIONS = NO\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/g8YJW.png\"/></a></li>\n<li><code>PE_LOAD_ALL_SECTIONS = NO</code> (default) and \"[✔] Load resources\" on the load dialog:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/eusLx.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Load resources AND PE_LOAD_ALL_SECTIONS = NO\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/eusLx.png\"/></a></li>\n<li><code>PE_LOAD_ALL_SECTIONS = YES</code> and <em>no changes</em> on the load dialog:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Yevun.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Just: PE_LOAD_ALL_SECTIONS = YES\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Yevun.png\"/></a></li>\n<li><code>PE_LOAD_ALL_SECTIONS = YES</code> and \"[✔] Load resources\" on the load dialog:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/shg5p.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Load resources AND PE_LOAD_ALL_SECTIONS = YES\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/shg5p.png\"/></a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The odd outcome is 3., because it loads the <code>.rsrc</code> section although it hadn't been asked for it. That's also the reason why I asked this question in the first place.</p>\n</div>",

Setting <code>PE_LOAD_ALL_SECTIONS = YES</code> in the config file does what it says, loads all sections (including <code>.rsrc</code>). Checking <code>Load resources</code> in the GUI also does what it says, ensures that <code>.rsrc</code> is loaded. These 2 configuration methods are independent of each other.</span>",
