    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Is it possible to retrieve .dfm file from a delphi executable. I have inherited Acrobyte projects(Indy Pity Crew) so before I reactivate the website(www.acrobyte.cf) every product must be in order. I have updated others except the three left. So since I have a software that converts .dfm to .pas I can update them. I have seen the software that extracts DFM data from a delphi executable, in form of .rc and .dat but I never been able to add a function that extract the whole DFM file.</p>\n<p>How can I extract the whole dfm file of an executable e.g( pet.exe to pet.dfm)?</p>\n<p>In other ways I would like to convert rc file to dfm.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\n</div>",
