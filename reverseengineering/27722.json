This adapter (PC052) was made to work with a Wii classic controller (<a href=\"https://http2.mlstatic.com/D_NQ_NP_2X_883040-MLB32327367646_092019-F.webp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">RVL-005</a>), if you saw both pictures, you will notice that CLV-202 and RVL-005 looks very similar, mine have less 5 buttons to me to care about\n*** End of my sad history ***</p>\n<p>So, I must start from where?\nHow to create a \"dump\" file of this firmware to my PC? Is it possible to edit it (w/o the source code)?\nI'm a 101% noob in this area, and have 0% idea in how to start... but I want to learn with you all</p>\n<p>PS: I don't care if the \"original intended\" devices stop working after the mod, just want this CLV-202 controller working</p>\n</div>",
