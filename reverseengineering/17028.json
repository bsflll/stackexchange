You can try attaching to a running process from IDA, instead of loading exe for disassembly first. Also, I would suggest trying the other debugging backends like Windbg (Debugger - Select debugger menu). You'll need debugging tools for Windows. And if there's no specific need to debug from IDA, then use Windbg directly.</p>\n</div>",
