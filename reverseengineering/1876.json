    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've been trying to reverse engineer a paid android app that writes out some binary data so that I can export that data into other programs (it's a run/walk timer app, if anyone's curious, and I'm trying to get its GPS traces out). However, it looks like the apk is encrypted and stored in <code>/data/app-asec/[app_id].asec</code>.</p>\n<p>There's a nice <a href=\"http://nelenkov.blogspot.com/2012/07/using-app-encryption-in-jelly-bean.html\">blog post</a> that says the encryption used is TwoFish, with a key stored in <code>/data/misc/systemkeys/AppsOnSD.sks</code>, but I haven't been able to decrypt the file using the na√Øve strategy of just using that key directly with TwoFish on the <code>.asec</code>.</p>\n<p>How can I decrypt this to get an apk I can actually analyze?</p>\n<p>Note: I realize that this information is considered somewhat delicate in places like xda-developers, since it could be used to enable piracy. I have no such intentions, I just want to examine the serialization code.</p>\n</div>",

They're actually dm-crypt volumes, which then get mounted at <code>/mnt/asec/[app_id]</code>. The <code>pkg.apk</code> in that directory is the unencrypted apk that can be analyzed using any of the fine tools in <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/46/257\">this answer</a>.</p>\n</div>",
