    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>About 15 years ago Sandisk released their \"Sansa SlotRadio\" thing. Basically, it's a regular mp3 player with an sdcard preloaded with music.</p>\n<p>Well, the music mafia being the music mafia, there's DRM involved, which would make an interesting project to try and defeat.</p>\n<p>On the sdcard is a sticker. And behind the sticker is... A grid of pins!</p>\n<p>Infact, it looks SUSPICIOUSLY similar to the ones data recovery centers use when doing low level stuff on physically broken cards.</p>\n<p>Anyone have any info on this? It's three rows and seven columns, with (2,2) missing and (2,5) much smaller.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jyr3360F.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"The SDCARD in question.\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jyr3360F.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
