    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>The test is on 32bit x86 Linux, with <code>g++</code> 4.6.3.</p>\n<p>So basically I use a <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/6311/how-to-recover-the-exception-info-from-gcc-except-table-and-eh-handle-sections\">IDA pro script</a> to recover the <code>.gcc_excpt_table</code> and <code>.eh_frame</code> sections from binary compiled from <code>C++</code> language.</p>\n<p>Basically I want to reuse the dumped information of these two exception handling tables in a new assembly code disassembled from this <code>C++</code> ELF binary.</p>\n<p>I put these two tables into the assembly code produced by disassembler, solving all intra-module address issue (basically translate concrete addresses into symbols) and re-compile it like this:</p>\n<pre><code>g++ final.s\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, there are three symbols that can not be found or I just don't know how to define it.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>_Unwind_Resume</code> are undefined</li>\n<li><code>__FRAME_END__</code> are undefined</li>\n<li>It seems that <code>eh_frame</code> requires the beginning address of <code>.plt</code> table, but is there anyway to get the beginning address of <code>.plt</code> table during compiling? I know I can use the symbol <code>_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_</code> to represent the beginning address of table <code>.got.plt</code>, but after a quick search, I just don't know whether there is a similar symbol representing <code>.plt</code> table.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
