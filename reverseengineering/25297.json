The decompiler concluded that there is a <code>CALL</code> to the address pointed to by your code. It doesn't know its prototype but it does know that this is called as a function. You can't normally <code>CALL</code> a <code>void *</code>, so <code>code *</code> is the way to show it. Consider it a cast to unknown-prototyped function.</span>",
