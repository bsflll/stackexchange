Running it again now or manually compiling before execution should yield a relatively short output.</p></li>\n<li><p>firmware-mod-kit did not simply fail with \"No supported filesystem found\". It failed with a python error that caused a premature termination of the tool.</p></li>\n<li><p>The python error was <code>str() takes at most 1 argument (2 given)</code>, which is an error widely known to come from trying to run python3 code with a python2 interpreter.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
