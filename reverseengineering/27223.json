Otherwise <code>idc.get_segm_name</code> might actually return the actual segment name, not the image name.</p>\n<p>You can easily rewrite that for Python 2 if needed by not utilizing the <code>pathlib</code> and change the <code>print()</code>-function to be a <code>print</code>-statement in case you want to access the original image file name.</p>\n</div>",
