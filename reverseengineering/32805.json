    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>There is a PE file, which can't run by itself, and can only be called from <code>cmd.exe</code>, it doesn't create independent processes, and can be launched independently only with <code>.bat</code> scripts, which without \"pause\" just execute themselves and self-destruct. Trying to attach debugger to cmd, only debugs the <code>cmd.exe</code> process. So am I doing something very wrong, or there is no real way to dynamically analyze this PE file?</p>\n</div>",

May be the process only exists for some milliseconds and then injects itself in a different process? Using Sysinternals ProcessMonitor I am sure you will see that there is a process and how long it lives.</span>",
