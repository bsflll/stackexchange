The issue arise when I try to decompile the same binary under Ghidra. </p>\n<p>For some reason, Ghidra, nor any other disassemble/decompiler software, does not demangle and decompile the binary properly. It shows a lot of idbs and undefined ASM calls. Upon researching further, I found out this technique is shown in <a href=\"https://iokit.racing/machotricks.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MachO Tricks</a> by qw as Mach-O obfuscation tricks. A issue is raised in <a href=\"https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues/1823\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ghidra repository</a> too.</p>\n<p>How to fix those segments via Ghidra, or any other tool for that matter so that the disassemble code will be readable and reversible? </p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The binary is <a href=\"https://www.hopperapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hopper Disassembler</a> which is ALLOWED to be reverse engineered. As per ToS presented.</p>\n</div>",

Although quite informative, this answer does not help with my last question from the thread: how can we manually refix those segments so we can continue reversing in r2/lldb. Wish IDA had a way to export MachO binaries.</span>",
