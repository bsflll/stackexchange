I want to do it for study purposes, and not for an actual anti-reversing method. Do you have any recommendations/approaches how can I write such a function, that will compile with <code>gcc</code> or similar compiler, but won't be decompilable by <code>hex-rays</code>?</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> \nMy goal is to make the code disassemblable, but not decompilable. I'm not looking for obfuscators that will hide the code completely, but a way to make IDA not to be able to decompile. for example, by somehow messing with the stack pointer. </p>\n</div>",

Beside, I think you can use a function which is not type-able in the type system of the decompilation target language of IDA (I believe it's a subset of C), e.g.</p>\n<pre><code>int foo(void *f, int i) {\n    return ((int (*)(void*, int))(f))(foo, i);\n}\n\nclang -c test.c\n</code></pre>\n<p>then IDA decompilers gives something likes</p>\n<pre><code>__int64 __fastcall foo(__int64 (__fastcall *a1)(__int64 (__fastcall *)(), _QWORD), unsigned int a2)\n{\n  return a1(foo, a2);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>which is obviously not correct: <code>foo</code> is recognized simultaneously as a function of two params and one param.</p>\n</div>",
