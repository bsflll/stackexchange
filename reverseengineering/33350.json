    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Somewhat recently FiveBelow started selling \"fancy\" famiclones branded under Vivitar. It's styled to look like an old CRT TV.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/j-xvHT_au9Y?si=ZeN9CmVRBeLvfJSs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">A video for those curious</a>.</p>\n<p>Intrigued in the possibilities for hardware hacking, I picked one up myself. Although because of the low quality of the PCB I ended up accidentally destroying it soon after due to lifting multiple pads. Oops.</p>\n<p>But hey, it didn't die completely in vain because not only did I dump it's flash chip (which contains the games), but I also managed to de encapsulate the IC!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/five-below-vivitar-fancy-famiclone-s-29-gl-064-n-90-tfi-04\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here's the firmware dump</a>.</p>\n<p>But unlike that Coleco Head-to-Head plug and play I decapped, this modern famiclone is SIGNIFICANTLY more complex! The former was little more then an NES and accompanying cartridge crammed down into two chips, but the latter is on par with <em>mid range microcontrollers!</em></p>\n<p>This is a problem, because the firmware dump I have looks like absolute nonsense to me. Not even a single ASCII string in sight!</p>\n<p>I also haven't found any part numbers on the NOAC silicon die, so I can't find a lead that way.</p>\n<p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>\n</div>",
