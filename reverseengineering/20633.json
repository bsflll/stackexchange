Trapping\n  means that some external component adds a JMP instruction that is used\n  as a notification whenever the trapped function is called.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Can you show me how exactly can trapping be used in practice? I assume that trapping is just calling a function with trapping instruction inside the other function, but I don't realize how the outside function can get \"notified\" about the call... Is it possible the author meant by \"some external component\" the debugger? It can make sense because if I set a breakpoint for some strange assembly insruction like <code>MOV EDI, EDI</code>, I'll get to where trapped function is... </p>\n</div>",

The intention is that the MOV EDI, EDI instruction\n  will be replaced with a two-byte JMP $-5 instruction to redirect\n  control to five bytes of patch space that comes immediately before the\n  start of the function. Five bytes is enough for a full jump\n  instruction, which can send control to the replacement function\n  installed somewhere else in the address space.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>the <code>mov edi, edi</code> is used in conjunction with five space holders emitted by the compiler before the <code>mov edi, edi</code> like <code>0xcc</code> or <code>0x90</code> </p>\n<p>so the patching software can patch in an atomically replaceable short jump and a long jump to a control area</p>\n</div>",
