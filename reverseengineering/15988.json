I used Ollydbg for unpacking and set breakpoint on <code>VirtualAlloc</code> to see the \"MZ\" header in memory dump, and saved it to a file. But the saved file is not valid, PEiD say it is not a valid file for example. I think it destroys its data directories. Is there any solution for repair this executable that I can try?</p>\n</div>",

Its data directories are destroyed. The PE file have been processed by the cryptor in order to be loaded in a continuous space, not divided by sections. It lost the ability to run independently, without being loaded by the cryptor’s stub. Addresses saved as RVA are in reality raw addresses.\n  I have remapped them using a custom tool, and it revealed more information, i.e. the name of this PE file is Setup.dll:</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

It might be beneficial to use a more interactive debugger for that phase, such as IDA or radare2, so tracking manipulation of the file will be easier.</p>\n</div>",
