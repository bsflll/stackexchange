In the below block of code at 0040117C we can see the \"align\" keyword that was inserted by IDA.   </p>\n<pre><code>.text:00401176                 mov     eax, [edx+4]\n.text:00401179                 call    eax\n.text:0040117B\n.text:0040117B locret_40117B:                          ; CODE XREF: sub_401160+Dj\n.text:0040117B                 retn\n.text:0040117B sub_401160      endp\n.text:0040117B\n.text:0040117B ; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n.text:0040117C                 align 10h\n.text:00401180\n.text:00401180 ; =============== S U B R O U T I N E =======================================\n.text:00401180\n.text:00401180 ; Attributes: bp-based frame\n.text:00401180\n.text:00401180 ; int __stdcall sub_401180(void *Src)\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we were to view this in hex mode in this example we would see \"<code>CC CC ..</code>\". With other compilers we might see \"<code>90 90 ..</code>\". The obvious hint of what this is being used for is the \"align\" keyword. </p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> how can I tell if a specific byte at an address is marked as <code>align</code> in IDAPython? Example code would be appreciated. </p>\n<p>I have found a couple of functions and data types such as <code>FF_ALIGN</code> and <code>idaapi.is_align_insn(ea</code> that looked positive but I have yet to figure out a working example or results that confirm yes or no. I would prefer to rely on IDA types or functions rather than use string parsing for the keyword \"align\". </p>\n</div>",
