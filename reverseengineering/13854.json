It's just a library loaded dynamically by something else.  What you probably need to do, is to load the game/application that USES that <code>.SO</code>, and set a breakpoint at the location where it calls the function(s) that you're interested in, and then just single step into the <code>.SO</code> to see what's going on.</p>\n</div>",
