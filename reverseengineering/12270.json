I can login via telnet as a user but don't have the root password (in parallel I am running oclHashCat with the hash from the shadow file but it takes a lot of time).</p>\n<p>I can get access via GDB and can execute commands in root context so I was thinking that <code>netcat</code> would be an easy way to get a root shell (<code>shell</code> command in GDB doesn't appear to work).</p>\n<p>I found netcat binaries from netbsd for armle but when I try to run it I get the error <code>can't access shared library</code>. Not sure what it's missing but my guess is glibc (searching for .so with hex editor shows libc.so libdl.so).</p>\n<p>Am I correct that it's looking for <code>libc.so</code> and <code>libdl.so</code> ? Where to find these for QNX armle?</p>\n</div>",
