Then in android wifi options you can configure the proxy settings ip and port:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Connect to WIFI network</p></li>\n<li><p>Settings-&gt;WIFI</p></li>\n<li><p>Long tap on connected network's name</p></li>\n<li><p>Modify network config-&gt; Show advanced options</p></li>\n<li><p>Set proxy settings</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that configure Brup proxy options under the proxy tab to stop all requests and responses. After that you don't need to know the port that you app is using, all traffic from you smartphone will be shown in Brup.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.portswigger.net/customer/en/portal/topics/718317-installing-and-configuring-burp/articles\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://support.portswigger.net/customer/en/portal/topics/718317-installing-and-configuring-burp/articles</a></p>\n<p>Apart from that Burp have lots of features and plugins for fuzzing and other stuff, I don't know what are you trying to accomplish here but anyway this way should work for you!</p>\n</div>",

You might have to enter all <strong>65535</strong> ports though.</p>\n<p>For <code>Packet Capture</code>: sure it can <strong>decrypt</strong> SSL traffic. However, if <code>Wireshark</code> level <code>pcap</code> is what you are looking for, <code>Packet Capture</code> is still not enough.</p>\n</div>",
