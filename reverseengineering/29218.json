    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Im working on old software written in C# .NET for increase skills in dnSpy. im new in dnSpy.</p>\n<p>When I step-in dnSpy, the program get license information from another dll file. and the dll class are only have get; methods, when I want to set the value (write code in dnSpy) the main program give me an error.</p>\n<p>Also when I step-in and the dnSpy get license information from dll file, I can see and change the value of license in <strong>Locals</strong> section, I can set <strong>activated</strong> flag value to true and run the program as activated. is there any way to save the changes during run? because as I said, I can't write code in dnSpy, I just want patch the exe file, not DLL. (as I found the activated program on internet, they only changes the .exe file, not dll's)</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> The activated version of the software available on internet for free. The question is only for further study and research.</p>\n</div>",
