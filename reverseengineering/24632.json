I'm new to reversing software and to hooking, so I may have missed something big here.</p>\n<p>I'm trying to use this function as a hook:</p>\n<pre><code>typedef  int (__thiscall* func_type)(LPVOID*, LPVOID*, DWORD, BOOL);\nLPVOID hookaddr = 0;\n int __fastcall testhook(LPVOID* pThis, void* _EDX, LPVOID* object, DWORD hp, BOOL self)\n{\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Hooked\"  &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n\n    func_type originalFunc = (func_type)hookaddr;\n\n    return originalFunc(pThis, object, hp, self);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The problem lies in the fact that the hooked function seems to follow <code>__thiscall</code> convention and Detours doesn't seem to be allowing this? I tried mixing <code>__thiscall</code> and <code>__stdcall/__fastcall</code> conventions in my injected dll, but couldn't get anything working. I either end up with a wrong <code>ecx</code> value or a crash due to an invalid <code>esp</code>.</p>\n<p>Any idea what I could try here?</p>\n</div>",

I got confused with the hooked function signature and the <code>__fastcall</code> trick to get a non member function to work with the <code>__thiscall</code> convention. In my initial post, the two first arguments in the function signatures are the one passed using <code>ecx</code> and <code>edx</code>, but I forgot about one of the pointer passed using the stack. The correct function definition is the following:</p>\n<pre><code> int __fastcall testhook(LPVOID* pThis, void* _EDX, LPVOID* object, LPVOID* object2, DWORD hp, BOOL self)\n{\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Hooked\"  &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n\n    func_type originalFunc = (func_type)hookaddr;\n\n    return originalFunc(pThis, object, object2, hp, self);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As the callee is responsible for cleaning the stack, providing an incorrect number of parameters lead to a stack corruption (in my case, one of the parameter was still on the stack after my function returns).</p>\n</div>",
