            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I think that the problem is a misunderstanding of how the Proximity Viewer works. It will not clear out all the other nodes in the graph when finding a path: it simply finds a path and adds the required nodes to the graph. If you want to view only the nodes between AllocateVolume and CompareVolumeComponents, do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to AllocateVolume and press '-'.</li>\n<li>Right click on the center node AllocateVolume and select \"Collapse  children\", then, \"Collapse parents\" as well.</li>\n<li>Then, right click outside this node in the proximity view and select \"Add name\".</li>\n<li>Find \"CompareVolumeComponents\" and add it.</li>\n<li>After this step, right click on the AllocateVolume node, select \"Find Path\" and select the only other available node.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If everything goes OK, you will have a graph with only the functions required to display a path from AllocateVolume to CompareVolumeComponents. If it does not, there may be some problem with the current code of the Proximity Viewer (in that case, please contact support at Hex-Rays for a fix). Also, you may want to take a look to the \"callgraph\" plugin in the SDK: the algorithm to find paths is pretty much the same and you may get an idea about why it isn't working.</p>\n<p>As a side note, a little explanation of how the PV works: The algorithm does not consider a path only calls/jmps as (Q)WinGraph32 does (IIRC) but also consider a path when there are data references. If a function A references, in any way, function B, then the proximity viewer will show that reference (with a gray edge instead of a blue edge). BTW, I'm the guy who wrote it.</p>\n</div>",

I guess I need to experiment a bit more because I honestly thought I tried all the hiding options without success.  On a side node are you aware of any options dialog such that we can configure to find n-paths or all paths? As right now it finds just 1, not all.

It's the old Wingraph32 stuff that came already with the 5.x versions of IDA. See the attached picture for how the real thing looks:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Proximity browser\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RUipB.png\"/>\n(direct <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RUipB.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link to full size image</a>)</p>\n<p>You can find it under <code>View</code> -&gt; <code>Open subviews</code> -&gt; <code>Proximity browser</code></p>\n<p>Keep in mind that if you still use 6.2, there'll likely be a Qt version (<code>idaq.exe</code>) and the old Windows GUI version (<code>idag.exe</code>). You'll want the former for the proximity browser to work.</p>\n</div>",
