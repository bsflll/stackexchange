This <em>may</em> work for you by picking another processor model supported by the <code>nec850</code> processor module. However, <strong>RH850 support in particular was only introduced in IDA 7.2.</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Looking further we can see in the Wikipedia article on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renesas_Electronics\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Renesas</a> we find out why it ended up in the <code>nec850</code> processor module:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p><strong>Renesas Electronics started operation in April 2010, through\n  the integration of NEC Electronics Corporation and Renesas Technology\n  Corporation.</strong> NEC Electronics was established in November 2002 by a\n  spin-off of the semiconductor operations of NEC. Renesas Technology\n  was established on April 1, 2003, as a joint venture of Hitachi, Ltd.\n  (55%) and Mitsubishi Electric (45%).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The name RH850 is actually not used in the IDA SDK 7.0 and 7.1 (this particular processor module comes with source code included as also indicated on the Hex-Rays website).</p>\n<p>And in the <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/7.2/index.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">release information for IDA 7.2</a> we can read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The NEC 850 processor module has been extended to handle new\n  addressing modes and instructions for V850E2M and RH850 from Renesas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So no support prior to IDA 7.2 as I already surmised. In the IDA SDK 7.2 we can then find this:</p>\n<pre><code>static const char *const shnames[] =\n{\n  \"V850\",\n  \"V850E\",\n  \"V850E1\",\n  \"V850E2M\",\n  \"RH850\",\n  NULL\n};\n\nstatic const char *const lnames[] =\n{\n  FAMILY\"NEC V850\",\n  \"NEC V850E\",\n  \"NEC/Renesas V850E1/ES\",\n  \"NEC/Renesas V850E2/E2M\",\n  \"Renesas RH850\",\n  NULL\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>(This should also provide the clue which possible alternative names you could try for rudimentary support using related processor models. <em>All</em> of those are implemented in that same <code>nec850</code> processor module.)</p>\n</div>",
