I hit a wrong key while trying it out and now some of the lines that looked like</p>\n<pre><code>lea     ecx, [esp+150h+var_13E+2]\n</code></pre>\n<p>now look something like</p>\n<pre><code>lea     ecx, [esp+14h]\n</code></pre>\n<p>It computed the sum of the formula to figure out the stack address, removing the stack variable name it was using. It's harder to use now. Is there a way to get back the original line?</p>\n</div>",

You can have IDA regenerate it by undefining your function and redefining it.</p>\n<p>To do, so, place your text cursor at the beginning of the function, press <kbd>U</kbd> (<em>U</em>ndefine), then <kbd>P</kbd> (define <em>P</em>rocedure).</p>\n<p>Note that this will cause IDA to lose any information you manually added to the function (stack variable names, function prototype, etc.), so only do it as a last-resort.</p>\n</div>",
