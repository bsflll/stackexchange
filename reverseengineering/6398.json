In the disassembly, calls to the functions then appeared visually like calls to known WinAPI methods, for example:\n<img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jYRep.png\"/></p>\n<p>In OllyDbg 2 it looks like:\n<img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VDgLt.png\"/></p>\n<p>Sadly strings are not directly seen anymore, but it helped me much more seeing when pushes are about to be method parameters.</p>\n<p>Is there an OllyDbg 2 compatible plugin providing me this feature?</p>\n</div>",
