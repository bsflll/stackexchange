Data that gets treated as code will usually contain undefined bytes â€“ these will appear as literal <code>dcd</code> bytes among seemingly valid disassembled instructions. (And on close inspection, those \"instructions\" are usually nonsensical.)</p>\n<p>Code that gets treated as data is more difficult to spot, especially if there are no obvious references into it. With sufficient experience, one may be able to recognize certain hex sequences as \"most likely code\"; in that case, instruct IDA to disassemble such a sequence and see what it produces.</p>\n</div>",
