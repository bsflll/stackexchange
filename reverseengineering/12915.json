    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>My goal is to see what's going on \"under the hood\" in the Windows command prompt when a user pastes text into it. So I loaded <code>cmd.exe</code> into IDA Pro that is set up in conjunction with the WinDbg debugger.</p>\n<p>My initial guess was to put a breakpoint on <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms649048(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OpenClipboard</a> API which must be used to access clipboard, but it seems like cmd.exe doesn't even have a dependency on <code>User32.dll</code> (where OpenClipboard comes from):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hPeWB.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hPeWB.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>So am I reading it correctly?</p>\n<p>PS. I'm doing this on Windows 10.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> You know, there's something other than deferred loading. I let the <code>cmd.exe</code> initialize and begin running, after which I suspended it. The loaded modules list still didn't have <code>user32.dll</code>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fbkl5.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fbkl5.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>and my deferred breakpoint didn't trigger upon clipboard operation either:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/d609W.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/d609W.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Could there be some other process that does all the \"command line\" logic?</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> Just tried to attach to a running <code>conhost.exe</code>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3UEJS.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3UEJS.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>while IDA Pro was running as administrator and got this error:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Hwolt.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Hwolt.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>EDIT 3:</strong> Just tried to attach to <code>conhost.exe</code> via just WinDbg itself and got this error. I'm not sure how <code>NTSTATUS 0xC00000BB</code> applies here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TEIKb.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TEIKb.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

It turns out that IDA Pro cannot attach to a 64-bit process so it was using a 32-bit version of WinDbg implicitly. Thus I was getting that strange error. I also discovered that I was using an old version of WinDbg. And lastly, even though I was originally starting a 32-bit version of <code>cmd.exe</code> it was implicitly connecting to a 64-bit version of <code>conhost.exe</code>. So eventually I had to ditch IDA and go with bare WinDbg which is somewhat hard to use... but it did the job. So thank you!</span>",
