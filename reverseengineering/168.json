Normally, it will indicate that the file is packed with UPX but, specially if you're analyzing malware, it may be done in order to fool you. My recommendation is to look to the entry point and find a pattern similar to this one:</p>\n<pre><code>0x00023b60 ; FUNCTION start\n0x00023b60 (01) 60                     PUSHA \n0x00023b61 (05) be00904300             MOV ESI, 0xHARDCODED_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS\n0x00023b66 (06) 8dbe0080fcff           LEA EDI, [ESI-0x38000] \n0x00023b6c (01) 57                     PUSH EDI \n0x00023b6d (02) eb0b                   JMP 0x00023b7a   ; 1 \n</code></pre>\n<p>Basically, find for PUSHA, MOV ESI, VIRTUAL_ADDRESS, LEA and JMP.</p>\n</div>",

Granted, the author of the elf file could introduce the very same strings intentionally to throw your analysis off-track. I would just use this as a starting point in my analysis.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the identification strings that helped me identify the packer type.<br/>\nUPX - UPX0, UPX1, UPX2<br/>\nAspack - aspack, adata<br/>\nNSPack - NSP0, NSP1, NSP2<br/>\nNTKrnl - NTKrnl Security Suite<br/>\nPECompact - PEC2, PECompact2<br/>\nThemida - Themida, aPa2Wa<br/></p>\n<p>Also, the file command identifies some common packer formats too.</p>\n<p>If you suspect that the file is definitely packed with UPX, then I would recommend the suggestion from 0xC0000022L.</p>\n</div>",
