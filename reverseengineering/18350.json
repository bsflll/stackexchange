I also tried using <code>toPrint = readstr(fp)</code>, but it does not work. (same unknown character)</p>\n<p>PS: I'm analysing a 32 bit PE file. I could not use IDAPython, as I'm using the x64 free version, so I have to resort to IDC. Any help appreciated.</p>\n</div>",

This is probably an initial cause of your problem: symbols preceded by single slash are interpreted as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequences_in_C\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">escape sequences</a> which means that the file name was interpreted incorrectly and was not opened.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/321.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">fgetc</a> in a way you did is also incorrect because it returns long or character, not a string, and Message function probably interprets is as a pointer.\nI checked this on IDA 6.9. In a later versions it is probably better to detect an EOF by <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/1221.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">value_is_string</a> function for this.</p>\n</div>",
