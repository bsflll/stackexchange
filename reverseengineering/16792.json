I'd say that it looks like kind of work with memory mapped registers - I had seen such a things before with various IOT devices ROMs . I'd suggest to do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verify that you have a segment that includes the address. If not - create additional data segment that includes all mentioned addresses.</li>\n<li>Mark the suspicious number as offsets (just press <kbd>O</kbd> on them).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This should cause IDA to threat all these things as offsets in memory.</p>\n<p>If this is low level code that deals with hardware directly you'll probably find all segment addresses either in it SDK or in the corresponding datasheet.</p>\n</div>",
