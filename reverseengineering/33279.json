But when I move on, processor module works and I can disassemble binary.</p>\n<p>I want to get rid of that warning. Apparently IDA Pro parses ELF file and finds <code>e_machine</code> is equal to <code>113</code> which is actually <code>Altera Nios II soft-core processor</code>. But also it is undefined for IDA Pro 9.0.</p>\n<p>I have tried <code>set_processor_type()</code>, but it is something else.</p>\n<p>I have searched google and there is a deprecated IDAPython function which is <code>loader_elf_machine</code>; so, this is not working for me either.</p>\n<p>So my question is rather obvious. I know the machine; I know what <code>113</code> refers to. Is it possible to get rid of this warning by using <strong>IDA Python</strong>? Can I define this number as a machine while loading processor module?</p>\n</div>",
