In a compiled .apk file, does it contain all constants from the XML files prior to compilation? I've decompiled an app using several Java RE tools, and used <code>apktool</code> to extract the resources (xml files, images and others). However, when rebuilding the project in Eclipse, the <code>R.java</code> generated by Eclipse (in the <code>gen</code> folder) does not match the original <code>R.java</code> from the decompiled app. Is this a common occurrence when reversing android apps? In this case, the original R.java contains fields consistent with the rest of the code. However, this is not present in the generated R.java and hence this error.</p>\n<p>The decompilers I used are</p>\n<p>1) <a href=\"http://www.android-decompiler.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JEB</a> (Commercial)</p>\n<p>2) <a href=\"https://github.com/skylot/jadx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">jadx</a> (Open-source)</p>\n<p><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4BXHG.png\"/></p>\n</div>",
