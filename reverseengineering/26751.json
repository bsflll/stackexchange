However, I am a beginner in the Computer Science field. I recently started my Computer Science Degree and would like to know what modules should I look out for that typically covers this sort of thing.</p>\n<p>We have a course in second year labelled - 'Full Stack Developing' would that be something I should take?</p>\n</div>",
