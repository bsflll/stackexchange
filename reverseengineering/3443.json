    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>One of the major hurdles of x86 disassembly is separating code from data. All available open-source disassembly library only perform a straight line disassembly (starts from the top and skips errors by 1 byte), compared with OllyDBG which apparently uses a control flow disassembly (using opcodes like CALL and JMP) or IDA using heuristics and emulation. However these two aren't open-source.</p>\n<p>My question is, is there any open-source library or project that uses a better technique than simple straight line disassembly (control flow or heuristics based) ?</p>\n<p>I stumbled upon a paper using a machine learning approach ? is there an open-source implementation of this approach ?</p>\n</div>",

This is a static analyser written in Python that is used, mainly, for malware analysis. Depending on what you need, you may find it useful (it only supports yet 16, 32 and x64 Intel code). You can write your own scripts using <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/pyew/wiki/BatchExample\">Pyew's API</a> (here you have a more complex <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/pyew/source/browse/gcluster.py\">example</a>). I use (and used it) for masive malware analysis. Indeed, when I was working for them, Pyew was analysing all the VirusTotal traffic. We used it to discard some very similar looking samples from some expensive analysis.</p>\n<p>Pyew does recursive traversal code analysis (explanation <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/pyew/wiki/CodeAnalysis\">here</a>). Pyew it's not going to be fooled like linear-sweeps disassemblers. Anyway, it isn't as smart as it's IDA. Pyew is Open Source (GPL) and depending on your needs I even give, sometimes, LGPL licenses for it. </p>\n<p>PS: If you're looking for something that support anything which is not Intel based and you want something Open Source you really need to check out <a href=\"http://radare.org\">radare</a>.</p>\n</div>",
