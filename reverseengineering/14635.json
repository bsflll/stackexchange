For me - looks a bit stupid, to calculate next address out of the previous one. For me this is an indicator of some problems during disassembly/debugging, but I am not very experienced to claim it to be true for 100%.</p>\n<p><code>shl     eax, 8</code> // SHL stands for Shift Left. It shifts the content of EAX bitwise on 8 bits, which is equal to multiplying it by 256. If some non-zero bits were shifted \"out of\" register - CF flag will be raised.</p>\n<p><code>add     eax, ecx</code> // add ecx to eax</p>\n<p><code>lea     edx, [eax+eax*2]</code> // Similar to previous LEA commands.</p>\n<p><code>mov     eax, dword_9FB922[ecx+edx*2]</code> // dword_9FB922 seems to be a DWORD array or matrix. So base-index addressing is used. ecx+edx*2 refers to a particular element of an array (or matrix, look here for an explanation <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/bilalamjad1/arrays-and-addressing-modes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Link</a>). The strange thing here is that usually, when working with DWORD (4-byte-element array) you have to multiply (scale) by 4 and not 2. This might be just a wrong naming from IDA.</p>\n<p><code>lea     ecx, dword_9ECB20[ecx+edx*2]</code> // Same thing here.</p>\n<p><code>sub     eax, 2C5h</code> // remove (subtract) 709 from eax</p>\n<p><code>cmp     eax, 0Dh</code> // compare eax to 13</p>\n<p><code>ja      short loc_42D480</code> // jump if eax &gt; 13 (not fired) else fired.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I recommend to review the data in all that dword_* variables. Hope this helped you.</p>\n</div>",
