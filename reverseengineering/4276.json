    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I want to generate all xrefs from function just to check what api it uses in its call-tree. I know I can generate call tree graph by right clicking on function name and \"Xrefs from\", but I would like to have this functions listed just as text or something like that, so I could read it easily.</p>\n<p>Reading it from WinGraph is pretty hard, and I have trouble with this nasty colors..\nI mean, how is it readable? It is really hard to read white text on cyan background. And I dont see any way to configure it. My eyes just cant stand looking at it.</p>\n<p>So how can I get this xrefs in some friendly format? I am sure it is possible.. \nI am using IDA 6.1 </p>\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\n</div>",
