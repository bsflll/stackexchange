Where did you get that information. <a href=\"http://dubeyko.com/development/FileSystems/NTFS/ntfsdoc.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here</a>? For starters attributes (and the file name is an attribute in NTFS terms, IIRC), can be resident (inside the record) or non-resident (elsewhere). So your assumption that the file name ought to be at offset 0x52 is already wrong. But what you describe here looks more like an <code>ATTRIBUTE_RECORD_HEADER</code>? I think you need to give more information.</span>",
