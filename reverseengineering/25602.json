Is there some version of a BGA x-ray that isn't thousands of $'s?</p>\n<p>Here's a picture of the BGA's. Would it be easier to build a breakout connector to insert between this and main board?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/dDocy.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/dDocy.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>If I desoldered them, maybe I could stick them in a socket and read them directly?</p>\n</div>",

I'm guessing RAM since there's two of them? But I could be wrong. If they were eMMC, there are sockets you can buy to read them, or breakout the pins manually to a dummy card. Not sure, there are some fairly cheap kits online that seem alright.</span>",

I couldn't find an exact datasheet, though I found one \"sorta\" similar for a NumonyxTM StrataFlash Embedded Memory (P30), don't know if Intel would collaborate with them? I was thinking about an infrared oven to pull them, vs. a hot air station.</span>",
