    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am analyzing a malicious javascript. The code is encoded and obfuscated in a way that I did not manage to even partially deobfuscate yet and it is filled with long strings. In order to simplify the task I put the code to <a href=\"http://jshint.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JShint</a>. According to the tool, there are 82 variables that are not used:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QfaCM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"JShint output\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QfaCM.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Given the context, is it safe to assume that the reason these variables exist is most likely to add to obfuscation but not to fulfill any operation? Would it be reasonable to delete declarations of these variables and have a shorter code to work with?</p>\n</div>",

This because the previous step of obfuscation make  vars look like unusued, only because their use in the code is obfuscated on a (again) previous step.</p>\n<p>For example. You could use eval and base64 encoding to hide the use of a piece of code. </p>\n<p>In a situation like your I tend to remove apparently unused code using IDE tools, then, if the code is still working I can be sure I removed useless fog from the code.  </p>\n<p>Person opinion: JsHint fall to detect used cars just when JavaScript coding is confused... An alert using window object to access a variable make JsHint blind. Is not a good help <em>for this specific purpose</em>.</p>\n<p><em>obviously you need to run every sort of sandboxing, sw and hw isolation and emulation when you try a malicious code</em> . </p>\n</div>",
