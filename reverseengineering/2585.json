C++ is not part of IDA's world directly. \nThat's more in the realm of a particular language, one of many, while IDA is about assembly and byte code domains; with the exception of the HexRays decompiler plug-in, which sort of adds a C/C++ thing on top.</p>\n<p>Are you sure you can relate the actual binary address to a given C++ method, and, or vftable et al?</p>\n<p>At any rate you will probably have to write your own plug-in, and, or scripts to do what you want.</p>\n</div>",
