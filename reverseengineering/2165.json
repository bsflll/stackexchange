Other functions are still available without the service start, like configuring or install under a different name. </p>\n<p>I'm trying to catch the network communications the malware is sending and receiving as soon as it starts as a service. If I attach to a running service/process with Immunity it already has sent the network packets and received, and I've missed what it has done with them. If I try to start it any other way I get the following error: <code>ERROR_FAILED_SERVICE_CONTROLLER_CONNECT</code> (00000427). </p>\n<p>Is there another way to go about this? Or some workaround? I'm fairly new to this so I certainly be missing some obvious.</p>\n</div>",

Perhaps you can figure out how to make it revert to being a normal app but then again that may not be possible. </p>\n<p>I think this will solve your packet monitoring problem though. It allows you to monitor packets per process unlike <a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">WireShark.</a> <a href=\"http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/smsniff.html\">SmartSniff</a> should also be able to do this job. Not sure but you might have to add the process column as it might not be displayed by default.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4865\">MicroSoft Network Monitor</a> should in theory be the best since it will be most integrated with the OS. And have access to more information a more portable tool like Wireshark would not.</p>\n</div>",

One piece of insight I would like to contribute is looking into the malware to see if there are any threads that are created that hold the functionality you wish to review. </p>\n<p>Oftentimes in my analysis, I've dealt with malware that runs as a service, but rather than go through some of the hoops you need to go through to launch a debugger when the service is invoked, I often have luck looking at the malware for a main thread that is spun off after initial criteria for the service startup is handled. Once I find the 'main', thread (assuming it exists and is standalone) I will just load the DLL/EXE in Olly, set my new origin on the thread start and proceed on with my debugging.</p>\n<p>End of day, its really just a different approach, but something to possibly consider if the situation presents itself. </p>\n</div>",
