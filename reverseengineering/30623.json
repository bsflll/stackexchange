    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I actually have two choices : <strong>C</strong> or <strong>Python</strong> to create my application.\nOn my application users will need a key (on start) to access it, the key will be verified with an algorythm on the user's computer. I'm searching for the best language to make the reverse more difficult. I know it's impossible to make an application 100% protected againt this.\nWhen looking for Python protection I saw this <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/22648/best-way-to-protect-source-code-of-exe-program-running-on-python\">question</a>, and so I'm wondering if <strong>C</strong> is better than <strong>Python</strong> for this kind of app.</p>\n</div>",
