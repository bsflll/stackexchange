If you want to create your own <code>libopcodes</code>-based disassembler that does this, the following article will help you get started: <a href=\"https://blog.yossarian.net/2019/05/18/Basic-disassembly-with-libopcodes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Basic disassembly with libopcodes</a>.</p>\n<p>GCC is a compiler toolchain, which performs preprocessing of the source file, translates source code to assembly, translates that to machine code, and then performs relocation via the link-editor, producing an ELF binary. It sounds like you are interested in going the other way, that is, disassembling object (binary) code. Therefore GCC is not relevant here.</p>\n<p>If you want to disassemble individual bytes, you can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/tree/master/bindings/python\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Capstone disassembly framework's Python bindings</a> to write scripts that disassemble the byte values that you specify. Here is an example:</p>\n<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python3\n\nfrom capstone import *\n\nCODE = b\"\\x55\"\n\nmd = md = Cs(CS_ARCH_X86, CS_MODE_32)\nfor i in md.disasm(CODE, 0x1000):\n    print(\"0x%x:\\t%s\\t%s\" %(i.address, i.mnemonic, i.op_str))\n</code></pre>\n<p>The output is <code>0x1000:  push    ebp</code></p>\n<p>When we consult the <a href=\"http://ref.x86asm.net/coder32.html#x50\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">x86 opcode table</a>, we see that a value of 0x50 + the register = <code>Push Word, Doubleword or Quadword Onto the Stack</code>. So if we change <code>0x55</code> to <code>0x54</code> the output becomes <code>0x1000:   push    esp</code> - a different register is pushed. <code>0x50</code> = <code>push    eax</code>. And so forth.</p>\n<p>Here is a modified version of the above script:</p>\n<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python3\n\nfrom capstone import *\n\nCODE = b\"\\x50\\x51\\x52\\x53\\x54\\x55\\x56\\x57\"\n\nmd = md = Cs(CS_ARCH_X86, CS_MODE_32)\nfor i in md.disasm(CODE, 0x1000):\n    print(\"0x%x:\\t%s\\t%s\" %(i.address, i.mnemonic, i.op_str))\n</code></pre>\n<p>This prints</p>\n<pre><code>0x1000: push    eax\n0x1001: push    ecx\n0x1002: push    edx\n0x1003: push    ebx\n0x1004: push    esp\n0x1005: push    ebp\n0x1006: push    esi\n0x1007: push    edi\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
