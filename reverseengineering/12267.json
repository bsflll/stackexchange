Well, because it's there. I've tried <a href=\"http://binwalk.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">binwalk</a>, but that's coming up blank:</p>\n<pre><code>$ binwalk apollo_fw4_full_p_1.1.32_nand.bin \n\nDECIMAL     HEX         DESCRIPTION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n$ \n</code></pre>\n<p>Likewise <a href=\"https://bitsum.com/firmware_mod_kit.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Firmware Mod Kit</a> fails:</p>\n<pre><code>$ ./extract-firmware.sh ../apollo_fw4_full_p_1.1.32_nand.bin \nFirmware Mod Kit (extract) 0.99, (c)2011-2013 Craig Heffner, Jeremy Collake\n\nPreparing tools ...\nScanning firmware...\n\nScan Time:     2016-03-21 15:05:55\nSignatures:    193\nTarget File:   /home/ob1/apollo_fw4_full_p_1.1.32_nand.bin\nMD5 Checksum:  b100590cbe030628d97e6d39c6f7fde8\n\nDECIMAL     HEX         DESCRIPTION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExtracting 0 bytes of  header image at offset 0\nERROR: No supported file system found!

Since the binary lacks common compression magic signatures, it is most likely to be encrypted.</p>\n<p>To decrypt the firmware you need to obtain more information about the product that uses this firmware. You can refer to <strong><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20190820225242/http://www.devttys0.com/2014/02/reversing-the-wrt120n-firmware-obfuscation/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a></strong> blog post for some ideas.</p>\n<p>As you say port 22 is open running a FTP service you can try connecting to it with default user/pass combos. You can try finding other open ports via nmap.</p>\n</div>",
