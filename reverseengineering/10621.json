Is there a plugin/script to quickly compare them and see their differences?</p>\n<p>P.S. I'm aware of the myriad of tools for doing binary diffing between two different binaries, for example for doing patch diffing . <em>This is not what I am looking for</em>.</p>\n</div>",

P.S. I know you're doing C#10; don't waste your time, those two functions are identical.</span>",
