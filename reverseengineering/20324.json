The flash size is 512KB   The processor was removed from a bad circuit board. Is there a way to read the flash after the MCU has been removed from the board.  Any help would be appreciated.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AkSe2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AkSe2.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
