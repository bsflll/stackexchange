    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm new in IDA Python, so the question is hard for me. I didn't find any solution in google, so I have to ask for the help there. During code analysis I found decryption function. There are about 1000 calls of this function with different arguments. The function takes one argument - encrypted string, which address is moved to eax before the calling.\nI'd like to write script for running the function for all encrypted strings. I find address of the function using idc.LocByName. Then I found all references to this function (using idautils.CodeRefsTo(addr, 1)). Now I to find the function's argument for each reference and call the function with this argument. \nCould you please advise the way I can do it?\nThanks.</p>\n</div>",
