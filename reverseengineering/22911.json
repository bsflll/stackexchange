    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I was trying to understand the <code>IsDebuggerPresent()</code> function exported by kernelbase.dll by importing the file on Ghidra. But Ghidra can't show me the proper disassembly or decompilation of function even though disassembly works fine in PE Bear? What could be the issue? I don't know if this is the proper place to post this so please guide me to a place if it isn't. Thanks!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RiU7s.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Ghidra Disassembly/Decompilation Output\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RiU7s.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CKEEh.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"PE Bear Disassembly Output\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CKEEh.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

Any idea why Ghidra won't do the disassembly automatically? This problem doesn't arise when I import kernel32.dll for example.</span>",
