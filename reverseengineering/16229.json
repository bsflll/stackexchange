    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I met the unknown (for me) method of anti-debugging today, while debugging in IDA Pro. This method delete fast all branches in file and the programm will look similar like on the image:<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/6VDNm.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/6VDNm.png\"/></a> </p>\n<p>Also many parts of code became unrecognized bytes, but I can fix this with Make Code command (only code, not branches). What it can be and how I can bypass this? The programm works fine after that, but I can't use breakpoints.</p>\n</div>",
