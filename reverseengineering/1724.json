The current DR source tree; however, does not contain DRK, despite the existence of a branch. DRK has yet to be open sourced, and U of T is actively doing kernel DBT research using DRK and a new DBT framework.</p>\n<p>If you are thinking of porting it yourself, the two main challenges are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interrupts and how they interact with the code cache. DRK took the \"direct port\" approach. For example, where DR uses thread-private code caches, DRK uses CPU-private code caches. This results in a lot of annoyances w.r.t. transparency and interrupts.</li>\n<li>What level of transparency you want. DR was designed with a lot of transparency in mind, and DRK kept that promise. My experience with kernel instrumentation so far has been that it is remarkably well-behaved (unless you care about a small portion of device drivers). Transparency on several fronts can be sacrificed, but this is more challenging within the general DR framework.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

This is the instrumentation created by me. Granary internally uses parts of DynamoRIO, but works rather differently. The goal of Granary is to make it easy to develop debugging and analysis tools. There will be a paper in HotDep'13 about one of the major memory debugging tools built on top of Granary.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/piyus/btkernel\">btkernel</a>, a recently released full kernel instrumentation system. You can find a paper about btkernel in SOSP'13.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
