But i never had any problems when i started the win32_remote.exe (or win64_remotex64.exe) server with admin privileges and told IDA to use the remote debugger, so this might work for you. I could imagine that even when your account is allowed to debug programs, it isn't allowed to debug programs that are running under an account that has privileges you don't have, because that ability would effectively give you unrestricted admin rights on the system.</span>",

Because there you get exactly this message  - at least in Windows - when you try to start the Ida remote server to debug a program without admin privilege:</p>\n<p>\"IDA Windows 64-bit remote debug server(MT) v1.15. Hex-Rays (c) 2004-2012\nCan not set debug privilege: Not all privileges or groups referenced are assigned to the caller.\"</p>\n<p>With 64 bit debugging this is relevant, as there the use of the remote server is mandatory, even when debugging locally. You must not forget to start it as administrator, otherwise you get the mentioned error message in the servers window. Trying to attach to a process anyway causes Ida to present the following message box:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aJFxR.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aJFxR.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>Tested in Ida 64-bit, V6.3</p>\n</div>",
