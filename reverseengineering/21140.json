In IDA help (press <code>F1</code>), under the <code>Problems List</code> header you have the list of possible problems encountered during analysis. In your case it seems to be <code>BADSTACK</code>, which means:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The value of the stack pointer at the end of the function is different\n          from its value at the start of the function. [...] The most probable cause is that stack tracing has failed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You will see each line causing this problem in the <code>List of problems</code> window.</p>\n<p>The description how to fix this problem is included in the IDA help as well, below the problem description.</p>\n</div>",
