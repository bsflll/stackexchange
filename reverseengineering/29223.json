    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have been reading through the API documentation <a href=\"https://hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idapython_docs/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and As far as I can tell there are three ways to wait for the analysis to finish.</p>\n<p><strong>get_auto_state</strong></p>\n<p><strong>auto_wait</strong></p>\n<p><strong>auto_is_ok</strong></p>\n<p>Looking at the API if get_auto_state() == AU_NONE then Analysis should be completed and if auto_is_ok() == 1 then analysis is completed. Also, from what I read auto_wait() should move forward when analysis is completed . I have tried all of these and none appear to work like I want. And I noticed that these events will be met when the IDA is pausing in part of analysis.</p>\n<p>I mean, if there is no way to accomplish this, then I would settle for a way to sort of activate the plugin when run is called normally and then have another part run from an event listener. Both of which appear to be documented poorly.</p>\n</div>",
