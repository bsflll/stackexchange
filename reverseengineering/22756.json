My purpose is to run a specific script that receives arguments via my main program against multiple files, but for some reason, it does not work for me. Sometimes it opens IDA without any reason.</p>\n<p>I am using the following commands:</p>\n<p>One command is: <code>'C:\\\\IDA\\\\ida.exe -B %s' % file</code></p>\n<p>Second command is: <code>cmd = 'C:\\\\IDA\\\\ida.exe -a- -A -S\"script.py \"%s\"\" %s' % (file, file)</code></p>\n</div>",

You're using the exact same type of quotes (<code>\"</code>) to denote two different things. You're attempting to quote the overall script+parameters, but you seem to also be quoting the parameter(s) with the same type of quotes. Not sure <i>how</i> you execute this (i.e. which Python module), but <code>cmd.exe</code> is likely going to have an issue telling these apart ... not to mention that file names with blank spaces will garble up the whole thing anyway.</span>",
