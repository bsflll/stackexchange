I am ignoring it because the file sizes seem fixed. (Also, for the images the <em>other</em> important data, its width and height, are not stored in the file.)</p>\n<h2>Palette</h2>\n<p>The palette is a 5 bits per channel BGR, with the highest bit unused. The two bytes are stored in little-endian order. Converting to True Color RGB is therefore a matter of bit shifting; you end up with 16 RGB color triplets.</p>\n<h2>Image</h2>\n<p>The image is stored in 16 x 16 blocks, each 8 x 8 pixels, and every two consecutive pixels are packed into a single byte, right pixel first. Every pixel value ranges from 0..15 and maps immediately to the palette.</p>\n<p>To unpack a single 8x8 block, all it takes is</p>\n<pre><code>for y in range(8):\n    for x in range(4):\n        print (img[4*y+x]])\n</code></pre>\n<p>which yields a series of 2-pixel data. I found it more convenient, below, to unpack each two nibbles immediately into 2 separate pixels; then it's a matter of looping over the right x and y axis to reassemble the entire image in a coherent, linear, 128x128 pixel bitmap.</p>\n<p>The code below then stores the RGB values for each pixel in a True-color PNG image; alternatively, you could save it as a palettized PNG image as well (or really any other image format you'd like).</p>\n<h2>Python 3.x code</h2>\n<p>This code needs <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pypng/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>pypng</code></a>. Adjust the fixed part of the path to your folder structure -- it should end with a slash. Save as <code>cookie2png.py</code> and call from a command line with</p>\n<pre><code>python cookie2png.py Rose/bu_strawberry_LZ.bin\\bu_strawberry_anger\n</code></pre>\n<p>i.e., leave off the parts <code>_pal.bin</code> and <code>_spr.bin</code> so the script can find them on its own.</p>\n<pre><code>import sys,png\nfrom struct import unpack\n\npath = \"/Sprites/Character files/\"\n# base = 'bu_strawberry2'\nbase = sys.argv[1]\n\nwith open (path+base+'_pal.bin', 'rb') as p:\n    pal = p.read()\n\npal = unpack('&lt;I16H', pal)[1:]\npal = [bin(p)[2:].zfill(15) for p in pal]\nrgb = [(int(p[10:15]+p[10:13],2),int(p[5:10]+p[5:8],2),int(p[0:5]+p[0:3],2)) for p in pal]\nprint ('rgb palette', *['%02x%02x%02x' % (r,g,b) for r,g,b in rgb])\n\nwith open (path+base+'_spr.bin', 'rb') as i:\n    img = i.read()\n\n# Strip header\nimg = img[4:]\n# Convert nibbles to bytes\nimg = [[b &amp; 0x0f,b &gt;&gt; 4] for b in img]\n# Unpack list\nimg = [b for a in img for b in a]\n\n# Linearize image\ntarget = []\nfor y in range(16):\n    for yy in range(8):\n        for x in range(16):\n            for xx in range(8):\n                target.append(rgb[img[16*64*y+64*x+8*yy+xx]])\n\n# Convert from palettized into True color\ntarget = [color for rgb in target for color in rgb]\n\n# Split into rows, required by pypng\ntarget = [target[i:i + 3*128] for i in range(0, len(target), 3*128)]\n\nw = png.Writer(128, 128, greyscale=False, bitdepth=8)\nwith open(path+base+'.png', 'wb') as f:\n    w.write(f, target)\n</code></pre>\n<p>and the results are as expected.

You can easily dump each <code>.bin</code> file and interpret it as sprite data. </p>\n<p>Back when I was writing my NES emulator, it had an extremely outdated way of handling sprites. It had a \"left side\" of the full list of sprites in the cartridge, which lies in <code>0x0000-0x1000</code> and then a \"right side\", which respectively lies in <code>0x1000-0x1FFF</code></p>\n<p>Example being in range <code>0x0000-0x0010</code> there would respectively lie the left side of some sprite (each side was 16-bytes long). You would combine those bytes in that portion with <code>0x1000-0x1010</code> which would be the right side of the sprite.</p>\n<p>Anyways, enough off-topic chatter. I just figured that would be interesting to you due to the similarities in structure. </p>\n<p>You'll want to extract each byte inside of each <code>.bin</code> file and store each one in a separate <code>std::uint8_t</code> array. Then you can use something like SFML to render the pixels as raw data. I used <code>sf::Texture::loadFromMemory</code> to go about doing this.</p>\n<p>If you want to raw rip the textures to image files. You'll have to convert the bytes in each <code>.bin</code> to a texture then output that texture as a <code>.bmp</code> file. </p>\n</div>",
