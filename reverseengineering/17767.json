Instead there are bunch of char comparisons spread across this binary.</p>\n<p>Like this one:</p>\n<pre><code>CMP BYTE PTR SS:[ESP+25], 40\n</code></pre>\n<p>Gather those together (there should be some above the part that you've pased) and sort by the index (ESP+<strong>xx</strong>). Converting the values after the comma (in this case 40) to ascii and printing them should give you the 'X'. </p>\n<p>For the image we have:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>hac__h___rad_$E</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
