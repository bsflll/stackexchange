    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>When I place my cursor on an instruction (on the address, opcode or operand) in the IDA-view, and switch immediately to HEX-view, I expected the hex bytes corresponding to the instructions to be selected. However, IDA 7.0.171130 (x86_64) is not behaving as expected.</p>\n<p>As an example, I have selected the address <code>0x8000328</code> in the IDA view (the cursor is not visible in the screenshot) which is a <code>mov</code> instruction. However, the HEX-view shows <code>E8 D9 04 00 00</code> highlighted with the cursor on it; which is a <code>call</code> instruction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IjAig.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IjAig.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uts7n.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uts7n.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
