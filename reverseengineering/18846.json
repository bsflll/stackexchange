What you could do is to close <code>Registers</code> and some other frames that you do not use at the moment thus creating more space for the registers. To close the section, move to it with <kbd>TAB</kbd> and then close with <kbd>X</kbd>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ac0r7.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ac0r7.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

Also, y-size gets spread evenly when y-split line is moved. Looks like there's currently no solution. I probably have to work more with the cmdline instead then.</span>",
