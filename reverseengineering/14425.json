Also, I am using another in-house tool for the same analysis that, too, exposes Python API. My intention is to augment the script such that when it is run within IDA, it'll run IDA specific methods and when it is run outside IDA, it has to call the method specific to the in-house tool. Does IDAPython provide any special environment variable to detect if a Python script is running inside IDA environment?</p>\n</div>",
