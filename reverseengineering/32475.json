    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've downloaded JEB CE (community edition) and according to the <a href=\"https://www.pnfsoftware.com/jeb/#features-matrix\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">feature matrix</a>, it supports both script and plugin functionality:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Th6bK.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Th6bK.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I would like to know if there is any difference in the 2 and any advantage of using one over the other? In version 5.X+, there is a /coreplugins folder which shows plugins written in both Python and Java:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iCuu7.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iCuu7.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>A Java plugin :</p>\n<pre><code>import com.pnfsoftware.jeb.core.Version;\nimport com.pnfsoftware.jeb.core.units.code.asm.decompiler.ast.opt.AbstractCOptimizer;\n\n/**\n * A sample gendec AST optimizer plugin.\n * \n * @author Nicolas Falliere\n *\n */\npublic class COptSampleJava extends AbstractCOptimizer {\n\n    public COptSampleJava() {\n        super();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int perform() {\n        logger.debug(\"COptSampleJava: the optimizer is running\");\n        return 0;\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>would look identical to the Python version</p>\n<pre><code>from com.pnfsoftware.jeb.core.units.code.asm.decompiler.ast.opt import AbstractCOptimizer\n\n'''\nSkeleton for an Java Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) optimizer plugin for gendec, JEB's generic decompiler.\nThis Python plugin is executed during the decompilation pipeline of a method.\n\nHow to use:\n- Drop this file in your JEB's coreplugins/scripts/ sub-directory\n- Make sure to have the setting `.LoadPythonPlugins = true` in your JEB's bin/jeb-engines.cfg file\n\nFor additional information regarding dexdec AST optimizer plugins, refer to:\n- the Manual (www.pnfsoftware.com/jeb/manual)\n- the API documentation: TODO\n'''\nclass COptSamplePython(AbstractCOptimizer):\n  # note: Python script optimizers are singleton instances!\n  # the engine will instantiate and provide a single instance for all decompilation threads\n  # therefore, if you are using object attributes, make sure to provide support for concurrency\n  # (this restriction does not apply to Java script optimizers, as well as full-blown jar optimizers;\n  # each decompilation thread has its own unique instance of such optimizer objects)\n  # for this reason (as well as others), moderately complex AST optimizers should be written in Java\n\n  def __init__(self):\n    self.logger.debug('COptSamplePython: instantiated')\n\n  def perform(self):\n    self.logger.debug('COptSamplePython: executed')\n\n    # if a value &gt;0 is returned, the decompiler will assume that AST is being transformed and this AST optimizer will be called again\n    return 0  # no optimization is performed\n</code></pre>\n<p>Can both languages be used for both plugin and script?</p>\n</div>",
