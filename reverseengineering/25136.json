Does anyone know what is the name of this kind of access and where can I read more about it?</p>\n</div>",

Usually the <code>add</code> instruction after the call results in <code>ebx</code> gettng the value of the GOT (Global offset table) so that external calls can be done without extra setup (the PLT stubs for external calls in PIC executables assume that <code>ebx</code> points to the GOT), but also global data can be addressed using a fixed offset relative to the GOT. This way the code can run regardless of the actual address at which it has been loaded by the OS (i.e. it is position independent).</p>\n</div>",
