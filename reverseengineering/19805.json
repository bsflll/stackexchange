    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a floppy disk image which I am trying to load with Bochs Emulator.</p>\n<p>It is from a CTF challenge and can be downloaded from here: <a href=\"http://squarectf.com/2017/floppy.img\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://squarectf.com/2017/floppy.img</a></p>\n<p>I am using Bochs version 2.3.9 on Windows 7 x64</p>\n<p>I started Bochs.exe and configured the memory and disk settings as shown below:</p>\n<p>Memory options:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HjvEp.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HjvEp.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Disk and Boot options:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4dYKf.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4dYKf.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>However, when I start the emulator, it gives the following error:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1xUyl.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1xUyl.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I have seen a writeup online for this CTF that describes the same method for loading the disk image and it worked.</p>\n<p>Please let me know why it does not work for me.</p>\n<p>Note: I am able to load the disk image using qemu-system-x86_64 or qemu-system-i386 on Linux already. However, I want to understand why I cannot load it with Bochs.</p>\n<p>I even tried the method of creating a bochsrc file and loading it using bochsdbg.exe as shown below:</p>\n<pre><code>bochsdbg.exe -f bochsrc -q\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, I still get an error while loading it.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I am able to load the image in Bochs emulator by selecting floppy as the boot device under Boot options.</p>\n<p>However, I cannot load the image using bochsdbg.exe. Below is my bochsrc.txt file:</p>\n<pre><code>romimage: file=$BXSHARE/BIOS-bochs-latest\nvgaromimage: file=$BXSHARE/VGABIOS-lgpl-latest\nmegs: 16\nata0: enabled=1, ioaddr1=0x1f0, ioaddr2=0x3f0, irq=14\nata0-master: type=disk, path=\"floppy.img\", mode=flat, cylinders=2, heads=16, spt=63\nboot: floppy\n</code></pre>\n<p>And I get the following error message:</p>\n<pre><code>Bochs is exiting with the following message:\n[      ] bochsrc.txt:5: ataX-master/slave: unknown type 'floppy'\n</code></pre>\n<p>The reason I want to have a proper bochsrc file is because I want to use IDA Pro to debug the boot sector.</p>\n</div>",

While I am able to get it working using the Bochs GUI, I still cannot get it to load properly using bochsdbg.exe. I have updated my question with my bochsrc file. Please have a look and let me know if it works for you.</span>",

When I renamed it to something else, it worked. In your example, you're naming it to <code>floppy.img</code>, so you could try something else.</p>\n<p>It's a bit of a guess, but seems like bochs doesn't like files with reserved words, like disk or floppy.</p>\n</div>",
