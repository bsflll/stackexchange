I have been getting the below error while trying to debug. I googled around and found the Microsoft no longer offers symbols exe as downloads and we need to link the MS symbols server in windbg. I tried that route too, but still failed to get rid of this error.</p>\n<p>ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.  Defaulted to export symbols for ntdll.dll - \nntdll!DbgBreakPoint</p>\n<p>Is there a way I can download the symbols for windows xp sp3 on to my local machine and then run the windbg.</p>\n</div>",
