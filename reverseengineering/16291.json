But it needs a rooted phone, and it will most probably disable SSL on every app and connection. And for security purposes, I'd like to avoid this solution.  I've read many papers from researchers, going through certificate pinning on Tinder, and there's no mention of a tampering check, or needs for an external things. That's why I concluded that it's either out of date, or the most probable one, is that I'm not skilled enough since I'm a beginner.</span>",
