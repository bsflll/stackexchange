The image below is two functions when I load <code>bootaa64.efi</code> to IDA.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QQNQO.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"ida\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QQNQO.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I'm not really good at ARM64 assembly but I recognized these functions are just forever loops.</p>\n<p>The code stuck in that loop means <em>somehow</em> the function is called. But IDA just show two xref, one is the function call itself (loop) and the other is <code>.pdata</code> xref:</p>\n<p>I want to know what called these functions.

You need to inspect system registers to determine the cause of the exception and where it happened. See the ARM manuals for more information.</p>\n</div>",
