I am still learning from your wonderful contributions, help and guidance.</p>\n<p>I have had an app that i want to study in-depth. How the the it is constructed? What components that are used? And the like.</p>\n<p>I did some decompiling operations with different tools and I get different results. What confuses me is that when I decompile with jadx (online one) I get java extension files, resource and so on but i do also see .dex file 1&amp;2. I don't know if the obfsucation was done on particular parts (3rd party) or what?</p>\n<p>What do you think guys? Does the proguard can be applied on certain parts in the app or as a whole.</p>\n<p>I can share with you the apk file and the results too.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance and have a good day.</p>\n</div>",
