It's very easy to use it - just make first shot of the registry before you launch your app and then second shot (after say 3-5 minutes) and then press <em>compare</em>-button. <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/regshot/\" rel=\"nofollow\">regshot</a> will make a report about registry keys/values that have been opened, added, deleted.</p>\n</div>",
