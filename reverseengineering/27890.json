    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to reverse engineer a raw binary image from an nrf24le1 SoC that (I think) has been compiled with the Keil toolchain.  Specifically, I see that C functions in this image usually expect their arguments in r7/r5/r3 as described <a href=\"https://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/c51/c51_ap_parampassreg.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and that the return value lives in r7.  The behavior I'm seeing is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ghidra thinks that every function in this image takes 0 parameters, even if it's obvious that the function is immediately looking at r7 for its first argument</li>\n<li>Ghidra thinks the return value lives in ACC</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have to manually override this for every function.  I would like for Ghidra to automatically figure out when a function has arguments based on the Keil ABI.</p>\n<p>By contrast, when I run Ghidra on a raw arm32 binary, it notices when a function looks for arguments in r0/r1/r2/... and it adjusts the function declaration accordingly.  So Ghidra behaves correctly for arm32, but incorrectly for 8051.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to fix this (or is there a better tool I should be using instead of Ghidra)?</p>\n</div>",
