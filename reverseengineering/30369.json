    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So, there is a PLC and a SoftMaster program to work with it. The PLC works according to the XGFenet protocol.\nWhen connecting to the PLC for the first time in SoftMaster, a password must be entered. And I caught this whole process using Wireshark.</p>\n<p>At the very beginning, we send a message like this to the PLC:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/m92Ir.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/m92Ir.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>where 41 44 is a request for a specific session key.</p>\n<p>With the next package we get:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/cH9fl.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/cH9fl.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>The PLC sent us a set of bytes. It is these bytes that are causing this question. More details further.</p>\n<p>We enter the password <em>qwerty</em> and it will be converted to</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VkCDK.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VkCDK.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Obviously, the bytes sent in the second packet encrypted our password in this form.\nAnd after that we get <em>correct password</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/M4uDC.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/M4uDC.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Question: how did the bytes sent in the second packet encrypt our password to this form?</p>\n<p>I experimented and wrote a script to request this session key multiple times. All the bytes sent differed by about 1000 units, respectively, something like a time or a countdown is sent to us and the password is encrypted based on it.</p>\n<p>If you do not know the answer, advise what other experiments can be done to understand what it is or in what direction to study. Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>UPD</strong></p>\n<p>The password length is limited by SoftMaster and you cannot enter more than 8 characters. But, even if the password consists of one character, the encrypted password does not differ in length from eight characters. Similar to hashing.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples:</p>\n<p>Password <em>A</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/T4f5e.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/T4f5e.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Password <em>AA</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n8kCO.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n8kCO.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Password <em>AAA</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/A0i3F.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/A0i3F.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>And here is the same password <em>qwerty</em> entered with a difference of a couple of seconds</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KIb0t.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KIb0t.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DXQUr.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DXQUr.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>But there is nothing strange here. Before each entry, a new session key is requested and these two identical passwords are encrypted with different keys.</p>\n<p>Using ProcessMonitor, I checked the services that are called during password entry and validation. Maybe there's a hint here</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FC7cU.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FC7cU.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
