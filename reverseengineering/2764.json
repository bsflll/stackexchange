The user interface has menus with buttons and other UI components.

Are there tools to help analyze and find those locations?</p>\n</div>",

It doesn't actually have any native 'button' classes, all of the drawing on the screen is controlled by DirectX, but any user interface is built by the programmers, or the programmers of the UI framework. There is no silver bullet here, unfortunately. You <i>might</i> be able to find the default/main message loop (ala WndProc) and set a conditional break on a mouse event, like a button press.</span>",
