I could extract them successfully using decompress-assemblies.</p>\n<p>Is there anyway I can compress them again into assemblies.blob file or at least modify the APK to allow loading the the extracted DLL like older Xamarin APKs?</p>\n<p>I seem to have found that the application checks for application_config.have_assembly_store value, if it's true, it only continues if there's an assembly blob. Any idea how to change this value inside the APK?</p>\n</div>",
