I was using nvim as the hex edior</p>\n</div>",

In any case, this question is impossible to answer. We have 3 lines of assembly code and the knowledge that if you invert a jump, the program spits out a message that it didn't produce before you patched it. What answer are you looking for beyond \"you altered the logic of the program, and its behavior changed as a result\"?</span>",
