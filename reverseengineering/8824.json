The ELF binaries may possibly come from embedded Linux systems, that is, the library should not be irritated by MIPS, ARM and other non-x86 architectures.</p>\n<p>What I have considered: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/eliben/pyelftools\" rel=\"noreferrer\">pyelftools</a> (my currently favored option)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/crackinglandia/pylibelf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">pylibelf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/pydevtools/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">pydevtools</a></li>\n<li>Also an option: using a C library and ctypes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do I have forgotten something?\nWhich of the above options would you prefer? </p>\n<p>For those who had some practical experience with pylibelf or pydeftools: These seem no longer updated (last commit: 2013 and 2012), are they mature enough?</p>\n</div>",

It can parse file formats (see <a href=\"http://radare.today/parsing-a-fileformat-with-radare2/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> for an example of parsing the ELF header).</p>\n<p>Radare2 supports multiple architectures and is being actively developed. On top of that it has bindings for a lot of languages, including Python of course. Read through the <a href=\"https://github.com/radare/radare2-bindings\" rel=\"noreferrer\">bindings source code</a> to see it is pretty straightforward to script it.</p>\n<p>HTH!</p>\n</div>",

Have you tried one of the mentioned libraries whose main/only objective is to parse ELF files? In case their parsing capabilities are as good the ones of Radare2, I would prefer a more light-weight solution ...</span>",
