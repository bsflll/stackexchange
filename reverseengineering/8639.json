    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Compilers often optimize variables usage, so multiple variables in the source code can be mapped to the same register (or stack variable) in the resulting assembly.</p>\n<p>I know that registers can be renamed within a start and end addresses in the assembly view in IDA, but what about hex-rays decompiler? Can I give a name to a variable only in a part of the decompiled function, and some other in another part?</p>\n</div>",

This plugin is filled with features which will make your life easier and small nuances you wish were present in IDA.</p>\n</div>",
