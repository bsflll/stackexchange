    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a problem with API-Monitor.</p>\n<p>When I try to capture data (here: network traffic), API-Monitor doesn't log the buffer from the recieved data. For send() it works well, but for recv() it doesn't show the buffer. I really don't know why this is happening. Both buffers reside in a valid memory space before and after the call.</p>\n<p>I think its either because API-Monitor doesn't recogonize the size of the buffer and therefore doesn't capture the content or it only monitors const char* types of buffers (idk why but thats the difference between the singature of the two functions).</p>\n<p>Here are some images:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/v3gYz.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/v3gYz.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>it works with send(). It logs all the data that was sent</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/557R0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/557R0.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>and here it says \"Not Avaliable\". Nothing shows up in the buffer-viewer. The return-value ist 5 so we can be sure that actually data was written into the buffer.</p>\n</div>",

Now I changed the length of the buffer to Length (length of the buffer passed) instead of PostLength (length of the return value). Somehow API-Monitor has a problem when logging a buffer after the call.</span>",
