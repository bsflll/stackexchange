Figured out how to install plugins, but I want to run a script for specific program to help me with the reverse. It seems like I need script loader. Tried installing Ollyscript, but that came up with error for missing .dlls</p>\n<p>My question is: Can you please recommend any other script loader for Olly and if possible with installation guide for it.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advanced.</p>\n</div>",
