It could put it anywhere on the stack, or even eliminate it entirely (for example, hold it in a register). There's a reason that mitigations like these are implemented inside of the compiler itself and not as source-level transformations.</p>\n</div>",

You have no contract with the compiler regarding any modifications you might want to make to the size and contents of the stack frame. If you were to attempt something like that, you can expect it to break constantly. Examples would include stack-based parameter passing on x64 and unwind funclets referencing parameters via the wrong stack base address. The proper way to do this is via modifications to the compiler.</span>",
