Then, a simple <code>push</code> will overwrite the saved <code>rip</code>.</p>\n<p>As you can notice on the first picture, your saved <code>rip</code> is at <code>0x5561dca8</code> and, your <code>rsp</code> as well. Therefore, a <code>push</code> operation will store the address of the <code>touch3</code> function as return address of the stack-frame.</p>\n<p>Nothing really difficult here.</p>\n</div>",
