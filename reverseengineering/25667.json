    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm relatively new to firmware reverse engineering but it has been a very interesting journey, loved it!</p>\n<p>I am currently trying to crack open the firmware of my Panasonic Lumix DC-G9 camera to see if I can bypass a recording limit. However, it seems like they did a great job of encrypting the firmware.</p>\n<p>You can download the .bin firmware file <a href=\"https://av.jpn.support.panasonic.com/support/share2/eww/com/dsc/fts/zip/G9___V22.zip\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I tried Binwalk, but the output only shows one entry, which might be a false positive:</p>\n<pre><code>DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n26453361      0x193A571       gzip compressed data, has header CRC, has 28967 bytes of extra data, last modified: 2052-10-14 16:14:25 (bogus date)\n</code></pre>\n<p>I tried extracting that, but <code>gunzip</code> only reports that the header checksum is not equal to the computed checksum. So could still be a false positive.</p>\n<p>I also tried to plot out the entropy of the firmware:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YTYq3.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Entropy plot\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YTYq3.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Seems encrypted to me? Next step was to check if I could read any hints of the basic <code>strings</code> command:</p>\n<pre><code>MC471\npanasonic\nMC471\nloader1\nloader2\nloader3\nprogram\nstorage\npostboot1\npostboot2\npostboot3\npostboot4\npostboot5\ndram_sleep\neep_ow_a\neep_ow_b\neep_adj\neep_fix\nmusic\nosdover\nosddata\nkoutei_kao\navchd_info\neep_net_a\neep_net_b\neep_act_a\neep_act_b\nzboot\nzimage\nrootfs1\nrootfs2\napu0_data_i\napu0_data_e\napu0_code_i\napu0_code_e\nusbcharge\nipu_data\nipu_code\nrc_data\nrc_code\nnr_data\nnr_code\nhm_c_prog\n</code></pre>\n<p>Seems like <code>zboot</code> is the bootloader?</p>\n<p>Since I'm still pretty new, are there any hints on how I could progress on this? I really hope it's not cracking open the camera and trying to debug any hardware ROM which stores the keys!</p>\n</div>",

You could do this by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>finding the type of processor / microcontroller / system-on-chip and checking for the reset vector (try searching for product approvals, e.g. from the FCC, which might contain interior images).</li>\n<li>scanning the file for known byte sequences associated with code, for example function prologues.</li>\n<li>reading the manual for the potential boot loader and looking for code associated with it. For example the linker file might identify where initialisation code lives.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This would enable analysis of the overall code structure, which is likely compressed or encrypted if your entropy graph is correct.</p>\n<p>Depending on how firmware updates are delivered it’s possible this file is encrypted and would be decrypted by the microcontroller.</p>\n<p>This could happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>during update, if the existing firmware decrypts and validates the update before writing to flash.</li>\n<li>on boot, if the target system supports encrypted firmware.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In both of these cases it’s much harder to analyse the system. You’d typically need a combination of hardware hacking and firmware reverse engineering to make progress.</p>\n</div>",
