I have looked at <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60273639/obtaining-a-list-of-3rd-party-libraries-used-by-an-android-apk\">this</a> answer but this is too vague.</p>\n<p>I can use tools such as Libradar etc. but these tools require that I provide a database of all the TPL's to find whether the TPL is existing in the app. Any other manual way to find all the TPL's which exist in the Android app as I'm interested only in finding the TPL's in a single app.</p>\n</div>",

Therefore a library could simply wait for the permissions requested by other parts of the app and then access the data without requesting the permission itself. Therefore you should search for API methods that require specific permission rather than code parts that request a permission.</span>",

In that case, you'll have to look for a way to remove those protections\nfirst, and APKiD will help you in first step of figuring out what exactly you're fighting against.</p>\n</div>",
