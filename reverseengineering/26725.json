    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am using the following IDC script in IDA:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;idc.idc&gt;\n\nstatic main()\n{   \n    for (i=0; i&lt;10; i++)\n    {                           \n        PauseProcess();\n        \n        GetDebuggerEvent(WFNE_SUSP, -1);\n        Message(\"%s\\n\", GetFunctionName(ScreenEA()));\n            \n        ResumeProcess();    \n\n        //Sleep(50);                      //does not work, see remarks below\n        //GetDebuggerEvent(WFNE_SUSP, 1); //same\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The main idea is to pause/resume process at regular intervals and check what is the current function (for profiling purposes).</p>\n<p>What I am searching for is a IDC function that will pause the script for a given amount of time (eg : 50ms) while the process will be still running. A function that would resume debugged process execution from a suspended state and run code for a given amount of time will be OK too.</p>\n<p>What I have tried so far :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>Sleep(time)</code> : does not works as expected as it stop the execution of the debugged process as well (which is not what I want). I would like process to continue running while script is waiting.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>GetDebuggerEvent(WFNE_SUSP, 1)</code> : idea is wait for suspend event (which will never happen) and use timeout (set to 1 second here). It works but the issue is time is specified in seconds which is a too big interval (it would have been OK if I could specify it in milliseconds).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
