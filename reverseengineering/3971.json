    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I was debugging a simple x86-64 program in Visual Studio 2010 and I noticed that the <code>main</code> function preamble is different from the GNU GCC compiled version of the same C program.</p>\n<p>To illustrate what I mean here is the C code for the <code>main</code> function:</p>\n<pre><code>int main() {\n  int a,b,c;\n  a=1;\n  b=2;\n  c=proc(a,b);\n  return c;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Visual Studio 2010 disassembly of the <code>main</code> function <strong>preamble</strong> for the  VC++ version is:</p>\n<pre><code>01211410  push        ebp  \n01211411  mov         ebp,esp  \n01211413  sub         esp,0E4h  \n01211419  push        ebx  \n0121141A  push        esi  \n0121141B  push        edi  \n0121141C  lea         edi,[ebp-0E4h]  \n01211422  mov         ecx,39h  \n01211427  mov         eax,0CCCCCCCCh  \n0121142C  rep stos    dword ptr es:[edi]\n</code></pre>\n<p>The rest of the function code of the VC++ version is:</p>\n<pre><code>0081141E  mov         dword ptr [a],1  \n00811425  mov         dword ptr [b],2  \n0081142C  mov         eax,dword ptr [b]  \n0081142F  push        eax  \n00811430  mov         ecx,dword ptr [a]  \n00811433  push        ecx  \n00811434  call        proc (81114Fh)  \n00811439  add         esp,8  \n0081143C  mov         dword ptr [c],eax  \n0081143F  mov         eax,dword ptr [c]  \n00811442  pop         edi  \n00811443  pop         esi  \n00811444  pop         ebx  \n00811445  add         esp,0E4h  \n0081144B  cmp         ebp,esp  \n0081144D  call        @ILT+300(__RTC_CheckEsp) (811131h)  \n00811452  mov         esp,ebp  \n00811454  pop         ebp  \n00811455  ret \n</code></pre>\n<p>The disassembly of the <code>main</code> function <strong>preamble</strong> for the GCC compiled version is:</p>\n<pre><code>00400502  push   rbp\n00400503  mov    rbp,rsp\n00400506  sub    rsp,0x10\n</code></pre>\n<p>The rest of the <code>main</code> function code of the GCC version is:</p>\n<pre><code>004004e8  mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc],0x1\n004004ef  mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x2\n004004f6  mov    edx,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]\n004004f9  mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc]\n004004fc  mov    esi,edx\n004004fe  mov    edi,eax\n00400500  call   0x4004cc &lt;proc&gt;\n00400505  mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],eax\n00400508  mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]\n0040050b  leave\n0040050c  ret\n</code></pre>\n<p>The same disassembly is given by <code>objdump</code> version 2.22.90.20120924.</p>\n<p>I realize that the first 3 instructions for both preambles do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Save old EBP (later needed to remove stack frame)</li>\n<li>Top of old stack frame becomes EBP of new frame</li>\n<li>Reserve space for local variables. The function has 3 integer local variables.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> What is the purpose of 4th instruction in the VC++ version? I see its saving EBX, but why? It never uses it afterwards.</p>\n<p>For the remaining instructions of the VC++ version preamble, I relized that it initializes  <code>39h</code> dwords with the value <code>0CCCCCCCCh</code>. Which makes sense because <code>39h * 4h = 0E4h</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Why is this space initialized with the value <code>0CCCCCCCCh</code>? Is this value better than <code>00000000h</code> in some way?</p>\n<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> Why does the VC++ version allocate <code>0E4h</code> bytes for 3 local variables? Is this number random? If not, how is it computed?</p>\n<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> Is this space used for something else beside local variables? If yes, for what?</p>\n</div>",
