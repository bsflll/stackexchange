You need to specify a number prefix if you want to stick with decimal (<code>0n</code> ; e.g. <code>0n17</code>) or use the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debuggercmds/n--set-number-base-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>n</code></a> command to change the default radix. Best way to not deal with this kind of errors is to always prefix your numbers with <code>0x</code> even if you know the default radix is 16.</span>",
