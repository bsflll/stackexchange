    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am currently reverse engineering a piece of 16-bit software (originally written in C/C++ from what I can gather).</p>\n<p>I have identified a function that seems to print text to the console. The text to be printed is passed into the function as a parameter, however Ghidra doesn't seem to be handling the strings properly.</p>\n<p>The function is decompiled as follows:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/U5YR2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"PrintToConsole Decompilation\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/U5YR2.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>The assembly for this function is:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8NvTu.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"PrintToConsole Assembly\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8NvTu.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>So Ghidra picks up on the string, however when I attempt to double-click it (to go to it's relevant location), the following error appears:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HydAI.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Invalid Address Error\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HydAI.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>This is making identifying where strings are utilised extremely hard, as I cannot search for where a string is utilised within the program's code. I don't understand how Ghidra can pickup part of the name of the string, but won't then let me click through to it?</p>\n<p>I also seem to be getting a lot of global variables names like this in the disassembly:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IQxJm.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Global Variables with Unfamiliar Naming\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IQxJm.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>And when I go to rename them, I get the following error:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jES0D.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Rename Failed Error\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jES0D.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I have no idea if these two issues are related or not?</p>\n<p>Any suggestions?</p>\n<p>Thanks,\nJames.</p>\n</div>",

Merging the blocks has now solved this issue, however I still don't seem to be able to double click on the string values in the decompilation.</span>",
