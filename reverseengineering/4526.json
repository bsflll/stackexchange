(I was thinking it was an at24c1024b because some are marked ATMLH) but after a while I found that \"ATMLH\" AND the line below define the identifier... AT10C1024B: ATMLH / 2B1 AT25128B : ATMLH / 5DB these two share ATMLH on his markings numbers but are different devices... just google the two lines plus atmel.. cheers! from Argentine rep</span>",

Given the size of the chip and context which you provided, I figured it was probably a serial EEPROM. Looking through Atmel's serial EEPROM datahsheets, your mystery chip is almost certainly an Atmel AT25128B-SSHL SPI EEPROM, which matches your chip's product markings and pinout.</p>\n<p>According to the AT25128B <a href=\"http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc8698.pdf\">datasheet</a>, the first line should be ATHXXX, where XXX is a three digit date code. In your case, \"ATH330\" means it was made in the 30th week of 2013.</p>\n<p>The second line contains the product's truncated part number (truncated part numbers are used when the entire part number is too long to fit on the package) and country of assembly. The truncated part number for the AT25128B is \"5DBL\", which from the picture looks reasonably like what is printed on your chip, and the trailing \"8\" identifies the country of assembly (I don't know what country \"8\" corresponds to, but its probably somewhere in Asia :)).</p>\n<p>The last line is the Atmel lot number.</p>\n</div>",

If not, it <em>could</em> be an SPI or even i2c flash of some kind, maybe used for, perhaps, a MAC address.  The test points would then be used to write the hypothetical MAC address; but you would then expect to see at least some of those same lines connected to the rest of the circuit</p>\n<p>So what you could try is to lookup the datasheets of other common 8-pin flash chips and see if any of the pinouts line up with what you have observed.</p>\n</div>",
