    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>As you know, OllyDbg provides labelling. When I see referenced address which assembly code has, I would get information(Label name) if referenced address is labeled.\nBut If labeled address would be referenced indirectly(e.g. mov eax, dword ptr[eax]) or labelled address is stack, OllyDbg cannot show label to reverser. (also, Status bar which is below CPU cannot show label too)\nIs there other way to view label in OllyDbg? It's too hard to analyze obfuscated code because of this poooor behavior</p>\n</div>",
