My questions are:<br/> 1.Is there any window which would show function list like in IDA? To be more spesific here is what I'm talking <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UZhnS.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">about</a>. How to bring such window in Olly?<br/>\n2. During investigation if I jump into some function(static analysis) how to get back? I mean is there anything that has same functionality as \n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2HTQG.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">these</a> keys do?<br/>\nSorry if questions sound silly I'm new with this stuff. thanks :)</p>\n</div>",
