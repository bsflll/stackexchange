Or is there any scripts that do the same thing i told?</p>\n</div>",

I'd like to explain why and how if there is a solution for it, it is probably going to be very very slow.</p>\n<p>A debugger does not actually know all the register values at every single point in the program. It doesn't know <em>any</em> register values until a debug break. So if any breakpoint triggers, it will be able to read those values and act on them (hence conditional breakpoints on a specific address).</p>\n<p>That means if you want to know if a register has a certain value at any time during execution, you will probably have to single step the whole program. That is, execute one instruction, break, read values, execute one instruction, break, read values, ...</p>\n<p>That's what a run trace usually does but I never used them due to speed. You may want to look around OllyDbg's trace features to see if it offers what you need but know it's probably going to be really slow.</p>\n</div>",
