    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>i have been trying to use IDA to make a breakpoints on a 4 byte memory address \nto find out what arm op code writes to it . yet it fails to set a breakpoint and gives me this message \" Xscale support only 1 byte length hardware breakpoints\"</p>\n<p>am using it on rooted mobile Samsung galaxy S6 , Armv8 \nserver connection is fine i can live edit values and functions also set a break point on functions ( 1 byte op code ) it works fine  .</p>\n<p>so i guess that either am doing something wrong or debugger is limited . \nplease note that am new to arm debugging o just want to find the op code that writes to this address for an android game . </p>\n<p>thank you much appreciated . </p>\n</div>",
