    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have been having a really strange issue which I have tried all ways to troubleshoot from my end but was not successful.</p>\n<p>I am going through a malware analysis course and following the debugging process of the trainer in the video, when I am trying to debug the same malware on my system, I am not able to hit the same break points as him.</p>\n<p>I am using x32Dbg for debugging.</p>\n<p>The following are some examples of the issue -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>The API CreateProcessInternalW hits for him but never hits for me in any malware sample.</li>\n<li>The API WriteProcessMemory hits for him but never hits for me in any malware sample.</li>\n<li>On stepping over VirtualAlloc breakpoint, for him the API is VirtualAllocEx and for me its NtAllocateVirtualMemory</li>\n<li>On stepping over VirtualProtect breakpoint, for him the API is VirtualProtectEx and for me its zwprotectvirtualmemory</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The following are the things I have tried -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>I have made sure that the tutor and me are running the same operating system (Windows 10)</li>\n<li>I have tried to use both 64bit and 32bit versions of Windows 10</li>\n<li>I have made sure I have the same malware sample as the malware samples are provided by the tutor himself and also I have verified the hash of the malware.</li>\n<li>I have made sure the difference is not being caused by a Anti-Analysis mechanism of the malware</li>\n<li>I have verified the above point by analysing the malware behaviour and found that the malware is being executed the same way as it is for him</li>\n<li>Like for one case for a malware, for the tutor the malware was using the CreateProcessInternalW API to call cmd.exe and drop a file in a directory, for me the API doesn't hit but the file is still dropped.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am not sure what is causing this difference of API calls and trying to fix this issue.</p>\n<p>Help would be appreciated.</p>\n</div>",
