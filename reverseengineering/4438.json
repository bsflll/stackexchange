    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I wanted to know if one can see old register values in Ollydbg in the register window. I mean, for example, I have the register value of <code>eax</code> like <code>eax=12345678</code>. And, now, let say that I go to the next instruction, and then to next instruction and so on... Lets also say, that <code>eax</code> is changing all the time and after a couple of instructions and changements of <code>eax</code>. </p>\n<p>I want to know the former value of <code>eax</code>, namely <code>eax=1234568</code>, how can I do that in Ollydbg ?</p>\n</div>",
