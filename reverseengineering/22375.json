    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've come across an SQLite database (gmm_storage.db) used by Google Maps on Android, and I'm unsure as to how the data it contains is serialised. For example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IVFtq.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Blob extracted from Google Maps Android database\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IVFtq.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I'm saying serialised, as from the header 0xACED it appears to be a Java serialised object.  However, as I have no idea what the serialised class actually looks like, I've been unable to deserialise it.</p>\n<p>I'm also not entirely sure it's standard Java serialisation, as I've tried a number of different tools, and Java itself,  and all of them report that the stream is corrupt.</p>\n<p>You can see some references to standard Java classes, such as java/util/Set, but also a lot of smaller references to things like 'fic', or 'vot'.  I'm guessing these are either obfuscated class names, or they are part of some kind of lookup/offset table.</p>\n<p>My other guess is that as it's a Google product, it's probably using a Google serialisation library, like GSON or protobuf, but the data doesn't look like either of those.</p>\n<p>Anyone come across this before, or can shine some light on it?</p>\n</div>",
