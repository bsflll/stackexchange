Most of the time those pages have links to the slides and/or recordings from that year.\n<ul>\n<li>You can sometimes find missing stuff by googling the name of the talk; often the author will have posted the slides themselves. There are also various YouTube recordings floating around of various talks from various years.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Montreal 2018 is an exception to this rule. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reconmtl/status/1012040135310020609\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">they announced on Twitter</a>, they decided to embed the slides <a href=\"https://recon.cx/2018/montreal/schedule/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in the schedule</a>, for some reason.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cfp.recon.cx/2022/schedule/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Montreal 2022 put the slides in the schedule again</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cfp.recon.cx/2023/schedule/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Montreal 2023 put the slides in the schedule too; apparently this is what they're doing now</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/publications/proceedings?f%5B0%5D=im_taxonomy_vocabulary_2%3A202\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT)</a>\n<ul>\n<li>For some reason, since 2020, WOOT proceedings are no longer published via USENIX.
