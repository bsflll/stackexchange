    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Pretty new to RE so sorry if this is a dumb question. </p>\n<p>I'm trying to manually unpack an executable and I believe I've found the OEP. However, when I use Scylla to try to fix the import table of the dumped .exe I get some invalid/missing results, and I couldn't find any information on how to determine the correct function to assign. I tried running the tool Universal Import Fixer, which seems to fix all the invalid imports but I would be unable to fix my dumped file. Any help would be appreciated!</p>\n<p>Here is a screenshot of what I see:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/elqud.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/elqud.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
