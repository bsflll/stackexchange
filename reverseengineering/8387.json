    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Due to the following topic,\n<a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/8382/initializing-a-struct-in-win32-assembly-programming-using-masm\">Initializing a struct in win32 assembly programming using MASM</a></p>\n<p>I tried to correct my mistakes, So I tried the following code :</p>\n<pre><code>.386\n.model flat,stdcall\noption casemap:none\n\nstruct1 struct\nfirst db ?\nsecond dd ?\nthird db ?\nstruct1 EndS\n\n.data\nInitializedstructure struct1 &lt;4,10&gt;\n\n.code\nstart:\nmov eax, struct1.first\nmov ebx , struct1.second\nmov ecx , struct1.third\n;offsets\nmov eax , offset struct1.first\nmov ebx , offset struct1.second\nmov ecx , offset struct1.third\nend start\n</code></pre>\n<p>But on the disassembled code didn't find any thing. I added the offset of each struct's member to distinguish the differences between the two.</p>\n<pre><code>.text:00401000 start:\n.text:00401000                 mov     eax, 0\n.text:00401005                 mov     ebx, 1\n.text:0040100A                 mov     ecx, 5\n.text:0040100F                 mov     eax, 0\n.text:00401014                 mov     ebx, 1\n.text:00401019                 mov     ecx, 5\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've surfed the net but didn't find any documentation describing the use of structs well, so I decided to try it by myself.\nThe disassembled code seems,it holds the size of each struct's member.</p>\n<p>The main question is how to use the members of the struct within the code?</p>\n</div>",

I think you've misunderstood the <code>Initializedstructure</code> to an instruction or other directives.You can name it what you want and use the initialized <code>struct</code> in the rest by its name.For instance, in the .data section you would use:</p>\n<pre><code>AAAA struct1 &lt;4,10,60&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>So in the rest of code in the .code section using following statement will work,\n<code>mov eax , AAAA.second</code> and give you (in this case) 10 and the <code>mov eax, offset AAAA.second</code> give the offset of second member in run-time.</p>\n</div>",
