In the end I want to record all data sent to/from a <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket</code>.</p>\n<p>I can't modify the jar file or the jre on disk, because it will bail if the hashes don't match up, but I can hook any function from native code during runtime.</p>\n<p>I have a working solution right now, but it's very messy and not that flexible. I'm hooking <code>JNI_CreateJavaVM</code> and inserting <code>-Djavax.net.debug=all</code> into the arguments passed to it. This causes all data sent over the socket to be written to disk, and then I'm hooking <code>WriteFile</code> to intercept that data before it gets written to disk.</p>\n<p>I found something that looked close to what I want, the <code>-javaagent</code> parameter, but by the time my agent is loaded all of the java standard library is loaded so I don't see a way to hook it using an agent.</p>\n</div>",

Hooking to me means inserting some piece of code which could also change the parameters, output of the function and affect program state. There's certainly some overlap but the intent, possibly acceptable runtime overhead and the requirements on the level of user interaction may be very different.</span>",
