So I copy the final executable  file to my Windows PC, use IDA 7.5  to disassemble it. At the same time, I debug this file in xcode using lldb.</p>\n<p>The pictures show some strange thing. There is an <code>unk_xxx</code> in IDA but in xcode there is some other ARM instructions.</p>\n<p><strong>Question one:</strong> Why there is an unknow flag in IDA views?</p>\n<p>I searched this on Google but there is nothing valuable. Can there is a possibility IDA 7.5 can not support adrp instruction. So it treats instruction as adrl ,so some error happens.</p>\n<p><strong>Question two:</strong> Is there  any way to fix it?</p>\n<p>As there is an <code>unk_xxx</code> in IDA text view, I found some content missing in pseudocode. This blocked me to read the whole logic of this function. I hope someone can give me some insight, so I can push on.</p>\n<p>Thanks very much!</p>\n<p>When ADRL is been detected, <code>unk_xxxx</code> appears, then pseudocode of disassembling code  of this function are missing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GjS3R.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Pseudocode miss in Ida\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GjS3R.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

If ida can not treat adrl ,it may detect it as two spit double instruction adrp and add. Now it treat it as adrl ,  not only the pseudocode of this instruct is missing ,and the pseudocode after the this instruction also missing . This is really unacceptable, and I can't carry on my analysis . I think this may be a bug of Ida.  Can you give me some advice how to handle this situation ? Thanks very much!</span>",

Although Adrl is affected by alsr, the disaccemble code should be adrl lable_offset, it shouldn't be unk_xxxx.   There is another possibilty . Ida can't get the real jump address (offset of instruction to jump). The real address is caculated at runtime. So the behaviour of ida is in expectations .</span>",
