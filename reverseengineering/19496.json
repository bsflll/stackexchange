Now in one of the questions I am given a <code>.dd</code> file and the hint says <code>Some files have been deleted from the disk image, but are they really gone?</code>\nI have no clue what to do with it. Any help on how to proceed. I mean what should I start with? what could be the way I can find a flag? how to open this <code>.dd</code> file?</p>\n</div>",

It will (maybe) give you more insight on what you are working with.</p>\n<p>I never did picoCTF but I bet the <code>.dd</code> refers to a <a href=\"https://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/Raw_Image_Format\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">raw disk image</a>.</p>\n<p>Now I have only a few experience in Forensics (yes I think it's more Forensics than Reverse Engineering per say), but I think you could try <a href=\"https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">testdisk</a> and/or PhotoRec (A tool that is shipped with testdisk). This software allows you to browse hard drive partitions and play a bit with it.\nNote that because it is a raw disk image, and if the partitions are not encrypted, using common/simple tools such as <code>strings</code> might reveal some interesting information.</p>\n<p>I hope this will be helpful.</p>\n</div>",

You load them into a tool for forensic analysis like FTK Imager or EnCase in order to analyze the file system structure and recover some clues. If it's just the deleted file recovery that you need, use Testdisk / PhotoRec as said above.</p>\n</div>",

It's often how you'd take a dump of a block or a character device and save it as a file, for example.  </p>\n</div>",
