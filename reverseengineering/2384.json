I figure the actual statement is meaningless, but I'm very curious to see who is assessing these protection factors. </p>\n<p>A Google search didn't turn up anything, so I thought that the Dexguard authors probably made it up themselves. But <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nflnfl/status/241442557580673024\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this Twitter post</a> implies that there are other \"hacker protection factors\", out there which 35 can be compared with. </p>\n<p>Does anyone know what the deal with this is? Is it just more pointless puffery? Is there an actual group that is assigning these numbers?</p>\n</div>",

The numbers are based on empirical evidence (\"<em>Based on our experience,...</em>\"). I thought it was cute; it is not an industry standard, but it does serve as a simple indication that an application processed with ProGuard is more difficult to reverse-engineer than the original application, and an application processed with DexGuard is <em>a lot</em> more difficult to reverse-engineer.</p>\n<p>(I am the developer of ProGuard and DexGuard)</p>\n</div>",
