I'd like to point out that for the <code>LDRNE R2, [R5, #960]! </code> instruction, since it is a pre-indexed instruction, the address used for the memory transfer should be 960 bytes above the address contained in R5. This means after the instruction is executed, the value of R2 should be equal to *(unsigned int)(R5+#960), not *(unsigned int) R5 as you have suggested.</span>",
