I'm hoping somebody here has access to a Strix version of the Vega 56 or 64 on a windows machine? If you do, would you please dump the <code>smbus</code>. This can be done using a demo version of AIDA64. Right click the bottom status bar and select \"debug video -&gt; dump ATI SMBUS\" (or something like that).</p>\n<p>I have the Polaris line of cards figured out, but Vega and Navi have thrown me a curve ball.</p>\n</div>",
