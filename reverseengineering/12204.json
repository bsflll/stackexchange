Upon entry to <code>main</code>, the stack pointer is <code>0xFFFFD95C</code>, while the <code>stack view</code> only shows up through <code>0xFEFFFFFC</code>. Attempting to \"sync with esp\" or jump to esp will fail. Is there a way to add more memory such that the contents of the stack can be viewed?</span>",
