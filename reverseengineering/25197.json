    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a fairly large obfuscated program, and I need to mark all of the lines as code. I was able to do this in IDC by iterating through the lines and running <code>MakeCode</code>. It works for small amounts of code, but when I tried it on the entire program I waited for hours and nothing happened. Is there a more efficient way to mark every line as code?</p>\n</div>",
