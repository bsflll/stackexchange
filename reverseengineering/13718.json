    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I noticed a strange instruction pattern. First the value of PC is moved into LR and then a register value is moved into PC.</p>\n<p>Here some examples:</p>\n<pre><code>.text:00001488                 MOV             LR, PC\n.text:0000148C                 MOV             PC, R2\n ...\n.text:000304E8                 MOVNE           LR, PC\n.text:000304EC                 MOVNE           PC, R3\n</code></pre>\n<p>If this pattern corresponds to a call instruction, wouldn't this result in an endless loop? If this does not correspond to a call, what is this ?</p>\n</div>",

As people quoting <a href=\"https://community.arm.com/thread/2341\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> from <a href=\"http://liris.cnrs.fr/~mmrissa/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=armv7-a-r-manual.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>on page A2-11 (Section A2.3) of the manual (ARM Architecture Reference\n  Manual ARMv7-A and ARMv7-R edition) it's been said that:</p>\n<p>PC, the program counter</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When executing an ARM instruction, PC reads as the address of the current instruction plus 8.</li>\n<li>When executing a Thumb instruction, PC reads as the address of the current instruction plus 4.</li>\n<li>Writing an address to PC causes a branch to that address.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most Thumb instructions cannot access PC. The ARM instruction set\n  provides more general access to the PC, and many ARM instructions can\n  use the PC as a general-purpose register. However, ARM deprecates the\n  use of PC for any purpose other than as the program counter. See\n  Writing to the PC on page A2-46 for more information. Software can\n  refer to PC as R15</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

ARM(32-bit version) is special in that the value of PC is pointing two instructions ahead when you read it (so +8 in ARM mode and +4 in Thumb mode). So, taking your example:</p>\n<pre><code>.text:00001488                 MOV             LR, PC\n</code></pre>\n<p>here, the <code>PC</code> value will be 1488+8 = 1490, so <code>LR=0x1490</code></p>\n<pre><code>.text:0000148C                 MOV             PC, R2\n</code></pre>\n<p>here, the <code>PC</code> will be set to the value in <code>R2</code> and the processor will start fetching instructions from that address. Most likely it will be a function which ends with a return instruction - <code>MOV PC, LR</code> (IDA shows it as <code>RET</code>), so the execution will resume at the value of <code>LR</code>ï¼ˆ0x1490) which happens to be just after the original <code>MOV PC, R2</code> instruction (0148C+4=0x1490), so in effect that sequence of instruction is equivalent to <code>BLX R2</code> in the newer processors.</p>\n</div>",
