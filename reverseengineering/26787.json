This has recently been published to the GitHub repository in the <a href=\"https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/tree/debugger\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>debugger</code> branch</a>. There is also a <a href=\"https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/ghidra-debugger/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">good blogpost</a> showcasing it.</p>\n<p>Sadly there does not seem to be a <code>x64dbg</code> backend yet, but I would expect that this will appear as either an official backend or a community plugin at some point in the near future.\nConcerning your specific questions and whether they are supported or will likely be supported via this debugger feature in the future:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>see the variables values in ghidra's decompile window</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think showing them directly in the decompile window is currently not supported. But showing a list of variables of the current function, globals and maybe specific addresses definitely seems like something that will be supported at some point, or can be written with reasonable effort.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>in the case of arrays and struct, from the address, how can I have all the values displayed, as if I was debugging from Visual Studio for instance ?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am not quite sure what you mean here because I never used debugging with Visual Studio myself. But this seems like a more specific case of the first question to me and will either be supported at some point, or something that can be scripted for a specific purpose easily enough.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>how can I label back the renamed variables in ghidra back in x64dbg ?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This might be out of scope for a debugger plugin and would require support on the <code>x64dbg</code> side. The <code>x64dbg</code> plugin would need some functionality to receive variable names from Ghidra and apply them. Most likely possible in general, but I do not know if the Debugger Protocol which Ghidra uses supports this notion.</p>\n</div>",
