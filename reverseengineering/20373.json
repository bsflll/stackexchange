Your best best bet is examining what the pins connect to and analyzing what they may do. Since its a one off chip the chance of finding a datasheet is slim to none. </p>\n<p>The big chip is a variation of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MCS-51\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Intel 8051</a> which is common in 80's car technology. The datasheet can be found <a href=\"http://www.b-kainka.de/Daten/Mikros/d80515.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>",

I don't know if this chip would be based on a standard chip and then relabeled or maybe it is an independent development. I will update the original question showing the connections with the main controller.</span>",
