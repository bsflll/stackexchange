    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm working on a disassembly project for my class where I'm trying to bypass a license check, but when I throw the executable into Binary Ninja this is what I see:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/26zvR.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Function pointers within binary ninja\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/26zvR.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>And when I look at those pointers, they are all pointing to the same block of hex:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Dp61f.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Block of hex\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Dp61f.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>I'm not sure what to make of it, or even how to interpret it. Any advice would be appreciated.</p>\n</div>",
