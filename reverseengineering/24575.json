    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to reverse engineer the firmware for an AutoDrive AD-520 dashcam. The firmware is available for download <a href=\"http://giinii.com/GiiNii/AD520_software_upgrade.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. I've installed binwalk on windows, I can get it to read the file just fine, here's a screenie of a regular <code>binwalk SD_CarDV.bin</code></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ecCiB.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ecCiB.png\"/></a> </p>\n<p>However, if I try pretty much anything else it doesn't work. I can't do -E, it just sits there for a minute then reads out the file contents like --signature, but doesn't do anything else, and trying to save the -E to a png I get an error saying \"failed to import matplotlib module\". When I try -e, I get a readout just like with --signature, but no actual files are created in the working directory. If I use <code>-e -C=./tmp</code> I get the normal readout, a tmp folder is created, but no files. I've tried <code>--dd=\".*\"</code>, as well as <code>--log=binwalk.log</code>, literally copied from the github manual, and I get this error (same error with -dd and --log)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CtKZ2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CtKZ2.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I can't seem to get this thing to work. I'm wondering if it's me, windows, the firmware file itself...I can't figure it out. Can anyone help me?</p>\n</div>",

If you want to extract image data you have to install matplotlib library for Python. Also, not sure if that matters but \"./\" is not the correct notation in Windows. use \"C:\\\\tmp\" instead (note the double \\).</span>",

I installed matplotlib, I can now get an output from the -E command, I had to resize it so the labels wouldn't hide the graph: <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/WRnDo0p.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">i.imgur.com/WRnDo0p.png</a> Also here's a screenshot of the command window after running the -E --verbose commands <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/AKe0tTS.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">i.imgur.com/AKe0tTS.png</a> I still can't get anything to extract though, with -e or -dd.</span>",
