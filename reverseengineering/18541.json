This is the result I got:</p>\n<pre><code>[30] .sha256_sig         PROGBITS         00000000000000000  00023276\n[31] .sig_key            PROGBITS         00000000000000000  00023676\n</code></pre>\n<p>Few questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Since there are two headers (<code>sha256_sig</code> and <code>sig_key</code>), does this mean the ELF is signed?</li>\n<li>How can I verify the signature?</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

The only references I could find to these section names are part of it's update mechanism as can be seen in this <a href=\"https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageUpdate/pull/75\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pull Request</a>.</p>\n</div>",
