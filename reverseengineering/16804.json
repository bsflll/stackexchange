    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Can a multi-byte primitive data type (ie int, double, float, etc) span multiple virtual pages on Windows?</p>\n<p>ex) The first 4-bytes of a double on a virtual page, and the next 4-bytes of a double on the next virtual page. Is this possible*?</p>\n<p>What about structs? Arrays?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>*I presume it is technically possible to just cast the address of the last 4-bytes of arbitrary memory in a virtual page to a double pointer, as long as there is another virtual page that follows -- but I'm more curious if this can happen naturally in a compiled/interpreted program.</p>\n</div>",
