    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Just started out with x86 assembly and slowly getting the hang of it. IDA produces nice graphs that make it much easier to follow all the jumps and function calls and stuff.</p>\n<p>I've looked at examples of arithmetics, control flow, loops, and function calls, and feel that I could reasonably take a chunk of instructions and reproduce the same logic in Java or C.</p>\n<p>Are there tools that will automatically take assembly and convert it to, say, C? I imagine for some people that at some point it becomes more of a chore than an exercise after doing it for years.</p>\n</div>",
