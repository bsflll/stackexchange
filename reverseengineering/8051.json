The folder containing the IDAPython script on the host machine is shared with the VM.</p>\n<p>The first time I run the IDAPython script in IDA it works fine. However, for subsequent runs a cached version of the script seems to be running. I end up having to close and re-start IDA in order for the changes to get loaded up. Is there an easier way? I run scripts as <code>File &gt; Open Script file.</code></p>\n</div>",
