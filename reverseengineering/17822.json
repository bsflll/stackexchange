Is there no \"resume program\" function that I can use to let the program I'm attached to, to run to completion of all its tasks without the debugger pausing every second (no breakpoints enabled). Maybe the access violations are why it's pausing but I want it to ignore them too as it's already excluded in my exceptions menu.</p>\n</div>",

You may have to disable the breakpoints beforehand(This will not delete them). In x64dbg you do a right click in the breakpoints panel and select \"disable all\" in the context menu to achieve this.</p>\n<p>To \"ignore\" all exceptions in x64dbg: Click on options -&gt; preferences -&gt; exceptions -&gt; add range. Then in the first input enter a \"0\" and in the second as many \"F\" as fit in.</p>\n</div>",
