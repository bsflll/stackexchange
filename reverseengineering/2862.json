In this series, we’ll be covering the usage of VDB\n  (dynamic debugging component) and <strong>vivisect</strong> (static analysis tool).</p>\n<p>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can also see the <code>README</code> file <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/vtrace-mirror/source/browse/trunk/README-vivisect\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, and some related scripts <a href=\"https://github.com/pdasilva/vtrace_scripts\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>",
