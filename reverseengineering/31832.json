But how do you determine where the characters of one language end and another begins? Is there a written standard that says language X starts at index Y and ends at index Z?</p>\n<p>In case it matters, I'm referring to <code>.ttf</code> &amp; <code>.otf</code> font files.</p>\n<p>I'm unsure if my question fits in this community and I'm struggling to find another, so if there's one better suited, please let me know.</p>\n<p>Any info or documentation on this would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks in advance.</p>\n</div>",
