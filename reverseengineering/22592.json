In fact a good number of the AC drivers I've looked at are nothing more than these callbacks and, sometimes, kernel pattern scans. Nearly every kernel mode AC will also have an IOCTL pipe that's pretty obvious (e.g \\Device\\AcName). No kernel AC is going to hide themselves, using a tool like Driver List should also be obvious. Many will also use <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directshow/dbglog\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DbgLog</a> in <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/driverentry-for-kmdf-drivers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DriverEntry</a> which you can see with <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DebugView</a> using kernel capture. They will also almost universally be signed with a certificate matching the AC name.  I guess the best answer to this is just to use generic tools to look through loaded drivers, it's typically very obvious if an AC driver is loaded.</p>\n</div>",
