In my opinion, it is mostly because of page optimization. You can read <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/pa-dalign/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> document for further understanding.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do PE files use IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION to work?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION is a data structure which can be expressed as:</p>\n<pre><code>typedef struct _IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION {\n    DWORD   VirtualAddress;\n    DWORD   SizeOfBlock;\n} IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION, *PIMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION;\n</code></pre>\n<p>PE files don't use IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION structure to work, PE loader (dynamic linker) use it for constructing relocation table. You can read <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17436668/how-are-pe-base-relocations-build-up\">this</a> topic if you want to learn more about relocation table.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6002359/so-most-of-the-binary-is-composed-of-reloc-table\">JosephH says:</a></p>\n<p>\"If your program makes a frequent access to global variables and constants, it will have a huge relocation table because theres so much places that the loader has to update\"\nHow does the loader use relocation table and update it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since you use .reloc in your title question, I will explain you relocation information in the .reloc section. This section holds information for base relocations which mean if required files cannot be loaded their preferred addresses (because already something mapped to it) instructions or variables relocated with that information.</p>\n<p>Loader uses virtual addresses, offset and loaded address to <em>resolve</em> and <em>relocate</em> which is another way to say adjusting addresses.</p>\n</div>",
