If not, can you put up a download link so someone else might have a go at it? It <i>could</i> be easier than finding out the relationship between these numbers.</span>",

            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">Just understand that depending on how realistic the game is, there are other (hidden) parts of the calculation.  For example, there is opposing aerodynamic drag in real life, which IIRC increases with the square of the velocity (e.g. 4x as much drag at 10 mph compared to 20 mph).  Aero drag would be part of the speed calculation, counteracting the thrust force, but it's not linear (obviously).  RE'ing the binary (as others have said) is the best. If not, try accounting for the aero drag, and you might get close.</span>",

The first problem with those data is that we do not know the unit. Speed equal to 188, but what? Is it km/h or knots?

There's a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust-to-weight_ratio\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">thrust-to-weight</a> ratio in aviation that might help you to deduce something from it (maybe there's some correlation between thrust, weight and speed) but to know that maybe we need to ask on <a href=\"http://aviation.stackexchange.com\">Aviation</a>?</p>\n</div>",
