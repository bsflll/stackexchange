I assume a good indicator would be to check if they have stack cookie or not. Do you know any tool that can do this, or any tool that I could build into a script, so I don't have to do it manually?</p>\n<h2>Edit</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee672187.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Found</a> <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44995\" rel=\"nofollow\">Binscope</a>, I'll check if it's capable to check more binaries at the same time or it's scriptable.</p>\n<h2>Edit2</h2>\n<p>It requires debug symbols, so this is not a solution.</p>\n<h2>Edit3</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/NetSPI/PEchecker\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/NetSPI/PEchecker</a></p>\n</div>",
