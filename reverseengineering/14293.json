    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>For the source generated by Hex Ray's decompiler in IDA, is it possible to highlight matching braces once I place the pointer at the beginning of a block?</p>\n<p>As an example, in the screenshot below, the <code>if</code> block begins at line# <code>263</code> and ends at line# <code>269</code>. What I want is, if I place the cursor at line# <code>263</code>, IDA should highlight the block end at line# <code>269</code>. Is such a feature available? Many code editors provides similar feature to make code browsing easier for larger blocks of code.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SpddM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SpddM.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
