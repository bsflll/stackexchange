    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Basically i'm debugging a closed source binary on Android and i want to execute some of my code in between which is large enough not to fit in codecave. So is it possible to compile library with my code separately &amp; then calling it from target binary?\nIf yes then how?</p>\n<p>My friend suggested me to modify binary header &amp; extend data segment to inject my code. Is it convenient?</p>\n<p>I have another one suggestion.\nI know interface to that closed source binary, then is it possible to write a wrapper binary?\nFor ex, suppose closed source binary is libfoo.so. Then is it possible to write a binary libbar.so which actually loads libfoo.so &amp; sends function calls to libfoo.so</p>\n<p>I'm asking this because i've seen some warez programs bundled with some extra dlls &amp; often some wrapper executable.</p>\n</div>",

Essentially you write a small application, either Java/Application based or C/Native based. An example of doing this is here;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rednaga/native-shim\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/rednaga/native-shim</a></p>\n<p>This allows you to call any method you would like with slight modifications.</p>\n</div>",
