However when I try do exactly as they say, I get the following error: <code>sh: 1: rsc: not found</code>.</p>\n<p>From what I can see, <code>rsc</code> is an extra utility that would have come in with Radare1. See <a href=\"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/raring/man1/rsc.1.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I understand that ! causes Radare to execute a shell command so I therefore need the <code>rsc</code> utility. However I cannot find it anywhere!</p>\n<p>I'm using Radare2 0.10.0 compiled from git and Boomerang compiled from git as well.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know what the state of these two tools working together is?</p>\n</div>",

Boomerang hasn't been yet added to r2 in this version, you can use <code>pdc</code> and <a href=\"https://asciinema.org/a/20904\" rel=\"nofollow\">retdec</a> (see r2pm). We are actually working on <a href=\"https://github.com/radare/radeco\" rel=\"nofollow\">radeco</a>. But you can always contribute and maybe add back this support to r2 ? That would be interesting</p>\n</div>",
