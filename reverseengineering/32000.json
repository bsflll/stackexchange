    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to change the name of a button, but I can't find anything that references it. I looked for the <code>CreateWindow</code> function in the intermodular calls, but I only found a reference to the main window. I also tried through strings but without success.</p>\n<p>Searching a little more I found a x64dbg function that allows checking the created processes and their identifiers called <code>handle</code> but nothing appears there except the process of the main window, different one from when you analyze the native calculator of windows.</p>\n<p>Could someone give me a new tip on what to do? It's like the button doesn't exist but it's visually there in the program.</p>\n<p>Sorry for my English I'm using google translator.</p>\n</div>",
