Next you need to reverse the game and see how its structured and where to patch the code so it will jump to your code. For dll injection you could use <a href=\"http://www.cheatengine.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cheat engine</a> they have a very nice tutorial but you still need to reverse the game and write injection code.dll.</p>\n</div>",
