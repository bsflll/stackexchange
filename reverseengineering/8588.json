    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have spent some time reverse engineering a QNX 6.5.0 based system. I am pretty new to the Linux (Ubuntu) world and definitely new to QNX, Qemu, and embedded systems. </p>\n<p>Since the hardware is fairly closed, the closest I could use is a Beagleboard-XM.   Since I didn't want to purchase one, I decided to use Qemu.   I have set it all up using the Linaro builds, etc.   I have a system booting.   </p>\n<p>My issue is that I cannot, for the life of me, get the emulated QNX system to show a USB drive.  I am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and am booting from an SD card.  I don't card if I can actually load a USB drive, but it seems like the simplest solution to be able to get files off the QNX system.   I have tried quite a bit.   I am unable to get networking up and running and am unable to get QNX to recognize any devices.</p>\n<p>Here is my working Qemu command line (version 1.7.0 (qemu-linaro 2014.01))</p>\n<pre><code>sudo qemu-system-arm -M beaglexm -m 512 -serial stdio \\\n                     -nographic -monitor pty -usb -sd /dev/mmcblk0\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have tried tons of command lines with <code>-device</code>, <code>-drive</code>, etc, etc.  For example.</p>\n<p>Nothing.   One thing to note is that I have attempted to use the EHCI bus but am unable to get that working because I keep getting a </p>\n<pre><code>qemu-system-arm: -device usb-ehci,id=ehci: No 'PCI' bus found for device 'usb-ehci'\n</code></pre>\n<p>using the command line</p>\n<pre><code>sudo qemu-system-arm -M beaglexm -m 512 -serial stdio \\\n                     -nographic -monitor pty -usb -sd /dev/sdd \\\n                     -drive if=none,id=usbstick,file=/dev/sdb1 \\\n                     -device usb-ehci,id=ehci \\\n                     -device usb-storage,bus=ehci.0,drive=usbstick\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also, the emulated system tries to load an <code>mmcsd</code> driver and is looking for a raw <code>/dev/mmc0</code>.   I have been unable to figure out how to get my SD card (or any other device) to show up with that mount name.</p>\n<p>Any suggestions for being able to get files off the emulated system?   I know that the system can use these two specific USB to ethernet adapters, but I don't have one.   Maybe I could simulate one of those?   My attempts at setting up a fake USB to serial connection also have failed.   Basically, anything that requires USB support I am unable to get working.</p>\n<p>This is what shows on the emulated QNX system when I query the usb host.</p>\n<pre><code>USB 0 (OMAP3530) v1.10, v1.01 DDK, v1.01 HCD\nUSB 1 (EHCI) v1.10, v1.01 DDK, v1.01 HCD\n</code></pre>\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n</div>",
