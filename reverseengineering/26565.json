You can use a compilation switch such as <code>/Zi</code> to generate a PDB file with debugging information which can then be used by IDA to label your functions and variables in the disassembly.</p>\n<p>Note that some information is lost anyway: comments, preprocess or definitions, or any code or data which has been optimized out and removed.</p>\n</div>",
