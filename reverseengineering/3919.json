    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p><sup>In hope this is <a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/226134/147640\">appropriate</a></sup></p>\n<p>I have a Bosch Tassimo TAS2002EE coffee maker that uses T-Disks. Those contain coffee/milk/something else, and a barcode that is supposed to tell the machine how to deal with the disk.</p>\n<p>What I want to do is understand the barcode and come up with some different barcodes that would be accepted as valid and let me adjust e.g. drink volume.</p>\n<p>At first I wasn't able to find any decent information about these barcodes, among the top Google hits were things like <a href=\"http://rightertrack.com/articles/barcodes-help-brew-your-perfect-cup-of-jo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> rather useless rant. Surprisingly, when searching for pictures of T-Disks (in order to study more barcodes), I stumbled upon this useful post: <a href=\"http://www.chapmanconsulting.ca/post/2007/12/02/Hacking-the-Tassimo-Part-2-Breaking-the-Code.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hacking the Tassimo - Part 2: Breaking the Code</a> <sup>(<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130901003014/http://www.chapmanconsulting.ca:80/post/2007/12/02/Hacking-the-Tassimo-Part-2-Breaking-the-Code.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">archive</a>)</sup>, which also links to <a href=\"http://www.google.com/patents/US7231869\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this T-Disk-related patent</a>, in which there is a table explaining the controlling bits.

The last digit is the check digit calculated according to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Product_Code#Check_digits\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">UPC Check Digit</a> rules.<br/>\nActual barcodes with the checksum removed:</p>\n<div class=\"s-table-container\">\n<table class=\"s-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Barcode</th>\n<th>Product</th>\n<th>Output, ml</th>\n<th>Barcode binary</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>06409</td>\n<td>coffe créma</td>\n<td>150</td>\n<td><code>00011001 00001001</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06178</td>\n<td>espresso</td>\n<td>80</td>\n<td><code>00011000 00100010</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>63735</td>\n<td>milk for latte (big disk)</td>\n<td>?</td>\n<td><code>11111000 11110111</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06182</td>\n<td>milk for cappuccino (small disk)</td>\n<td>?</td>\n<td><code>00011000 00100110</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06665</td>\n<td>hot chocolate</td>\n<td>?</td>\n<td><code>00011010 00001001</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07879</td>\n<td>service disk</td>\n<td>200</td>\n<td><code>00011110 11000111</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>The service disk is used for cleaning, it makes hot water at 60° C flow straight through without any brewing time.</p>\n<p>Using a barcode printer, I tried to modify the Coffe Créma barcode to give 300 ml (the max amount from the patent). I did some really extensive testing, printing out and feeding the machine a handful of barcodes, and <em>it would seem</em> there are six bits in the barcode, not four, that control the amount. The data is available <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_uBt_U6h3ikUW98nolEZqYE-iGY2-3JgZYizDbAbS6k/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> at Google Docs. The 6-bit range in question is in the middle: last 3 bits of the first byte and first 3 bits of the second byte (big-endian). Because Google Docs don't support in-cell colours, there is also a more nicely coloured Excel file uploaded <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/0B6R95Kw26afzd1ZmNkk4aEljbjg/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=115083121392060786441&amp;resourcekey=0-nzaUqZo7kDoGgsgfdzwfqA&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> at Google Drive.</p>\n<p>So I identified two 6-bit sequences that resulted in 300 ml for Crema.<br/>\nFor the sake of interest, I took one of the sequences and put it into the respective place of the original Espresso barcode. And there it is, I got 300 ml of Espresso.</p>\n<p>While this was sort of a success (I'm now able to produce barcodes with correct volumes for the drinks I'm interested in), I'm still completely lost as of exactly how this works. As you can see from the experiment table, the pattern is rather fuzzy, and there are entries that give same volume from different combination of bits. I'm also not sure I'm getting the same brewing parameters with the barcodes I made.</p>\n<p>Please share your ideas on how to understand this further.</p>\n</div>",

Also, the patent mentions different cartridge charges - with soak, without soak - which may affect the volume of water in the cup, as well as steam/no steam, which isn't mentioned in the patent. Last, the blog author mentions that american cartriges seem to have high first digits while europeans have zero; this might mean some bits have no effect on the apparatus, but serve as licensee/vendor identification.</span>",

The first one reads the barcode on the side of the T-Discs. This code is formatted using <em>Interleaved 2 of 5</em>.<br/>\nThe other type of machine (I think it's only the T43xx, and the T55xx) reads the barcode from the front of the T-Disc, as shown in the picture from User perror. We already discovered, that this code is kind of invalid, all scanner apps and online decoder I found couldn't convert it into readable text.<br/>\nDuring my research I discovered a <a href=\"http://board.gulli.com/thread/739924-s-tassimo-t-disc-barcode-von-grosser-tasse/?p=14918070#post14918070\" rel=\"nofollow\">german forum post</a>, telling that's an <em>invalid UPC-E</em>. However I wasn't able to photoshop the missing parts on it, namely the start and end sequenz.<br/>\nIn the same forum, one comment below my link there is a guy guessing that these codes refer to an internal memory with hardcoded brewing instructions. In my opinion that's wrong, because in this case tassimo couldn't update their disc lineup after the launch of the machines, and in my region they did this with the milk-discs.</p>\n</div>",
