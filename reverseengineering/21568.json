    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I was under the impression that reverse engineering can mainly be legally prohibited in two ways: via copyright law forbidding the making of copies; and via an end-user licence agreement (EULA) specifically prohibiting reverse engineering.</p>\n<p>I've come across a software licence that permits unlimited software copying (under certain conditions) &amp; doesn't explicitly prohibit reverse engineering. I'm based in the UK, and thought that if UK law governed the agreement, that I would then be able to reverse engineer the software (under the certain conditions).</p>\n<p>It just so happens that Californian law governs the licence so I'm slightly unsure as to whether I can legally reverse engineer the software.</p>\n<p>Anyone have any answers on the overall question of this post?</p>\n</div>",

A possible way would be to ask over on <a href=\"https://law.stackexchange.com\">law.SE</a>. But similar questions have been asked here via <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/law\">law</a> and they typically end in opinion-based answers.</span>",

They help give an idea on what the correct course of action should be. Even if you get professional legal counsel, the counsel can end-up being wrong although I suppose legal insurance can help mitigate the damage in such situations.</span>",
