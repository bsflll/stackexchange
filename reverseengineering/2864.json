I use VirtualBox however. This mainly has to do with Seamless mode, this allows me to do great things :)</p>\n<h2>System Requirements</h2>\n<p>However I DO recommend to use a decent system. I tried to do this with my old-laptop and it was horrid. Atleast 8GB of RAM, and VT-x is recommended.</p>\n<h2>The wine way</h2>\n<p>I have been using IDA Free and OllyDBG with Wine for quite a while. And I had some issues with it, things like unreadable text.</p>\n</div>",

And besides that it doesn't really matter, even if there is some kind of awesome memory resilient worm that on the fly detects it's operating system to determine if he has to load GetProcAddress() or if he can syscall to the kernel he is still in a VM. The seamless mode only strips the gui using the vm-tools. The only issue is with anti-debugging that detect the VM by looking for the tools driver in memory.</span>",
