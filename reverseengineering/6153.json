I assume that it is an anti-debugging technique because the process terminates after hitting that line. </p>\n<p>But, I could not find any good explanation for <code>\"ZwQueryInformationThread\"</code> stopping the process. For me, the purpose is clear: it tries to make my work harder, but I would like to get more information about that. </p>\n<p>So, my question would be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is there someone who can tell me what <code>\"ZwQueryInformationThread\"</code> does? </p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

The technique is documented at <a href=\"https://ntquery.wordpress.com/2014/03/29/anti-debug-ntsetinformationthread/#more-6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ntquery.wordpress.com/2014/03/29/anti-debug-ntsetinformationthread/#more-6</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We call NtSetInformationThread two times with wrong parameters and\n  this will reveal most anti-anti-debug plugins. Since Vista it is\n  possible to use NtQueryInformationThread and this makes it much more\n  powerful. Currently no anti-anti-debug plugin is hooking\n  NtQueryInformationThread to prevent this check.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

There no point just looking at ZwQueryInformationThread and guessing it's that API.</p>\n<p>Breakpoint the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ExitProcess</li>\n<li>TerminateProcess</li>\n<li>NtTerminateProcess</li>\n<li>LdrShutdownProcess</li>\n<li>ExitThread</li>\n<li>TerminateThread</li>\n<li>NtTerminateThread</li>\n<li>LdrShutdownThread</li>\n<li>SetThreadContext/ NtSetContextThread setting EIP/RIP to 0.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Soon as it exits you'll able to follow it all back to whats actually closing the program.</p>\n</div>",
