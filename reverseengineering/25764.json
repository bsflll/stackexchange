    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am new to reverse engineering and I was trying to debug why a 3rd party application was crashing when I m injecting my DLL in it. (There are some cases where it didn't crash)</p>\n<p>So I was able to figure out from a set of instructions/subroutine where the application was throwing an error. There is was able to figure out that it was probably getting a null pointer for some TLS value.</p>\n<p>Here is my question w.r.t to this problem\nI want to break/notify my debugger whenever a value is getting changed at that given TLS slot.</p>\n<p>I'll add the ASM to make better sense, This is the disassembly of kernel32!TlsGetValue. I want to watch the TLS slots for the given thread. To put it in simple words I want to add watcher for <strong>GS:[0x1480]</strong></p>\n<p>Does anyone have any idea how to do it x64dbg?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZzTXw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZzTXw.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
