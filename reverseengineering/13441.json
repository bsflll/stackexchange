Correct? Or are there any drawbacks/errors when not supplying a script file during the process of <code>ASM</code> generation? I understand that a batch mode is normally only reasonable for advanced tasks, controlled by a script. But I only want to generate the <code>ASM</code> files for a bigger corpus of executables..</span>",

Just for clearification: my understanding so far was, that performing the above mentioned command (without <code>-S</code>), IDA will open the file, performing the autoanalysis and saves the ASM file to a location. Afterwards it closes the process and I can proceed with the next executable. So, of course there is no additionally processing, as my pure goal is the generation of the ASM file. So to reach this goal, the above mentioned processing should be right? As soon as I start supplying an additional script file, I HAVE to supply further commands (as you mentioned) - correct?</span>",

There's no <i>default</i> behavior for <code>-A</code>. If that's what you want to do, you'll have to write a small <code>idc</code>/<code>ipython</code> script that performs these operations.</span>",
