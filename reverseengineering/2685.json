    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am using the Local Bochs Debugger along with IDA Pro to debug a shellcode. This shellcode disassembles properly in IDA Pro, however, now I want to debug it.</p>\n<p>I tried debugging but since the configuration of Bochs is bare metal, it will not be able to execute some code properly, for instance:</p>\n<pre><code>xor eax, eax\nmov eax, dword ptr fs:[eax+0x30] // PEB\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since PEB is a structure defined in the Windows Operating System, Bochs does not execute this code properly (does not load the PEB address in eax).</p>\n<p>Simiarly, other sections of code which parse the kernel32.dll structure to find various API addresses also does not work.</p>\n<p>How can I debug the shellcode with IDA Pro and Bochs Debugger?</p>\n<p>I also have the following:</p>\n<pre><code>Windows XP SP3 Guest OS running in VMWare workstation.\nIDA Pro running on the host OS.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is it possible to place the shellcode.txt file inside the Guest OS and then debug it using IDA Pro on the host OS? I think in this case, the Windows Debugger, windbg's engine can be used.</p>\n<p>What will be the configuration? In the following article:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/tutorials/debugging_windbg.pdf\">https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/tutorials/debugging_windbg.pdf</a></p>\n<p>It describes how to debug a remote process running on Windows. But in my case, it is not a process but a shellcode loaded from a text file.</p>\n</div>",

The same code can be applied on 32bit Windows.</p>\n</div>",
