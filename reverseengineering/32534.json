    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>First time delving into hardware reverse engineering and can't seem to connect using JTAG nor SWD.  I found two identical devices that I'm trying to understand how they work and see if I can extract the firmware.  One device I'm sacrificing to research, the ATSAME70Q21 is a BGA which I removed to help with identifying traces.  The board has 10 holes that I've mapped the following pins:</p>\n<p>Pin 1 -&gt; +3V3</p>\n<p>Pin 2 -&gt; J11 (SWDIO/TMS)</p>\n<p>Pin 3 -&gt; F9 (SWCLK/TCK)</p>\n<p>Pin 4 -&gt; C10 (TDO/TRACESWO/WKUP13)</p>\n<p>Pin 5 -&gt; H12 (NRST) - Low to Reset</p>\n<p>Pin 6 -&gt; (GND)</p>\n<p>Pin 7 -&gt; M9 (PD19/NCS3/CTS2/UTXD4)</p>\n<p>Pin 8 -&gt; M10 (PD18/NCS1/SDCS/RTS2/URXD4)</p>\n<p>Pin 9 -&gt; A12 (TDI/PB4)</p>\n<p>Pin 10 () -&gt; UNKNOWN</p>\n<p>The data sheet is rather confusing, it seems like JTAG is only used for manufacturing and the SW_DP isn't clear what needs to be set, I'm probably just missing it though. From the datasheet:\n\"8.2.1 Serial Wire Debug Port (SW-DP) Pins\nThe SW-DP pins, SWCLK and SWDIO, are commonly provided on a standard 20-pin JTAG connector\ndefined by ARM. For additional information about voltage reference and reset state, refer to the\nTable 4-1.\nAt startup, the SW-DP pins are configured in SW-DP mode to allow connection with debugging\nprobe. For more details, refer to 16. Debug and Test Features.\nThe SW-DP pins can be used as standard I/Os to provide users more general input/output pins when\nthe debug port is not needed in the end application. Mode selection between SW-DP mode (System\nIO mode) and general IO mode is performed through the AHB Matrix Special Function Registers\n(MATRIX_SFR). Configuration of the pad for pull-up, triggers, debouncing and glitch filters is possible\nregardless of the mode.\nThe JTAGSEL pin is used to select the JTAG boundary scan when asserted at a high level. It integrates\na permanent pulldown resistor of about 15 kâ„¦ to GND, so that it can be left unconnected for normal\noperations.\nThe JTAG Debug Port TDI, TDO, TMS and TCK is inactive. It is provided for Boundary Scan\nManufacturing Test purpose only.\"</p>\n<p>Going through the traces, I did find they had a 0 Ohm resistor going to ground for the JTAGSEL pin and right next to it was an empty pad that switched it to VDDIO.  I moved that pin but it didn't change anything.  The datasheet mentions that to put it into JTAG mode, JTAGSEL (B11) has to be high, TST (H11) has to be high and PD0 (D4) has to be to GND.  The board doesn't appear to have an easy way to bring TST high and PD0 to GND.  I can upload pictures if that would help.</p>\n<p>I've tried using a JTAGulator to identify pins, which is seemed to do quite well but couldn't connect via JTAG.  I've also tried a Segger J-Link Edu Mini with no luck.</p>\n<p>Anyone have any possible next steps?  Any insight would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/MCU32/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/SAM-E70-S70-V70-V71-Family-Data-Sheet-DS60001527.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Datasheet</a></p>\n</div>",

Yes, I removed components and ran wires to connect everything for the JTAG and as you stated, it had no effect.  I can't seem to get SWD to work either.  I've connected a logic analyzer and there is nothing happening on the SWD  wires either.  Anything else I could possibly try?  Thanks again!</span>",
