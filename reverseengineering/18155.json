When disassembling we already have the assembled file as an opcodes so what the disassembler do is reverse it to a readable form e.g <code>83EC1C =&gt; sub esp, 0x1c</code>, the disassembler doesn't actually change anything in the file it just shows you the translation which is the assembly language instructions.</span>",
