From the quick glance, I conclude, this device measures temperature.</p>\n<p>Subsequent data looks like an <em>array of floats</em> - one can deduce it from <code>41</code>'s and <code>42</code>'s in each <code>4</code>-byte block (\"reasonable\" float numbers usually start with them when written in hex).</p>\n<p>To read the data, just take any <code>4</code>-byte, block starting with an address divisible by <code>4</code> and use <a href=\"https://www.binaryconvert.com/result_float.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this site</a>. However, as you may notice, the order of bytes in each <code>4</code>-byte block has to be different than just \"left to right\", that is, so-called <em>big endian</em>.</p>\n<p>Knowing that each number has to start with either <code>41</code> or <code>42</code> (otherwise resulting numbers would be too high or too low to reflect the temperature), you can conclude that, in  fact, number <code>ABCD</code> really means <code>BADC</code>, so it's <em>little endian</em> encoding with respect to each <code>2</code> bytes.</p>\n<p>For example, if you want to decode <code>01 41 33 33</code>, you want to convert the number <code>41 01 33 33</code> to decimal format (that is ~<code>8.075</code> Celcius degrees).</p>\n<p>Modifying data is rather straightforward - hex editors provide very easy way to do it; just highlight relevant bytes and start typing.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> it is also possible (and more likely) that the numbers are stored in <em>little endian</em> encoding, assuming that the first one begins at address <code>0012h</code>. In such a case, <code>0x421</code> (<code>21 04 00 00</code>) is probably the size of the float array.</p>\n</div>",

If I read the data using the viewer it shows excel results like that but I need to adjust certain values. I will follow and try with your instructions. Thanks a lot.</span>",
