For example</p>\n<pre><code>if ( !iFile2Size\n  || *pFile2BufferCopy == *pFile3BufferCopy\n  &amp;&amp; (iFile2Size &lt;= 1\n   || pFile2BufferCopy[1] == pFile3BufferCopy[1]\n   &amp;&amp; (iFile2Size &lt;= 2 || pFile2BufferCopy[2] == pFile3BufferCopy[2])) )\n  blah;\n</code></pre>\n<p>is a bit eye bleedy. I can't for the life of me figure out how to re-arrange it though.</p>\n</div>",

Examples of such a plugins in IdaPython (probably not working and outdated) may be found in its old Google Code repository (see v*.py <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/idapython/source/browse/trunk/examples/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> )</p>\n<p>In addition you can manipulate decompiler configuration.\nAs it wrote <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/decompiler/manual/config.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> you can reduce or increase <code>RIGHT_MARGIN</code> parameter, and this will probably give you an ability to manipulate single line size of decompiler output (which will change representation of your condition among others). The same setting can be accessed via edit/plugins/something related to hexrays/ (sorry, I don't have HexRay installed right now) menu.</p>\n</div>",
