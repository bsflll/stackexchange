They go so deep, they make me spend more time on adding structs rather than actually reversing.</p>\n<p>Is there any way of doing this?</p>\n<p>I did try parsing the file I need with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F9</kbd>, but IDA doesn't understand stuff like e.g. <code>#include</code>s and errors, making this option impossible to use</p>\n</div>",

Now load the test driver into IDA.
