    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong> I want to do live debugging of a java program on a linux machine, and don't how/what debugger to attach to the JVM to get this done.</p>\n<p>I expect that this is a well-solved problem, but I lack the terminology to find a solution after several hours of searching:</p>\n<p>I have a java program (stored in a jar file) that I'd like to observe (reverse engineer?) it <em>while</em> it runs. I see a lot of <em>decompilation</em> support for java - this isn't what I'm interested in at all, so please refrain from explaining how to do this. A major problem I'm having in my search is running into these kinds of answer.</p>\n<p>Ideally, I'd:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start the program and find the PID.</li>\n<li>Attach a debugger to the JVM somehow (this is what I don't know how to do, and lack the language to search for, apparently)</li>\n<li>Use the debugger to set breakpoints, read/write arbitrary memory of the JVM, see the JVM's registers and stack.</li>\n<li>Use a simple, open-source command-line tool to do this, like Radare2 or GDB.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I expect to be reading java bytecode (the instruction set for the JVM), not java source, while I do this.</p>\n<p>I am used to using Radare2 and GDB for native code (crackmes, CTF stuff, microcorruption). I also see that they both technically support Java, but I'm having a hard time figuring out <em>how</em> to do this, exactly.</p>\n<p>I need help with 2 things: <strong>what software to use</strong> and <strong>how to attach the program to the process</strong>. Bonus points if I can use radare!</p>\n<p>To be clear, the Java in question is running on a linux PC, not on an Android phone or anything like that.</p>\n<p>I also read about JDB, but it seems like the code needs to be compiled with debug flags, and this is not possible for my situation -- it also doesn't seem like what I'm looking for.</p>\n</div>",

You can then perform a heap dump (right click on process) and view the values of the variables of the classes your interested in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2Vrf5.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"heapdump\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2Vrf5.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
