There are some differences though, operator new can throw exceptions and cause new handlers to be called. There could also be a difference between what sort of meta data is stored about the allocated memory between malloc and new. They're different functions so it's best to treat them as such. After allocation you usually have object construction into the allocated memory.</span>",
