    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Id like to debug (to log function calls) native ARM Android Code in a shared library. So far I got no source and tried to disassemble it with IDA, but its hard to track all the calls down to a specific function.<br/><br/>\nSo I came up with IDA's <code>android_server</code>, which didnt work(<em>not breaking on breakpoints, pausing takes me always to the same loop, cant step through</em>) and Android NDK's <code>gbdserver</code> using as remote GDB Debugger in IDA based on that <a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=35602033&amp;postcount=5\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=35602033&amp;postcount=5</a> which results in the same. Using NDK's <code>gdbserver</code> and cli <code>gdb</code> didnt work, cause it requires the (source) project folder.<br/><br/><br/>\nThats why Id like to ask if there is  a way to debug native code w/o source or tracking down the calls is possible?\n<br/><em>(in this case nearly all of the app runs on native code/the funcs Id like to track arent called directly over JNI)</em></p>\n</div>",

There are some commands that rely on source/symbols, like disassemble, but you can use commands like x/20i &lt;address&gt; instead.
