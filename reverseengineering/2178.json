    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I manage my structures in C files, the header might look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>#pragma pack(0)\n\ntypedef struct\n{\n    short important_value;\n    char  _A[2]; // unknown\n    int   interesting_value;\n} STRUCT;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I loaded this into IDA via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F9</kbd>. Now I find out more about the structure, seeing that <code>_A</code> contains <code>short imaginary_value</code>.</p>\n<p>When I try to reload this in IDA via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F9</kbd>, nothing happens. When I delete the structure in IDA, parse the C file and re-create the structure, I see the new structure, however all instances of <code>STRUCT</code> in the database are deleted.</p>\n<p>So the question is, how do I reload the structure without removing all instances from the database.</p>\n</div>",
