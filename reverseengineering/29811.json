Firstly the file is a different size than the original, and the .jar will not run at all and instead throws a manifest error.</p>\n<p>\"\"\" no main manifest attribute, in xxx.jar \"\"\"</p>\n<p>The only change I am making at this time is to a string changing it from \"Welcome!\" to \"LOL!xox!\".</p>\n<p>I repackage the .jar with the following command:\njar -cvf xxx-2.jar -C xxx-1/ .</p>\n<p>If I extract the new .jar again and diff the two directories I get changes in directories that I didn't touch</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>└──╼ $diff -q xxx-1/ xxx-2/</p>\n<p>Common subdirectories: xxx-1/META-INF and xxx-2/META-INF</p>\n<p>Common subdirectories: xxx-1/net and xxx-2/net</p>\n<p>Common subdirectories: xxx-1/org and xxx-2/org</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's worth noting that after executing\njar -cvf xxx-2.jar -C xxx-1/ .</p>\n<p>I see a significant amount of deflation (30-60%) during execution.

Therefore the different file size can just mean you have chosen a different compression level when recreating the JAR file. Also relevant: What is the OS you use for patching the JAR file? Windows is case insensitive so files that only differ in case are lost/overwritten when unpacking.</span>",

Between the last zip file entry and the zip central directory at the end of the file an unlimited bytes can be inserted. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#/media/File:ZIP-64_Internal_Layout.svg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#/media/…</a> Google uses this section for placing cryptographic signatures in APK files (again ZIP files).</span>",

I just remembered another ZIP trick: You can have multiple ZIP entries of the same name, or some entries are present as file-entries but not in the central directory (depending on if you enumerate the file entries or use the central directory you would get a different result). ZIP allows quite a few manipulations...</span>",
