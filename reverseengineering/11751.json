I have tried to trace the references back to maybe .float but nothing but references. I would love to assume that the byte in question is the possible toggle im looking for.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rkICd.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rkICd.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Notice how the address takes 3 rows 2 for the xref and 1 for the .byte 0\nI am hoping maybe possibly it could be as simple as making a button that switches the .byte 0 into .byte 1 activating god mode and other features.\nTried xref to and two and no xrefs from godmode.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yyvmh.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yyvmh.png\"/></a>\nusing IDA 6.1, PPC binary</p>\n</div>",

But to find the godmode variable, you have to check the instructions around the xref addresses (0x823cc3e4 and 0x823cc3e0, which is really only one reference, just the address was constructed with 2 instructions).</span>",

I see register 11 is used in both xrefs except aGodModeS@1# used r3 also. The numeral 1 makes me think they are a toggle. Will dig into this after work. Thank you again.</span>",

Thus, follow the references back and you may see something like similar to the following pseudo code in assembly:</p>\n<pre><code>flag = aDisabled_\nif (god_mode == 1)\n   flag = aEnabled_\nsprintf(godStr, aGodModeS, flag)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally you have to found the address of \"god_mode\" variable. Of course, it may be read out in a more complex way, for example by calling a getter function of a configuration class.</p>\n</div>",
