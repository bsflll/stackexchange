Then, you connect with <code>target extended-remote</code> in gdb, and then run the <code>attach &lt;pid&gt;</code> in gdb.</p>\n<p>You could also instead use a wrapper on the debugee to not start <code>gdbserver</code> until a connection is made:</p>\n<pre><code>$ socat tcp-l:&lt;port&gt;,reuseaddr,fork exec:\"gdbserver --once --attach &lt;pid&gt;\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Statically compiled builds of <code>socat</code> can be made by you or often found online.</p>\n</div>",
