However, I would expect that the thread created by <em>Process A</em> via <code>CreateRemoteThread</code>, in the address space of <em>Process B</em>, would have the <code>th32OwnerProcessID</code> equal to the ID of <em>Process A</em> (if we were to take the description of the <code>th32OwnerProcessID</code> as quoted above). I was a bit surprised to see that it is actually equal to the ID of <em>Process B</em>.</p>\n<p>Could someone please explain why this is so? And how to get the ID of the actual creator of the thread, i.e. <em>Process A</em> in my example?</p>\n</div>",

The snapshot that is created by the Toolhelp APIs is system-wide, so in order to understand where a thread lives, you need its process ID.  That would be meaningless if it said process A, if process A created a remote thread in process B and then exited.  In that case, the PID belonging to process A at the time of creation might end up being reused by the next process that is created, and obviously be completely unrelated to the thread.</p>\n<p>Consider this a different way: creating a remote thread is merely making a request to the remote process to create the thread, so the remote process is the one who creates thread.  There is no concept of who made the request.</p>\n</div>",
