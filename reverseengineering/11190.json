    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>This is my first time asking something on SE and I'll do the best I can to provide all of the required information, but I apologize in advance if I'm not clear enough.</p>\n<p>I'm trying to reverse engineer a certain fighting game to be able to run the moves \"manually\".  What I mean by this is, say a certain power move is run by pressing S A J quickly on the keyboard, I want to be able to just jump to the method to use that move in the code without having to press the keys.</p>\n<p>so far I've tried using CheatEngine and OllyDbg to search for strings that match the move names, and also looked at what values changed before, during, and after executing the move, but neither seems to have done anything.</p>\n<p>I'm relatively new to the assembly language, but have quite a bit of experience in c++, c# and other languages.  </p>\n<p>I looked for questions similar to this one before posting it, but couldn't seem to find anything that would help.  If this has been posted before and I just missed it, sorry about that.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for any answers.</p>\n</div>",

That switch-case should read the <code>MSG</code> structure's <code>message</code> member for message types that belong to the keyboard. most commonly those are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646280(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>WM_KEYDOWN</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646281(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>WM_KEYUP</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646276(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>WM_CHAR</code></a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you've found the case handling those types, you should be pretty close to the function you're looking for. That case will most-likely do a few lines for code worth of parameter preparations and then call the function you're looking for.</p>\n</div>",

Depending on the game it might come from something like getchar() or be handled in a Windows message loop (assuming x86 Windows here since you mentioned OllyDbg).</li>\n<li>The condition for the breakpoint would be when the input data equals 'j'. You might get lucky and find a cmp/jmp (or similar) sequence for 'j' or 'J' in the disassembly, then you could just set a normal break point there.</li>\n<li>Run the game, and execute the combination on the keyboard.</li>\n<li>When the break point hits, you can then single step and keep track of the <code>call</code> statements that are hit, one of them is likely to be the function you care about.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
