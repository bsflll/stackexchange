As I use segment to separate something, now I want my name automatically shows in the following form<br/>\n<code>9     dseg_1234      the same as 2, but without data type specifier</code>,<br/>\nwhich is described in <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/609.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/609.shtml</a><br/>\nThe Java processor and loader can change the name representation to number 9 without any additional settings. However I failed to find any code relating to changing the name representation :(<br/>\nSo how does the Java processor change this option?</p>\n</div>",
