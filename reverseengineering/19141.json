And then selecting the <code>Startup and exit</code> under the <code>Debugging</code>. There you have an option to select where it will stop when executable is loaded.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/egAs0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/egAs0.png\"/></a> </p>\n<p>You probably have <code>System breakpoint</code> selected.</p>\n</div>",
