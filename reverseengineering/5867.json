I figured out one of the user login/passwords and am able to telnet in, but that's it. I have a drive that is attached which automatically mounts, which I can plug into my PC to add/subtract files.  I made a copy of the bash and busybox binaries (including a few others), and gave them <code>u+s</code>, hoping setuid root would give me some root privileges.  Unfortunately that did not work.  Running <code>bash</code> (<code>-rwsr-xr-x</code>), <code>id</code> still shows up as just user.  For some reason it doesn't seem to honor the setuid bit for bash or busybox (or a few others) to give me root privs.</p>\n<p>So, I had an idea, which brings me to my question: maybe I could compile a small C program, such as:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;\n#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\n\nint main()\n{\n   setuid( 0 );\n   system( \"/tmp/rootscript.sh\" );\n\n   return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which, maybe, would allow me to run a script as root.  Unfortunately, after a few days of trying to compile various versions of <code>gcc-mips</code> on various systems, I've not been able to do so.  Which leads me to ask if someone who already has the tools built would mind compiling the above code for me. I realize it's an odd request, but I guess it's come to this.</p>\n<p>Some potentially helpful info:</p>\n<pre><code>bash-3.00$ cat cpuinfo \nsystem type             : Viper\nprocessor               : 0\ncpu model               : MIPS 74Kc V4.12  FPU V0.0\nBogoMIPS                : 324.40\nwait instruction        : yes\nmicrosecond timers      : yes\ntlb_entries             : 32\nextra interrupt vector  : yes\nhardware watchpoint     : yes, count: 4, address/irw mask: [0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000]\nASEs implemented        : mips16 dsp\nshadow register sets    : 2\ncore                    : 0\nVCED exceptions         : not available\nVCEI exceptions         : not available\n</code></pre>\n<p>and</p>\n<pre><code>file /tmp/bash \n/tmp/bash: setuid ELF 32-bit LSB  executable, MIPS, MIPS32 rel2 version 1, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.12, not stripped\n</code></pre>\n<p>Any thoughts or advice from anyone?  Hopefully this counts enough as a \"reverse engineering\" post!</p>\n</div>",

If it's a [V]fat fs, there's no support for unix attributes.</p>\n<p>What exactly does <code>id</code> say? Anything about an euid? Like in</p>\n<pre><code># cp /usr/bin/id /usr/bin/suid\n# chmod u+s /usr/bin/suid\n# ls -l /usr/bin/suid\n-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 25152 Jul 16 08:42 /usr/bin/suid\n\n$ /usr/bin/id\nuid=1000(gbl) gid=100(users) groups=100(users)\n$ /usr/bin/suid\nuid=1000(gbl) gid=100(users) euid=0(root) groups=100(users)\n</code></pre>\n<p>You see, the special suid-version of id sets your effective uid, not the real one; but if they are different, id should report about it. If it doesn't, the problem is probably your mount options; if it does, chances are your C program would actually work, but in that case, it shouldn't even be neccesary.</p>\n<p>If you want a compiler that creates mips binaries, you might also find the <a href=\"http://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/Toolchains\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mips-Toolchains</a> page helpful.</p>\n</div>",

I didn't end up compiling my own program (as above), but I got close. I downloaded a large virtual machine file which already had the tools compiled (but it had errors with my program calling setuid). So I went another route: I grabbed the pre-compiled mips binary from <code>https://packages.debian.org/sid/super</code> and copied the binary file <code>setuid</code> onto the box with u+s set, root as owner. </p>\n<pre><code>$ id\nuid=1001(ftpuser) gid=1001(ftpuser) groups=1001(ftpuser)\n$ ./setuid 0 id\nuid=0(root) gid=1001(ftpuser) groups=1001(ftpuser)\n$ ./setuid 0 bash\nbash-3.00# id\nuid=0(root) gid=1001(ftpuser) groups=1001(ftpuser)\n</code></pre>\n<p>As they say on TV.. Bingo, bango, bongo.</p>\n</div>",
