    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to inject code to change the byte value of a CMP in an executable from 0 to 2 at runtime, in order to effectively no-op a boolean comparison as part of an effort to insert my own behavior. I have the offset of that single 0x00 byte in the file, as well as what I had thought was its virtual address - the file offset + the image base + the virtual address of the .text section.</p>\n<p>However, I was surprised by the fact that when I looked at this virtual address at runtime, I was in a completely different place in the code, in the middle of a bunch of 0xCC bytes.</p>\n<p>Looking at it more, I found out that in general my presumed virtual addresses are inconsistent. For example, here's a few opcodes at virtual address 0x00ebf5e0 (offset + imagebase + .text virtualaddr) as displayed by Ghidra:</p>\n<pre><code>55                push ebp\n8B EC             mov  ebp, esp\n83 EC 1C          sub  esp, 0x1c\nA1 90 74 43 01    mov  eax, dword ptr [0x1437490]\n33 C5             xor  eax, ebp\n89 45 FC          mov  dword ptr [ebp - 4], eax\n</code></pre>\n<p>And here is a few opcodes dumped in memory, by directly reading from the same address (<code>(unsigned int8_t*)0x00ebf5e0</code>):</p>\n<pre><code>8B 01             mov  eax, dword ptr [ecx]\n89 45 F8          mov  dword ptr [ebp - 8], eax\n89 5D E4          mov  dword ptr [ebp - 0x1c], ebx\n83 FB 10          cmp  ebx, 0x10\n72 04             jb   0x11\n8B 3E             mov  edi, dword ptr [esi]\nEB 02             jmp  0x13\n8B FE             mov  edi, esi\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've tried pretty much anything I could - directly addressing, obtaining the image base pointer through psapi.h <code>GetModuleInformation</code> (which unsurprisingly turned out to be equal to <code>0x400000</code>), including and not including the <code>0x1000</code> (<code>.text</code> vaddr), etc. The only interesting result this has brought is that at the very start of the image base, the bytes and opcodes do in fact check out - which has me thinking that this issue has something to do with alignment.</p>\n<p>Note: As per dumpbin, the executable has relocations stripped. It is also 32 bit.</p>\n</div>",

I have no idea what's going on in here; the addresses are apparently relocated for some reason but the CMP should be unchanged, right? This whole thing has me so confused. I even dumped the entire image from memory and analyzed it in Ghidra and nothing makes sense. Also, would you happen to know any other place where I could ask other knowledgeable people about this?</span>",

There were some weird differences such as a certain MOV operating on EBP as opposed to ESI on disk (which I now think is related to thread-local storage, since apparently the Windows linker does rewrite things?), but I managed to get it work.</p>\n</div>",
