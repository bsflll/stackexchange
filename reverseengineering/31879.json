    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am self learning reverse engineering and working on reversing a firmware image for an unknown ioT device that's running on Zephyr. I have the firmware image (.img file), which returns '<em>Linux kernel ARM64 boot executable Image</em>' when running the <em>file</em> command. I've tried running <em>binwalk</em> to extract anything meaningful, but all I get is the Linux kernel ARM64 image and text. My question is, is it even possible to boot this image and how can I go about this?</p>\n</div>",
