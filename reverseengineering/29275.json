            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">I concur with the existing answer for the most part. However, have you considered Samba? AFAIK the Samba devs have meanwhile even been able to work with some folks at MS and AFAIK it is possible to run it as a full-fledged DC. Since you can peek into the Samba sources, it should be possible to figure out which knobs to turn in order to change the domain name <i>after</i> initial configuration. You could even create the initial Samba AD by joining it as AD into an existing domain. AD LDS <i>might be</i> (but I'm not 100% sure) another option.</span>",

A couple off the top of my head:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>running services on the client</li>\n<li>DNS queries</li>\n<li>services reachable on the domain controller</li>\n<li>LDAP queries</li>\n<li>changes to the client registry</li>\n<li>timesync settings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. you get the idea. I think you would have to spend more time faking the domain membership based on what each piece of malware is looking for, than it would take to run up a DC. If you have a Windows server VM snapshotted, you could just run <code>dcpromo</code> each time, or even better, automate the whole deployment.</p>\n</div>",
