It includes programs for decompiling AS2 &amp; AS3.</p>\n<p>Some of the tools listed there include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ActionScript Extractor</li>\n<li>SWFWire Decompiler</li>\n<li>JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler</li>\n<li>JP ActionScript decompiler (ASDec)</li>\n<li>HP SWFScan, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to disassemble AS3, then I highly recommend <code>SWFDump</code>.</p>\n<p><strong><code>swfdump</code></strong> (part of <strong><code>SWFTools</code></strong> package) will decompile AS3 and will work in Mac as long as you follow the instructions in their <a href=\"http://www.swftools.org/faq.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">FAQ</a> to compile the tool set for Mac.</p>\n<p>The current collection is comprised of the programs detailed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>SWFDump</code></strong> Prints out various informations about SWFs, like contained images/fonts/sounds, disassembly of contained code as well as cross-reference and bounding box data.</li>\n<li><strong><code>SWFStrings</code></strong> Scans SWFs for text data.</li>\n<li><strong><code>SWFC</code></strong> A tool for creating SWF files from simple script files. Includes support for both - ActionScript 2.0 as well as ActionScript 3.0.</li>\n<li><strong><code>SWFExtract</code></strong> Allows to extract Movieclips, Sounds, Images etc. from SWF files.</li>\n<li><strong><code>AS3Compile</code></strong> A standalone ActionScript 3.0 compiler. Mostly compatible with Flex.</li>\n<li><strong><code>SWFCombine</code></strong> A multi-function tool for inserting SWFs into Wrapper SWFs, contatenating SWFs, stacking SWFs or for basic parameter manipulation (e.g. changing size).</li>\n<li><strong><code>PDF2SWF</code></strong> A PDF to SWF Converter. Generates one frame per page. Enables you to have fully formatted text, including tables, formulas, graphics etc. inside your Flash Movie. It's based on the <code>xpdf</code> PDF parser from Derek B. Noonburg.</li>\n<li><strong><code>JPEG2SWF</code></strong> Takes one or more JPEG pictures and generates a SWF slideshow from them. Supports motion estimation compression (h.263) for better compression of video sequences.</li>\n<li><strong><code>PNG2SWF</code></strong> Like <code>JPEG2SWF</code>, only for PNGs.</li>\n<li><strong><code>GIF2SWF</code></strong> Converts GIFs to SWF. Also able to handle animated gifs.</li>\n<li><strong><code>WAV2SWF</code></strong> Converts WAV audio files to SWFs, using the L.A.M.E.

(Notice: this tool is not included anymore in the latest version, as ffmpeg or mencoder do a better job nowadays)</li>\n<li><strong><code>Font2SWF</code></strong> Converts font files (TTF, Type1) to SWF. <br/></li>\n<li><strong><code>SWFBBox</code></strong> Allows to read out, optimize and readjust SWF bounding boxes. <br/></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><code>SWFTools</code></strong> has been reported to work on Solaris, Linux (both 32 as well as 64 bit), FreeBSD, OpenBSD, HP-UX, Solaris, MacOS X and Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista.</p>\n</div>",

I've only used the Windows version but I believe their features should be mostly similar. They have a feature to export FLA from a SWF file which works very well for most cases.</p>\n<p>Their product page mentions</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Support Flash CS3/CS4/CS5/CS5.5/CS6 and ActionScript 2.0/3.0.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sothink.com/product/flash-decompiler-for-mac/\">http://www.sothink.com/product/flash-decompiler-for-mac/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Freeware:</strong></p>\n<p>I do not know of a good freeware solution. If you'd like to use AS3Extractor on your Mac, you can consider running Wine (install via <a href=\"https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew\">Homebrew</a>). AS3Extractor also mentions that they have a dependency on <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2&amp;displaylang=en\">Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package</a> so do take note!</p>\n</div>",
