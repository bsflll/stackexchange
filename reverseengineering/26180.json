    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm reversing some windows drivers, and IDA never converts numbers to their corresponding major function name like IRP_MJ_CREATE = 0x00, how can i force this? is there anyway i can convert a number to major function name?</p>\n<p>ALSO : why doesn't IDA convert it itself? for the first parameter of IoBuildSynchronousFsdRequest is always a major function number, why can't ida just name its MAJOR function name instead of giving me its number?</p>\n</div>",
