Apparently, my friend used it to protect some script, except it's not a python script, it's a few TXT files. Is it possible to reverse engineer it so I can see whats in the actual TXT files? I have the:</p>\n<pre><code>from pytransform import pyarmor_runtime\npyarmor_runtime()\n__pyarmor__(__name__, __file__, b'\\x50\\x59\\x41\\x52\\x4d\\etc`, 2)\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>thing still.\nAny help appreciated!</p>\n</div>",
