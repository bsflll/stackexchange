    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm using x32dbg and I've set a hardware memory breakpoint. It triggers successfully for a specified module and the debugger pauses and a message on the bottom says:</p>\n<pre><code>Hardware breakpoint (byte, read/write) at mscorlib.ni.69`9d3d9 (6919d3d9)!\n</code></pre>\n<p>All good so far. Now naturally I want to go to address <code>6919d3d9</code>, which I assume to be the starting memory address of the code that accessed my target memory location.</p>\n<p>So I go to Breakpoints view (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>) double click on the breakpoint and it gets me to Dump, ie the memory view.. This is where I'm confused. I can't find out how to go to address <code>6919D3D9</code> to see the disassembled instructions. Kindly help if you can.</p>\n</div>",
