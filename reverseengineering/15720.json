    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am new here and I have a question for you guys</p>\n<p>(<strong>C++</strong>)\nI will try to describe my situation with some details so that you can understand this better. This might be long(er) but it might be necessary to explain this to someone who doesn't know how this (scripthook) works</p>\n<p>I am playing <strong>GTA 5</strong> and there's a library file made by unofficial person called <strong>ScriptHookV</strong>.dll. It's main purpose is to enable modding, it hooks to the game and allows us (modders) to call the game's <strong>native functions</strong>, such as: <code>VEHICLE::VEHICLE_CREATE</code>, \n<code>PLAYER::PLAYER_SET_WANTED_LEVEL</code>, \nand so on. ( full list here: <a href=\"http://www.dev-c.com/nativedb/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.dev-c.com/nativedb/</a> )</p>\n<p>However, this modding works in a way that you download sdk from \n( <a href=\"http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/</a> ) \nand you can use sdk to make your own mod, it provides those native functions so you can use and compile it. </p>\n<p>When it gets compiled it gets compiled with .asi extension (actually its a dll renamed to asi) and you need to place it in gta 5 main folder and when you launch the game, scripthookv.dll and other file called dsound8.dll will take care of loading that .asi file</p>\n<p>However, as you see what I've described, it works in a way that scripthook file itself loads .asi files into the game and executes their code by itself. And what i'm trying to do is i would like to have my own program from which i can use ScriptHookV.dll 's native functions to manipulate gta 5 singleplayer, but i don't have the source code of that dll.</p>\n<p>So I am wondering what to do now..</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I want to manipulate GTA 5 singleplayer with functions that ScriptHookV.dll provides by using my own program, but I don't have source code of that dll</p>\n</div>",

            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">i'll explain usage example as it's quicker, regularly scripthook does the job of loading mods and stuff, but i don't want to make a mod, they always depend on the scripthook and they must be in gta 5 folder, a standalone exe would be better because you can manipulate gta 5 from outside of it's folder and it's easier in my opinion. I am aware that both exe and script would run pretty similar (as both use scripthook dll functions) but i would like to do it in a standalone exe instead because i prefer it more and i think its better ^^ and this would be good for me, learning how to do stuff</span>",

You can edit game's memory from outside the same as from within gta 5 folder I guess I could even externally completely edit memory myself to do my own functions, but that sounds too complicated for my skill level. But, couldn't I somehow insert scripthook in the game with my program and execute scripthook's provided functions from my program?</span>",
