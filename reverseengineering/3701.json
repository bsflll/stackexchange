    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Whenever I attach a process in OllyDbg v1.10 on my Windows 7 64-bit machine, I notice that the first saved EBP on the stack doesn't point to the very base of the stack. Instead it points 16 bytes before it.</p>\n<p>To illustrate what I mean, see the following screenshot:\n<img alt=\"screen-shot of OllyDbg stack window\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VYfxb.png\"/></p>\n<p>The EBP (highlighted in gray), which is right above the <code>RETURN to ntdll.76FC9F45</code>, is pointing to <code>1B05FFEC</code>.

However, I've used the code snipped from my previous comment to get the stack base address. Then I read DWORD after DWORD using <code>memcpy</code>, from base to top, and those 16 bytes at the beginning are still there.</span>",
