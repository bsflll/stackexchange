However, you defined that variable as a <code>char</code> which the standard does not enforce sign-ness for, so the compiler is not obligated to sign-extend that variable assignment.</p>\n<p>But the most important part is that only when you replaced the <code>char</code> with an <code>int</code> you created a variable 4 bytes long that could actually be sign extended.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, removing the minus mark obviously removed the <code>NEG EDX</code> instruction.</p>\n<p>If you didn't, looks like you still need to change the assignment line (<code>str[32] = *(a+6);</code>) to treat the destination as a dword sized array, because you're interested in assigning the entire dword. Your code will still have <code>MOV BYTE PTR SS:[EBP-20],DL</code> instead of <code>MOV DWORD PTR SS: [EBP-20],EDX</code> unless you have something like <code>(int*)str[8] = *(a+6);</code></p>\n<p>I replaced the 32 with an 8 because we're indexing 4-byte long array instead of a single byte long array.</p>\n</div>",
