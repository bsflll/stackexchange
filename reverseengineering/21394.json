The closest you can get is using iteration (<code>@@</code>), and printing the stack like this:</p>\n<p><code>[0x10000b4a1]&gt; pxw 16 @@=rsp rsp-16 rsp-32 rsp-48</code></p>\n<p>(For more lines, you simply add additional <code>rsp-?</code> elements).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this method has several disadvantages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you need a variable amount of lines, that won't do. You can either use an external command to generate the elements (via <code>@@c:</code> or <code>@@=``</code>), or contribute to radare2's iterator code (located in <code>r_core_cmd_foreach</code>, in <code>libr/core/cmd.c</code>), which currently supports only positive direction (you'd need to add support for negative stepping).</li>\n<li>For certain hexdump formats (such as <code>px</code>, which is the default format used in panels view), a header is added to the output, and when using an iterator, which results in multiple command executions, the header will appear over and over again.</li>\n<li>For some reason, this kind of iteration does not work in panels view.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'd recommend opening a feature request (or implementing it and contributing to the project), to support reverse printing direction.</p>\n</div>",
