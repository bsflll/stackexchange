    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am currently learning to use ghidra, and I found the Symbol Tree.</p>\n<p>Ghidra found some namespaces that I would like to export.\nThese namespaces don't even have to be readable, just reusable, such that I can use them in another application.</p>\n<p>Is there any way in Ghidra to export those namespaces in a reusable form? And if not, what would be my best bet of achieving this?</p>\n<p>Some additional information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The namespace is written in Visual C++ or C++.</li>\n<li>The application is running on windows, and so is Ghidra.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If any more information or clarification is needed, please tell me.</p>\n</div>",
