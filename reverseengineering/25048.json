    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a Toyota ECU from 2005 with an NEC 76F0004GD micro controller on it, I have already read the full 512k dump from the chip using a K-Tag. However, when I tried to put it into IDA, there weren't any options for this architecture! I checked Ghidra as well, no luck. I don't have a problem adding a new processor to IDA using the SDK, but I can't seem to find ANY information about this chip online! </p>\n<p>Anyone have any clues?</p>\n<p>Many thanks,</p>\n<p>Zephurah</p>\n</div>",

You need to find out what CPU core it’s using (e.g.  V850) and look for that. </p>\n<p>There may be hundreds or thousands of different chips using the same instruction set, it would not make sense to list them all as separate processor entries. </p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I could find a datasheet for a NEC <strong>µPD76F0018</strong> which says it uses a <strong>V850E</strong> Family core, so I suspect yours is a V850 too (E or non-E).</p>\n</div>",
