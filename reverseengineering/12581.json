    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am currently analyzing a disassembled library file(.so) for in x86. There is a function called <code>get_random_key</code> and I can't make any sense out of it. It's more than weird and I personally think this is not even allowed due to memory restrictions. Here's the code for it(disassembled with IDA):</p>\n<pre><code>sub_685     proc near       ; CODE XREF: get_random_keyp\n    mov ecx, [esp+0]\n    retn\nsub_685     endp\n\npublic get_random_key\nget_random_key  proc near       ; CODE XREF: get_generated_key+15p\n    call    sub_685\n    add ecx, 1AFFh\n    lea eax, [ecx+3Ch]\n    retn\nget_random_key  endp\n</code></pre>\n<p>From what I see here it loads the content on top of the stack, adds 0x1AFF(6911!!) to it and then interprets this as pointer and adds 0x3C to it and returns. It's a fairly small library and it's likely that it's originally written in C. I can't think of ANY code that would produce something like this. In my eyes this results 9/10 times in a segmentation fault. It's a library that gets loaded into an android app via Java and is around 6kb big. </p>\n<p>I'm glad for every hint on this function :)</p>\n</div>",

If it's about deciphering this library just for the sake of it, this comment won't be helpful. If you just want to gain access to that App-API attach a debugger to the Android App, call the native function and catch the response (use IntelliJ's \"Evaluate Expression\" window while in debug mode).

The call to <code>sub_685</code> gets the address of the instruction after the call into <code>ecx</code>. The <code>1AFF</code> is probably the offset from that instruction to the data segment, and <code>3C</code> is the address of the variable in the data segment. Or, <code>1AFF</code> is the offset to a structure, and <code>3C</code> the offset to a member of that structure.</p>\n</div>",
