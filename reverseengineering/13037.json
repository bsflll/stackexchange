    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have been tracing through my binary and converting it to C code so I can understand it easily. As I am going through the instructions and functions, I keep stumbling upon code that don't make sense. \nFor example:</p>\n<pre><code>ROM:080004B8                 CMNNE.W         R4, #1\nROM:080004BC                 BEQ.W           loc_80007DE\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code will never branch.\nAnother example:</p>\n<pre><code>STRB.W          R0, [SP,#0x18+var_18] @ where var_18 is -0x18\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which is similar to indexing an array in C like this \"array[5-5]\". Why is this happening? Is this the disassembler? A form of obfuscated code that is trying to frustrate me? A poor compiler? </p>\n</div>",

A value from the stack is loaded to R0, shifted, and saved in R0 (the value in the stack does not get updated). The next line loads a different value from the stack which removes the shifted value from the line before. What is the point of these instructions that have no purpose?</span>",

It may change when parameters for a function/method/subroutine are pushed, when the programmer uses things like <code>alloca</code>, and for other reasons as well, depending on the compiler and processor.</p>\n<p>This makes tracking the position of arguments and local variables quite hard. For example, code like <code>f(i++)</code> may result in something like</p>\n<pre><code>mov r0, [sp, #8]     ; read the variable\nmov [sp], r0          ; put it on the argument stack\nsub sp, sp, #4        ; adjust the stack pointer\nadd r0, r0, #1        ; calculate the ++\nmov [sp, #12], r0    ; write back result\n</code></pre>\n<p>which is a version that makes the change to <code>sp</code> visible; normally, that change will be hidden in something like <code>stmfd sp!, {r0}</code></p>\n<p>In such cases, it's quite difficult to see that the \"read\" and \"write\" operations access the same address in memory while the <code>sp</code> value has changed.</p>\n<p>This is why decompilers like IDA assign names to those locations - as an example, let's assume in my example the variable is named <code>var_4</code> with a value of 4.</p>\n<p>Now IDA can emit</p>\n<pre><code>mov r0, [sp, var_4+#4]     ; read the variable\nmov [sp, var_4+#8], r0     ; write back result\n</code></pre>\n<p>with <code>var_4</code> hinting at \"the same variable\", and the <code>#4</code>/<code>#8</code> at the offset from <code>[sp]</code> that needs to be added to <code>var_4</code> in each of these cases.</p>\n</div>",
