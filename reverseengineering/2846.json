I have read many tuts about finding the SEND function. But they are not helpful in finding in my case.</p>\n<p>So i started as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I first attached the game client in ollydbg.Then found all the executable modules.</li>\n<li>Then opened the <code>client.exe</code>. Further i searched for all intermodular calls.</li>\n<li>Then I searched for the SEND function. I got Five <code>SendMessage()</code> functions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From this step I don't understand what to do further.</p>\n</div>",

You asked for finding the function that sends packets to the server, this is your answer and it seems to be valid according to your feedback. You'll need to provide more details what you want to achieve. This is also better to do in a new question.</span>",
