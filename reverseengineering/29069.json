    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have following intel processor <code>4th Generation Core Processor (Haswell U/Y)</code>.\nI want to check the value of <code>PMBASE</code> register in the processor. For that I have downloaded the processor datasheet, where I found that <code>PMBASE</code> is present at B:D:F <code>0:1:0</code>. Here is the screenshot\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ET0ns.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ET0ns.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>The VID and DID of the device are mentioned below (from the same datasheet)\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/z0U7J.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/z0U7J.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>But, now when I am doing <code>lspci</code> from my linux machine, I am not seeing device <code>0:1:0</code>. I have even checked with chipsec tool. Even there I am not seeing any device with device id <code>0x0c01</code>. <br/>\nAny reason why such discrepancy is there?</p>\n</div>",
