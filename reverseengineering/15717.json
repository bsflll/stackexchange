In that case, you will also need to edit the file adder to account for a new section.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>if the app is packed or protected in any way from patching, then you can not just patch it on disk just like that. You'll need to unpack it, patch as explained above and repack (or not) back.\n\n<ul>\n<li>or you can create runtime patcher in this case, which is more complicated to do. </li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>UPDATE:</p>\n<p>To automate the on-disk patching, one can use a pretty easy way which is based on some pattern matching and a little bit of heuristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>with the help of disassembler try to find some distinguishable bytes before the patch area </li>\n<li>do the same for the area after the patch area</li>\n<li>if appropriate, find the same for the patch itself:\n\n<ul>\n<li>for example if there is a control flow change, try to analyze the target of that change for some pattern.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>All the above will be sufficient (hopefully) to accommodate version changes and assure that you change at the right place. Such patcher could be easily coded with Python. For disassembling you can use <a href=\"http://www.capstone-engine.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Capstone</a> library which has Python binding.</p>\n<p>Take into account that, you fill make OSX complain about this patched app as it will not be signed any more.</p>\n</div>",

I have to replace the original executable with modified one to run the patched app.  So instead of doing this manual process in every Mac, I want to create a app patcher which should patch the original app and produce the modified one. It Is much like dynamic patching so how can dynamically patch that Mac app?</span>",
