However that being said I'd recommend IlSpy over Reflector. Both of them will decompile the program into the intermediate language to roughly the same results but I've had better experiences (i.e. smoother, easier) parsing variable values using IlSpy.</p>\n<p>But if it's your own code and you remember what all of your variable values are then either one will work fine. Just my two cents.</p>\n</div>",
