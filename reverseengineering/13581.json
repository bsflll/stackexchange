We could just upgrade the firmware, but that wouldn't be any fun and so I thought this might be a learning opportunity to play with Binwalk.</p>\n<p>All of the tutorials assume you already have a binary and I am not even sure if there is a way to non-destructively extract the firmware out of an existing router.</p>\n<p>I ran a full port scan on it and only TCP/80 and TCP/1783 are active...so TFTP doesn't look like an option.</p>\n<p>Any pointers would be appreciated.</p>\n</div>",

Obtaining that, along with NVRAM settings should be a good representation of the firmware.</p>\n<p>Also if you have hardware access, there is a chance of a UART console in form of pads/pins on your router's PCB. Connecting that to a cheap ~$5 USB serial might allow you to pause your router early in the boot process and extract the firmware out via tftp, assuming u-boot which is very common.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.devttys0.com/2012/11/reverse-engineering-serial-ports/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.devttys0.com/2012/11/reverse-engineering-serial-ports/</a></p>\n<p>(devttys0's blog is an excellent read on router-hacking)</p>\n</div>",
