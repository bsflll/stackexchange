Is this compatible with a better known CPU?</p>\n<p>Is there any (free) tool that could help? Like an extension for Ghidra, which <a href=\"https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions#what-processors-are-currently-supported\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">reportedly</a> does not support this instruction set out of the box?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Update: I'm now wondering how far the CPU can be from the <a href=\"https://wiki.superfamicom.org/65816-reference\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">65(C)816</a> of SNES fame.</p>\n</div>",
