    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to reverse engineer the key fob of my Ford Fiesta 2014 but I am stuck at finding the used checksum algorithm. I've successfully demodulates the key fob signal (using on-off keying + manchester encoding) and identified different type of bytes (see below).</p>\n<pre><code>|---b1---|---b2---|---b3---|---b4---|---b5---|---b6---|---b7---|---b8---|---b9---|---b10--|\n|preamble|-------------------------rolling code-------------------------|counter*|checksum|\n|01010101|10110100|01010110|11101111|00011011|11011001|10100011|11111001|01100111|01111000|\n\n*counter: this byte is also used for the commando, the last 4 bits are different for OPEN,\nCLOSE, TRUNK while the first 4 bits is a counter.\n</code></pre>\n<p>As the preamble is the same for all packets I assume it is not used in calculating the checksum. I am pretty sure it is <strong>not a CRC</strong> as I tried finding the CRC polynomial by bruteforcing (+bruteforcing the final XOR) but found no matching model (using <a href=\"https://github.com/nitram2342/bruteforce-crc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/nitram2342/bruteforce-crc</a>).</p>\n<p>I have tried some other standard checksum methods (XOR, 2s complement, modulo 256, ...) but without success. I have read other stackexchange posts about finding the checksum algorithm but couldn't apply them to my packets. I am stuck with this problem for a few days now and it seems that I am not making any progress.</p>\n<p>These 3 packets might be helpful as they only differ in the first 3 bits of the 7th byte (b7) and the first 4 bits of the counter (b9).</p>\n<pre><code>|---b1---|---b2---|---b3---|---b4---|---b5---|---b6---|---b7---|---b8---|---b9---|---b10--|\n|preamble|-------------------------rolling code-------------------------|counter-|checksum|\n|01010101|10110100|01010110|11101111|00011011|11011001|10100011|11111001|01100111|01111000|\n|01010101|10110100|01010110|11101111|00011011|11011001|10100010|11111001|01101000|01001110|\n|01010101|10110100|01010110|11101111|00011011|11011001|10100111|11111001|01101011|01001101|\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here are some more packets:</p>\n<pre><code>|preamble|-------------------------rolling code-------------------------|counter-|checksum|\n|01010101|10110100|01010110|11101111|00011011|11011001|10100011|11111001|01100111|01111000|\n|01010101|10110100|01010110|11101111|00011011|11011001|10100010|11111001|01101000|01001110|\n|01010101|00010111|11110101|01001100|10111000|01111010|01011010|10100001|01101001|10100000|\n|01010101|00010110|11110100|01001101|10111001|01111011|01011011|10100000|01101010|10100101|\n|01010101|10110100|01010110|11101111|00011011|11011001|10100111|11111001|01101011|01001101|\n|01010101|00010001|11110011|01001010|10111110|01001100|01011100|00001000|10110100|01010011|\n|01010101|00011001|11111011|01000010|10110110|01000100|00001001|01010100|10110101|00011000|\n|01010101|10011001|01111011|11000010|00110110|11000100|11011100|11010100|11100000|00100001|\n|01010101|01000100|10100110|00011111|11101011|00011001|00001001|11010101|11100001|01001110|\n|01010101|01000101|10100111|00011110|11101010|00011000|00001000|11011110|11100010|11110110|\n|01010101|01010100|10110110|00001111|11111011|01011001|00011001|11001101|00100001|10111101|\n|01010101|01010101|10110111|00001110|11111010|01011000|00011000|11001110|00100010|00000101|\n|01010101|10011011|01111001|11000000|00110100|10010110|11001111|11010110|00100011|11011011|\n|01010101|01010001|10110011|00001010|11111110|01011100|00011100|11001000|00100100|00111001|\n|01010101|10011001|01111011|11000010|00110110|10010100|11001001|11010100|00100101|01101111|\n*these packets were not all recorded sequentially as you may notice some gaps in the counter.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am new to the reverse engineering and signal processing scene so excuse me if I am not using the right terminology or if I am overlooking some simple things. \np.s. please don't steal my car :)</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT 1</strong></p>\n<p>I found these packets where the checksum is the same that might help:</p>\n<pre><code>|preamble|-------------------------rolling code-------------------------|counter-|checksum|\n|01010101|10110100|01010110|11101111|00011011|11011001|10100010|11111001|01101000|01001110|\n|01010101|01000100|10100110|00011111|11101011|00011001|00001001|11010101|11100001|01001110|\n\n|01010101|01010001|10110011|00001010|11111110|01011100|00011100|11000010|00101110|10111101|\n|01010101|01010000|10110010|00001011|11111111|00111101|00011101|11000011|00001111|10111101|\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
