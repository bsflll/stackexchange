    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a malware sample that I know is acting as a bot and connects to a botnet. The problem is that it uses no known protocol that I am familiar with (it's IRC-like) and doesn't actually do anything until it is issued commands.</p>\n<p>How can I explore behavior that can be issued to it via a C&amp;C server? I was thinking of possibly using symbolic execution on the part of the program that receives commands? Static analysis would be tedious since the code is obfuscated.</p>\n</div>",

With a bit of hackish code I was able to get several commands out of the binary.  I had previously already tried simulating the network with INetSim, but stepping through the code was too tedious to do for each command.</span>",
