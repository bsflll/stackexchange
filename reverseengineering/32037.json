    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Normally in CLI apps you can use <code>Ctrl + c</code> / <code>Ctrl + d</code> to terminate/exit, but they don't seem to do anything in <code>r2</code> - at least not in debugger's <code>v</code> (visual) mode, which is how I use it. To exit, I press <code>q</code>, then type \"exit\", and have to press <code>y</code> twice to confirm quitting and killing the process, which is quite tedious.</p>\n<p>Is it possible to terminate a visual debugging session and exit <code>r2</code> with a single key combination ?</p>\n</div>",
