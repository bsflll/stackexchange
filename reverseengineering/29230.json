That doesn't necessarily mean it's encrypted (but that's a possibility).</p>\n<p>I'm assuming that it's a savegame file and you are probably looking to change some value (like the amount of money your character has). You could try opening this file in a hex editor (I like <a href=\"https://hexed.it/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hexed.it</a>). That way you will be able to read some values from this file instead of getting those weird symbols you get in N++.</p>\n<p>Furthermore you should read up on endianness and encoding to better understand what you are seeing.</p>\n</div>",

I love this game and my goal is just to know about future events to better save my resources when needed.</span>",

I tested your software online it is the same result, understandable series of characters.  I saw on another topic a software to find in which language it is encrypted, but I am not able to use it (not enough knowledge in programming).
