Not for Poached eggs!</p>\n<p><strong>I downloaded the firmware</strong> update payload motorola srecord SREC format concatenated with a big blob of data like BMP &amp; i18n files. i used ghidra to look inside the code SREC : ARM 32bit/16bit big endian. </p>\n<p><strong>Qemu emulation</strong> with unicorn framework: i traced mcr instructions. it seems the firmware is configuring the MPU this way:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/j6nJQ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"MPU's layout\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/j6nJQ.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XGXma.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"base address\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XGXma.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Recon</strong> Then i was able to id \"Boot_console_put(char *)\" function and a memory address where the firmware write char by char all the boot  message related strings: <strong>0x3402f404</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pw3NZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"0x3402f404 used to place boot console char\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pw3NZ.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Console Output</strong> Then the emulated firmware update payload seems to be stuck on a loop when trying to acces and I2C slave (could be the eeprom) printing this:</p>\n<pre><code>[boot] entering HW_MCASIC_init\n[boot NVM] I2C: SDA seems stuck low!\n[boot NVM] I2C: SDA seems stuck low!\n[boot NVM] I2C: SDA seems stuck low!\n</code></pre>\n<p>the code dealing with I2C seem a bit too much convoluted for a rapid understanding</p>\n<p><strong>The question</strong> :  i would like to guess What are all the others address the firmware is referencing in the code. Searching google and github for similar constant/base address &amp; offsets didn't help... google search result returning off topic commercial links.</p>\n</div>",
