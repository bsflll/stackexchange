(win32k.sys is kinda like stub to other drivers)</p>\n<p>Because I have a crash that occurs only when enabling special pool specifically on <code>win32kfull.sys</code> by <code>verifier /driver win32kfull.sys /flags 0x1</code>. It doesn't crash when enabling special pool on <code>win32k.sys</code> or <code>win32kbase.sys</code>. Is this case weird?</p>\n<p>Also, what would be the general setup regarding turning on the special pool when fuzzing <code>win32k*.sys</code>?</p>\n</div>",

Ask it there, higher chance of getting an answer and higher chance of getting it from someone working on a team that maintains these drivers. Of course you may want to cut down on the notion that you're fuzzing stuff ;)</span>",

The reason I asked is because I couldn't get all 3 drivers to have special pool turned on so was wondering whether turning it on <code>win32k.sys</code> will have similar affect. Now I got all 3 to have special pools turn on, but still the other question I must find out.</span>",

It looks like your memory corruption is in a memory chunk allocated in <code>win32kfull.sys</code>, that's why enabling special pool on this driver alone leads to a crash, and enabling it on other drivers does not.</span>",
