I get no errors and nothing in the Windows event viewer. </p>\n<p>I am using the latest version of immunity from their website. </p>\n<p>Is there anywhere else I can look for the cause of the problem? Is this a known issue? Does anyone know how to fix this problem? </p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n</div>",

I had Python 3.5 installed on my Windows 7 laptop.  Immunity would open and then immediately close.  I installed Python 2.7 and, when I launched Immunity Debugger, it came up perfectly.  So, in addition the your environmental variables, also be careful about which version of Python you're running!</p>\n</div>",
