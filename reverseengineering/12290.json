    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am writing a PinTool, which can manipulate certain register/memory value. However, after manipulation, one challenge I am facing now, is the <code>deadloop</code>. </p>\n<p>In particular, due to the frequent manipulation of certain register value, it is indeed common to create <code>deadloop</code> in the execution trace. I am thinking to detect such case, and terminate the execution.</p>\n<p><strong>So here is my question, what is a good practice to detect a <code>deadloop</code> in a PinTool?</strong> I can come up with some naive solutions, say, record the executed instructions, and if certain instruction has been executed for a large amount of times, just terminate the execution. </p>\n<p>Could anyone help me on this issue? Thank you.</p>\n</div>",

Once the area identified, you can open the tool in IDA to do further inspection or \"connect\" your source to debugger.</p>\n<p>Another way, is to log every Trace or basic block that is executing - check in the examples. This log should also show you the problematic area.</p>\n</div>",

The exit condition has one of the control-transfer instructions (jz, jg, ja...) that keeps the loop going. So it's enough to log the control-transfer instructions.</p>\n<p>Logging the instructions can be expensive, and you may need to narrow the algorithm to specific thread and module.</p>\n<p>You may also want to consider to diagnose the infinite loops to know more about the cause before implementing algorithm to detect it.</p>\n</div>",
