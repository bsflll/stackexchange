(Alternativeely, you can probably fiddle with the DNS entries/hosts file of your client to make game.server.com == 192.168.2.2)</p>\n<p>Then, use this stunnel.conf:</p>\n<pre><code>[game]\nclient = yes\naccept = 80\nconnect=game.server.com:443\n</code></pre>\n<p>You could possibly use stunnel if you set up two tunnels if you can't patch the client - one stunnel https server to connect your client to, which forwards to an stunnel http server, which forwards to the real https server, but i've never done that.</p>\n<p>The third possibilty is <a href=\"http://mitmproxy.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mitmproxy</a>, which might be even closer to what you need. I gave up on getting it to work on my Centos 5 system, but if you have a newer linux, it might be the easiest way to get what you want.</p>\n</div>",

These tools will show you the entire request, response, and body of all network traffic and timeline of when connections are made. In Chrome, you can even edit the page content and review how it affects the page.  These are very powerful tools for reverse engineering the DOM and request structure. </p>\n</div>",

However, if the application does verify SSL and throws an error if encryption is stripped, one option is to create your own SSL certificate pair and add it to your OS certificate trust store like so: </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://pubs.vmware.com/view-51/topic/com.vmware.view.installation.doc/GUID-2D968AD7-ED62-46CA-B2B2-CCC526CA09F5.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pubs.vmware.com/view-51/topic/com.vmware.view.installation.doc/GUID-2D968AD7-ED62-46CA-B2B2-CCC526CA09F5.html</a></p>\n<p>If the application checks the authenticity of an SSL certificate against your OS certificate trust store and forces encrypted traffic, you can spoof the endpoint while retaining a non-stripped, 'valid' encrypted session between the application and a proxy which receives a SSL encrypted session from your host using the self-signed certificate and reencrypts using a non self-signed certificate. Thereby you have an encrypted session that appears valid and non-stripped to both ends of the session with a man-in-the-middle attack. </p>\n</div>",
