The exact problem I'm facing is how to study the HTTP connection. Would it be possible for someone to explain the procedure a bit more clearly.</p>\n</div>",

A network sniffer would be the most useful here. <a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">Wireshark</a> (especially it's <a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChAdvFollowTCPSection.html\">Follow Stream</a> feature)for example. Also , some browser plugins can be useful, for example <a href=\"https://getfirebug.com/\">Firebug</a>, <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tamper-data/\">TamperData</a> and <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/poster/\">Poster</a>.</p>\n<p>Appart from that, it's just the matter of replicating what the browser does. \nBasically, http communication consists of either GET or POST requests and replies (there are other requests tho and you should look into <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html\">RFC2616</a> for more details). So, by looking at HTTP streams in Wireshark, you could deduce what kind of request gets sent to the web application, and what kind of reply it gets. Some (or most, even) of this info can be deduced by studying the html source of the webpage since the html form element will have the parameters and action url specified. </p>\n</div>",

Using sniffers and proxies is overkill if you can access the web page/resource with a browser. In this case you only need to automate what the user does within the browser and using tools like <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chrome Developer Tools</a> for inspecting the HTML and AJAX connections.</p>\n<p>I've written several articles on this subject if you want to take a look:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.databigbang.com/google-search-no-api/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Search NoAPI</a> (automating Google searches)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.databigbang.com/automated-browserless-oauth-authentication-for-twitter/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Automated Browserless OAuth Authentication for Twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.databigbang.com/web-scraping-ajax-and-javascript-sites/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Web Scraping Ajax and Javascript Sites</a> includes a LOT of resources in the end about offline/headless browsers and browsers emulation like <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HTMLUnit</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For applications that has some anti-scraping techniques you can take a look at <a href=\"http://blog.databigbang.com/running-your-own-anonymous-rotating-proxies/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Running Your Own Anonymous Rotating Proxies</a></p>\n<p>If there is some specific requirement that is not covered there please don't hesitate to leave a comment and I will help you on that.</p>\n</div>",
