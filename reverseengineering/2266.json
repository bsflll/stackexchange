This appears to be the equivalent of gcc's -O3<br/>\n<code><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/k1ack8f1.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">/Oy</a></code> Omit frame pointers. (x86 only)<br/>\n<code><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/we6hfdy0.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">/GR-</a></code> Disable Run Time Type Information<br/>\n<code><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/2kzt1wy3.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">/MT</a></code> flag is used to static link the various libraries.</p>\n<p>Visibility - I don't think  the MSVC compiler has any options to turn off visibility like <code>-fvisibility=hidden</code> offered in gcc, but is this necessary for MSVC since the debugging symbols are stored in the PDB file?</p>\n<p>Are there any other things I should include to ensure minimal information is distrubuted in the application?</p>\n<p>(I might add that I am creating a standalone executable)</p>\n</div>",
