One entry of interest is the REG_BINARY key InstallTime. I have an idea of what the dates are supposed to be based on program install times. Actually, more curiously, it has different values under HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node</p>\n<p>First line is under HKCU\\SOFTWARE, second is under HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node</p>\n<p>11/30/16<br/>\nCBHome</p>\n<pre><code>46 f2 f7 39 8d 4b d2 01\n46 f2 f7 39 8d 4b d2 01\n</code></pre>\n<p>7/1/01<br/>\nCBPro</p>\n<pre><code>85 53 c1 13 18 3a c1 01\n7d 49 8e f1 93 02 c1 01\n</code></pre>\n<p>11/2/22<br/>\nCWViewer</p>\n<pre><code>94 01 d7 b8 37 ef d8 01\n94 01 d7 b8 37 ef d8 01\n</code></pre>\n<p>It wasn't until I put this together that I realized that they match except for the second one.

Your use of American date formatting in the question supported my conclusion.</span>",
