In IDA, I disassembled ac_client.exe as a portable executable and tried to search for that address in the subview window with no results. This address is definitely in the actual game. How would I make IDA include more subview addresses so I can find that function address?</p>\n<p><strong>Can't Find Address</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nQ9xk.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Missing Addresses\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nQ9xk.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
