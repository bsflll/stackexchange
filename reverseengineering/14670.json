Pat file from ida.\nI can generate Sig file from .pat files But i can not use them . when i load a file in ida pro with my new CPU module and try to load the signiture the signiture is empty (I guess that ida is filtring signutures with cpu type ) </p>\n<p>How to tell Sigmake about the CPU type . the sigmake tool has - p option that normally sets the cpu type but i am not able to use it correctly . ida has the same command line switch - p that can be used like this - pmipsel (cpu is mipsel ) . But in sigmake it gives \" ill processor id \" error. \ni tried using my cpu id defined in the cpu module but ida dose not show the sig file   </p>\n</div>",

There are a few things that can help:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All menu actions can be linked to IDC funtion via the IDA configuration files found in the cfg directory inside the IDA installation path (3 files starting with ida)</li>\n<li>Read inside the source files. They're fairly well documented.</li>\n<li>Read the IDA Pro book second edition</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Apart from that you might even be able to do it without the IDA GUI: <a href=\"http://www.hexblog.com/?p=128\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.hexblog.com/?p=128</a></p>\n</div>",
