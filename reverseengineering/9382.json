That function validates that the virtual addresses of the bytes to be patched are within a section's memory space at run-time (based on the section's virtual address and the section's virtual size). Since the bytes you're patching are after the end of the section's virtual size, <code>ConvertVAtoFileOffsetEx()</code> returns <code>0</code> and the patches are never applied.</p>\n<p>As a workaround, I'd recommend patching the virtual size of the section to which you're appending those new bytes. Whatever the current virtual size is, make it <code>14</code> bytes bigger in the PE section's header.</p>\n<p>You can use a tool like <a href=\"http://www.ntcore.com/exsuite.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Explorer Suite</a> to make this change by navigating to the file's <em>Section Headers</em> and increasing the value in the target section's <em>Virtual Size</em> field:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Explorer Suite\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/59oUX.jpg\"/></p>\n</div>",
