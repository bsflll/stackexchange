    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am a student interested in Android Security. I was trying to modify a APK file using baksmali and smali. However, I am not able to run the repackaged app in my mobile. When I click on the icon it say \"Unfortunately, test has stopped\" and exists. (Even the icon of the app got changed, now I see default android icon instead of old real colorful icon of the app)    </p>\n<p>What could be the reason for this ? Actually I haven't even modified code of the apk file. I just unzipped apk to get dex file, then I converted it to smali using <code>baksmali.jar</code>, and then back to dex using <code>smali.jar</code>. Finally zipped and signed. </p>\n<p>What I have done in detail:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Decompress the apk file</p>\n<pre><code>$   Unzip test.apk\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Convert 1classes.dex1 to smali</p>\n<pre><code>$ baksmali -x classes.dex -o smaliClasses\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Converted the classes back to <code>classes.dex</code> (replaced old <code>classes.dex</code>, in fact I did not add any new code to smali file. I wanted to know whether this works first).</p>\n<pre><code>$ smali smaliClasses -o classes.dex\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Zip all the files to <code>test.zip</code></p>\n<pre><code>$ zip test.zip AndroidManifest.xml classes.dex res META-INF resourses.arsc\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Rename <code>test.zip</code> to <code>test.apk</code></p>\n<pre><code>$ mv test.zip test.apk\n</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now I believe I have to sign the APK again, please correct me if am wrong here.</p>\n<p><strong>Edited</strong>:</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><p><code>java -jar signapk.jar testkey.x509.pem  testkey.pk8 test.apk  test-patched.apk</code></p></li>\n<li><p>I tried to install the new repackaged APK. Using adb shell. Adb shell showed it successfully installed. However, I am not able to run the repackaged app in mobile. The App crashes when I click on it. It says \"Unfortunately, test has stopped\".</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why doesn't the repackaged app running ? I don't understand what I am missing here ?</p>\n<p><strong>Edited</strong>:</p>\n<p>I tried to repackage the same app using apktool. I extracted the smali files using it and repackaged. But why repackaging is not working with baksmali, smali, zip and signapk. Is zipping the real problem in this procedure? I see the size of the app is reduced drastically when I zip it and rename it to .apk compared to the original apk file :| </p>\n</div>",

This time app got installed in phone. However, when I click on the app it crashes saying \"\"Unfortunately, app has stopped\". One thing I noticed is size of the repacked apk is lesser than the orginal, is it the zip tool reason for that change is size ? Any clue on why the app crashes ? How do I get a log for this?
