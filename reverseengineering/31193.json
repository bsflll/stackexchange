    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So, I wanted repurpose some old boarding gate scanners and I'm trying to make use of their commands.</p>\n<p>Now, I have a dump from an actual boarding gate PC and I've noticed that the commands only work if I send them as they are on the dump. If I change even a single byte, the scanner rejects the command. After some Googling, I came across the term 'CRC' and now I understand why that is the case.</p>\n<p>I played around with some CRC calculators, but the scanner seems to have its own algorithm and I have trouble figuring it out.</p>\n<p>For instance, the command that displays a message on the scanner's display is 'AD;MG#P#ATESTMESSAGE'.</p>\n<p>Here's an example from the dump:</p>\n<pre><code>02 30 80 41  44 3B 4D 47   23 50 23 41  4E 4F 54 20  .0.AD;MG#P#ANOT\n49 4E 20 55  53 45 0D 42   0D FF 03 3A  12           IN USE.B...:.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I noticed that the same exact command is sent in one more way that's slightly different:</p>\n<pre><code>02 31 80 41  44 3B 4D 47   23 50 23 41  4E 4F 54 20  .1.AD;MG#P#ANOT\n49 4E 20 55  53 45 0D 42   0D FF 03 3B  92           IN USE.B...;.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Although the message is the exact same, the difference in the command header seems to have an effect on the last two bytes.</p>\n<p>All command headers either start with '02 30 80' or '02 31 80' depending on the response header of the scanner. Kind of like 'ping-pong' (I couldn't think of a better way to describe this).</p>\n<p>I have tried decompiling <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/jdQm1zq0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the scanner's firmware</a> but I can't seem to locate the method where it checks for the CRC.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pastebin.com/rGDqLuDi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Here's a few more command pairs</a> in case they help.</p>\n<p>Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>\n<p>P.S: I'm a completely new to all this, in case you couldn't tell.</p>\n</div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>These are simple XOR checksums.  Here's how they work using a short message as an example:</p>\n<pre><code>STX |&lt;------------- data --------------&gt;|s1 |s2 \n\n 02  30  80  41  44  3b  43  57  ff  03  66  e4 \n</code></pre>\n<p>The values <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> are calculated separately over only the data portion; the start of text (STX) character is not used for the check bytes.  Here's pseudo-code with all quantities being 8-bit values.</p>\n<pre><code>s1 = 0\ns2 = 0\nfor (each b in data)\n    s1 = s1 ^ b\n    s2 = ror(s2) ^ b\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>ror</code> here stands for \"rotate right\" which rotates the 8-bit quantity to the right by one bit:</p>\n<pre><code>         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\nBefore:  | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |\n         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n\n         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\nAfter:   | 0 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |\n         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n</code></pre>\n<h2>How I figured it out</h2>\n<p>I noticed that, ignoring the last two bytes, each pair of messages differed by a single bit, b<sub>0</sub> (the low bit).  The <code>s1</code> byte also differed by only the low bit, so I guessed something like a sum or XOR.  Doing an XOR over all bytes except the first (<code>02</code>) and the last (<code>s2</code>) yielded 0 for all samples, so that was <code>s1</code> figured out.</p>\n<p>For <code>s2</code>, the pairs of message also differed in only a single bit, but the position was different for each pair, so I assumed it was a linear operation and I guessed that there was some rotation happening that would shift the position of the changed bit depending on the length of the message.  After a few guesses, I hit upon the algorithm described above.</p>\n<p>Also the changing bit <code>30</code> or <code>31</code> was probably a \"toggle bit.\"  Many serial protocols employ one.  The idea is that for each message sent, the bit changes so that way it's possible to tell whether the message is a duplicate or a new message.  Any retransmitted message would leave the bit unchanged; only new messages change the state.</p>\n<h2>In Java</h2>\n<p>I don't much like Java, but if that's what you're using, this is an implementation that works.</p>\n<pre><code>public class MyClass {\n    public static byte ror(byte c) {\n        return (byte)(((c &gt;&gt; 1) &amp; 0x7f) | (c &lt;&lt; 7));\n    }\n    public static byte[] getXOR(byte[] data) {\n        int s1 = 0;\n        int s2 = 0;\n        for (byte b : data) {\n            s1 = (s1 ^ b);\n            s2 = ror((byte)s2) ^ b;\n        }\n        return new byte[]{(byte)(s1), (byte)(s2)};\n    }\n    \n    public static void main(String args[]) {\n      byte[] data = new byte[]{0x31,(byte)(0x80),0x41,0x44,0x3B,0x43,0x57,(byte)(0xFF),0x03};\n      byte[] x = getXOR(data);\n\n      System.out.println(String.format(\"%x %x\", x[0], x[1]));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
