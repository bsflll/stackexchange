I don't know the exact algorithm that's being used (but it's not base64, I tried decoding). Here's a<a href=\"https://hastebin.com/xogagaruqa.lua\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a> to one of the encrypted responses that I receive.</p>\n<p>My question: can someone tell what encoding this is, or how can I proceed from here?</p>\n</div>",
