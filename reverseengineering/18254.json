I'm trying to make a patch for a software &amp; when I compare this two file the only change I have seen in line 12 &amp; 26. </p>\n<p>As I'm not a java coder so I don't know how to do that but I read some articles &amp; it suggests that to change a compiled java class there is only two way either get the source code or edit with bytecode editor. I tried to decompile the jar file but it shows huge error. So java byte editor is the only option.</p>\n<p>I want to know how to change these parameters without decompiling the class file in java byte editor.</p>\n<p>Please help me.</p>\n</div>",
