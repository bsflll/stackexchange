It is quite inefficient and do not scale at all when I try to analyze big binaries.</p>\n<p>I know that IDAPro is having a data-base to store comments and a memory zone, but, in case we do not want to use IDAPro, what techniques or (free) tools are you using to collect your notes and to display it properly ?</p>\n</div>",
