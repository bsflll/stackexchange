    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a binary compiled in Rh850 using green hills compiler from the looks. Luckily, it still symbols attached ,but I am struggling to read the symbols and it is worth my time to demangle them. Is there a script or better yet a rule set that I can extract somehow to start this process? I am wanting to avoid the whole compiling binaries until I solve all the symbols myself.</p>\n<p>I assume there is a symbol conversion table or something documented somewhere, but either will be great.</p>\n<p>I found a couple of scripts, but they are very incomplete.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Chadderz121/ghs-demangle\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/Chadderz121/ghs-demangle</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jackwakefield/ghs-demangler\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/jackwakefield/ghs-demangler</a></p>\n</div>",

Also, please amend your question to tell us what exactly seems to be missing. But given what you've already found, it appears to be either verbatim or a modification of the GNU C++ symbol mangling.</span>",
