    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>In LX format description in section\n3.13 Fixup Record Table, when describing <code>SRC = DB Source type field</code> there is such an option:</p>\n<p><code>06h = 16:32 Pointer fixup (48-bits).</code></p>\n<p><strong>1. How many bytes does this fixup change and how?</strong> I found a particular example of such fixup, it points to 2nd byte of a certain jump instruction:</p>\n<p><code>66EA665544332211  jmp dword 0x1122:0x33445566</code></p>\n<p>I assume it at least changes 4-byte offset (33445566), but does it also change 16 bit selector (1122)?</p>\n<p><strong>2. Where can I find more in-depth description of different fixup kinds?</strong> IBM doc seems to assume it to be common knowledge.</p>\n</div>",
