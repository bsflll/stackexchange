    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a library DLL which I'm trying to analyze, and I have a basic understanding of its function and behavior (and can modify some input to affect how long certain operations will take to execute/how often it will execute), but I'm not sure where exactly in the DLL the functions which I know exist are located, and finding them by following program flow manually in a disassembler is non-trivial. It would be very helpful to be able to have some sort of \"flame-graph\" code coverage tool which would show me how many times a given line of assembly has been executed. I don't need function calls or anything like that, just the raw number of executions per line (or CPU time per line) from some kind of sampling.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as a library DLL, it has to be called from another process, and in this case must be called by a very specific program.</p>\n<p>Is this possible with a DLL that doesn't have any debugging symbols attached? Or am I asking for a holy grail?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div>",

            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">Hi and welcome to RE.SE. Coverage is typically measured on instrumented binaries. But an emulator (e.g. Unicorn Engine) or symbolic execution via Angr could work here. The more difficult part is that this all happens from another process. Code lifting may be a better approach then, provided the DLL doesn't implement any protection methods or checks its integrity (e.g. code-signing). And yet another approach could be a combination of the above with a DLL placement attack and a proxy DLL <i>you offer</i> which provides the same exports but forwards them to the <i>real</i> DLL. Question is a bit vague.</span>",

It seems a bit abandoned, though.</span>",
