And, it would be nice to know if there are ways to extract the real shape of the control-flow of the program.</p>\n</div>",

Here's a typical graph of a function which had this obfuscation applied:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Xk4L6.png\"/></p>\n<p>As you can see, all edges between basic blocks - both conditional and unconditional - has been redirected to a dispatcher node which uses a new artificial variable to decide which block should be jumped to next. This variable is updated at the end of each separated basic block.</p>\n<p>Here's the dispatcher node:</p>\n<pre><code>LDR    R3, =0xF26A85D2\nADD    R3, R2, R3\nCMP    R3, #0x40 ; switch 65 cases\nADDLS  PC, PC, R3,LSL#2 ; switch jump\n</code></pre>\n<p>It uses <code>R2</code> as the control value.</p>\n<p>And here's one of the basic blocks:</p>\n<pre><code>LDR  R2, =0x853FD863 ; jumptable 00532EFC case 33\nLDR  R1, [SP,#0x130+var_108]\nSTR  R2, [SP,#0x130+var_134]\nLDR  R2, =0xD957A31\nSTR  R1, [SP,#0x130+var_44]\nB    loc_532ED0\n</code></pre>\n<p>It updates <code>R2</code> with the value which will be used to jump to the next block.</p>\n<p>Recovering it shouldn't be <em>too</em> difficult in most cases - just track the control variable updates and replace jumps to the dispatcher node with jumps to the next block corresponding to the new control variable value.</p>\n</div>",
