    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So I'm trying to hack the translation from the PS4 version of a game into the Vita version. The script files were conveniently uncompressed, and I was able to drop them in and have it working without a hitch - great!</p>\n<p>However, various other message files and quest summaries and the like are not so convenient.</p>\n<p>Here's a comparison of two files in a hex editor:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iih4q.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iih4q.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>At first I thought it was a simple byte-pair compression, but there's obviously more to it than that, because if you look at the places which correspond to \"Let's go!\" and \"Let's do this!\" they don't start with the same string of characters at all.</p>\n<p>I uploaded the PS4/Vita versions of a file with rather more readable text:\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/bw0nvexyi9ww2be/hm%20vita?dl=0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/bw0nvexyi9ww2be/hm%20vita?dl=0</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/sk74zadvndc8v9t/hm%20ps4?dl=0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/sk74zadvndc8v9t/hm%20ps4?dl=0</a></p>\n<p>Going through it and looking for common and recurring words, I found this:</p>\n<pre><code>Goblin Thief\n´0Ö0ê0ó0·0ü0Õ0\nB430 D630 EA30 F330 B730 FC30 D530\n\nGoblin Thief Archer\n´0Ö0ê0ó0·0ü0Õ0¢0ü0Á0ã0ü0\nB430 D630 EA30 F330 B730 FC30 D530 A230 FC30 C130 E330 FC30\n\nAncient Grief\n¨0ó0·0§0ó0È0°0ê0ü0Õ0\nA830 F330 B730 A730 F330 C830 B030 EA30 FC30 D530\n\nGrief Screamer\n°0ê0ü0Õ0¹0¯0ê0ü0Þ0ü0\nB030 EA30 FC30 D530 B930 AF30 EA30 FC30 DE30 FC30\n\nGrief\nEA30 FC30 D530\n\nThief\nB730 FC30 D530\n</code></pre>\n<p>So you can see that FC30 D530 is \"ief\".\nBut then I look for more occurences of \"gr\"</p>\n<pre><code>Deep Grudge\nÇ0£0ü0×0°0é0Ã0¸0\nC730 A330 FC30 D730 B030 E930 C330 B830\n</code></pre>\n<p>And you don't see the EA30 that starts off \"Grief\".</p>\n<p>I have a feeling FC30 could be some kind of switch byte, either an upper case indication or possibly marking the use of some kind of lookup table? It's also interesting that all the lines which are just objectives/boss names have the --30 structure, but some of the descriptive passages don't seem to.</p>\n<p>The additional problem, of course, is that the uncompressed English text from the PS4 version <em>won't</em> be a 100% perfect match for the text from the Vita version -- that's the whole point, after all! So even when I look at the name \"Deep Grudge\" and notice that I don't see anything which looks like it would correspond to the \"Gr\" from \"Grief\", I can't be <em>certain</em> that they didn't change the name in the PS4 version.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how I should be approaching this? If I'm right and there's actually some kind of compressed lookup table business going on, then it might be effectively impossible to reverse, right?</p>\n</div>",

The digits are translated in a very straightforward way, but the exclamation point (\"!\") is <code>0x21</code> in ASCII or UTF-8 but <code>0x01ff</code> is the Unicode \"fullwidth exclamation mark\" encoded as UCS-2 (that is, UTF-16 encoded as little-endian).</p>\n<p>So with the hint about encoding we can see that the hex you've identified as \"Goblin Thief\"</p>\n<pre><code>b430 d630 ea30 f330 b730 fc30 d530\n</code></pre>\n<p>is rendered as ゴブリンシーフ which is the Katakana representation of the English words \"Goblin Thief\".  It's common for Japanese speakers to render foreign words into phonetic equivalents with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Katakana</a>.  So taking it syllable-by-syllable we have:</p>\n<pre><code>ゴ  go\nブ  bu\nリ  ri\nン  n\nシ  shi\nー  (extended vowel)\nフ  fu\n</code></pre>\n<p>So if we say it aloud, \"go bu ri n shi-i fu\" sounds like \"Goblin Thief\" as pronounced by a native Japanese speaker.  You can try <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/?hl=en&amp;tab=TT#view=home&amp;op=translate&amp;sl=ja&amp;tl=en&amp;text=%E3%82%B4%E3%83%96%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC%E3%83%95\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Google translate</a> to experiment a bit more and to see and hear what this sounds like.  </p>\n</div>",
