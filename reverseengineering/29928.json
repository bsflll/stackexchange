It could be a false positive, but I didn't run it yet.</p>\n<p>So far I've tried to open it with IDA, Radare2, and Ghidra, but all of them have problems when trying to parse the file:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IDA - \"the processor type 'cli' is not included...\",</li>\n<li>Radare - \"[w] Cannot open 'dbg://../a.exe' for writing.\", and</li>\n<li>Ghidra can't properly decompile it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I will look into those to see if I am missing something, and also tomorrow I'll try to run it inside a VM. Am I doing something wrong? Are there any other approaches that I'm missing or some way to analyze malware?</p>\n</div>",
