    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm looking for a way to export all infos about a function (Call signature including custom storage, local symbols, etc) in a ghidra program and import them into another ghidra program, but at a different address, and to do that automatically for 30-50 functions.</p>\n<p>This is within the context of a very large game executable, enough so that any form of full analysis is way too cumbersome for my needs, and each game patch shuffles most of the addresses. I already have most of that automated, but through manually defining serialiazation code for function elements like parameters, and was wondering if there was any better way.</p>\n</div>",
