There may be encryption, but some of the UDP packets have very small payloads, and using encryption would slow down packet processing which is the opposite of the key purpose for using UDP.. which is speed.</p>\n<p>For your second question, the LAN game is using UDP, and TLS needs TCP. If you think about the use case.. TLS/SSL is to verify that at least one end of the connection is who it says it is. If you're on the LAN, you don't know who is who (no DNS) and you don't care.. TLS makes no sense in this case.</p>\n<p>I think you're correct that the TLS connections are being used during user authN to the game servers. However, given that the session keys negotiated between 192.168.0.104 &lt;--&gt; game server are used to secure <em>only</em> communication between those 2 hosts, they would not be used between 192.168.0.104 &lt;--&gt; 192.168.0.100 on the LAN as they provide no value. They do not identify either host, and they slow down game performance.</p>\n<p>This is a little wordy but I hope it helps.</p>\n</div>",

So its weird that the LAN packets are encrypted</span>",
