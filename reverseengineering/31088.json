I have tried using TrID but no result from it. I have also tried using software like WinRAR, 7-zip etc, which cannot recognise the file.</p>\n<p>I do not think this is a known file extension since I have never seen it anywhere before, and the internet has no idea what it is when I try to search about it.</p>\n<p>I'd also love to ideally create an extraction tool so I can extract content from other file types ending in this .xbd format.</p>\n<p>I will really appreciate any help given, thank you :)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiEcsvCdfJY5g-557PGxRmGtbWKpfw?e=RdfW0D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">.xbd file download (OneDrive)</a></p>\n</div>",

This is in 'assets_p.dat' which is where the game files are. This is the link to the assets [link] (<a href=\"https://mega.nz/file/WVpHBK7K#XWjSZwxqdL4EdjXftVt91r96dad7JSXz97qsLr3N1cY\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mega.nz/file/â€¦</a>) The xbd file is located in audio. If this still isn't enough info let me know,</span>",
