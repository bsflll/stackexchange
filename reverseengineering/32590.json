    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to reverse an apk but there is a strange thing that happens, probably something new for me, basically if I decompile only the resources (not dex files) and recompile it zipalign/sign, the app installed works fine.</p>\n<p>If I decompile also or only the sources (dex files), recompile it then zipalign/sign the app remain stuck on splash screen or sometimes crash going to background.</p>\n<p>NO error messages from Android (crash dialog), NO usefull logs from logcat (I tried also making app debuggable and doing some trials), AFAIK NO signature verification methods or anti-tampering mechanism (I researched and added breakpoint on PackageManager methods, looking at some pattern for those mechanism and so on....), I was trying to look also the .so but I'm not so good at going through them (I don't have a good \"starting point\" to look at it).</p>\n<p>Then, I'm not able to understand what is happening. When I decompile sources, there is some poorly recompilation that I made? I tried everything, I'm using latest version of apktool (2.9.1) and so on...</p>\n<p>Just this, the decompilation / recompilation of dex files break the app (not loading the main activity) without any usefull stack trace.</p>\n<p>I will appreciate a lot your help, thanks in advance!</p>\n<p>(Tell me eventually everything you need, logs, bugreports from adb, informations, etc...)</p>\n</div>",

I'll suggest you to try out with MT Manager, as it tries to fix lot of problems while recompiling, that'll help to pin point the problem.</p>\n<p>Also, please try to provide a link to the sample apk.</p>\n</div>",
