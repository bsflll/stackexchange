    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'll be releasing a piece of software soon and I'm looking for good protectors. The three that came to my attention were: Enigma, Themida and VMProtect. I searched a lot online but I couldn't find many comparisons. They are all in a similar price range so that is not a huge problem. I was wondering what the main differences are between them? Virtualization, string encryption, packing etc. I couldn't find much info about that.</p>\n<p>All replies are appreciated! Thanks</p>\n</div>",

All details shown are from my own personal research.</p>\n<p>This comparison will only include the protectors I personally have a licence for: VMProtect and Themida. I do not have a licence to Enigma, so I cannot tell about its protection features.</p>\n<p>I will also not be including the licencing features of either, I will only be talking about the protection methods they employ.</p>\n<p>To get us started, here is the \"unprotected\" version of a simple loop function that we will be protecting with both protectors to see what they output.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/icsmw.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/icsmw.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>VMProtect</strong></p>\n<p>VMProtect has 3 protection modes: <em>Mutation</em>, <em>Virtualization</em>, and \"<em>Ultra</em>\" (both methods combined)</p>\n<p><em>Mutation</em> does what it says it does: it <strong>mutates</strong> the assembly code to make automated analysis of it harder. The resulting mutated code varies drastically per compilation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jCdNZ.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jCdNZ.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>On the other hand, <em>Virtualization</em> translates the code into a special format that only a special virtual machine can run. It then inserts a \"stub\" function to call the VM where the actual code was supposed to be ran.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/B3hka.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/B3hka.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Note that this VM inserts a lot of overhead. The original ~100kb application was increased to around ~600kb after protection using this method. You can decrease the size though by turning on the packing feature inside of VMProtect.</p>\n<p>There is also functionality for checking if debuggers are being ran, string encryption, methods of grabbing a unique identifier for the computers hardware, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Themida</strong></p>\n<p>Themida is a little different from VMP. While it also has the same protection features of VMP, it does it much differently and has a few more features that VMP does not have. Note though that these features that VMP does not have do not work on all application types.</p>\n<p>For Themida's <em>Mutation</em>, it does it quite differently to VMP. It adds lots of random operations to the assembly instead of specifically mutating each opcode.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1gMkw.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1gMkw.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Themida's <em>Virtualization</em> however has one cool feature that VMP does not: Multiple VM architectures. Themida has the ability to have different virtual machines (using a different architecture) inside of the same application. There is also different 'styles' of VM: some faster but less secure, some more secure but less fast, etc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DI7k0.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DI7k0.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Of course, the problem with this is pretty obvious: the size. A protected application with all protection options disabled is around ~2mb from the original ~100kb. Luckily, Themida also has a packing feature to reduce the size, where it reduced it to around ~1mb. </p>\n<p>Themida also has a few other features: <em>\"ClearCode\"</em>, where it clears the assembly after it ran, <em>\"Encode\"</em>, decrypting the code at runtime and re-encrypting it after it was executed, string encryption, and functions to check code integrity.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Both protections are quite good when used properly. Which one you buy is up to you, not me, so I would recommend you to choose wisely for the application you wish to protect and to see which features you specifically want.</p>\n</div>",
