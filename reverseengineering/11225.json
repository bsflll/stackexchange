If I understand correctly, <code>hbreak</code> tells the OS to monitor every instruction an compare the address of current instruction to the address of breakpoint (i.e. no modification of the in-memory image). However, the number of hardware breakpoints available at a time is limited.</p>\n<p>To place a hardware breakpoint with <code>hbreak</code>, your program must be already running with <code>gdb</code>'s <code>run</code>. To achieve that, you should place an ordinary breakpoint somewhere at the very beginning (let's say, <code>_start</code> function), successfully break there, place a hardware breakpoint and then remove the original ordinary breakpoint.</p>\n</div>",
