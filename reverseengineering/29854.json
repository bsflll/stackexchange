In real programs these \"value\" types will often point to complicated structures, which can require a detailed analysis of how it is used to work out the original data types.</p>\n<p>In this simplistic example the assembly is something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>sub     rsp, 24\nmov     DWORD PTR v$[rsp], 128                    ; 00000080H\nmov     eax, DWORD PTR v$[rsp]\nmov     DWORD PTR i$[rsp], eax\nlea     rax, QWORD PTR i$[rsp]\nmov     QWORD PTR j$[rsp], rax\nmov     eax, DWORD PTR i$[rsp]\nadd     eax, 2\nmov     DWORD PTR i$[rsp], eax\nmov     eax, DWORD PTR i$[rsp]\nadd     eax, 4\nmov     rcx, QWORD PTR j$[rsp]\nmov     DWORD PTR [rcx], eax\nxor     eax, eax\nadd     rsp, 24\nret     0\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we see the example of the \"constant\"</p>\n<pre><code>mov     eax, DWORD PTR i$[rsp]\nadd     eax, 2\nmov     DWORD PTR i$[rsp], eax\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can see the value at memory address $i[rsp] is loaded into eax, 2 is added to it, then the value is directly stored back in the memory address via</p>\n<pre><code>mov DWORD PTR $i[rsp], eax\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case we would use the \"constant\" follow on <strong>DWORD PTR $i[rsp]</strong> to find the value.</p>\n<p>However, with j we are instead getting a memory address held at <strong>$j[rsp]</strong> which points to the memory location of i. Instead of updating <strong>DWORD PTR $j[rsp]</strong> this time we are instead setting the value at the memory location held there.</p>\n<pre><code>mov     eax, DWORD PTR i$[rsp]\nadd     eax, 4\nmov     rcx, QWORD PTR j$[rsp]\nmov     DWORD PTR [rcx], eax\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this scenario we would use the \"value\" follow on <strong>$j[RSP]</strong> to find the value.</p>\n</div>",
