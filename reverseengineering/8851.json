    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>i have an ARMv7 Mach-O Executable on which I want to patch out a certain segment in the binary header which prevents DYLD injection. </p>\n<p>more information <a href=\"http://www.samdmarshall.com/blog/blocking_code_injection_on_ios_and_os_x.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> under point 3. of preventing dyld injection. TL;DR a  __RESTRICT binary header section with a __restrict segment prevents DYLD injection on iOS.</p>\n<p>Unfornatunately i'm not sure howto patch the file properly. Do I simply fill the file offset responsible for the LC_SEGMENT with zeros or do I remove it altogether (meaning cutting out and therefore altering file size and probably? breaking offsets)?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\n<p>Malte</p>\n</div>",
