How to proceed is very dependent on which of these executables you have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>If you have a <code>P-Code</code> program, all you could ever disassemble is the interpreter, and you won't learn much from tracing the interpreter while it interprets the original program.

If it's <code>P-Code</code>, I cannot help. If it's native, what you need to do is known as differential debugging. You can do it without using plugins or external tools <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/tutorials/replayer/trace_replayer.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">directly from IDA</a>.</p>\n<p>If by any chance you're running an old version of IDA that lacks that support, you can use <a href=\"https://github.com/joxeankoret/mynav\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MyNav</a>, a tool I wrote for doing differential debugging as a replacement for <a href=\"https://www.zynamics.com/binnavi.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BinNavi</a>, a tool that you might be able to use if your target is a 32 bits one.</p>\n<p>You might also want to take a look to this question: <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2565/trace-assisted-code-identification\">Trace assisted code identification?</a>.</p>\n</div>",
