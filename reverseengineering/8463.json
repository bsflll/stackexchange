This will probably be more complicated if we are talking about some custom and sophisticated packers.</p>\n<p>I also strongly suggest to avoid various automatic unpacking plugins as they leaving you without the understanding of the process.</p>\n<p>So in most cases unpackers (in terms of unpack process) will try to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>validate their payload</li>\n<li>allocate new memory to store the unpacked code (data). This will (in most cases) be done with the help of <code>VirtualAlloc(Ex)</code></li>\n<li>unpack routing will take the obfuscated code and write the clean one to the allocated space</li>\n<li>at the end of the process transfer control to the payload</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What you should try to do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>place the HW breakpoint on the <code>VirtualAlloc(Ex)</code> as there are packers which will check the preamble for the BP placements. Press <code>execute till ret</code> and at the <code>EAX</code> you will get the allocated memory area address</li>\n<li>right click on the <code>EAX</code> to follow the address in <code>Dump</code></li>\n<li>place the <code>Memory On Write</code> breakpoint or <code>HW on write</code> breakpoint which should get you to the actual unpack routine</li>\n<li>analyze the flow of the unpack routing to place another breakpoint at the end of the unpack process</li>\n<li>once the unpacking is done, right click on the <code>Dump</code> windows to save the unpacked payload to the file.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In your case, the payload will probably will not be the clean <code>MZ</code> file or in contrary, the unpack routing intentionally had crippled the payload.</p>\n<p>Probably this will be an iterative process as you also need to validate that the unpacked payload is actually the code. Try to use </p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Trace</code></li>\n<li>in addition place <code>HW on Execute</code> at the beginning of the unpacked payload</li>\n<li>dump unpacking routine / area and open it in IDA to understand (find) if there are any control transferring process near by.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Have Fun!</p>\n</div>",
