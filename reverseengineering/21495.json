Imagine that the code accidentally jumps to some random location. If some garbage bytes are there, the behaviour is undefined. </p>\n<p>However, in case where such a jump accesses <code>int 3</code> instruction, it will just cause <code>software breakpoint</code> in the debugger thus preventing udefined behaviour from happening and showing you that some strange jump happened and stopping the execution at this point, exectly as in the case you set a breakpoint there.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Moving <code>0xCCCCCCCC</code> just sets <code>4</code> contiguous bytes to <code>0xCC</code>.</p>\n</div>",

In such case, the compiler generates code which fills all stack variables with the byte 0xCC, so that any uninitialized value is clearly visible during debugging. \nSee also <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/11865164\">https://stackoverflow.com/a/11865164</a></p>\n</div>",
