I successfully changed the color from blue to red but I cannot change from blue to green because the string \"green\" is bigger than \"blue\" so it's overlapping the next instruction:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5edmo.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5edmo.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/X6aAk.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/X6aAk.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2cBBX.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2cBBX.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lXsXy.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lXsXy.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>So my question is what can I do ?</p>\n</div>",

You'd also need to update all the code referencing <code>\"blueColor\"</code> to use your new space address. One such candidate space could be strings describing segment and sections for <code>__TEXT</code> and <code>__text</code> respectively in the Mach-O header. Both of them will be exactly 16 bytes (padded with zeroes).</p>\n</div>",
