I have already found tools for disassmbling them into assembly code. The next step is converting them to C code. But I could not find any tool that works. I have already tried the following decompilers with no success: RecStudio, Boomerang, Decompiler 0.2.4, IDA Pro with Hex-Rays.</p>\n</div>",

You will probably need to do it yourself (write a decompilation tool) or do manual decompilation.</p>\n<p>I recommend you to give a try to writing a decompiler for your project if it's worth the effort: even if your decompiler is not very good, it will help you a lot in manual decompilation.</p>\n<p>BTW, manual decompilation is very tedious; perhaps \"horrible\" is a better definition... In my opinion, it's probably the most tedious task in RE.</p>\n</div>",

If you do find a tool for decompiling code for that processor family, it will be subject to the limitations that I laid out in <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/311/why-are-machine-code-decompilers-less-capable-than-for-example-those-for-the-clr\">this answer</a>.  In fact, for ROM dumps, the situation will be even more dire than what was described therein.  In short, machine code decompilation is not a point-and-click type of affair as it is for managed languages.</p>\n</div>",

I realize a couple of years have passed since you posed this question. During that time support for the 680xx family has been much improved. The current version (0.4.5) should be able to disassemble and decompile those binaries. The menu command <code>File</code> &gt; <code>Open as...</code> should allow you to open the a raw binary.</p>\n<p>Decompiler is available here: <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/decompiler\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sourceforge.net/projects/decompiler</a> (depending on whether SourceForge is back from its very prolonged outage).</p>\n<p>If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements / feature requests, don't hesitate to add them to the issue tracker.</p>\n</div>",
