    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have an offset to a property within a player class that I need to access data from. It's made of a specific struct that I have already assembled. IDA reports the accessing offset as so:</p>\n<pre><code>v32 = ( v3 + 280 ) // v3 is the player in this case\n</code></pre>\n<p>I want to convert this to the correct struct within my own C++ module so I can read a specific property of that struct. I can easily get the base address of the players but whenever I get the property it doesn't come out correct.</p>\n<p>I have tried something of the following:</p>\n<pre><code>playerData* lpData = reinterpret_cast&lt;playerData*&gt;((int)n_GetLocalPlayer() + 280);\n</code></pre>\n<p>But the struct isn't correct.</p>\n<p>There is NO doubt that the base address or offset are correct, as the function I reversed in IDA was short and well commented. I just need help casting it.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n</div>",
