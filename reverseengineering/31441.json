    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have an Infineon Tricore <strong>ELF</strong> file. I have a <strong>HEX</strong> file that has been patched with minor changes and new code appended (e.g. the hex from the ELF was exported and then had changes made to it manually effectively via a hex editor).</p>\n<p>How can I \"<strong>replace</strong>\" the hex within the ELF file but not lose all the other metadata in the elf file for processing?</p>\n<p>Is there any way to import a HEX into an existing ELF project and have it override the binary it has already extracted?</p>\n<p>I'm sure a tool could be written to do this, I'm just trying to save time and see if there is any existing functionality to do this. I am fairly inexperienced with <strong>Ghidra</strong>.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get all the function names/variables annotated in the new modified HEX file.</p>\n</div>",
