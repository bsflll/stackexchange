    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>i am struggling since a long time to determine the checksum of the following sequences. </p>\n<p>I have two examples.  </p>\n<p>Ex1: Have the same checksum and one have a payload incrementation  by 0x0A<br/>\nat the same position (Byte 8).</p>\n<p>Ex2: This one have the same checksum (9.byte).</p>\n<p>I am sure this are the checksum and is always 1 Byte.<br/>\nWhat I noticed is that the values of checksum is not bigger than 0x7F.<br/>\nI have many expamples but i see that it never grows up to 0x80.<br/>\nIt can also not 0xFF because 0xFF marks the sequenze as the end.</p>\n<p><strong>Example with paylod increment of 0x0A on the 8.Byte.</strong><br/>\n01: ED  0   1   0   1   0   0   00  29<br/>\n02: ED  0   1   0   1   0   0   0A  19<br/>\n03: ED  0   1   0   1   0   0   14  49<br/>\n04: ED  0   1   0   1   0   0   1E  79<br/>\n05: ED  0   1   0   1   0   0   28  4A<br/>\n06: ED  0   1   0   1   0   0   32  44</p>\n<p><strong>This examples has the same checksum (0x53):</strong><br/>\n01: E4  09  01  02  26  50  00  53<br/>\n02: E4  10  01  01  00  0F  00  53<br/>\n03: E4  14  01  09  42  09  41  53<br/>\n04: E4  15  01  14  48  08  03  53<br/>\n05: E4  01  02  21  02  50  00  53<br/>\n05: E4  01  02  22  22  52  00  53<br/>\n06: E4  01  02  22  31  05  00  53<br/>\n07: E4  02  02  02  10  0D  05  53</p>\n<p>I have tested various algorythms.\nFletcher, Adler32, BSD 8Bit are one of them.<br/>\nXor8 an some tests with shiftet bits and various modulus.<br/>\nI have xored the values but nothing of worth comes out.<br/>\nReveng gave me some results but not for all sequences.<br/>\nI am also sure that it is not a CRC but only a simple checksum.</p>\n<p>I have read many threads if there was a hint how i can reverse the checksum.<br/>\nBut i see nothing wich handles 7bit. I also look at the bits but i dont know on how to begin.</p>\n<p>I see some participations but dont see the relation.<br/>\nIn the first block I see that the checksum is ending in 0x09. (Set 1 - 4)<br/>\nIf the payload increases by 0x0A the checksum also increments by 0x30 (Set 2-4)\nuntil a specific point (Set 5).</p>\n<p>I am sure it is very simple. In german i would say \"ich sehe den Wald vor lauter BÃ¤umem nicht\".<br/>\nDon't know the correct translation in english. ;-)</p>\n<p>It would very appreciate if someone can point me the right direction.</p>\n<p>With best regards<br/>\nChris</p>\n<p>Edit:\n- replaced the word \"crc\" in the text by \"checksum\" for better understanding.<br/>\n  Tnx to JimmyB for the hint.</p>\n</div>",
