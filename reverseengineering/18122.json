IDA output window displays the following error message:</p>\n<pre><code>WaitForEvent() failed; please make sure that all unresolved bpts/expressions could be evaluated before continuing\n</code></pre>\n<p>or breakpoint is completely ignored. This command does not help either:</p>\n<pre><code>sxe ld:driver\n</code></pre>\n<p>I tried to replace the first byte of driver's <strong>DriverEntry</strong> code with <strong>CC</strong> opcode (<strong>int 3</strong>). After that virtual machine window silently closes.</p>\n<p>Does anybody know how to break on <strong>DriverEntry</strong> of such driver? Thanks.</p>\n</div>",
