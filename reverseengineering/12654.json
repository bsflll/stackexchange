    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So I got a couple super old chips from what looked like an arcade. The game-board they game with is OK I think. The CRT monitor is wrecked, however the chips are still good. </p>\n<p>I stuck them in my Chip reader and did a dump of them.Had a poke around to see if there was anything I could do with them, perhaps make an emulator ext. However I don't quite understand what it means. I'm not sure if there encoded, or if i'm trying to decode them with the wrong Character-set. I'm pretty sure these are the sting outputs of the game, I first thought, OK well there probably in another language. But google has no clue.</p>\n<p>Tried UTF-8, EBCDIC, etc.</p>\n<p>Whats posted is it in ASCII.\nGoogled the model number of the board, no dice.</p>\n<p>The chips where labeled U4-U8</p>\n<p>Here is a snipit of the first chip:</p>\n<pre><code>00047600  73 20 6f 20 61 20 6f 63  20 68 20 6f 62 65 64 77  |s o a oc h obedw|\n00047610  20 75 74 6e 74 20 6f 62  65 00 79 75 20 65 2c 72  | utnt obe.yu e,r|\n00047620  63 69 65 6f 65 6d 72 20  61 64 20 6e 20 74 6e 2e  |cieoemr ad n tn.|\n00047630  00 6f 63 20 68 20 70 69  20 75 74 6e 74 20 70 69  |.oc h pi utnt pi|\n00047640  20 20 61 72 69 74 20 77  20 61 64 2c 00 65 63 20  |  arit w ad,.ec |\n00047650  74 74 65 63 72 65 74 62  74 61 6f 6e 2e 20 6f 72  |ttecretbtaon. or|\n00047660  2c 6e 20 6c 63 6a 63 73  00 6f 20 6f 62 65 64 77  |,n lcjcs.o obedw|\n00047670  73 6f 20 70 69 20 61 64  2e 00 6c 79 72 77 6e 20  |so pi ad..lyrwn |\n00047680  69 68 36 63 72 73 61 20  31 70 69 74 20 72 6c 73  |ih6crsa 1pit rls|\n00047690  2e 00 65 6c 72 73 61 64  20 6e 31 20 72 6d 72 20  |..elrsad n1 rmr |\n000476a0  6f 6e 73 6f 20 6e 36 63  72 73 0a 54 79 74 20 6f  |onso n6crs.Tyt o|\n000476b0  62 65 77 6e 69 67 20 79  70 65 73 6e 20 6f 62 65  |bewnig ypesn obe|\n000476c0  75 20 75 74 6e 0a 20 63  73 63 75 74 68 67 2c 61  |u utn. cscuthg,a|\n000476d0  64 38 69 20 6c 61 73 61  70 73 2e 00 40 00 41 00  |d8i <a class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"f29e9381938281dcdcb2dcb3\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">[email protected]</a>.|\n000476e0  42 00 43 00 44 00 45 00  46 00 47 00 48 00 49 00  |B.C.D.E.F.G.H.I.|\n000476f0  4a 00 4b 00 4c 00 50 00  51 00 52 00 53 00 54 00  |J.K.L.P.Q.R.S.T.|\n00047700  55 00 56 00 57 00 4d 00  20 00 21 00 22 00 23 00  |U.V.W.M. .!.\".#.|\n00047710  24 00 25 00 26 00 27 00  28 00 29 00 2a 00 2b 00  |$.%.&amp;.'.(.).*.+.|\n00047720  2c 00 30 00 31 00 32 00  33 00 34 00 35 00 36 00  |,.0.1.2.3.4.5.6.|\n00047730  37 00 2d 00 00 00 01 00  02 00 03 00 04 00 05 00  |7.-.............|\n00047740  06 00 07 00 08 00 09 00  0a 00 0b 00 0c 00 10 00  |................|\n00047750  11 00 12 00 13 00 14 00  15 00 16 00 17 00 0d 00  |................|\n</code></pre>\n<p>I figured a group of security people would probably have seen encoding or encryption like this before and might point me in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Or hell, they might be encrypted, there was a label for \"Security chip\" on the board, however it was missing.</p>\n<p>Any idea what encoding this is, or if its encrypted?</p>\n<p>Dumps: <a href=\"https://mega.nz/#!W8UwiQBS!17g3GMBniRPBcqOuDXVGZZoYh1qOZAJzJIdh-rpk5kQ\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://mega.nz/#!W8UwiQBS!17g3GMBniRPBcqOuDXVGZZoYh1qOZAJzJIdh-rpk5kQ</a></p>\n</div>",

The font starts at space and continues well into accented characters, following <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Code Page 437</a>, all the way up to the capital <code>Ñ</code>. After that comes an <code>Ø</code>, followed by some specialist (probably in-game) characters. A very similar 8x8 character set starts at 0x75FEA. This strongly suggests a modern PC was used to create the game, and in-game texts are basically encoded as Code Page 437.</p>\n<p>About halfway into the combined file, there is a huge chunk of text for changing the settings; it starts around <code>PROGRESSIVE CONFIG SHOULD BE DONE ON A MASTER MACHINE</code>. Some of the texts are in Norwegian (?).</p>\n<p>The second pair is <strong>U5 + U8</strong>. Combining them shows it starts with the names of the sub-games: <code>DOUBLE-UP  KENO</code>, <code>SUPER DOUBLE-UP</code>, and so on. It also contains lots of detailed in-game help texts. The final half of the file is blank, consisting only of 0xFF bytes.</p>\n<p>I did not find a good reference for what CPU drives this, and I don't recognize code (probably) as Z80, Intel, ARM, or MC680XX. I also cannot readily determine if word data is stored little or big endian.</p>\n</div>",
