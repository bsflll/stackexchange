Note that at that point the change was only made to the IDB you're working on and not to the actual binary you loaded.</p>\n<p>Before applying the patches made to the original binary, I recommend you review them using the <code>Edit -&gt; Patch program -&gt; Patched bytes</code> option. To apply the changes, you need to use the <code>Edit -&gt; Patch program -&gt; Apply patches to input file...</code>. You should probably create a backup (the option's available in the dialog).</p>\n<p>Note that this is only possible if the segment you're trying to edit is not a <code>BSS</code> segment. Executables don't <em>contain data</em> for <code>BSS</code> segments because <code>BSS</code> segments are completely initialized to all zeroes by the executable loader.</p>\n<p>Note that in earlier versions of IDA the <code>Patch program</code> submenu was hidden by default and you had to set the <code>DISPLAY_PATCH_SUBMENU</code> configuration in <code>idagui.cfg</code> to <code>YES</code>.</p>\n</div>",
