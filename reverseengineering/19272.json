My command to run it from the command line is:</p>\n<p><code>ida64 -A -SC:\\path\\to\\script\\databaseAll.py C:\\path\\to\\ELFexecutable\\target0</code></p>\n<p>If I open the file in the graphical interface first and pack the database, then it works from the command line in creating the database correctly, but otherwise it has a lot of information that's missing.</p>\n<p>Am I doing something wrong? How do you properly run a script from the command line?</p>\n</div>",
