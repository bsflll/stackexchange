    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am developing a static analysis automation tool to help me on CTFs. It would be nice for me to discover from where a certain argument of certain functions is coming from (does it come from a writable section in the VAS? Or does it come from .rodata?). I have a need-to-know superficial knowledge of angr, I tried to look at the documentation and my approach would be to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Generate the CFG of the binary</li>\n<li>Get all the symbols of the binary and filter them for the functions I'm interested in</li>\n<li>Get to know from which address these symbols are being called</li>\n<li>Construct from the calling address its basic block and traverse backwards the CFG from it to find out how the corresponding register is being set</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Am I having the right approach? How would you implement this with angr?</p>\n</div>",
