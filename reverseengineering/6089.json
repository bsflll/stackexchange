I downloaded the source code from the website, compiled it into a .lib (smoothly), and this is what I get when I try to turn it into a .pat file:</p>\n<pre><code>plb.exe -v sqlite.lib\nsqlite.lib: invalid module at offset 143146. Skipping.\nsqlite.lib: invalid module at offset 2587742. Skipping.\nsqlite.lib: skipped 2, total 2\n</code></pre>\n<p>The resulting .pat file is empty and I cannot proceed to create the final file with sigmake.</p>\n<p>Google doesn't seem to indicate that anyone has ever had an \"invalid module at offset\" problem in the entire world, so I'm guessing this is pretty unique. I'm stuck. Help?</p>\n</div>",
