    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<h1>Problem Statement</h1>\n<p>I have a file composed entirely of data structures; I've been trying to find a tool that will enable me to open this file, and declare (perhaps) a type and offset such that i may work with the presumed primitive data type individually.</p>\n<p>e.g. I declare the 4 bytes located at offset 0x04 to be a 32-bit unsigned integer, and would like to inspect the value at this location (read as big-endian perhaps) and then work with this integer individually (perhaps see what it looks like encoded as a 4-byte ascii string and attempt to read it, etc.)</p>\n<h1>Specifics</h1>\n<p>I have a 4096 byte file containing C-structs with member elements as integers ranging from 16-64 bits in length; the following is an example:</p>\n<pre><code>struct my_struct {\nuint_32 magic\n} // sizeof(my_struct) == 0x04\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, magic = 'ball', and so when the file is opened in a text editor it reads as 'llab...', and obviously can also be represented as a 32-bit integer</p>\n<h1>Question</h1>\n<p>Is there a tool that enables static analysis of flat data structure files?</p>\n<h1>What I've considered thus far as a solution</h1>\n<p>I've considered writing a command line tool in Python to do this, but if something already exists I'd prefer to save time, and perhaps learn more about this topic by using a tool designed by someone more experienced. If it seems to you that I am going about this incorrectly (this is my first serious exploration into this kind of reversing) please guide my understanding, thanks.</p>\n<h1>Where I have already researched</h1>\n<p>Googled 'reverse engineering tools' and browsed the links</p>\n<p>Checked wikipedia's reverse engineering pages</p>\n<p>Tried some first principles reasoning</p>\n<p>Checked pypi</p>\n<h1>Results</h1>\n<p>There are three completely valid and correct answers, but I've marked the most detailed and least expensive of them as correct, because it is the most accessible to members of the community reviewing this question.</p>\n</div>",

It's not free, but it's more than worth the $90 price tag.</p>\n<p>Features I find most useful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>C-style struct syntax, supporting various arrays, string types, bitstrings, validity checks, etc.</li>\n<li>Customisable data inspector (useful if you only want to see data as a few types)</li>\n<li>Diffing</li>\n<li>Offset display (shows address offsets, selection size, etc.)</li>\n<li>Sequence highlighting (like \"highlight all\" on find)</li>\n<li>Bitwise operations, checksums, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
