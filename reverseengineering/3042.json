    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a proprietary file format that is a compressed database file. This database file has a few dozen tables. Each of these tables only have a few records, many of them don't have any records at all. A few of these tables contain fields that are stored as blobs of hex data. These blobs account for 99% of the disk space of the overall database file.</p>\n<p>As far as I can tell, these blobs are not compressed data (by using unix 'file' command). I have tried finding known values in these blobs by exporting values from the proprietary software, converting to hex and searching for that value in the database file. So far I haven't been able to find any matches. The problem is that the software can export in a myriad of formats and I'm not sure which one (if any) the data would be stored in.</p>\n<p>Most of the tables contain checksum fields, which I believe, are responsible for my inability to edit the blobs and see what changes in the proprietary software. This combined with the fact that I cannot directly change the values that I wish to extract from the proprietary files leaves me in a difficult position.</p>\n<p>Does anybody know any tricks for trying to tease out time series data from binary data?</p>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>\n<a href=\"http://pastelink.me/dl/4e6d0c#sthash.Co5cEOJS.dpuf\" rel=\"nofollow\">This zip file</a> contains 2 hex blobs (index and value) from the decompressed database and the same data as it is exported from the program.</p>\n</div>",

The third and fourth dwords may be flags of some kind and do not appear to point to data. This lops off the first 16 bytes, hence my guess the 2nd dword is 'data length'.</p>\n<p>Right after this header comes that familiar pair <code>78 9C</code> again, so I brought out my zlib decoder wrapper. Unpacking <code>value.hex</code>, starting at offset 0x10, and using <code>TINFL_FLAG_PARSE_ZLIB_HEADER</code> (as I am using <code>miniz.c</code> for eaze) gave me a correct unpacking result and a data file of 33,208 bytes long.</p>\n<p>Inspecting this with 0xED shows this file consists entirely out of <em>double values</em> (8 bytes each); the first few are</p>\n<pre><code>0.991932\n0.991931\n0.991932\n0.991932\n0.991932\n0.991933\n</code></pre>\n<p>(okay, there appears to be a pattern here -- the devil is in the last few digits which 0xED doesn't show, they are not all the same values).</p>\n<p>The second file, <code>index.dat</code>, also unpacks correctly and gives another long list of double values, this time clearly going up:</p>\n<pre><code>0.0000\n0.0082\n0.0163833\n0.0245667\n</code></pre>\n<p>I didn't cross-reference these values against the XLS file you provided, I assume you can work that out from here.</p>\n<p>I only unpacked until I got a positive result back, I did not check if there are more data packets (compressed or otherwise) following the first one and you should verify using the end result of your own favourite decompression routine.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Just as I was heading to bed, it struck me that the 3rd and/or 4th dwords in the header (weren't they the same anyway?) may be the 'unpacked' length.</p>\n</div>",

I've never seen/used the <code>78 9C</code> magic number, so that was a lifesaver that you noticed it right off. I'm assuming that <code>TINFL_FLAG_PARSE_ZLIB_HEADER</code> is just a way to skip the first 16 DWORDs. Is that right? I'm using python so I got it from <code>zlib.decompress(hexData[16:])</code> and then reading in little endian.</span>",

It depends greatly on your application field. For example in the medical field, most algorithms used are very well known, and therefore you can simply skipped a bunch of binary data to find well known algorithm such as zlib for meta-data and/or simple encoding such as RLE for images.</p>\n<p>What I would try is create a string such as \"super calli fredgulistic ex pe alli doschus is a cool word\". And then export the file in all possible format, then simply grep for that in all exported files. Eg:</p>\n<pre><code>$ grep \"super calli fredgulistic\" *\n</code></pre>\n<p>or if your strings is in 16bits little endian:</p>\n<pre><code>$ strings -e l output_format | grep \"super calli fredgulistic\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>You'll find the format the most easy to deal with (well hopefully!).</p>\n</div>",
