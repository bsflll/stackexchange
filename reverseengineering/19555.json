Instead, they are public symbols inside the run-time library itself.  The startup code that runs before _main() performs the command-line resolution, assigning parameters into the __wargv array, and storing the count in __argc.  The <em>relative</em> addresses are fixed for the file, but the absolute addresses will vary if Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) is in effect.</p>\n</div>",

I'm assuming it's using the <code>shell32!CommandLineToArgvW</code> api to do the parsing, like @RbMm suggested in the comments above, hah? Also, you say that these symbols have relative fixed addresses. But relative to what -- one of the read-write data sections in the PE file? Image base?</span>",
