    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am analysing obfuscated code which contains code paths leading to dummy instructions. These dummy instructions prevent IDA from creating functions. However, I need these functions to do a function matching with Bindiff.</p>\n<p>While I was patching these functions manually, the output of the \"Make Function\" feature (by pressing \"p\") contained the address where it encountered a problem. This information was very helpful to pinpoint the next dummy instruction.</p>\n<p>To speed up this process I started to write a Python script. I managed to identify the start addresses of functions containing dummy instructions. However, unlike in the IDA Pro UI the API function MakeFunction() only returns true or false to indicate a (un)successful creation.</p>\n<p>I tried to get the same address as reported in the output window by other means like \"Jump to next unexplored\", but no luck. The only other way I found is to use the \"Jump to Problem\" option which again I only can access in the UI.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to get the address where MakeFunction() failed in Python, just like in the UI?</p>\n</div>",
