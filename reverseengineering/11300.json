I've used PIX to see all the DirectX calls of the game, and that part worked correctly. </p>\n<p>After that, I wanted to know where in the code those functions were called from. Therefore, I tried to use API Monitor, but there I got the first surprise: no calls were being found to <strong>Graphics and Gaming/DirectX Graphics and Gaming</strong> (where all the Direct3D functions are).</p>\n<p>As that didn't work, I used IDA instead; In the Imports window, only these were being shown:\n <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/b3wcg.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/b3wcg.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>And in the Functions window, none of the DirectX functions was found.</p>\n<p>So, is this the proper way (if it's possible at all) of doing this? Also, how is that API Monitor doesn't register any DirectX calls, although PIX does?</p>\n</div>",
