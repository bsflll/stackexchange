    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm disassembling an old (1996) game, that has been compiled with the Watcom 386 compiler. This compiler seems to aggressively reorder instructions to make better use of the processor pipeline, as seen in this chunk of assembly:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RqNJ3.png\"/></p>\n<p>The instructions marked with a red dot set up the parameters for the next call; the instructions with a blue dot finish the initialization of the object returned from the previous call. Rearranging them makes the assembly much easier to read:</p>\n<pre><code>...\ncall    ClassAlloc13680_0FAh\nmov     edx, [eax]\nmov     [edx+Class180F4.WidgetInputHandler], offset gblHandleTransportDestinationAndCheckForPassengersSpace\nmov     edx, [eax]\nmov     [edx+Class13680.Paint???], offset ClassVehicleManager__PaintForSomeWidget\nmov     dword_A4D88, eax\nmov     eax, [eax]\nmov     [eax+Class10B8C.MouseInputHandler], offset ClassVehicleManager__MouseInputHandler\n\npush    0\npush    2\npush    0\npush    4Eh\npush    5Bh\nmov     ebx, 5Ch\nmov     ecx, 21h\nmov     edx, ebp\nmov     eax, ebp\ncall    ClassAlloc13680_0FAh\npush    0\npush    2\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>(Note that i moved the <code>mov reg, xxh</code> instructions even further down, because the compiler's calling convention is ax-dx-cx-bx-stack, so i can see the order of arguments here as well)</p>\n<p>Is there a way to accomplish this in IDA? I'm not asking for an algorithm to automatically determine which instructions should be \"red\" and which should be \"blue\", and i don't want to patch the original binary file, i'd just like to manually re-arrange instructions in the ida database.</p>\n<p>Or is there another way to improve readability of this kind of code in IDA?</p>\n</div>",
