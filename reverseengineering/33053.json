One was to detect <code>ptrace</code> which <code>pwndbg</code> evaded easily but now the when the program expects an input <code>pwndbg</code> interprets it as its own command rather to pass input to the program. Am I missing something??</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code>Waiting to initialize.\nStarted.\nEnter a prompt: e\nAmbiguous command \"e\": eb, echo, ed, edit, egrep, elfsections, emulate, en, enable, end, entry, env, environ, envp, eq...\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
