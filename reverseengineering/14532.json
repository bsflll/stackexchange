It supports decompilation for a lot of platforms (because it uses the same intermediate representation for all processors) and as opposite to IDA its processor definitions are configurable and can be updated (see the <a href=\"https://ghidra.re/courses/languages/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sleigh language manual</a>).</p>\n<p>The code generated by Ghidra may be less polished and less accurate, but you have a possibility, for example, to add new instructions when you need them - <a href=\"https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues/78\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see here an example</a> (first I found, I'm sure there are more)</p>\n</div>",
