    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>i perform a loop in assembly where i am parsing the sections of ntdll change their memory permissions with <strong>VirtualProtect</strong> and then revert them back to their original permissions. the code looks like this:</p>\n<pre>\nlea eax, [OldProtect]\npush eax                      //here it will store the old protection value\npush PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE\npush dwSize                   //size of section\npush lpAddress                //start address of section\ncall Virtual_Alloc\n...\nblahblah\n...\nlea eax, [OldProtect]\npush eax\npush OldProtect               //the protection value to revert\npush dwSize                   //size of section               \npush lpAddress                //address of section             \ncall Virtual_Protect\n</pre>\n<p>The loop runs correctly on the first three sections <b>.text</b>, <b>.RT</b> and <b>.data</b> which have initial memory permissions <b>ER</b>, <b>ER</b>, <b>RW</b> respectively.</p>\n<p>The problem is that the in the next section which is the <b>.mrdata</b> section and it is readable only, the memory protection changed succesfully from <b>R</b> to <b>ERW</b>. But When i try to revert back to the old protection the return value is 0x00000050 in eax and i get an exception. </p>\n<p>What i want to ask is  why? Is this a false use of VirtualProtect? Or has something to do with the .mrdata section</p>\n</div>",
