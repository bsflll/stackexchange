Beyond knowing people that are interested in the same things, is there a collaborative reversing dumping ground for documenting specifically disassembly of closed source firmware?</p>\n</div>",

I'm guessing \"no\" since they don't usually post it, but I'm not aware of any open source firmware, except for things like Tomato, though that's more like an OS for a wifi unit, so I'm just trying to make sure I understand the question better.</span>",

However, there are numerous forums that specialize in a specific type of firmware, manufacturer, or even just one product, and some of them are pretty big on their own. Here's a few examples that come to mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/\">XDA Developers</a>: everything about hacking Android and Windows Mobile-based phones and other devices.</li>\n<li>PC BIOS hacking: <a href=\"http://www.wimsbios.com/forum/\">Wim's BIOS</a> and <a href=\"http://forums.mydigitallife.info/forums/25-BIOS-Mods\">My Digital Life</a>.</li>\n<li>Samsung TVs: <a href=\"http://forum.samygo.tv/\">SamyGO TV</a>.</li>\n<li>Digital cameras: <a href=\"http://chdk.setepontos.com/\">CHDK</a>, <a href=\"http://www.magiclantern.fm/forum/index.php\">Magic Lantern</a>, <a href=\"http://nikonhacker.com/\">Nikon Hacker</a>.</li>\n<li>Ebook readers: <a href=\"http://www.mobileread.com/forums/\">MobileRead</a></li>\n<li>Audio players: <a href=\"http://forums.rockbox.org/\">Rockbox</a></li>\n<li>Wireless routers: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wireless_router_firmware_projects\">too many to list here</a>.</li>\n<li>iPhone/iPod/iPad: <a href=\"http://www.idroidproject.org/forum/\">iDroid Project</a> (and many others)</li>\n<li>and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
