    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am very unsure if this is the right place to as or if I need to ask this at another forum, but here it goes.</p>\n<p>I am trying to reverse engineer a .NET program with the use of dnspy. I installed dnspy with <code>choco install dnspy</code>. I was then able to start dnspy in by calling it in pwsh, but when debugging the program I get the following error <code>Could not start the debugger. Use 32-bit dnSpy to debug 32-bit applications</code>. I then <a href=\"https://buildfunthings.com/posts/reversing-tear-or-dear/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">found this link</a> that said to restart the debugger with <code>dnspy-x86</code>. But still the debugger is 64 bit. I also tried to run dnspy by running <code>dnspy -x86</code>.</p>\n<p>I see <a href=\"https://chocolatey.org/packages/dnspy#virus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here </a> in chocolatey.org that the 32 bit is checked in virustotal. But I am unsure if the 32-bit version is included. I also cant find any information on flags or parameters dnspy is able to take.</p>\n<p>My question is if dnspy 32 bit is installed by using choco or if one has to install the 32-bit manually. And if dnspy 32 bit is installed with choco, how do I start it in 32 bit.</p>\n</div>",

But, with a little bit of effort, I found that to install 32bit you will need to add either add: <strong>--x86</strong> or <strong>--forcex86</strong> to force x86 (32bit) installation on 64 bit systems.</p>\n<p>To download dnspy 32 bit you would run: <code>choco install dnspy --x86</code></p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can go to <a href=\"https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy/releases\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dnSpy</a> github and download it from there.</p>\n<p><strong>For next time please refer to <a href=\"https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/commands/install\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">choco install</a> docs and read the entire <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/help/asking\">help section</a></strong></p>\n<p>I hope you learn something new today â˜º</p>\n</div>",
