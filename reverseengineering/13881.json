    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm debugging <code>android jni</code> with <code>gdb</code>. There's a <code>jni</code> function <code>A()</code>, I need to set <code>breakpoint</code> there and step through. I calculated the address with <code>module_base+offset</code>, which is <code>0x99B62C7A</code>, then I tried to verify if it's the right address, with <code>gdb</code> command:</p>\n<pre><code>display /5i 0x99B62C7A\n</code></pre>\n<p>It prints some unexpected instructions, which is different from <code>IDA</code>:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YU1WQ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YU1WQ.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>And if I put a <code>breakpoint</code> there and click on the UI to trigger the <code>breakpoint</code>, the process crashes with <code>SIGSEGV</code>. </p>\n<p>So why <code>gdb</code> displays different instructions? Is the crash has something to do with the bad instruction?</p>\n</div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Your instructions shown by Ida are Thumb-mode instructions. The easiest way to verify this is by checking the addresses - each instruction has 2 bytes. Gdb doesn't know this however, and assumes 4 byte arm instructions. When an object has a symbol table, gdb can detect the instruction mode from that, but will fallback to a default mode when it can't. You can change this fallback mode; <code>set arm fallback-mode thumb</code> should do the trick.</p>\n<p>This explains the SIGSEGV as well as breakpoints use different opcodes in arm and thumb mode.</p>\n</div>",
