But <code>0x55000</code> is larger than <code>0xFFFF</code> so it cannot be stored in a 16bit register, which <code>ax</code> is, hence it complains.</p>\n<p>If you meant the decimal number 55000, I think you can enter it as \"55000.\" with the trailing dot. If that doesn't work enter the number as hex:</p>\n<pre><code>mov ax, 0D6D8\n</code></pre>\n<p>The leading 0 is necessary otherwise the first character would be a letter and OllyDbg would not recognize it as a number.</p>\n</div>",
