    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am attempting to understand the PE File Format and I have come across an unexpected value in the <em>IMAGE_THUNK_DATA</em> Array.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Here are the file details:<br/>\nMD5: d82d3e003eb5c728d584e22ce7f36fbf<br/>\nFile Name: ChromeSetup.exe\nLink: hxxps://www[.]google[.]com/chrome/thank-you.html?platform=win64&amp;statcb=1&amp;installdataindex=empty&amp;defaultbrowser=0</p>\n<p>(After some testing, I found out that the hash changes but the issue is the same.)</p>\n<p>The issue I'm facing is that in one of the DLLs that is present, the <em>IMAGE_THUNK_DATA</em> structure contains an additional DWORD that is out-of-bounds. Here's the attached screenshot:<br/><br/><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gk95c.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Out-of-Bounds DWORD\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gk95c.png\"/></a>:</p>\n<p>That first block i.e. (48fe 0100), resolves perfectly to \"SHGetFolderPathW\". But that second block (a8020080) is out of bounds - adjusting for endian format, we get 0x800002a8 - but the file itself is present up till 0x14DE2A (verified via 010 Editor and xxd). The third block signifies the end of the <em>IMAGE_THUNK_DATA</em> array so no issues there.</p>\n<p>I've checked using 010 Editor and it shows \"SHGetFolderPathW\" as the only function imported from SHELL32.dll. I'd greatly appreciate some help understanding why that second block is present if no function name resolves to that address, which is out-of-bounds by itself?</p>\n</div>",

In an <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2002/march/inside-windows-an-in-depth-look-into-the-win32-portable-executable-file-format-part-2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">old MSDN article</a>, the setting of the high-bit is indicative of how the value is to be interpreted - either as an ordinal or a RVA. In this case, the value 0x800002A8 has the high-bit set so it is to be interpreted as an ordinal. The last 31-bits, when converted to decimal, give 680.</span>",

This leads me to another question - are ordinals set in stone or do they change as well?</span>",
