The Multiprocessor Specification from Intel at Page 31 says that to enable this mode you have to write 01H to the IMCR memory register. The problem is that this memory register (has to be accessed over outb/inb)  is absolutely nowhere documented.\nCan someone point me to the official spec where it's written down?</p>\n</div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>As I understand it the Multiprocessor Specification is the only Intel document that references this, with the following info</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>PIC Mode is software compatible with the PC/AT because it actually\nemploys the same hardware interrupt configuration. As Figure 3-2\nillustrates, the hardware for PIC Mode bypasses the APIC components by\nusing an interrupt mode configuration register (IMCR). This register\ncontrols whether the interrupt signals that reach the BSP come from\nthe master PIC or from the local APIC. Before entering Symmetric I/O\nMode, either the BIOS or the operating system must switch out of PIC\nMode by changing the IMCR. <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qiV74.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qiV74.png\"/></a> The\nIMCR is supported by two read/writable or write-only I/O ports, 22h\nand 23h, which receive address and data respectively. To access the\nIMCR, write a value of 70h to I/O port 22h, which selects the IMCR.\nThen write the data to I/O port 23h. The power-on default value is\nzero, which connects the NMI and 8259 INTR lines directly to the BSP.\nWriting a value of 01h forces the NMI and 8259 INTR signals to pass\nthrough the APIC. The IMCR must be cleared after a system-wide INIT or\nRESET to enable the PIC Mode as default. (Refer to Section 3.7 for\ninformation on the INIT and RESET signals.) The IMCR is optional if\nPIC Mode is not implemented. The IMCRP bit of the MP feature\ninformation bytes (refer to Chapter 4) enables the operating system to\ndetect whether the IMCR is implemented.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Example use case can be found in linux kernel within APIC.c:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/kernel/apic/apic.c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/kernel/apic/apic.c</a></p>\n<p>However these documents supersede the Multiprocessor specification and don't reference IMCR:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/articles/acpi-config-power-interface-spec.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ACPI Config Power Interface Spec</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://software.intel.com/contennotet/www/us/en/develop/download/intel-64-architecture-x2apic-specification.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Intel 64 Architecture x2APIC Specification</a></p>\n</div>",
