I can properly break on the DLL by loading the .Net app into x64Dbg, and waiting for a DLL call, and it's fine.</p>\n<p>But the fact that x64dbg does not support .Net syntax make it very weird to play with when the flow came back from the DLL to the application, and i would like to do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Use the DnSpy build-in debugger to see what's going on on a high level with the .Net application.</p></li>\n<li><p>And use x64dbg attached to the DLL to take a look at it whenever it is call by the application.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>But i can't manage to do that, since the root process (the .Net application) cannot be debugged by two debugger at the same time.</p>\n<p>How can i setup x64dbg to intercept the DLL without attaching it to the .Net process ?</p>\n<p>Is it even possible to do that ?</p>\n<p>Or maybe I'm unaware of some magic tools that would help me ?</p>\n<p>Any idea ?</p>\n<p>Thanks :)</p>\n</div>",

In Windows it is not possible to attach two debuggers to the same process. WinDbg supports easily debugging .NET and native processes.</p>\n<p>To access .NET functionality you can run commands:</p>\n<pre><code>.loadby sos clr\n</code></pre>\n<p>More details of the .NET extensions <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/sos-dll-sos-debugging-extension\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>\nImproved .NET debugging with sosex 3rd party extension <a href=\"http://stevestechspot.com/SOSEXV40NowAvailable.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>\nCommon commands for WinDbg thematically grouped <a href=\"http://www.windbg.info/doc/1-common-cmds.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> </p>\n<p>There is some learning curve to use it fully effectively but once learned it is extremely powerful debugger for .NET and native code.</p>\n<p>If must use x64dbg then you would require a plugin that supports .NET, the currently available plugins are listed here: <a href=\"https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/wiki/Plugins\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/wiki/Plugins</a></p>\n</div>",
