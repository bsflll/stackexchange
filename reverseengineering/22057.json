How can I load debug symbols from that? It would help to see the types, function names, class names, etc. from the code calling the library.</p>\n<p>Other than by manually hunting down and changing signatures in the decompiled code. There must be an easier way.</p>\n<p>(If there's a way to do this in IDA, I can switch to that instead, just for this.)</p>\n</div>",
