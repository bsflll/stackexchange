    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am debugging Challenge 6 from the 2014 FlareOn challenges.\nFor incorrect imput it displays the \"bad\" message.\nRunning <code>/i bad</code> returns <code>0x004f3bf2 hit0_0 \"bad\"</code>.\n<code>ps @ 0x004f3bf2</code> returns <code>bad</code> as expected.\nMy problem is that if I try to find reference to this memory address, <code>axt @ 0x004f3bf2</code>, <code>radare2</code> does not return anything, but the address is surely referenced:</p>\n<pre><code>pd 1 @ 0x43710c\n0x0043710c      bff23b4f00     movl $0x4f3bf2, %edi        ; \"bad\" @ 0x4f3bf2\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have written a simple application containig <code>const char* bad=\"bad\"; printf(\"%s\\n\", bad);</code>. In this case using the steps from above <code>radare2</code> correctly identifies the line calling <code>printf</code>.</p>\n</div>",
