    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So i am trying to \"hack\" a game however not for cheating purposes. I am looking to extend the games scripting functionality through a DLL that can look for processes and return them. The game I am looking to do this for is Train Simulator (i know, don't laugh) and the game uses lua to script all of the engine functionality within the game. All the 3rd party devs get to see is the lua script that they write.</p>\n<p>Inside the games lua there is core functions. The main ones:</p>\n<pre><code>function Initialise()\n\nend\n\nfunction Update(time) -- time is the interval since the last update\n\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is also C functions that are used as such:</p>\n<pre><code>Call(\"SetControlValue\", name, index, value)\nor\nCall(\"GetIsPlayer\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>These return different values.</p>\n<p>What i have so far with my DLL is as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;\n\n\nBOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE hModule, DWORD ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved)\n{\n    switch (ul_reason_for_call)\n    {\n    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:\n        /* The DLL is being loaded for the first time by a given process.\n        Perform per-process initialization here.  If the initialization\n        is successful, return TRUE; if unsuccessful, return FALSE. */\n        MessageBoxA(0, \"TSDll has been attached !\", \"Train Sim Dll\", MB_ICONEXCLAMATION | MB_OK);\n        break;\n    }\n    return TRUE;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And this works. In my train sim engine script i am using the loadlib library to load the DLL.</p>\n<pre><code>libinit, err = loadlib(\"plugins\\\\TSDll.dll\", \"libinit\")\nif _G[\"libinit\"] then \n    Print(\"TSDll Library Loaded!\")\n    libinit()\nelse\n    Print(\"loadlib on TSDll failed: \")\n    Print(err)\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p>And i get this result:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wjjzZ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Dll Popup\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wjjzZ.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>So the dll initialises properly.</p>\n<p>The problem i face is that the Lua library is directly built in to the game binary (as far as i know) which means i am unable to reference lua.dll for fundamental functions such as lua_pushstring. Does anyone here know how i can find the address of these functions. I know a dll like this has been made before but the person who did it has been very secretive about how it has been done.</p>\n<p>Thanks,\nDan</p>\n</div>",

It's inside <code>plugins/GameManagerVC.dll</code> (or GameManagerVC64.dll in case of 64-bit).\nSo, first step will be finding out, which version of Lua it is. So put this DLL into Ghidra or IDA Pro. The most easiest way of figuring out, what version of Lua it uses, is by searching for \"Lua\" string in string list (In case of IDA Pro <code>Views &gt; Open Subviews &gt; Strings</code>). In case of Train Simulator, we found <code>Lua 5.0.2</code>. Then we should download the Lua 5.0.2 source code, so we can search for functions. The easiest way of search for functions, is by picking some function, which have some strings, and search those strings in your disassembled file. Then rename them, look for references, etc. This way, you shold be able to find all functions, you're looking for.</p>\n</div>",

If you only have a handful of functions in the target DLL you could figure out the prototypes and simply forward the ones you aren't interested in but intercept the calls you are interested in.
