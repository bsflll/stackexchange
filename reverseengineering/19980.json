I have tried setting breakpoints on cookie set which did not seem to help.</p>\n<p>2) Can this be deobfuscated easily by a JS noobie such as myself and what tools should I be using?</p>\n<p>EDIT: If anyone can get involved I would be willing to compensate.</p>\n</div>",

To fo it, you must use an editor capable of regexp replacing, like VSCode or Sublime Text (and a lot of others)\nI got one and only one instruction per line</p>\n<h2>Step 2</h2>\n<p>Look at first assignment</p>\n<pre><code>T8jj.W4C=\"3421\";\n</code></pre>\n<p>I will replace every occurence of <code>T8jj.h6C</code> in the following code with the value <code>\"3063\"</code>. But before, using regex search, I will ensure that there is only ONE occurrency of assignment, otherwise I will do a more delicate replacement.</p>\n<p>In this case, only one assignment! Good, so use a regexp to replace</p>\n<pre><code>\\bT8jj\\.W4C\\b\n</code></pre>\n<p>with </p>\n<pre><code>\"3421\"\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note !!!! we used word separator and entered the dot as escaped, because otherwiser you could mis-replace ASDAS<strong>T8jj</strong>E<strong>W4CS</strong>DFSDFD and this will create bugs !</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first regexp avoid to change eventually future occurrency of new. Do not forget trailing <code>\"</code> because are syntattically important for js. <code>3421</code> is an integer, <code>\"3421\"</code> is a string.</p>\n<p>For example, at roww 22233 this replaces</p>\n<pre><code>I(g9L.r3y(+T8jj.W4C));\n</code></pre>\n<p>with</p>\n<pre><code>I(g9L.r3y(+\"3421\"));\n</code></pre>\n<p>So string or numeric is very different !</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You now think \"I can remove the first line, because there is no more need for it; every referring point has now got the litteral value.\"\n  Wrong ! Some obfuscator use string concatenation and other techs to keep you in a trap, so never remove code ! </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Only 44042 rows remaining ! </p>\n<h2>Reiterate</h2>\n<pre><code>bx8jj.h8C \n</code></pre>\n<p>has more than one assignment, so must replace with \"3871\" only occurency <em>before</em> the next assignment, there same var receved assigned value of \"1964\"</p>\n<h2>Suggestions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Use trailing \\b and replace . with . when searching;</li>\n<li>If you got only one result or no result at all, do not delete assignment; some point in the obfuscated code could use string concatenation or use unicode chars and evals to read the variable value;</li>\n<li>Replace occurrencies of unicode-only strings with their litteral value; this will speed up code deobfuscation; for example <code>'\\x6e\\x65\\x73\\x74\\x65\\x64'</code> is <code>'nested'</code>; </li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
