    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am reading a book on reversing and I am curious about one of the assembly snippet i have read in it.</p>\n<p>There is a simple disassembly of the function RtlNumberGenericTableElements and it looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>push ebp\nmov ebp, esp\nmov eax, dword ptr [ebp+8]\nmov eax, dword ptr [eax+14]\npop ebp\nret 4\n</code></pre>\n<p>And it occured to me, say there is a member of a structure that is a pointer to some other structure. How would I go about dereferencing that member?</p>\n<pre><code>struct example {\n  int member1;\n  *object member2;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Would I be dereferencing member 2 like so (pointer to struct comes as first param):</p>\n<pre><code>mov eax, [ebp+8]\nmov eax, dword ptr [eax]\nmov eax, [eax+8] ; this would get me the pointer to member2???\n</code></pre>\n<p>any input appreciated</p>\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n<p>I see, your explanation was understandable, thank you, I appreciate it.</p>\n<p>I have one more question that popped up from my mind. Say in your example, member 2 is a pointer to an int, then </p>\n<pre><code>mov eax, [ebp + 8] ; eax contains pointer to struct and its first member\nmov eax, [eax + 4] ; eax contains a pointer to member2 (this is a pointer to an int)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Say i would like to get the value of member to into ecx i would carry on like this:</p>\n<pre><code>mov eax, [eax]\nmov ecx, [eax]\n</code></pre>\n<p>So the whole thing would read like so:</p>\n<pre><code>mov eax, [ebp + 8] ; eax contains pointer to struct and its first member\nmov eax, [eax + 4] ; eax contains a pointer to member2 (this is a pointer to an int)\nmov eax, [eax]     ; dereferenfce the pointer that is pointing to member2\nmov ecx, [eax]     ; dereference member2 itself that is a pointer to an int\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is this correct?</p>\n</div>",

In your example, <code>[ebp + 8]</code> is a pointer to <code>member1</code> and you can access a pointer to <code>member2</code> like this: </p>\n<pre><code>mov eax, [ebp + 8] ; eax contains pointer to struct and its first member\nmov eax, [eax + 4] ; eax contains a pointer to member2\n</code></pre>\n<p>When in any doubt, you can always write a simple program, compile it and check the resulting assembler code. In your case, you could write something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nstruct example\n{\n    int member1;\n    void* member2;\n};\n\n\nvoid initialiseStruct(struct example* e)\n{\n    e-&gt;member1 = 1;\n    e-&gt;member2 = NULL;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    struct example e;\n    initialiseStruct(&amp;e);\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then compile it and run <code>objdump -dM intel FILENAME</code> to get a snippet like the following one:</p>\n<pre><code>0000054d &lt;initialiseStruct&gt;:\n 54d:   55                      push   ebp\n 54e:   89 e5                   mov    ebp,esp\n 550:   e8 6b 00 00 00          call   5c0 &lt;__x86.get_pc_thunk.ax&gt;\n 555:   05 83 1a 00 00          add    eax,0x1a83\n 55a:   8b 45 08                mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]\n 55d:   c7 00 01 00 00 00       mov    DWORD PTR [eax],0x1 ; e-&gt;member1 = 1\n 563:   8b 45 08                mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]\n 566:   c7 40 04 00 00 00 00    mov    DWORD PTR [eax+0x4],0x0 ; e-&gt;member2 = NULL\n 56d:   90                      nop\n 56e:   5d                      pop    ebp\n 56f:   c3                      ret  \n</code></pre>\n<p>Regarding your second question: you should view <code>[]</code> in assembly like <code>*</code> in C in case of <code>mov</code>. </p>\n<p>If <code>member2</code> points to <code>int</code>, you can access this integer this way (I've added C equivalents next to each assembly instruction):</p>\n<pre><code>mov eax, [ebp + 8] ; eax = e - remember, in my example e is a pointer\nmov eax, [eax + 4] ; eax = *(e + 4) = e-&gt;member2, so now eax contains the memory address at e-&gt;member2\nmov ecx, [eax] ; ecx = *(e-&gt;member2) - ecx contains the integer value\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
