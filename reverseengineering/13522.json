They were abundant, but all seem to perform extremely specialized functions and I have doubts about how well they would represent legitimate programs in the real world</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Finding and downloading programs manually.</strong> This would be extremely slow and tedious, and also ineffective to get large numbers of such programs.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I suppose what would be ideal for my situation is a sort of program dump, but I'm not aware of any that exist.</p>\n<p>As someone unaffiliated with any organisation, is there an effective way of getting a large number of public normal programs for the purpose of comparing their features to a set of malicious programs?</p>\n</div>",
