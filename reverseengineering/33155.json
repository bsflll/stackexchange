I managed to do the following so far:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Dump the firmware from the SPI flash.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Running strings on the bin file gave the default AP name and its PSK, and a potential boot password.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Running binwalk on the file gave the below output, and this is where I am stuck. I was expecting something like uboot header or squashfs, but I am puzzled by what I am getting.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GskD8csQ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"binwalk analysis\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GskD8csQ.png\"/></a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Extracting the components with binwalk -Me gave the below result.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fzZOq0W6.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"binwalk extraction results\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fzZOq0W6.png\"/></a></h2>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><p>I made more trials and ran <code>binwalk -Me</code> and <code>strings</code> on all files and dumped the output to a text file \"fw_contents.txt\"<a href=\"https://pastebin.com/MSw8UWiJ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">fw_contents</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Running <code>binwalk -Me</code> on file \"80100.7z\" gave what looks like c-source files but I failed to extract any of those files.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Cb3O4Sar.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"80100.7z with binwalk\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Cb3O4Sar.png\"/></a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em><strong>Updates:</strong></em>\nI tried to extract the firmware parts manually following the memory map found in the bootlog file, and compare the extracted components to what <code>binwalk</code> extracted. The only part that matches was the <code>rootfs1</code> and <code>80100.7z</code></p>\n<p>I tried also exporting the config file from the router homepage, then I changed a single character in the default SSID name, then exported the config file again for comparison. The files were completely different. So, I guess the config file is also encrypted.</p>\n<p>I tried using \"unlzma\" and \"7za\" to extract the 10000.7z and 80100.7z but the files were unrecognized.</p>\n<p>I do not know what I am looking at here, and would really appreciate it if you could provide some guidance.</p>\n<p>I am happy to share the firmware <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/pqbnz65zgwyfbbyde8ekx/etis_03.bin?rlkey=r897incg8nwbxodbrr8eiuait&amp;st=gybnh0fg&amp;dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">firmware.bin</a> and the bootlog <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/2hf5uudr2n2xbugivf5e4/Etisalat_ZXHN_H168N_V3.5_Serial_log_normal_00.log?rlkey=jrc0gojeuo3o04isckyiiyd2d&amp;st=kdr3pm47&amp;dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Normalboot.log</a> , <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/qbcl053o7wqiul5rnvxv4/Etisalat_ZXHN_H168N_V3.5_Serial_log_testmode_01.txt?rlkey=96tnmo6hf7rpf7tov21pc8w02&amp;st=dnvm2gke&amp;dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Testmodelog.log</a> files if someone is interested.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n</div>",
