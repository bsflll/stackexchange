As it seems there are no SVD files available to import the information automatically.\nAlso adding the ROM functions provided by the driverlib would significantly help.</p>\n<p>Are there different ways to load that information into ghidra (without doing it manually using the tech reference). What kind of files I could extract that information from?</p>\n</div>",
