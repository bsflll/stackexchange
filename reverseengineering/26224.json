    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am using the websocket module for my client in python3, and I am trying to troubleshoot some errors I am getting that lead to the client disconnecting after seemingly random intervals.<br/>\nWhen I enabled trace with <code>websocket.enableTrace(True)</code> I can see some entries that I am not sure how to decrypt. Here is an example:</p>\n<p><code>Thread-3:send: b'\\x88\\x82\\xc1$\\xf7\\xa6\\xc2\\xcc'</code></p>\n<p>Any idea how to decrypt the message and see if this could explain the source of my problem?</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n</div>",
