    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I know how to reverse-engineer normal Android APKs using tools like <code>apktool</code> and <code>dex2jar</code>, but I don't know how to work with obfuscation.</p>\n<p>When I extract everything from APK, I get some Smali files (I tried JD-GUI, but the strings contained random names. Probably obfuscated using ProGuard.), some resource files, and a \".so\" files in the <code>/lib</code> directory.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do I analyze the \".so\" file? I know that SO files are kind of DLLs of the Linux world, but what are the tools that can be used to analyze SO files? Any links to videos would be very helpful.</li>\n<li>Also, how would I get around if there were a JAR file instead of an SO file in the APK?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I know this largely constitutes learning by myself, but I really don't know what to look or where to look. Some examples would be really helpful. Thanks!</p>\n</div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>The .so file is a compiled library, in most cases from C or C++ source code. .so stands for Shared Object, it doesn't have anything to do with obfuscation, it just means someone wrote parts of the app in C.</p>\n<p>In some cases, there is existing C code and it's just easier for the programmer to build a JNI interface to call the library from Java; in other cases, the programmer wants the speed advantage that compiled C has over Java. And of course, if I want to hide how some part of my application works, writing that in C and compiling it to a .so makes it much harder to reverse.</p>\n<p>If you want to reverse an Android .so, these are the options you have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy the commercial version of IDA Pro. The demo versions will not do, as they can't disassemble ARM code. This is expensive, but by far the best tool to work with unknown object code.</li>\n<li>If the app includes versions of the .so for different hardware, and if it has a library for Android on x86, you can use the free IDA 5.1 version to disassemble it.</li>\n<li>If you have access to a Linux system, get a gcc toolchain for ARM that includes <code>objdump</code>, and use <code>objdump --disassemble</code> to get a huge text file containing disassembled code. Then, have fun with that text file. There might be gcc toolchains for ARM targets that run on Windows as well, but I never tried.</li>\n<li>You could also upload the .so file to <a href=\"http://onlinedisassembler.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://onlinedisassembler.com/</a> to get a disassembled file, if you don't want to install a gcc toolchain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Beware, though, in all of these cases, you need a thorough understanding of the ARM processor architecture, assembler language, JNI conventions, and compiler ABI to make any sense of the disassembly. Prepare for many long nights if you're inexperienced.</p>\n</div>",
