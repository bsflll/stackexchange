    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've been trying to learn <a href=\"https://www.nsa.gov/resources/everyone/ghidra/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ghidra</a> by attempting to reverse the <code>comctl32.dll</code> system library, which has many of its functions documented. I started the de-compilation analysis in it, and after a while it showed this error message: </p>\n<p><em>(I don't know how soon it happened. I had to leave it to do its thing as sadly it was taking too long.)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EI2Qz.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EI2Qz.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Then I happened to see that if I go to File -&gt; Download PDB file, then select some folder on my drive and provide Microsoft symbol path <code>https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols</code> and click <code>\"Download from URL\"</code> it seems to download it.</p>\n<p>It then asks if I want to apply it to the project and if I click <code>Yes</code> it shows this warning:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BwVGO.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BwVGO.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>So I'm obviously not doing it right.</p>\n<p>Thus I was curious:</p>\n<p>A) Is it possible to provide the symbol server path and have it download needed symbol files automatically?</p>\n<p>B) If not, what's the sequence to load symbols for a particular binary? It seems like it wants to have symbols up front, but how would I know which files/imports it may need (besides the obvious binary file that I'm opening)?</p>\n</div>",

And any US citizen should be able to add such a feature (via Java) and make a pull request to add it.</p>\n<p>I found what you do is simply add the module to your Ghidra project.\nWhen you click on the module/executable it will ask \"...Would you like to analyze it now?\".\nClick \"No\", load your PDB, and then start the analysis manually via the \"Analysis\" menu option.</p>\n</div>",
