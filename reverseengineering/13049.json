Because of this, you should make a backup of the original file before your first patch, and copy it back before every subsequent patch you make.</p>\n<p>Also, i recommend you to check into <a href=\"https://thesprawl.org/projects/ida-patcher/\" rel=\"nofollow\">idapatcher</a> which will make it a bit easier to make and check your patches.</p>\n</div>",
