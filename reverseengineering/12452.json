Some article illustrates radar2 work, and there radar2 resolve string by XREF:</p>\n<pre><code>0x00400ee4    be00244000   mov esi, str.Border_relations_with_Canada_have_never_been_better. ; \"Border relations with Canada have never been better\" @ 0x402400\n</code></pre>\n<p>But my instance of radar2 prints:</p>\n<pre><code>0x00400ee4    be00244000   mov esi, str.BorderrelationswithCanadahaveneverbeenbetter. ; CODE (CALL) XREF from 0x00401338 (unk)\n</code></pre>\n<p>How I can see this string? Maybe I must specify some settings?\n(P.S. Miscusi my English, if it incorrect)</p>\n<p>UPD: using <code>strings ./binaryFile | grep someTemplate</code>, I find string... but radare2 behaviour has higher priority. Therefore this string exists in file.</p>\n</div>",

Seems the example version of radare replaces them with underscores, while your version just omits them. But, this is the name of the label, not the real string, and if you display the memory at that location, you should see the real string, including the space characters.</p>\n</div>",
