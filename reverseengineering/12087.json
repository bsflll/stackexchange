    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Bit of a noob question, I'm working through some examples on crackmes.</p>\n<p>In Ollydbg and x64dbg, in the stack, disassembler and registry windows, there are texts to show values of memory locations, for instance:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/v7jhC.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Ollydbg descriptions\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/v7jhC.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I would have thought IDA would have had this information readily available in the debugger, however it seems the user has to hover over addresses to view it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kAlBD.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kAlBD.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Is there a way to display this available in IDA? It is much more useful in Olly/x64 to have the text, rather than <code>debug070:7EFDE000</code> etc</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n</div>",
