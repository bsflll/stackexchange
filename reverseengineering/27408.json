It complains about</p>\n<pre><code>The function has undefined instruction/data at the specified address.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I think this is because it has remembered where I've marked thing as undefined or data or code.

If there are many such places, you can also try a mass selection and <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/blog/igor-tip-of-the-week-04-more-selection/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">force everything in a range to code</a> (though this may backfire if code is obfuscated).</p>\n</div>",
