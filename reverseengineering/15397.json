    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm new with IDA pro and have little problem. Right click on some data in <code>.rdata</code> brings options in which I can convert, In that window D means decimal B means binary and so on, but I have multiple Ds in which I can convert, and the values in which it can be converted are different, what is the difference between this Ds? Here is the picture</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EZIHP.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"for example\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EZIHP.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>thanks :)</p>\n</div>",

So it will change the data type that is used to display the values you have.</p>\n<p>If you check closely you would notice that from the bottom the pattern is: <code>byte</code>, <code>word</code>, <code>dword</code>, <code>qword</code>. Those two at the top are probably the two are some forms of float/real numbers created from the data you're trying to convert.</p>\n</div>",
