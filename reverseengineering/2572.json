Any help will be appreciated.</p>\n</div>",

Assume this, and do not put credentials or private data in your resources/code. </p>\n<p>The idea behind resource encryption/compression is summarized well in <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/19537/XResFile-Files-Stored-in-Resources-Part-3-Encrypte\" rel=\"nofollow\">this codeproject article</a>, the same ideas apply to .NET. You use some encryption method, add the encrypted file to your project, load it via your code, and run your decryption/decompression algorithm on it.</p>\n<p>Realistically, though, it sounds like you're looking for a .NET obfuscator with compression features. I don't believe stackexchange is the place for product advertisement, so here is a good objective list: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_obfuscators_for_.NET\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_obfuscators_for_.NET</a></p>\n<p><strong>In regards to making cracking your application more difficult,</strong> you should consider using asymmetric encryption <a href=\"http://www.drdobbs.com/licensing-using-symmetric-and-asymmetric/184401687\" rel=\"nofollow\">as described here</a> and license key files. Think of creative ways to perform license checks throughout your application. Using a keyfile you're preventing the possibility of anyone ever writing a keygen for your application, and adding a large number of checks for the license will make it arduous for anyone attempting to crack the application.</p>\n</div>",
