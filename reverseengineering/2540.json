So, the management of the binary format is done through <code>libbfd.so</code>.</p>\n<p>Usually, MacOS X binutils comes with the Mach-O management, but it might be that you are using a buggy package. Or, you may also try to open a Mach-O on another system than MacOS X, and on other systems the Mach-O support is extremely rarely added to the default package. </p>\n<p>The best way to get the Mach-O support (and all possible formats and architectures in GNU binutils) is to compile the package with the option <code>--enable-targets=all</code>.</p>\n<p>Personally, I am using a Debian unstable. and I am used to recompile the whole package taken from sources.
