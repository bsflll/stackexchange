Either by first editing the Import Table or by dynamically loading your DLL using <code>LoadLibrary</code> and functions using <code>GetProcAddress</code>.</p>\n</div>",

Believe me, I have done this. We reverse engineered a program back to compilable source. This project took way too long. </p>\n<p>If your changes were minor, I would recommend codecaving. Just create a PE section jump to it and make your changes , then jump back. <a href=\"http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/adding-a-section-to-pe-binary/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tutorial on how to expand PE binary</a></p>\n<p>I have done this before on large projects.
