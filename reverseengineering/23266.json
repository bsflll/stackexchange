            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">thanks Robert, yes of course but <code>seed</code> mean is different here. <code>seed</code> is input of a function that generate <code>key</code> as output.that function have a loop for 0x23 time(-or another value) and shifitng and xor,( i decribe this function in <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/23256/seed-key-constant-value/23257#23257\" title=\"seed key constant value\">reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/23256/â€¦</a>.  so i can't calculate this constant value AND i like to know generally, how i can reverse kind of this algorithms. thanks,</span>",
