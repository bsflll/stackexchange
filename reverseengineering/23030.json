Now I'm trying to find at least some sources where opcodes of instructions listed and can't.</p>\n<p>There're some C headers, where opcodes defined in non-readable form, lot of different scientific publications with 1k+ pages (containing no opcodes), etc., but I can't find simple list.</p>\n<p>Could somebody point me?</p>\n</div>",
