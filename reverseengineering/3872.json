    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I created a simple Cocoa app (Mac 64bit) in Xcode, and in it I created a string object, and then outputted the contents of the string in a NSLog statement.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/98uC6.png\"/></p>\n<p>Then I decided to see if I could modify the contents of the binary (exe) in the .app directory of the application.  I used 0xED to change, <em>This is my string.</em> to <em>This is my new string.</em>  I did this by typing the word <em>new</em> in the right portion of the 0xED editor.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/6UTQt.png\"/></p>\n<p>Finally, I saved the file, then tried to launch it, but it appears to crash.  The crash report appears somewhat cryptic to me, so I am not exactly sure why the app is crashing.</p>\n</div>",

But if you want to make larger changes to the text, you'd need to add the new text to the end of the program (or write it into an unused area) and then patch the code so that it references the new text instead of the old text.</span>",
