Looking at the cross references and the surrounding API calls might tell you how they are being used. </p>\n<p>Perhaps using a utility like strings might help to discover if there is more embedded text.  If you think the files might be obfuscated you could try Didier Steven's xorsearch tool.</p>\n</div>",
