    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Suppose I have a ton of test cases and my target is closed-source. Well, I need to know which test cases discover new path in the execution of my target and which are duplicated. I know I have to use DBI frameworks such as <a href=\"https://www.dynamorio.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DynamoRIO</a>, <a href=\"https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Intel Pin</a> and others. But, I cannot figure out how to use them, in the other words, I got confused to how I should save trace map and check them for a ton of test cases!?</p>\n<p>Another question is, how can we figure out a test case is good and interesting during fuzzing test? Just discovering new path?</p>\n</div>",
