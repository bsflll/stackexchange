I'm not familiar with PE files, but I will do an example of ARMv7 and ELF.</p>\n<pre><code>0xc8  movs r0, r1\n0xca  b 0xd8\n0xcc  b nowhere\n0xd8  0000 empty bytes to 0xff\n0x100 mov r3, r4\n</code></pre>\n<p>From above if I write an instruction(s) from address <code>0xd8</code> all will be executed until I branch back to <code>0xcc</code>. In ELF, you will need to edit the program headers and change the flags to executable, so all can be possible or just use a code cave in which program headers are executable. Inserting bytes changes offsets, and it's possible the program won't have an entry point. Overwriting works most of the time if what you're patching is simple and needs only a few instructions.</p>\n</div>",
