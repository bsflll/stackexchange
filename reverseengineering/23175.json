    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Are there any community tools that are aimed specifically at extracting or replacing AGESA code in a UEFI?  In AMI UEFIs, AGESA is said to be scattered among multiple modules.  I have read that in AWARD BIOSes it's contained within a single module.  Are there any modern AWARD AMD UEFIs?</p>\n<p>Thank you for any guidance.</p>\n<p>Edit: Removed the long intro, straight to business.</p>\n</div>",
