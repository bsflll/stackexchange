    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've been trying to hook a function using Detours 1.5, but when <code>DetourFunction()</code> is called, it throws access violation.</p>\n<p>This is the original function:</p>\n<pre><code>int greeter(char *name) {\n    printf_s(\"%s, %s!\\n\", greetings[rand() % ((int) sizeof(greetings) / (int) sizeof(greet_t))], name);\n    int rerun = strcmp(\"Gabriel\", name);\n    if (!rerun) printf_s(\"Have a nice day!\\n\");\n    return rerun;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>With the program compiled and running properly, I used IDA Pro to see the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/gfreivasc/874fa4e780b06538de35d9c559f74fbe\" rel=\"nofollow\">trace and found my function</a> beginning on address <code>0x004010B0</code>.\nThen I set the variable <code>DWORD orig_greeter = 0x4010B0</code>. And wrote the following code:</p>\n<pre><code>#include \"sky.h\"\n\nint myGreeter(char* name);\nint (__cdecl* origGreeter)(char*);\n\nbool __stdcall DllMain(HINSTANCE hInst, DWORD dwReason, LPVOID pvReserved) {\n    if (dwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) {\n        // Start Hook Sub-Routine\n        origGreeter = (int (__cdecl*)(char*))DetourFunction((PBYTE)orig_greeter, (PBYTE)myGreeter);\n        origGreeter(\"sir\");\n    }   \n    return true;\n}\n\nint myGreeter(char* name) {\n    printf_s(\"You've been hooked, %s!\", name);\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once DetourFunction tries to access the given offset it throws Access Violation and the function is not hooked. What am I missing?</p>\n<p>[Edits removed. No relevant for the question]</p>\n</div>",

The callstack showed it called <code>myGreeter</code> when it was supposed to. Therfore, I consider this question answered.</p>\n</div>",
