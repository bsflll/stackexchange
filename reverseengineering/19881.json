So I am looking for a way to save my analysis progress and if possible retain renamed variables.</p>\n<p>It currently doesn't work because if I open it again another time it won't load the renamed variables and I can't do stuff like \"ood\" which is the way to reopen the binary as far as I'm concerned. But there are no errors.</p>\n<p>After invoking radare2 with <code>r2 -d calc</code> I run <code>aa</code> and then <code>Ps calc_project</code>. After that I close the terminal and open up a new one. Then I start with <code>r2 -d calc</code> again and follow it with <code>Po calc_project</code>. Now, there are many errors which appear to be the same over and over again:</p>\n<pre><code>fcn_recurse failed\nCannot add basic block\", that message 50 times or more.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Version information:</p>\n<pre><code>radare2 version: \nradare2 3.1.0-git 20049 @ linux-x86-64 git.3.0.1-214-g5759f21\ncommit: 5759f217c941478ef265bf9a6ba5e23cd646661a\n</code></pre>\n</div>",

If you don't want or need that, it's okay as well. This is also the likely reason you could not comment on your own question then.</span>",
