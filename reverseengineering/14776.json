You can add a structure via Structures window (View--&gt;Open Subviews--&gt;Structures, or <kbd>Shift-F9</kbd>) , import the header file via File--&gt;Load file--&gt;Parse C header file, or <kbd>Ctrl-F9</kbd> (this will also import typedefs if needed) or use a type library as described in <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/13175/how-to-import-windows-ddk-headers-into-ida\">How to import Windows DDK headers into IDA?</a> .</li>\n<li>After that you should locate cursor at the function definition, press <kbd>Y</kbd> and enter C function prototype as it stated in the function definition.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Good luck.</p>\n</div>",
