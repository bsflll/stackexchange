    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Reading arguments as well as return values is pretty trivial when utilizing Frida. But is there any way to read data that is modified through pass by reference. I am attempting to read some data in an iOS application that utilizes this scenario. These are also called inout parameters in Swift. This is the piece of code in Swift:</p>\n<pre><code>var pubKey, privKey: SecKey?\nlet status = SecKeyGeneratePair(parameters, &amp;pubKey, &amp;privKey)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Because SecKeyGeneratePair isnâ€™t really returning anything but rather modifying a variable by reference, I am unsure what to hook into.</p>\n</div>",

The only problem is that you should modify them in onLeave but they are by default only present in onEnter. AFAIR you can save them to <code>this.variablexyz</code> so that you can access them in onLeave (sorry I am not able to find a full example at the moment).</span>",
