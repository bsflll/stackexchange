    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So basically I am trying to re-implement a memory protection technique, with the description like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A 256M segment is reserved for application code and </li>\n<li>A 512M segment is reserved for some special data (can't be modified during runtime)</li>\n<li>...</li>\n<li><code>%fs</code> register is used to access the 512M memory of special data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am thinking to leverage some segmentation based protection on 32bit x86, however, I am trapped in the first step, <strong>how to reserve some memory for the special data mentioned above ?</strong></p>\n<p>So basically what i am trying to do is very similar with Google's Native Client, I \nquote some thing for its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Native_Client\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The x86-32 implementation of Native Client is notable for its novel \n      sandboxing method which makes use of the x86 architecture's rarely \n      used segmentation facility.</p>\n<p>Native Client sets up x86 segments to restrict the memory range \n      that the sandboxed code can access.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Could anyone give me some help on this issue ?</p>\n</div>",

Unless you are writing some emulator or a virtual machine you cannot guarantee that memory will always be available at some specific address.
