    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Host and target are both Windows 7 x64.\nThe session goes well, but sometimes after 15-20 minutes the target freezes (like a break point was hit), but WinDbg reports that the debuggee is running and it can not take commands. Also, when I attempt to break into the target (ctrl + break)  I am told that I can't communicate with the target:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wrote 0 of 1 bytes of the breakin packet.\n  Failed to write breakin packet to target.  HRESULT 0x80004005\n  WARNING: The HOST cannot communicate with the TARGET!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If I am quick to catch the moment, the first errors are different: Win32 error 0n23 and Win32 error 0n121. I looked around for this error, but I could not find something related to WinDbg.</p>\n<p>The only way I can resume my session is to shut down the target by pressing it's power button.</p>\n<p>At first I thought this has something to do with the target entering stand by, but I modified the power options so it should never enter in a sleep state and I started to actively use it. </p>\n<p>I thought this was my driver's fault (although it just iterates through some LIST_ENTRYs and displays some addresses with DbgPrint) so I restarted the target and never loaded my driver. </p>\n<p>I noticed that right before this happens the target display goes black for a moment. Any place where I should start looking?</p>\n</div>",
