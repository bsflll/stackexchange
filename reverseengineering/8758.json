Non-virtual methods look exactly like normal functions except they take an implicit 'this' pointer. If you are dealing with visual C++ compiled program then it will probably be a bit more obvious as usually it uses <strong>thiscall</strong> calling convention so you just need to watch for cases when the instance address is in ecx at function entry. See <a href=\"http://www.openrce.org/articles/full_view/23\" rel=\"nofollow\">my article</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>Of course, if you have symbols then it's very easy - just check for <code>classname::</code> prefix in the demangled function name.</p>\n</div>",
