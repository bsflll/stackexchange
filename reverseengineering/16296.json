In this paper, we demonstrate how page fault analysis\nand some creative processor fuzzing can be used to exhaustively search\nthe x86 instruction set and uncover the secrets buried in a chipset.\nThe approach has revealed critical x86 hardware glitches, previously\nunknown machine instructions, ubiquitous software bugs, and flaws in\nenterprise hypervisors.</p>\n<p><strong>Author:</strong> Christopher Domas</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Domas-Breaking-The-x86-Instruction-Set-wp.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Domas-Breaking-The-x86-Instruction-Set-wp.pdf</a></p>\n<p><strong>Related Resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/sandsifter\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/sandsifter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Somehow related microcode-internals from academia:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Title:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Reverse Engineering x86 Processor Microcode</em></p>\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>\nMicrocode is an abstraction layer on top of the physical\ncomponents of a CPU and present in most generalpurpose\nCPUs today. In addition to facilitate complex and\nvast instruction sets, it also provides an update mechanism\nthat allows CPUs to be patched in-place without requiring\nany special hardware. While it is well-known that CPUs\nare regularly updated with this mechanism, very little is\nknown about its inner workings given that microcode and\nthe update mechanism are proprietary and have not been\nthroughly analyzed yet.\nIn this paper, we reverse engineer the microcode semantics\nand inner workings of its update mechanism of conventional\nCOTS CPUs on the example of AMD’s K8 and\nK10 microarchitectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nhow to develop custom microcode updates. We describe\nthe microcode semantics and additionally present a set of\nmicroprograms that demonstrate the possibilities offered\nby this technology. To this end, our microprograms range\nfrom CPU-assisted instrumentation to microcoded Trojans\nthat can even be reached from within a web browser\nand enable remote code execution and cryptographic implementation\nattacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Author:</strong> Philipp Koppe, Benjamin Kollenda, Marc Fyrbiak, Christian Kison, Robert Gawlik, Christof Paar, and Thorsten Holz</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://syssec.rub.de/media/emma/veroeffentlichungen/2017/08/16/usenix17-microcode.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://syssec.rub.de/media/emma/veroeffentlichungen/2017/08/16/usenix17-microcode.pdf</a></p>\n<p><strong>Related Work/Reads</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://inertiawar.com/microcode/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://inertiawar.com/microcode/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://argp.github.io/2017/09/14/re-x86-microcode/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://argp.github.io/2017/09/14/re-x86-microcode/</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>EDIT: I added the reference mentioned by Dan.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Title:</strong></p>\n<p>Page Fault Liberation Army or Gained in Translation: a history of creative x86 virtual memory uses</p>\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>\n<p>x86 processors contain a surprising amount of built-in memory translation logic, which is driven by various data tables with intricate entry formats, and can produce various kinds of traps and other interesting computational effects.

It is very unlikely to find a (significant) bug in a CPU. Even though it happens from time to time.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it is much more interesting to look at software bugs (because they are more likely) than hardware bugs.</p>\n<p>Yet, you have a few occurrences of hardware bugs that led to disclosure of some \"secrets\". The most famous one being probably the one from the Bell company (the 2600Hz bug).</p>\n<p>Basically, this bug was coming from the fact that they were two types of signals transmitted between the phone booth and the telecommunication central. The <em>command signals</em> and the <em>voice signals</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Command signals</strong>: They were used to send commands such as the destination of the phone call (phone number), the start/end of the communication, the amount of coins payed, and so on.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Voice signals</strong>: They were used to encode the audio signal of the phone communication.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>All these signals were encoded into an electrical signals and sent from the phone booth to the central. The problem was coming from the fact that the encoding module from the <em>voice signals</em> was not strictly bounded to usual human voice frequencies. One could produce an unusual sound in the phone and get an encoding that would be understood as a <em>command signal</em> by the central.</p>\n<p>In fact, one hacker did realize that if you produced a sound of 2600Hz, the audio encoding of this signal was corresponding to a <em>command signal</em> of a long-distance call (it was as if you inserted a coin of 25 cents in the phone booth). And, by an extraordinary coincidence, at this time a brand of cereals (for kids' breakfast), called \"<em>Cap'n Crunch</em>\", was offering to his customers a whistle that was producing a sound of this exact same frequency.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PpRq3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PpRq3.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>At this time, these cereal boxes became very popular and the phone company did loose a bit of money. :-)</p>\n</div>",

Nonetheless, the complexity is so great that having source code wouldn't be of much benefit.</p>\n<p>If we focus on instruction execution (vs peripheral functions like memory management), functionality is quite well defined, and therefore easy to verify. Moreover, the cost of a mistake is quite high--you can't simply push out a patch like you can in software. Therefore, designs are simulated for days before being taped out, and there are even formal methods to prove that every part of the chip has been exercised.</p>\n<p>However, the amount of state held by a CPU is astronomical. A bug where the CPU jumped to the wrong instruction all the time would be quickly found. The reality is that there could be a rare sequence of events--perhaps not even easily reproducible given the stochastic nature of out-of-order processors--that leads to misbehavior. Such bugs would also be hard to exploit.</p>\n<p>There are indeed bugs found after tape out. Most processors have an errata sheet, and few designs go to production on A0 (one full tape out, no metal fixes) silicon. But, I mostly see bugs or design gaps in peripheral functions. For an example list of bugs, search for something like \"Skylake errata.\"</p>\n</div>",
