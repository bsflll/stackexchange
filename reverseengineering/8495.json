Is it possible to do so?  </p>\n<p>I have some experience to use command line ida, but that only limits to execute some IDAPython scripts.  </p>\n<p>The test is on Windows 7, with IDA-Pro 6.6 and BinDiff 4.1. </p>\n</div>",

I know i've read about it somewhere. You would still have to start IDA to generate the idb file, but as far as i know that's also possible via the command line. <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/417.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/417.shtml</a> seems to cover this, check the -B parameter.</span>",
