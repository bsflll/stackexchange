    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to do windows kernel debugging with VirtualBox and WinDBG. But every time I hit a breakpoint the virtual machine CPU usage skyrockets and the CPU registers do not show up in WinDBG. Am I doing something wrong?</p>\n<p>What I have done:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In <code>boot.ini</code> I set <code>/debugport=COM1 /baudrate=115200</code>;</li>\n<li>In VirtualBox I forwarded <code>COM1</code> to a named pipe <code>\\\\.\\pipe\\debug</code>;</li>\n<li>In WinDBG File &gt; <code>Kernel Debug...</code> &gt; <code>COM</code> tab: Ticked the \"Pipe\" check box, and for the <code>Port = \\\\\\\\.\\pipe\\debug</code>;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In WinDBG the debug session is found, and I can hit breakpoints, I can step through code, I can see the disassembled code in the \"Disassembly window\", and I can view memory locations in the \"Memory window\". But nothing shows up in WinDBG \"Registers window\".</p>\n<p>The Host OS is Windows 10 and for the Virtual Guest OS i tried both Windows XP and Windows 7 both have the same issue.</p>\n<p>I am really not sure where to look for answers to this issue, could anyone point me in the right direction ?</p>\n<p>For anyone else having this issue or trying to learn kernel debugging i used parts from the following tutorials to get to where I am so far:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Windows_Kernel_Debugging\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Windows Kernel Debugging Tips</a> (Virtualbox documentation);</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/03/27/configure-windbg-kernel-debugging/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">How to configure WinDbg for kernel debugging</a> (blogpost).</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
