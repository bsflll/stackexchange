It is a bit like trying to compare a fish and a bike. To be more precise, breakpoint is used to stop a program in order to analyze the memory at this point. And, hooking won't stop the program but run a given function at start and at exit of a given program block.</span>",

Ive read zines, CTF &amp; crackmes writeups that use hooks due to time checks or something implemented in the target.  However, in all the situations encountered I never thought \"cant use a debugger in this situation! Lets go hooking!\" The only time I have is anti-malware or AV, which led to this question. When would you <i>need</i> to utilize hook rather than debug (outside of the aforementioned reasons) outside of AV/malware usage? I know its preferred when REing packers because it would be faster than dbg or writing a dbg script.</span>",
