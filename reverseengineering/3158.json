    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to reverse engineer some data received over serial port. </p>\n<p>The hardware sending the data consists of a gps, compass and a power monitoring unit (which sends information about the battery).</p>\n<p>I received three types of messages of varying length. These are given below:</p>\n<pre><code>55 BB 55 BB 33 00 E7 29 B4 BD D7 82 61 39 23 C4 04 74 04 38 6B 02 12 8E 8D F3 E3 D7 4B 59 91 9C 01 98 0F C5 43 95 D2 03 D2 CC 4B B1 9A A2 54 8C 99 4A 00 DD 02 AB CD \n\n55 BB 55 BB 38 00 85 1F EA BD DE D0 87 7F 14 9A 5C 46 78 7A D1 E7 29 56 2E 7D F9 A9 FF DE E4 6C F2 F5 26 0D EF CD 6A ED B0 28 1D 9E DB 9D 8E BA 5F 58 26 3F B3 DD 03 00 A6 73 AB CD\n\n55 BB 55 BB 24 00 F3 8B FD F6 BF D0 B0 06 05 8D 7C 40 19 CF 29 72 0E 88 B5 0F 4E 56 67 1C 56 AE F8 A3 01 00 DE 05 AB CD\n</code></pre>\n<p>What i have understood so far is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Each message starts with 55 BB 55 BB which i assume is the Message Header.</p></li>\n<li><p>The field (byte 5) is the length of the message from 5th till the last byte.</p></li>\n<li><p>It is then followed by 00 which might mark the start of payload.</p></li>\n<li><p>The last two bytes are always AB CD which might be a trailing header.</p></li>\n<li><p>The fourth last and third last bytes might be checksum for the message.</p></li>\n<li><p>The fifth last byte is always zero which might indicate the end of payload. </p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The checksum is obtained by using The 8-bit Fletcher Checksum Algorithm described in the TCP alternate checksum options document (rfc1145).</p>\n<p>The data in the payload doesn't make sense. I have to figure out the order as well any encryption that might be occurring. It seems as they are Xoring the data and the Xor mask changes everytime. But they are sending the Xor mask in the data. I tried Xoring the whole string with each byte but couldn't obtain something similar to known values for Lat/Long.</p>\n<p>Can somebody provide some guidance on how should i proceed?</p>\n<p>Some work has been done here before. <a href=\"http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1995704\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rcgroups Post#15</a></p>\n<p>Here is a rft file containing the rest of the data.\n<a href=\"http://www.4shared.com/office/N7Bi3Gup/20131209153158.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">4shared Link RTF File</a></p>\n</div>",

Also, can you share the rest of the data in some format that isn't Windows only?  Some of use use other operating systems.  Also, if it's really RTF, a much easier format for automated processing would be plain text or plain binary.</span>",
