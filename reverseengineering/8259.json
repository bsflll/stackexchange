Is this common or potentially something more sinister? Is the next best course of action to run reshack in a debugger and watch what happens? </p>\n<p>UPDATE</p>\n<p>I manually saved the potentially offending bitmap in question by right clicking and pressing 'save'. I will analyze the bitmap independently. </p>\n</div>",
