    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I was trying to reverse engineer a native lib code in an android app. the <code>.so</code> contains many functions. But the function <code>sUQWWyTBEs()</code> was referred in the Java code. I was curious how this function works, the code of the function <code>sUQWWyTBEs()</code> decompiled with <code>Ghidra</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>*************************************************************\n                             *                           FUNCTION                          \n                             *************************************************************\n                             undefined  __cdecl  Myapp_sUQWWyTBEs()\n             undefined         w0:1           &lt;RETURN&gt;\n             longlong *        x0:8           param_1\n                             Myapp_sUQWWyTBEs XREF[2]:     Entry Point (*) , 00101350   \n        00100e44 08  00  40  f9    ldr        x8, [param_1 ]\n        00100e48 01  00  00  b0    adrp       x1, s_c7a584936712f32773d3d0a_00101000           ; = \"c7a584936712f32773d3d0a\"\n        00100e4c 21  60  08  91    add        x1, x1, #0x218\n        00100e50 02  9d  42  f9    ldr        x2, [x8, #0x538 ]\n        00100e54 40  00  1f  d6    br         x2\n</code></pre>\n<p>in my understanding, I have made the static analysis as like following:</p>\n<p><code>00100e44 08  00  40  f9    ldr        x8, [param_1 ]</code></p>\n<p>load the value at memory address param_1 into register x8.</p>\n<p><code>0100e48 01  00  00  b0    adrp       x1, s_c7a584936712f32773d3d0a_00101000  </code></p>\n<p>sets register x1 to 0x101000.</p>\n<p><code>00100e4c 21  60  08  91    add        x1, x1, #0x218</code></p>\n<p>adds 0x218 to x1, so it sets x1 to 0x101218.</p>\n<p><code>00100e50 02  9d  42  f9    ldr        x2, [x8, #0x538 ]</code></p>\n<p>loads the value at x8 + 0x538 into x2.</p>\n<p><code>00100e54 40  00  1f  d6    br         x2</code></p>\n<p>and finally branches to the  address stored in <code>x2</code>.</p>\n<p>with that being said, Here I don't know the memory at address at <code>x2</code>, obviously it initially  depends on the value <code>param_1</code> holds. is there way or how can I refer where <code>param_1</code> was initialized? I don't know very much about usage of <code>Ghidra</code> or other reverse engineering tools. any one might help would be appreciated.</p>\n<p>Edit: <strong>This function returns a string like this <code>47fjlkj843h9asjklj94kljfsad93j4l2715943hasd...</code> but what I wanted is that how this value was generated or returned.</strong></p>\n</div>",
