This instruction doesn't erase the data that was previously at <code>esp</code> (so <code>ecx-4</code> still points to the return address), but stack pointer points now to possibly different value than at the begining of the function. So there is a need to push the return value (<code>[ecx-4]</code>) on the stack so that <code>esp</code> points to the return address instead of some garbage data.</p>\n<p>For instance, assume that previous <code>esp</code> value was <code>0x11111118</code>. Then the function return address is located at <code>esp</code> (i.e. equals <code>[esp]</code>). But after the <code>and</code> operation, <code>esp</code> now equals <code>0x11111110</code>, so the function return address is at <code>esp+8</code> address, which is not on the stack (actually <strong>below</strong> it) and <code>esp</code> now points to some other data, which definitely isn't the function return address. But we know that <code>ecx-4</code> points to that address (since <code>ecx</code> = <code>0x11111118+4</code>=<code>0x1111111C</code>), so we push <code>[ecx-4]</code> on the stack, so that <code>esp</code> now points to it.</p>\n</div>",
