If there is no-prior knowledge I do assume you know Java and like to puzzle. Lets have a look at the most basic steps of reversing an APK.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first and most important rule in Reverse Engineering is, you want to know what makes it tick. This requires research, thus first research how APK works.</li>\n<li>First I would read the basic information about the file format, use Wikipedia ( <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APK_(file_format)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">APK on Wikipedia</a></li>\n<li>After having an idea what I want to reverse I'll look for known tooling, either use Google or recommended <a href=\"http://www.woodmann.com/collaborative/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Woodmann</a></li>\n<li>Ok, so Wikipedia said it was a zip file. So first unzip it, then pick-up the file and tooling that you are interested in ( classes.dex )</li>\n<li>A quick Google resulted produced a <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1249973/decompiling-dex-into-java-sourcecode\" title=\"Dex2Jar\">stackoverflow question</a></li>\n<li>After that you got Java, so woodmann has some Java decompilation tools. <a href=\"http://www.woodmann.com/collaborative/tools/index.php/Category:Java_Decompilers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Java Decompilation at Woodmann</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Good luck, don't give up and remember if it's hard it is worth it. If it is too hard, try harder. :)</p>\n</div>",

Here's a link:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.decompiler.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.decompiler.com/</a></p>\n<p>If you want to be able to edit the APK and recompile, use \"ApkTool\" and edit the SMALI code. You'll need to jar sign the APK and use zipalign before reinstalling the APK to your phone.</p>\n<p>You can also use IDA Pro to help analyze the code, however I don't know anything about IDA Pro.</p>\n</div>",
