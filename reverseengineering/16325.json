So, you can obtain this file (or any other file of interest) from device or VM using <code>fnsysctl</code> and <code>exec backup</code> commands, together with the configured tftp-server. In my case it looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>#&gt; fnsysctl cp /bin/init /var/log/root/mlog.0\n#&gt; exec backup disk log tftp AA.BB.CC.DD anomaly\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, rename the received file on the tftp-server.</p>\n</div>",
