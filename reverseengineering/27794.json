    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>i was wondering how to get to the function definition of a function pointer. Currently i have a function which is called in the following way:</p>\n<pre><code>iVar = (*DAT)(param_2, PTR_s)\n</code></pre>\n<p>When i press on *DAT i see that it is referenced by several functions. What i am wondering know is what the function definition looks like because i am interested in what the function is doing. How do i get to the function definition from the pointer?</p>\n</div>",
