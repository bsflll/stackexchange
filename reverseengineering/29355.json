Could someone please explain in simple words the concept of data only attacks, what's their purpose and why choose this method over others?</p>\n<p>Note: I am familiar with other techniques such as the various ret2, jop/rop,...</p>\n<p>Additionally, I would appreciate it if someone who knew a \"cheat sheet\"/wiki-like site/GitHub that shows modern concepts regarding exploitation(not old stuff that the internet is full with). I am pretty sure it could help a lot of people here as well.</p>\n<p>My goal is to help make things more secure and I really want to contribute my part to aid.</p>\n</div>",
