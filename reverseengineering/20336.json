On the far left you have also some arrows indicating jumps and on the far right there are comments.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>May I know how the command below:<br/>\n   wa je 0x400976 @0x00400968<br/>\n   changes 760c to 740c and jne 0x400976 to je 0x400976?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><code>wa</code> command, which you could check by requesting help in r2, is a command that writes the opcode of the provided mnemonic.</p>\n<pre><code>| wa[?] push ebp       write opcode, separated by ';' (use '\"' around the command)\n</code></pre>\n<p>So executing <code>wa je 0x400976 @0x00400968</code> will write the opcodes for the <code>je 0x400976</code> at the address of <code>0x400968</code>. </p>\n<p>And actually it changes from <code>750c</code>, and that is the opcode of the jump-not-equal with the offset of <code>0xC</code> bytes. You requested (by issuing the command <code>wa</code>) to write on that spot the jump-if-equal and the opcode of this is <code>74</code>. The offset stays the same.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, what does that accomplish? Does it just bypass the function</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It changes the condition so from now on the jump will be taken when the strings that are being compared (@<code>0x400961</code>) are equal and not taken if they are different. This also happens to the string being printed at offset <code>0x400971</code>.</p>\n<p>Apart from the first question this is nor really radare2 specific stuff. It looks like you should start with some basic assembly and/or RE topics/tutorials that are plenty on the internet.</p>\n</div>",
