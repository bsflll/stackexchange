    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have an (ARM) object file that I want to inspect. There are some instructions that load addresses pointing to another area in the object file. I would like to see the contents of the area, but <code>objdump -Ds</code> shows <code>...</code> and skips the whole section. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>000230cc &lt;heap_size_129&gt;:\n   230cc:       00000000        andeq   r0, r0, r0\n\n000230d0 &lt;small_integers&gt;:\n        ...\n\n000231d8 &lt;heap_size_33&gt;:\n   231d8:       00000000        andeq   r0, r0, r0\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, I need the contents of <code>small_integers</code>. Does <code>...</code> mean it is full of <code>andeq r0,r0,r0</code> (i.e., <code>null</code>)?</p>\n<p>I cannot find other flags beside <code>-Ds</code> in the <code>objdump</code> manpage that may help here.</p>\n</div>",
