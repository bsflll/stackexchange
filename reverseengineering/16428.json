    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have been trying to figure this out for quite some time now, and would really need some help. Firstly, some intro:</p>\n<p>I am running the newest version of radare2 from Github on a 64bit Ubuntu 16.04 and have the following sample program <code>r2_test.cpp</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;cstdio&gt;\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\n    int num;\n\n    while (1)\n    {\n        printf(\"Enter a number: \");\n        scanf(\"%d\", &amp;num);\n        printf(\"You entered: %d\\n\", num);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>What I am trying to achieve is to debug this program using radare2 and two terminals in a way that I run radare2 in terminal window <code>T1</code> and have the programs input/output in terminal window <code>T2</code>. After some research I figured that this should probably be done with the help of <code>rarun2</code> tool. </p>\n<p>So, for my first try I read the <a href=\"https://github.com/radare/radare2/blob/master/man/rarun2.1#L139\" rel=\"noreferrer\">man page</a> for rarun2, specifically the part with redirecting IO to another terminal and after identifying the <code>T2</code> terminal as <code>/dev/pts/17</code> I created the following <code>test.rr2</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/rarun2\nstdio=/dev/pts/17\n</code></pre>\n<p>In <code>T2</code> terminal I've then run <code>sleep 999999</code> and in terminal <code>T1</code> I run <code>r2 -R test.rr2 -d a.out</code> and when executing the command <code>dc</code> inside radare2, the programs input/output is in terminal <code>T1</code> which is not what I wanted. I've also tried variations like making <code>test.rr2</code> equal </p>\n<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/rarun2\nstdin=/dev/pts/17\nstdout=/dev/pts/17\n</code></pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/rarun2\nstdio=/dev/pts/17\nstdin=/dev/pts/17\nstdout=/dev/pts/17\n</code></pre>\n<p>but the result was always the same.</p>\n<p>For my second try, after some research and reading, I tried running the radare2 in the following way: <code>r2 -d rarun2 program=a.out stdio=/dev/pts/17</code>. With this I've achieved redirecting the IO to terminal <code>T2</code>, but the process which gets debugged inside radare2 is the rarun2 tool and since my knowledge of Linux and reverse engineering on it is not that good, I don't really know how to proceed to debugging the <code>a.out</code> process.</p>\n<p>So, to summarize, I would really appreciate if someone could share here if this kind of debugging can be done with radare2 and, if it can, how to achieve it? I've also tried it with using <code>nc</code>, but I haven't made any progress to this topic with it.</p>\n</div>",

Now just for the example, let's put a <em>breakpoint</em> on the second call to <code>printf</code> and start the program using <code>dc</code>. In the <em>gif</em> I was not creating a breakpoint.</p>\n<pre><code>[0x7f9654e0fd80]&gt; db 0x00400580\n[0x7f9654e0fd80]&gt; dc\nSelecting and continuing: 14074\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now <em>T2</em> gives us the output and asks for our input:</p>\n<pre><code>Enter a number:\n</code></pre>\n<p>After we send it a digit our breakpoint on <em>T1</em> hit:</p>\n<pre><code>hit breakpoint at: 400580\n[0x00400580]&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can now continue the execution using <code>dc</code>, the loop would continue forever and the Standard Input and Output will be in T2.</p>\n</div>",

Also, I only tried with the -R option and with it it doesn't work.

If you have time, can you check if it will work for you with the -R.</span>",
