Calculate the effective address of the shellcode then and put in the packed address(\\x01\\xef\\xcd\\xab for 0xabcdef01) in place of BBBB. Follow the tutorial carefully which you're trying. Read on the materials suggested/provided.</span>",

Another option is returning to a Windows API; then you must correctly set arguments before calling function and bypass ASLR.  </p>\n<p>* Since some compilers can place buffers immediately after return value, I assume <code>pass</code> variable stored higher addresses than <code>buff</code> and you overwrote it.</p>\n</div>",
