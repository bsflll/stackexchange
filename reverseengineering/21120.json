To do so, it will directly check if the method (this + 8) is equal to the current method (0x004EDC58). If it's true, it will continue to the current code. Otherwise, the address of the method at <code>this + 8</code> is read and it jumps to this address.</p>\n<p>You have different options to set a type to this memory part. Since it seems to be a pointer to something, go to this address address and type 'o' or <code>Edit → Operand type → Offset → Offset (data segment)</code>.</p>\n</div>",
