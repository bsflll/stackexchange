There are many such resources; <a href=\"https://github.com/libvmi/libvmi/blob/master/notes/pe.txt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here's one</a>. Specifically, you're going to want to locate the <code>IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER</code> structures, and then consult their <code>VirtualAddress</code> and <code>SizeOfRawData</code> fields. You can identify the <code>.text</code> section either through the <code>Name</code> field, or by checking the <code>Characteristics</code> field for the <code>IMAGE_SCN_CNT_CODE</code> bit.</p>\n</div>",
