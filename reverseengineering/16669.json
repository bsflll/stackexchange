    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have seen the ways to modify an apk using apktools and adding android:debugging=\"true\" but I have an apk that check for changes and crashes if any changes are made. Is it possible to capture the running thread and set a breakpoint using smalidea or something similar? I'm trying to capture some info from the apk in order to write something similar as I'm not getting any feedback from the original developer (in China).</p>\n</div>",
