When on XP, I can use StrongOD and PhantOm but neither of these work properly on Windows 7. I could use the XP machine via RDP but my Win 7 machine is much less irritating to use. </p>\n<p>Does anybody have any suggestions? </p>\n</div>",

It could well be installed on your system and catching the debugger out.</p>\n<p>My first suggestion would be to try <a href=\"http://debugger.immunityinc.com/\">Immunity Debugger</a>. It's an Olly fork that is designed for offensive debugging and exploit development, but it might have a different enough codebase and enough anti-anti-debug stuff built in to help.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you could use <a href=\"http://cheatengine.org/index.php\">Cheat Engine</a> along with its DBVM kernel-mode module. It's usually used for cheating in games, but CE actually has a very fully featured debugger and some nice stealth features. The driver component re-implements a bunch of core Windows APIs, such as OpenProcess.</p>\n<p>If the kernel-mode driver <em>isn't</em> still around, then it may well just be something like the OutputDebugString trick causing the crash. If the target is using TLS callbacks to execute code before WinMain, it might crash the debugger before you get to it. You could try editing Olly's options so that it breaks on the system entry point rather than WinMain.</p>\n</div>",

I need a debugger to find its CRC check methods and detour them. I did not know about the DBVM module, it works like a charm - breakpoints and all! CE's debugger confuses me a bit, but I'm learning slowly. Thank you thank you thank you though, MS has no idea CE is attached.   One nasty thing happened the first time I attached though. I BSOD'd; this happened with Olly once too. I think it's an anti-anti-debug method; BSOD message was BAD ACCESS/segfault.</span>",

It is a kernel-mode hiding driver for both x86 and x64 OSses. It has the following features:</p>\n<pre><code>- ProcessDebugFlags (NtQueryInformationProcess)\n- ProcessDebugPort (NtQueryInformationProcess)\n- ProcessDebugObjectHandle (NtQueryInformationProcess)\n- DebugObject (NtQueryObject)\n- SystemKernelDebuggerInformation (NtQuerySystemInformation)\n- NtClose (STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE exception)\n- ThreadHideFromDebugger (NtSetInformationThread)\n</code></pre>\n<p>TitanHide is open-source and it's relatively easy to add new hooks. Notice that you need to disable PatchGuard and driver signing for it to work correctly on an x64 OS. Take a look <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/*/fyyre.ivory-tower.de\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>Edit: I would like to point out that TitanHide is no longer maintained and not recommended for use in production environments. Always use a VM. For simple applications I would also recommend <a href=\"https://github.com/x64dbg/ScyllaHide\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ScyllaHide</a></p>\n</div>",
