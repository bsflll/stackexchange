What I notice is that Radare (running pD) generates assembly code that is byte addressed whereas Avr Studio works with word addressing. \nIs there any simple way of instructing Radare2 to handle addressing using words rather than bytes?\nMany thanks in advance!</p>\n<p>Regards,\n  Staffan</p>\n</div>",
