I have searched Google and it seems to come up with CTF find a password type of challenges.</p>\n<p>Are there resources that focus on challenges similar to CTF, but specific to finding vulnerabilities is binaries, such as BO, RELRO, NX bypass, ROP, etc...?</p>\n</div>",

Any 10 minute Google attempt would give you some results from which one could work. Then one could come back and ask for more specific help and demonstrate ones 'failed' attempt(s) (research effort). It will also generate a primarily opinion based answer, although that should not be a reason to down vote but to close.</span>",

It also has a rating system for people who have completed the \"challenge\" which includes fun factor/educational/difficulty which I found useful when trying to find problems to do. The one caveat is you run into a lot of contrived examples (aka DEFCON bs, like shellcode goes through a bubble sort) though practice is practice. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://microcorruption.com/login\" rel=\"nofollow\">MicroCorruption</a> is a embedded CTF type website with a nice interface including interactive debugger that was put together by Matasano and Square. It focuses on embedded type systems and goes through the gamut of bugs but in an embedded environment (not x86, praise jesus)</p>\n<p>Another option is to go through disclosed vulnerabilities from <a href=\"http://www.exploit-db.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">exploit-db</a>. This obviously requires you to find proper versions of software but generally I've seen ways to obtain the software.</p>\n</div>",
