IDA and x64dbg each have their advantages and disadvantages. You need to see which to use depending on your primary purpose - decompliation or debugging. It is possible to achieve the same with IDA with scripting. x64dbg has a ready (and free) plugin that does exactly what you'd asked for... If you can script well then you can do it in IDA itself.</span>",
