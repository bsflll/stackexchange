It lets you execute what they call \"ruleset\" and \"retrohunt\" searches which are basically running yara rules on every sample processed through virustotal and every sample from the last 3 months. This is a paid service but it's definitely worth it.</p>\n<p>Here's an image that shows the retro-hunt and yara search web UI:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/M2GGu.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"yara ruleset search example\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/M2GGu.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
