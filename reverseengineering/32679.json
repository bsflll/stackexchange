Now I want to write a piece of C++ code to test the stability and efficiency of the interfaces of the module, among which the functions are mainly unexported.</p>\n<p>So my question is that how can I find the address of an unexported function and correctly call it from C++ with DLL and PDB?</p>\n</div>",

At run-time you need to add the base address of the DLL (which may change because of ASLR) and you have the full address of the function. Assuming the function doesn't expect special calling conventions you can then call it using the pointer.</span>",
