I chose to do this through LLVM and I had a question, where can I see a simple example of lifting instructions to the LLVM-IR level? For example, where can I look at code that just translate one pop rsp instruction to LLVM-IR? Since I didn't find anything like that.</p>\n<p>Maybe someone has articles where this is described or can someone suggest with an example?</p>\n</div>",
