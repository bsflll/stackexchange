    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm working on this problem: <a href=\"https://challenges.re/53/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Challenge 53</a></p>\n<p>When compiling with <code>cl c53.c /Fac53.asm /MD</code> in VS2019 X86 Development Console and loading the <code>.exe</code> into OllyDbg, I found OllyDbg labels all segments of <code>c53</code> as <code>R</code>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tAKt2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tAKt2.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Maybe there is some misunderstanding here, but why is the data segment not writable? Actually when I step into the program I can see the beginning of memory part of \"Hello, world!\" been overwritten by \"Goodbye!\" and there was no segfault (unlike in Linux there IS segfault and <s>I'm still trying to figure out why, but that's a different question</s> when checking <code>c53.o</code> in IDA it tells me the string \"Hello World!\" is in <strong>rodata</strong> so that segfault makes perfect sense):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Zg7jG.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Zg7jG.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>To verify that the strings are indeed in data segment, not in rodata segment, I checked the assembly code:</p>\n<pre><code>_DATA   SEGMENT\n$SG10125 DB 'Goodbye!', 00H\n    ORG $+3\n$SG10126 DB 'Result: %s', 0aH, 00H\n$SG10129 DB 'Hello, world!', 0aH, 00H\n_DATA   ENDS\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
