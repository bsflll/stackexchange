There's no documentation for Hopper Debugger Server, nor am I finding mention of it in the Hopper documentation.</p>\n<p>Any tips on how to make this work?</p>\n</div>",

Here's the procedure that needs to be followed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open a copy of the executable to be analyzed in Hopper on the host Mac</li>\n<li>Put a copy of the executable to be analyzed on the VM</li>\n<li>Install Hopper Debugger Server on the VM and launch it</li>\n<li>In Hopper on the host Mac, choose Debug &gt; Select Debugger</li>\n<li>Select the VM</li>\n<li>Change the path to the executable to the correct path on the VM, rather than the path to the file on the host Mac</li>\n<li>Begin debugging in Hopper on the host Mac!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I heard from someone else that doing this caused a beachball on their machine, but don't have details. This worked for me, using the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hopper 4.3.24</li>\n<li>Hopper Debugger Server 2.4</li>\n<li>macOS 10.13.4 on the host Mac</li>\n<li>macOS 10.12.6 on the VM</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
