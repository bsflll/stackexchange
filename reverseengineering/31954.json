    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to get Bluetooth devices to work in HID-Proxy mode with a Laird BT820 dongle. According to their docs at <a href=\"http://cdn.lairdtech.com/home/brandworld/files/Application%20Note%20-%20BT800%20Series%20HID%20Proxy.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://cdn.lairdtech.com/home/brandworld/files/Application%20Note%20-%20BT800%20Series%20HID%20Proxy.pdf</a> it states the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once a connection has taken place, the pairing is saved. The BT820 will always try to connect to same BLE device\nit has last connected to. The pairing entry needs to be cleared before it will connect to a new BLE device.\nThe pairing can be removed with HID “SET_FEATURE_REQ” command over USB – “0x06 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0\n0x0”. For testing purposes, there is an exe file to remove the pairing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't have the aforementioned exe file. Can anyone point me in the right direction on how to send this SET_FEATURE_REQ command?</p>\n</div>",
