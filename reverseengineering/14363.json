For debugging ELF I use <a href=\"https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">GDB</a> debugger. GDB can come with a GUI and you can find more about that in <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1392/decent-gui-for-gdb\">this answer</a> . Besides GDB, for reversing ELF files on Linux I would also suggest <a href=\"https://radare.org/r/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">radare2</a>.</p>\n</div>",
