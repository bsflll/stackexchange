    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I would like to know what is the simplest way to produce code binaries with instruction camouflage (see <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1673/what-is-a-instruction-camouflage-obfuscation\">this question</a>). </p>\n<p>The problem here is that you first have to produce a correct assembly code and then to hide it with a given method directly into the binary. Doing it by hand is quite painful, especially if you have to take care of the static jumps into the code. Right now, I am using <a href=\"http://www.nasm.us/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">nasm</a>, and more precisely its <a href=\"http://www.nasm.us/xdoc/2.10.07/html/nasmdoc4.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">preprocessor</a> to perform the camouflage operations. But, I wonder if there are better ways to do it.</p>\n<p>So, what tools or tricks do you use to produce such binaries ? </p>\n</div>",

I am of the opinion that the direct creation of obfuscation techniques, without a view to reversing them, is OT. In this early stage, it is really important to figure out what is and what isn't on topic.</span>",

Your new segment has the decryption code for the original code and the changed entry point now means that the first code to execute when the executable is loaded is your decryption code. </p>\n<p>Your encryption code then either maps a segment, usually at the address where the original executable segment was located, and decrypts the source segment into the mapped segment or it directly decrypts the segment in place. If your code decrypts the segment in place you need to make sure the remove any relocations from the original executable. </p>\n<p>In all cases, except if you get to map your decrypted executable segment at its original intended address, you need to do the relocations yourself after decryption so that the executable won't crash. Personally I would implement the relocations in order to support things like ASLR. After decryption and relocation you simply call into the original entry point.</p>\n<p>This way you do not have to create your encryption or \"masking\" code for a particular binary and applying it to arbitrary binaries in the future should be possible.</p>\n</div>",
