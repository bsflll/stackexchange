    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I just came across the MyNav Python scripts and would like to use some of their functionality on my IDA Pro database. I have IdaPython installed properly, but I cannot seem to get the plugins to show up in the menu. I have gone to File &gt; script and run MyNav.py, but all that happens is the myexport.pyc and mybrowser.pyc files get generated where I have the source files.</p>\n<p>I tried copying those into the plugins directory and restarting, but nothing shows up. The install documentation on the google code page is non-existent. Has anyone had any success installing this plugin package? </p>\n<p>I am using Python 2.7 with IdaPython 1.5.2, but have also tried with Python 2.6</p>\n</div>",
