    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I used ollydbg to look at the disassembly of a binary I made to get some practice with reversing. When I close Olly, and then reopen it after a crash, the assembly window is at a different location. How do I search for my comments to jump back to where I was working? I've tried ctrl-g to search for them, but that only seems to search through the assembly code itself.</p>\n</div>",

Back in the days I used <a href=\"http://www.openrce.org/downloads/details/107/Labelmaster\" rel=\"noreferrer\">LabelMaster</a> for this task.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>On a personal note, I highly recommend to use x64dbg which is an active open-source project, unlike Ollydbg which is absolutely outdated. Moreover, x64dbg is inspired by OllyDbg so you should not have too many problems with migrating to it.  </p>\n<p>Here are some resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://x64dbg.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">x64dbg main website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The project's Github repository</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://x64dbg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">x64dbg's documentation</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the record, you can list your defined comments in x64dbg by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> or by clicking the \"View\" menu and choosing \"Comments\".</p>\n</div>",
