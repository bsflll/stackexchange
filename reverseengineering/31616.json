The instruction shows that (RBP + -0x40) is equal to local_48, however at the beginning of the code, we can see that (RBP + -0x48) is equal to local_48. Also, I know that this is a struct. Is there something wrong here or am I looking at it wrong?</p>\n<p>The instruction I was talking about:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FXU8s.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Assembly Instruction\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FXU8s.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>And the beginning of the code:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Bpedz.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Beginning Of The Code\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Bpedz.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

Since <code>RBP</code> might have been set to the value of <code>RSP</code> <em>after</em> some pushes occurred, it could be a slightly different offset than the stack offset at the entry point of the function. This can take some getting used to as it is unintuitive.</p>\n<p>If you are still learning assembly, a good exercise is to follow the changes made to the stack pointer via pushes/pops in the function start, and verify that you understand why the offset of <code>RBP</code> later in the function body would be slightly different than the offset to <code>RSP</code> at the beginning of the function for the same stack address.</p>\n</div>",
