    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am currently working on an ELF-injector and my approach is standard: find code cave (long enough sequence of 0's), rewrite it with the instructions I want to execute and then jump back to the start of the original program to execute it as it normally would.</p>\n<p>To actually execute code in the code cave I tried two different approaches, both of which result in sigsegv.</p>\n<p>First one was changing entry point to the start of the code cave. The second one was \"stealing\" some of the first instructions from the original code and write jump to my code cave there and then after executing my injected code I would first execute stolen instructions and then jump to the instruction after the last stolen one in the original program.</p>\n<p>I am also changing the access flags for the section, in which code cave resides.</p>\n<p>Here are some screenshots of debugging the program in gdb:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IHC5I.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Instructions at entry point - 0x555555556156 is the address of code cave\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IHC5I.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wpJzp.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Instructions in the code cave - executing stolen ones and jumping back\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wpJzp.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KikfO.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Executing the code\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KikfO.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>And here are the flags for the section the code cave is in:</p>\n<p><code>[19]     0x555555556058-&gt;0x555555556160 at 0x00002058: .eh_frame ALLOC LOAD READONLY CODE HAS_CONTENTS</code></p>\n<p>This is the Valgrind output.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/I6P0g.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/I6P0g.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>So is there a way to actually allow the execution of code in this section.</p>\n<p>I also thought about adding new section to the binary and writing my code there. If someone had experience in doing so, I would appreciate the info.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I think I know what my mistake is - I set the executable flag for the section, but the segment it's in isn't executable. But it also seems like the code cave I found doesn't belong to any section, since the start of the code cave is actually the end of one section and the end of the code cave is the start of another section. And there are no other sections in between.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> I changed the code cave to the one, that is in <code>.fini</code> section, which belongs to executable segment. However I am still confused about the empty space between sections (and segments).</p>\n<p>Here are the screenshots of the <code>readelf</code> output</p>\n<pre><code>Section Headers:\n  [Nr] Name

The next section - .rodata starts at <code>2000</code>. Does that mean that the space between <code>11e8 + d</code> and <code>2000</code> does not belong to any section? That segment also ends at <code>11F5</code>, which is the end of last section belonging to it - <code>.fini</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT 3:</strong> managed to solve the problem - had to choose the section, that belongs to the executable segment. Still a bit confused about the sizes of sections.</p>\n<p>Actually managed to inject the code into the binary, however, I got the instructions from an assembly, which only has <code>.text</code> section:</p>\n<pre><code>.text\n.globl _start\n_start:\n  #save the base pointer\n  pushq %rbp\n  pushq %rbx\n  mov %rsp,%rbp\n\n  #write syscall = 1\n  movq $1, %rax\n  #print to stdout\n  movq $1, %rdi\n  #9 character long string\n  movq $9, %rdx\n\n  # push \"INJECTED\\n\" to the stack  \n  movq $0x0a, %rcx\n  pushq %rcx\n  movq $0x44455443454a4e49, %rcx\n  pushq %rcx\n\n  movq %rsp, %rsi\n\n  syscall\n\n  #remove the string\n  pop %rcx\n  pop %rcx\n\n  movq $0, %rax\n  movq $0, %rdi\n  movq $0, %rdx\n\n  \n  pop %rbx\n  pop %rbp\n  ret\n</code></pre>\n<p>It prints \"INJECTED\" before the original program execution. While this kind of payload works, what are other ideas of implementing better and actually usable injector? Maybe with the possibility of calling <code>libc</code> functions or some other library functions, that are linked by our victim binary? Because it seems like getting actual instruction from the code, we would like to inject, is kind of pain in the ass.</p>\n</div>",

You need to ensure your code belongs to an executable segment.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As can be seen, section .fini starts at 11e8 and has the size of d.\nThe next section - .rodata starts at 2000. Does that mean that the\nspace between 11e8 + d and 2000 does not belong to any section? That\nsegment also ends at 11F5, which is the end of last section belonging\nto it - .fini.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, the space between 11F5 and 2000 is a kind of \"no man's land\". In theory, the bytes there would not be present in the memory. However, in practice, the memory protections and mappings work on a page granularity (0x1000) so these bytes <em>are</em> mapped into memory and made executable so your patch works. To make everything \"legit\" it may be better to extend the segment length so it extends up to 2000.</p>\n</div>",

Correct me if I'm wrong, but looking at readelf output, section .fini starts at <code>11e8</code> and has the size of <code>d</code>. The next section starts at <code>2000</code>. Does that actually mean that the space from <code>11e8 + d</code> to <code>2000</code> does not belong to any section?</span>",
