I have found this : </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An opcode is binary or hex value of the machine instruction in the cpu\n  instruction set.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If I understand correctly the definition, for instance :</p>\n<pre><code>6A 03  push 3\n</code></pre>\n<p>6A is the opcode et 03 the operand. But in several posts on different forums, people talk about 03 as if it was an opcode (for instance <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/17671/what-is-an-immediate-value\">this</a> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here, 3 is an immediate because it's included directly as part of the opcode (in the second byte).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>).</p>\n<p>Does 03 is an opcode <strong>and</strong> an operand? </p>\n</div>",
