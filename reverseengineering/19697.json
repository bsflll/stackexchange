    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>In the core my question is about how to reverse engineer undocumented functions.\nI want to call the function \"xxxMouseEventDirect\" (located in win32kfull.sys). I have already been able to collect some information for this, but now I am a bit stuck.</p>\n<p>The call hierarchy is as follows:\nNtUserSendInput -&gt; xxxSendInput -&gt; xxxMouseEventDirect.</p>\n<p>The function looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>NTSTATUS __fastcall* xxxMouseEventDirect (ULONG dx, ULONG dy, ULONG mouseData, ULONG dwFlags, ULONGLONG time, ULONGLONG extraInfo, ULONGLONG, ULONG);\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am relatively sure that I call the function parameters correctly, but there is still a blue screen when I call the function.</p>\n<p>The bluescreen occurs like this:</p>\n<pre><code>mov rax, qword ptr [win32kfull!_imp_gptiCurrent (fffffbe9`4c720ec0)]\nmov r14, qword ptr [rax]\ncmp qword ptr [r14+1B0h], rcx ; &lt;--- Bluescreen because r14 == 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>When I call NtUserSendInput, rax points to a pointer which is then used via [r14+1B0h].\nWhen I call xxxMouseEventDirect directly, rax points to 0, causing [r14+1B0h] to cause a blue screen.\nI now wonder what is stored in win32kfull!_imp_gptiCurrent and why it is not there when I call xxxMouseEventDirect directly.</p>\n<p>I am relatively new in the field of reverse engineering and would like to know how to deal with such a problem in general. Concrete tips are of course also very welcome.</p>\n<p>Thank you </p>\n</div>",
