    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm analyzing a C++ PE binary with its debug symbols using IDA 7.3 w/ the decompiler.</p>\n<p>I'm using the HexRaysPyTools plugin to get the xrefs to class fields, but it doesn't show xrefs to virtual functions.</p>\n<p>I want to know if there is an existing similar plugin that can build the xref list for calls to virtual functions statically (ie. without running the code).</p>\n<p>As far as I can understand the behavior of HexRaysPyTools, it should be trivial to do that as the IDA decompiler already recognize virtual function calls when decompiling, I just need it to store the xref list to virtual functions just as HexRaysPyTools does with member fields.</p>\n</div>",
