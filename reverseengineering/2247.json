    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a PCB board that is a little involved to figure out its working. I spent a good day mapping trace by trace, node by node but still some node connections wouldn't make sense. I know designers use software to reroute PCB traces, making them compact and planar, also render them hard to decipher.  </p>\n<p>I was wondering if there is any software that helps me translate single sided PCB traces with components to schematics?</p>\n</div>",
