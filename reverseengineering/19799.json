So the machine is \"ARM aarch64\". I want to understand a single instruction and it's realization in ESIL. The opcode of the instruction is: \n<code>movk x4, 0x40, lsl 16</code></p>\n<p>The ESIL-string is: <code>-4294901761,x4,&amp;,4194304,|,x4,=</code></p>\n<p>Has anybody an idea, why it looks like that? Shouldn't it be a <code>&lt;&lt;</code> to \"shift left\"? </p>\n<p>The R2 commands I run are:</p>\n<pre><code>aa\ne asm.syntax = att\ne asm.emu = true\npdfj\n</code></pre>\n<p>(But i did this in R2pipe)</p>\n<p>I am curious about the solution and thank you in advance! :)</p>\n</div>",
