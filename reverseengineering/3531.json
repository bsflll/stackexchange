After googling days by days for tools but didn't get any, I had my temporary solution that I write a tool as below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>For load-time dynamic linking: Parsing the PE structure of this exe to export the dll names in the import directory then search them in %path% enviroment variable and the current directory of the exe. If the dlls exist, I copy them to the output.</p></li>\n<li><p>For run-time dynamic linking: Hooking the LoadLibrary functions to get the dll names then check the existence (similar as above).</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
