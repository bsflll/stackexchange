    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I was reverse engineering an <code>apk</code> and just found out it is using native functions for such operations. there are some exported and non-exported functions. wanted to get and hook those non-exported functions, tried possibilities but still no luck, for example; this <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51811348/find-manually-registered-obfuscated-native-function-address\">stack overflow question</a> though it looks like my problem and still get not applicable the solution mentioned there.</p>\n<p>previously I loaded the lib into <code>ghidra</code> and auto analyzed it and then used this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/FrankSpierings/f66c55ecc550039fd90666d469867ae7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">python script</a>, just to get frida hooks on functions interested. what this script does is that it gets all functions in the lib and then generates frida hook script for them, may be technically some fallacies, didn't investigate it. btw the plugin outputs the function interested hook:</p>\n<pre><code>//Hook function setAuthUser @ 0x8e427c\nInterceptor.attach(Module.findBaseAddress(\"librhodes.so\").add(ptr(0x7e427c)), {\n  onEnter: function (args) {\n    console.log(\"=&gt; setAuthUser(\" + args[0] + \")\")\n  },\n  onLeave: function (result) {\n    console.log(\"setAuthUser() =&gt; \" + result)\n  },\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>when I ran this script with the apk attached with <code>frida gadget</code>, I got no results. so apparently the function address is a miss. so what I wanted is that is there in frida a way to get all non-exported functions and their addresses to hook them. because I believe the offsets given by <code>ghidra</code> is not matching to the running apk lib? may be? no idea and I'm beginner to this.</p>\n<p>please help this</p>\n</div>",

I can confirm that it produces different memory addresses when using the two values <code>00100000</code> and <code>0x100000</code>.</span>",
