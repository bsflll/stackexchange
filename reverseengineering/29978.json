    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to create an instance of a class of an iOS app using Frida.</p>\n<p>In the past I have successfully done this using a command such as:</p>\n<pre><code>var instance = ObjC.chooseSync(ObjC.classes.TestClass)[0];\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, in this instance, the class that I would like to create an instance of has a <code>.</code> in the name so if I try the same command as above I understandably get an error:</p>\n<pre><code>var instance = ObjC.chooseSync(ObjC.classes.Test.Class)[0];\nSyntaxError: expecting field name\n</code></pre>\n<p>I had identified the class from the output of:</p>\n<pre><code>Object.keys(ObjC.classes).filter(function(m){ return m.toLowerCase().includes(\"test\") });\n</code></pre>\n<p>The output of this lists a number of classes, all of which are either mangled Swift names, or have a <code>.</code> in them so I'm not sure if I simply don't understood a concept here about how Frida handles class names in a Swift and Objective-C app, or there is something I've missed in attempting to create the instance.</p>\n</div>",
