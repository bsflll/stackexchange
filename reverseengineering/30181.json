    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Remembering all register contents may be exhausting so I would like to find a solution to be able to see all register contents at a chosen instruction in the Listing. I know debuggers got this function when you set a breakpoint at the instruction you are interested in and move to it, you can see the contents of all registers but is there a way to integrate this functionality into Ghidra? Some kind of plugin?</p>\n</div>",
