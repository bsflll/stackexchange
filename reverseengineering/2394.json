    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Sometimes when you load a binary manually in IDA you wind up with segments that have unknown read write and execute flags. You can see them under the Segments subview (<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F7</kbd>). Is there a way to change these flags from within the GUI of IDA without running a script and modifying them? </p>\n<p>It seems like such a basic piece of functionality which is very important for the proper operation of the Hex Rays decompiler. I've been using the class to express segment rights which just seems wrong considering these flags exist.</p>\n<p>Although I would appreciate the question being answered in the general case, in this particular case I'm dealing with flat binary ARM files with code and data intermixed. All page level permissions are set up by the software when it loads by directly mapping them via the MMU.</p>\n</div>",

Regarding your second solution (which is what I'm currently using), this isn't warning related. It has to do with data and code being intermixed. Hex Rays has issues with constant pools that are embedded in certain segment types which has significant negative impact on the decompilation when dealing with low level software. I'm leaning towards there being nothing built into IDA and the scripting solution mapped to a hotkey being the easiest.</span>",

Let's take <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/gg463119.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Microsoft's PE/COFF</a> format binary for example. This is basic layout of PE:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"PE/COFF Layout\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1XAik.png\"/></p>\n<p>Each segment that you see in IDA is a loaded in accordance to <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680341%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER</a> structure of the particular section/segment. The structure has the following format:</p>\n<pre><code>typedef struct _IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER {\n  BYTE  Name[IMAGE_SIZEOF_SHORT_NAME];\n  union {\n    DWORD PhysicalAddress;\n    DWORD VirtualSize;\n  } Misc;\n  DWORD VirtualAddress;\n  DWORD SizeOfRawData;\n  DWORD PointerToRawData;\n  DWORD PointerToRelocations;\n  DWORD PointerToLinenumbers;\n  WORD  NumberOfRelocations;\n  WORD  NumberOfLinenumbers;\n  DWORD Characteristics;\n} IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER, *PIMAGE_SECTION_HEADER;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong><code>DDWORD Characteristics</code></strong> member of the structure holds flags that indicate permission levels for the section/segment. There are lots different flags available, but to name few: <strong><code>IMAGE_SCN_MEM_READ</code></strong>, <strong><code>IMAGE_SCN_MEM_WRITE</code></strong>, and <strong><code>IMAGE_SCN_MEM_EXECUTE</code></strong>. </p>\n<p>As IDA loads executable, all work thereafter is done within the database. No changes are made to executable by IDA. I believe you will have to patch your executable in order to change read/write/execute permissions on a segment permanently. Unless, there is a script or plug-in to do it. </p>\n</div>",
