I want to highlight the code paths taken so that I only reverse engineer the parts that are being executed. Unfortunately, Lighthouse only plugs into IDA Pro and Binary Ninja paid versions.</p>\n<p>Perhaps there is a free plugin for Ghidra or radare2/Cutter?</p>\n<p>If such a plugin is not available, how can I go about making something like that? What would be the basic building blocks?</p>\n</div>",
