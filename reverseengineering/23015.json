I followed the above link and can view the ASCII values from the dereferenced pointers, but I would like to be able to dump it to a file. The only options I see are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Binary copy (these are the addresses, rather than values).</li>\n<li>Copy as Table (copies all the data...not needed)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any idea? I use both ollydbg and x32dbg so either is fine for a solution</p>\n</div>",
