This means there are paths listed with offsets and sizes.</li>\n<li>Header structure is 64 bytes for the game identification (magic number + a whole lot of 0x00), then a uint32 for total file size, then a uint32 for the offset where the first block of data ends</li>\n<li>Data follows, the first block takes up more than 90% of archive size. This is where the resources have to be located. This seems to be ciphered/encrypted.</li>\n<li>What is left is what I call the \"Resource Table\" - a chain of either 64 or 120 bytes long blocks until the end of file. I believe this is where the paths are registered</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So far, so good. However, this is where it get's tricky. The first twelve bytes of each of those blocks are readable, they are always three uint32.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Length of the block including this int (either 64 or 120)</li>\n<li>Some offset, this seems to link the blocks in a LinkedList style (actually proved that using a small program I wrote).</li>\n<li>Offset of the last 4 bytes of this block.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And this is where I'm currently stuck, since the rest seems to be encrypted/ciphered data. I dumped the data from the 64 and 120 long blocks seperately, without those twelve \"header\" bytes. Each block is seperated by line break.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://paste.ubuntu.com/25247256/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Long Blocks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://paste.ubuntu.com/25247255/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Small Blocks</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now there are obviously some repeated patterns here, so I'm thinking that it might be some XOR-ish cipher, though I haven't been able to figure out a key or even a structure.</p>\n<p><strong>What I expect to find in this data</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two uint32, offset and size</li>\n<li>A string path</li>\n<li>Unused space filled with 0x00</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, I know that these (partial) strings should be in there somewhere in some way or another (got those from the executable):</p>\n<pre><code>data\n../../../data/g\ng/img/inv_Lf._img\ng/img/inv_Rt._img\ng/img/inv_All._img\ng/img/mcUse._img\ng/img/mcTalk._img\ng/img/mcTake._img\ng/img/mcLook._img\ng/img/mcArrow._img\ng/img/fntOtherSpeakers._img\ng/img/fntBig._img\ng/img/fntWhite._img\ng/img/fntYellow._img\ng/img/fntGray._img\n</code></pre>\n<p>That is all I have been able to figure out up to now. Any help in figuring this out would be <em>much</em> appreciated!</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time!</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Posted the binary in the comments</p>\n</div>",
