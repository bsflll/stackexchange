Problem is, when i add a breakpoint on function address to see what values are being passed , the application crashes. Is there a way to monitor what parameters passed other than setting a breakpoint ?</p>\n</div>",

But i'm interested at third option. As far as i understood, as it starts, application imports the function i'm interested at from the dll(advapi32.dll). With third option, would i be able to output(for example with a message box) the parameter ?</span>",
