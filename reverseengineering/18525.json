The command that you have provided works, but exactly as i wanted. However it pointed me in the right direction. I can write it by \"wa str x1,sp,0x10\".</span>",

Execute <code>afv?</code> to see its subcommands:</p>\n<pre><code>[0x00000000]&gt; afv?\n|Usage: afv[rbs]\n| afvr[?]                     manipulate register based arguments\n| afvb[?]                     manipulate bp based arguments/locals\n| afvs[?]                     manipulate sp based arguments/locals\n| afv*                        output r2 command to add args/locals to flagspace\n| afvR [varname]              list addresses where vars are accessed (READ)\n| afvW [varname]              list addresses where vars are accessed (WRITE)\n| afva                        analyze function arguments/locals\n| afvd name                   output r2 command for displaying the value of args/locals in the debugger\n| afvn [old_name] [new_name]  rename argument/local\n| afvt [name] [new_type]      change type for given argument/local\n| afv-([name])                remove all or given var\n</code></pre>\n<p>By executing <code>afv</code> you'll see a list of all arguments, and both <code>bp</code> and <code>sp</code> based local variables. For example, by executing <code>afvs</code> you'll see a list of all stack-pointer based variables. Use <code>afvb</code> to see variables that are base-pointer based.</p>\n<p>After executing these commands, you'll see how these variable names were defined:</p>\n<pre><code>var int local_8h @ rsp+0x8\nvar int local_10h @ rsp+0x10\n</code></pre>\n<p>For example, you can see that <code>local_8h</code> is defined for <code>rsp+0x8</code>, and <code>local_10h</code> for <code>rsp+0x10</code>.<br/>\nWhile debugging, you can use <code>afvd [var_name]</code> to shed more light on the variable.</p>\n</div>",
