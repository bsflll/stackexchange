    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I just loaded up an ARM kernel image into IDA. When I boot up the ARM kernel and inspect the kernel symbols, I can see the following :-</p>\n<pre><code>/ $ cat /proc/kallsyms | head -n 10\n00000000 t __vectors_start\n80008240 T asm_do_IRQ\n80008240 T _stext\n80008240 T __exception_text_start\n80008244 T do_undefinstr\n80008408 T do_IPI\n8000840c T do_DataAbort\n800084a8 T do_PrefetchAbort\n80008544 t gic_handle_irq\n800085a0 T secondary_startup\n</code></pre>\n<p>When I load the kernel image into IDA, I am presented with functions with a memory segment that is loaded at 0x8000. As the kernel symbols are not present in the ARM kernel, this is making analysis hard.</p>\n<p>How can I map the addresses I see in the ARM image(I'm running it in Qemu, and could debug the kernel using gdb-multiarch) with the addresses I see in IDA? I'm guessing rebasing the <code>.text</code> section in IDA would be the way to go. If so, how could I go about finding the address to which I would have to rebase the segment?</p>\n</div>",

Load the file into IDA.</li>\n<li>As the file is a binary file, you need to tell IDA how to work with it. You set the architecture to ARM(as was in my case), set the RAM segment to load at 0x80008000.</li>\n<li>Write an IDApython script to read the text file from [1] and do a MakeName(address, name).</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
