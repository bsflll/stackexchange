    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>This is a homework assignment, so I'd appreciate it if I would get a hint only, not a full answer. I wrote this program which is supposed to print the following:</p>\n<pre><code>Executing function_a\nExecuting function_b\nFinished!\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>main()</code> and <code>function_a()</code> functions were given, and I'm only allowed to change <code>function_b()</code> in the marked part.</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;\n\nvoid function_b(void) {\n    char buffer[4];\n\n    // edit between here...\n    uint32_t * x = &amp;buffer;\n    while (*(x++) != 0xa0b1c2d3);           // Find the beacon\n    *(uint32_t*)(&amp;buffer + 6) = *(x + 2);   // Copy return address from caller\n    *(uint32_t*)(&amp;buffer + 5) = *(x + 1);   // Copy frame pointer from caller\n    // ... and here\n\n    fprintf(stdout, \"Executing function_b\\n\");\n}\n\nvoid function_a(void) {\n    int beacon = 0xa0b1c2d3;\n    fprintf(stdout, \"Executing function_a\\n\");\n    function_b();\n    fprintf(stdout, \"Executed function_b\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    function_a();\n    fprintf(stdout, \"Finished!\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The problem is of course to make sure that 'Executed function_b' is not outputted. We have to manipulate the stack so that when returning from <code>function_b()</code> we don't go back to its actual parent <code>function_a()</code> but to its grandfather <code>main()</code>.</p>\n<p>The part of the code I wrote finds the beacon from <code>function_a()</code> and then copies the return address and saved frame pointer of <code>function_a()</code> to the frame of <code>function_b()</code>. My program does the following:</p>\n<pre><code>Executing function_a\nExecuting function_b\nFinished!\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\n</code></pre>\n<p>So it does the right thing, except for the segfault. It fails when returning from the <code>main()</code> function. I used gdb to get this:</p>\n<pre><code>(gdb) run\nStarting program: /.../exercise2c\nExecuting function_a\n\nBreakpoint 1, function_b () at exercise2c.c:9\n9       *(uint32_t*)(&amp;buffer + 6) = *(x + 2);   // Copy return address from caller\n(gdb) backtrace\n#0  function_b () at exercise2c.c:9\n#1  0x0000000000400607 in function_a () at exercise2c.c:18\n#2  0x0000000000400630 in main () at exercise2c.c:23\n(gdb) info frame\nStack level 0, frame at 0x7fffffffdcb0:\n rip = 0x400593 in function_b (exercise2c.c:9); saved rip = 0x400607\n called by frame at 0x7fffffffdcd0\n source language c.\n Arglist at 0x7fffffffdca0, args: \n Locals at 0x7fffffffdca0, Previous frame's sp is 0x7fffffffdcb0\n Saved registers:\n  rbp at 0x7fffffffdca0, rip at 0x7fffffffdca8\n(gdb) frame 1\n#1  0x0000000000400607 in function_a () at exercise2c.c:18\n18      function_b();\n(gdb) info frame\nStack level 1, frame at 0x7fffffffdcd0:\n rip = 0x400607 in function_a (exercise2c.c:18); saved rip = 0x400630\n called by frame at 0x7fffffffdce0, caller of frame at 0x7fffffffdcb0\n source language c.\n Arglist at 0x7fffffffdcc0, args: \n Locals at 0x7fffffffdcc0, Previous frame's sp is 0x7fffffffdcd0\n Saved registers:\n  rbp at 0x7fffffffdcc0, rip at 0x7fffffffdcc8\n(gdb) step\n10      *(uint32_t*)(&amp;buffer + 5) = *(x + 1);   // Copy frame pointer from caller\n(gdb) step\n12      fprintf(stdout, \"Executing function_b\\n\");\n(gdb) frame 0\n#0  function_b () at exercise2c.c:12\n12      fprintf(stdout, \"Executing function_b\\n\");\n(gdb) info frame\nStack level 0, frame at 0x7fffffffdcb0:\n rip = 0x4005b5 in function_b (exercise2c.c:12); saved rip = 0x400630\n called by frame at 0x7fffffffdcd0\n source language c.\n Arglist at 0x7fffffffdca0, args: \n Locals at 0x7fffffffdca0, Previous frame's sp is 0x7fffffffdcb0\n Saved registers:\n  rbp at 0x7fffffffdca0, rip at 0x7fffffffdca8\n(gdb) backtrace\n#0  function_b () at exercise2c.c:12\n#1  0x0000000000400630 in main () at exercise2c.c:23\n(gdb) continue\nContinuing.\nExecuting function_b\nFinished!\n\nProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n0x0000000000400654 in main () at exercise2c.c:26\n26  }(gdb) \nContinuing.\n\nProgram terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\nThe program no longer exists.\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can clearly see that <code>function_b()</code> indeed returns to <code>main()</code>, but for some reason that I don't understand <code>main()</code> crashes. The only way I could see that happen is that I messed with the stack frame of <code>main()</code>, which I didn't, or that I should have changed something there - but I wouldn't know what.</p>\n<p>What's going on here?</p>\n<p>Note: the program is compiled with GCC and the flags <code>-g -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fno-stack-protector</code>. I'm on a 64-bit machine.</p>\n</div>",

Besides that, it also turns out that I had to copy four numbers from the stack frame. This is working code:</p>\n<pre><code>uint64_t * my_ptr = &amp;buf;\nint * x = my_ptr;\n\nwhile (*(++x)  != 0xa0b1c2d3);  // Find the beacon. We could of course simply have a look\nuint64_t * y = x + 1;           // with gdb where it's stored, but this works generically.\n\n*(my_ptr+7) = *(y+3);           // Copy frame information\n*(my_ptr+6) = *(y+2);\n*(my_ptr+5) = *(y+1);\n*(my_ptr+4) = *y;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Typically you need to fiddle a bit with what addresses you have to copy. You can get a rough idea using gdb, as you did. The exact numbers depend on the functions and their variables.</p>\n</div>",
