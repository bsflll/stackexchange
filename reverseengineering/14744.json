I see Strings, and I wish to find out where these strings are referenced in code.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KaVEa.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KaVEa.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I have tried to find cross-references to these strings in the code but there aren't any.</p>\n<p>Am I totally naive and missed out something totally obvious to the initiated? Could the strings be referenced by some obtuse run-time calculation of address (to obfuscate references) rather than just straightforward absolute/relative reference (which IDA mostly could work out?)</p>\n<p>Many thanks.</p>\n</div>",

Here is an example of how strerror() looks up strings:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NWYBN.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"String table example\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NWYBN.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Should be pretty straightforward to see that <em>errid</em> is just used to calculate the pointer for a corresponding string in the <em>errmsg</em> table by the <strong>strerror()</strong> function.  This could be why you are not seeing xrefs for those strings.  Without more information, that's my best guess.  I would try to find the beginning of that list of strings and look for an xref there.</p>\n</div>",
