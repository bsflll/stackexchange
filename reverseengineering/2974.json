The answer can be found between those pages because it shows that MOV has a single source and a single destination. I read through those pages to verify the usage when I saw bread's question. Thought it would be helpful.</span>",

The answer can be \"found\" by looking out the window, too, but by choosing that manual, you imply that the instruction exists.  It's more likely that the OP was mistaken about the output in some way, and thus has not returned to comment.</span>",
