    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am analyzing a binary that is injecting code into another process (i.e., svchost.exe) to make the debugging more tedious. I can attach the new process to a debugger (e.g., ollydbg or the one featured by IDA Pro) and read the assembly code. However, I was wondering whether it is possible or not to take like a snapshot of this so I can later on analyze the code offline (as any other binary).</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div>",

Hopefully my answer matches your idea:</p>\n<p>Did you already take a look at the <a href=\"http://low-priority.appspot.com/ollydumpex/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OllyDumpEx Plugin</a>?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This plugin is process memory dumper for OllyDbg and Immunity\n  Debugger.
