    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to determine - using IdaPython - if a function prototype is user-defined or have been automatically guessed / defined by IDA (i.e. without specific user interaction).</p>\n<p>The flag is probably available somewhere but I haven't been able to find it, despite multiple tries.</p>\n<p>According to the documentation for the <code>Functions Window</code>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A bold font is used for functions that have a definite (user-specified) prototype.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example (disassembled Windows kernel with PDB), in the Functions window the <code>PsReferenceImpersonationToken</code> function is in bold, and its decompiled code prototype (signature) is in blue:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lQtZ2m89.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"User-defined function\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lQtZ2m89.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>On the other hand, the <code>ObReferenceFileObjectForWrite</code> function is not in bold in the Functions window, and its decompiled function prototype is in yellow:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Z1FnPsmS.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Non user-defined function\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Z1FnPsmS.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>What I'd like to find - using IdaPython - is that, given a function <code>ea</code>: is the function prototype user-defined or not? (i.e. bold in functions windows and blue in the decompiler).</p>\n<p>I've tried using <code>cfunc_t</code> and <code>cfuncptr_t</code>, checking the flags between various functions, but nothing definitive came out of it. Tried also with the <a href=\"https://github.com/idapython/src/blob/master/examples/hexrays/vds4.py\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">vds4.py</a> example (with some modifications) but to no avail.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: I'm using IDA Pro 9.0 SP1 and have the x64 decompiler.</p>\n</div>",
