    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have two x86-64 UEFI applications <code>original.efi</code> and <code>patched.efi</code>. I want to find out what have been changed in <code>patched.efi</code> and what these changes do.</p>\n<p>I have tried to use the Radare2 framework to solve this task:</p>\n<p><strong>$ radiff2 original.efi patched.efi</strong></p>\n<pre><code>Buffer truncated to 283136 bytes (1024 not compared)\n0x000000d8 e129 =&gt; d52e 0x000000d8\n0x000099d0 35 =&gt; 00 0x000099d0\n0x0000eefb 3637 =&gt; 3730 0x0000eefb\n0x0000ef03 3031323538 =&gt; 3330353136 0x0000ef03\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have then opened two windows side by side and run radare2 on each file:</p>\n<p><strong>$ radare2 original.efi</strong></p>\n<pre><code>[0x0000a66c] aaa\n[0x0000a66c] s 0x000000d8\n[0x000000d8] pd 10\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>$ radare2 patched.efi</strong></p>\n<pre><code>[0x0000a66c] aaa\n[0x0000a66c] s 0x000000d8\n[0x000000d8] pd 10\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case there is a difference at the address, but it looks like there is something wrong:</p>\n<pre><code>0x000000d8    d5           invalid            |     0x000000d8    e129         loope 0x103\n0x000000d9    2e05000a0000 add eax, 0xa00     |     0x000000da    05000a0000   add eax, 0xa00\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, in many cases I have found that even though radiff2 reports a difference at a memory location, when I try to compare like described above, no differences are found and the lines are identical.</p>\n<p>Can anyone explain if I'm doing anything wrong or maybe a better way to do this?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I do not have access to a Windows system, so I can only use tools available for Linux.</p>\n</div>",
