    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>In <code>%SYSTEMROOT%</code>, there are about 2000 DLL and EXE files. I am looking into reverse engineering some of them which are dependencies of other applications.</p>\n<p>However, what I would preferably want is disassembling all of them and get the assembly files from all files in order to search through the code more \"quickly\". Even though I keep focusing on individual functions and files, I would otherwise need to decompile each DLL individually, which is a lot of repetitive work.</p>\n<p>It's hard enough to find a proper x64 disassembler tool, let a long something that has command line options. Do you have any idea how to solve this problem?</p>\n</div>",
