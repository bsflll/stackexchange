There's also a short installation/setup process. </p>\n<p>Also there are some downsides of this one - as you need to install something on the machine (someone might don't want to do it). So what it's presented as the best solution (for him) is using physical Firewire but the setup requires separate machines.</p>\n<p>I recommend to have a watch of those 4 streams if you are new into the topic.</p>\n</div>",
