This could indicate a buffer overflow. Notice the window title \"Error space on disk\".</p>\n<p>I would like to disable that memory check using the simplest method possible, but I am willing to disassemble it despite having next to zero knowledge which winapi calls are using to check the free disk space. I am grateful for any hint!</p>\n<p>I already tried the compatibility options on the shortcut properties, which didn't help.</p>\n<p>The error can also be reproduced in a vm guest with windows.</p>\n<p>PE Explorer shows this is a WIN32 GUI app with a subsystem version 3.10</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/owmTL.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"application screenshot from vm\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/owmTL.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
