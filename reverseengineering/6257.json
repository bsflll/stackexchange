    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a touchscreen Windows 8 tablet and I would like to be able to use this platform to easily browse control flow graphs in IDA Pro and display them to other people. There are a couple of problems I keep running into - but the earliest problem I ran into is that my tablet has no scroll wheel capability and no keypad with +/- on it, so I cannot zoom in and out of graphs. This is not necessarily a reverse-engineering question per se, but is it easily possible to enable zoom functionality on this platform in a way that I have not thought of yet? What would an extension to IDA that enables pinch-to-zoom require? </p>\n</div>",
