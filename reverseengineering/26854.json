When i use burp suite with my android emulator it was making a <strong>POST</strong> request to a method of an api in form of <strong>JSON Array</strong> (Encrypted)...is there any way that i can decrypt this text or find decryption key?</p>\n<p>Also i have found that after deobfuscating i found a method named as void decode() but it doesnt reveal any information..so is there is anyway to use this method explicitly?</p>\n</div>",

Then I would use <a href=\"https://frida.re\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">frida</a> on an rooted phone to hook that method and extract the used encryption key (assuming the used encryption algorithm is something standardized like AES).</span>",
