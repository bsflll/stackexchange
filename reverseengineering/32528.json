I have someone at the moment trying to get what I gotten a few years ago but with the static.</p>\n<p>This just happened all of a sudden when 'circuit bending' the game with a simple speed control knob changing the pitch of the game.</p>\n<p>I know on low batteries this game can do a lot of things like making it count up to 69. Here's the spectogram of the audio that was captured with the static.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7tPCV.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7tPCV.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
