    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've recently took it upon myself to research more about reverse engineering, I'm currently testing my intermediate skills on various CTF hosting sites. Interestingly enough I have come across a challenge on this particular site:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://0x0539.net/play/mordor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">0x0539.net</a></p>\n<p>Now the challenge I'm focused on at this moment in time is <code>Very_Malicious</code></p>\n<p>So far what I've gathered about this challenge is that it has some form of program obfuscation, in this case the obfuscation I've identified is a VM (Virtual Machine) which fetches and decodes a large set of opcodes. The opcodes are stored within the same function as the entry point of the program.</p>\n<p>Now I have identified each of the custom VM instructions and have created a very short IDA Python script to extract the bytecode. It isn't ideal but it does what it is suppose to do.</p>\n<pre><code>dism_addr = list(FuncItems(0x1b4c))\nfor addr in dism_addr:\n    if \"mov     byte ptr [rax],\" in GetDisasm(addr):\n        print(GetDisasm(addr))\n</code></pre>\n<p>After creating a disassembler for the challenge, I'm curious if there is a better way to solve this challenge rather than spending a couple of hours (2/3) reverse engineering. I've read about Symbolic Execution and my question is:</p>\n<p>How would a reverse engineer solve a challenge like this using Symbolic Execution?</p>\n<p>Please refrain from posting flags, I just want a thorough explanation on what I could do to solve this more efficiently and quickly.</p>\n<p>Any help is appreciated, thank you for taking the time to read my question!</p>\n</div>",
