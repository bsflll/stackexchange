The \"Sources\" tab will show you files that are being loaded and from where. This can help you avoid keeping junk/irrelevant files, like analytics JS files, etc.</p>\n<p>If you click on the \"Network\" tab and refresh the page, you can see the order and timing of everything loading.</p>\n<p>Reversing functionality from dynamic pages <em>can</em> be exponentially more difficult (see: impossible). Implementations like <a href=\"https://angular.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Angular</a> create a black box that stores a lot of functionality server-side, so if you wanted to save, say, the functionality of the live-update notification icon from YouTube, you won't be able to do that using just what's rendered on the client side.</p>\n<p>This is where reverse engineering really does come into play. You can learn a lot about <em>how</em> a page/site works via the browser's developer tools, but taking it to the next step, you're going to want to use tools like <a href=\"https://www.wireshark.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wireshark</a> or <a href=\"https://www.telerik.com/fiddler\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Fiddler</a> to capture packets and inspect data more thoroughly (if you can; the data may be encrypted).</p>\n<p>If a site is based on a platform like WordPress, then there are likely breadcrumbs in the code that will hint at either the theme the site is based on, plugins being utilized, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Your question is far more broad than you think (which isn't your fault because you don't know any better), but if the page you're interested in has no dynamically-updating content and its static form is truly enough for you, then saving the complete page via your browser should be sufficient. That, or use an application like <a href=\"https://www.httrack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HTTrack</a> or <a href=\"http://www.web2disk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Web2Disk</a> for something a bit more thorough that can crawl a page/site and nab more resources than a browser will render.</p>\n</div>",
