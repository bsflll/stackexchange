How did you create that file? If you make <code>hda.img</code> an <code>ext2</code> filesystem and copy an init into it and leave off the <code>-initrd</code> argument you may get a little further booting, although you wont be emulating the WR740N at all by then...</span>",

I've changed the \"init=/bin/sh\" to \"init=/sbin/init\" and then typed: user - root  | password - 5up , to get a shell (maybe will help others). I've tried to connect it to the net (with \"tap\") but when I type udhcpc -i br-lan I get the following error:  error, SIOCGIFINDEX failed!: No such device. I guess that it doesn't recognize my card, but i don't know how to solve it. At the end, what i want to do is debug the webserver (httpd) with IDA. Maybe it would be better to run Debian MIPS in qemu and then upload the router's files? thank you in advance.</span>",
