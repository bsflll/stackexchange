    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've seen multiple posts about the subject, but mine is a little bit more specific about what I want to achieve.</p>\n<p>I have many times situations where Hex-Rays decompiler outputs 16 lines of code and I know this is a call to a inline structure function.</p>\n<p>So the first step, I convert those 16 lines of code to a structure (i.e <code>Matrix</code>) which makes it a little bit more clear to understand what's happening</p>\n<p>Then I'm stuck where I want to make it show as 1 line, which will call to the underline inline structure function <code>Identity()</code>.</p>\n<p>So those 16 lines of code:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pJUem.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pJUem.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Would show as <code>s_mtx.Identity()</code> or maybe <code>Identity(s_mtx)</code></p>\n<p>Is that even possible doing it within HexRays decompiler? Maybe some script I can write to do that?</p>\n<p>This gets really tedious when you have a function with many matrix multiplications, vectors etc...</p>\n<p>Maybe @IgorSkochinsky?</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot in advance!</p>\n</div>",
