I'm learning code languages and the way I found to bring it to my world so I can learn it better was coding for/with games i play.</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>When a window close on the game a function needs to be called, when the character move or you pick an item, everything has a command, function, process or some value of an address change and etc... What i wanted to know is if there something that shows me on real time every call, every value change, address value change, etc...</p>\n<p>Nowadays i have to reach some value address by CheatEngine, changing the value till i find the correct address. With this kind of thing i would have a list off things that is happening right now, and a \"log\" of the past things, then i go to the exact time that i did something, so i would have to look on that peace of the list and discover what did my \"something\"</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on a button;</li>\n<li>Check on the real-time thing what happened at the time of the \"Click\non a button\" process;</li>\n<li>Discover what call was responsible for that and what it did;</li>\n<li>Now i can code something that do what \"Click on a button\" do, without needing to actually click on that button;</li>\n</ol>\n<hr/>\n<p>I have seen it somewhere, thats why i'm asking here, if i'm totally wrong and this doesn't exist, i'm sorry, i will delete this post.</p>\n</div>",

This obviously slows down the process considerably but if that is acceptable will provide a lot of data in a readable and useful way.</p>\n<p>I often use <a href=\"http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rohitab's API Monitor</a> as it's very flexible and manages to provide a lot of information per API.</p>\n</div>",

An early tool implementing this approach was <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenRCE/paimei\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PaiMei</a> by Pedram Amini. Unfortunately it's been abandoned and probably won't work with recent software. IDA has a <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/1634.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">trace recording/diffing feature</a> which may be used for this purpose. You can also write your own tool based on some debugging framework or a DBI engine like PIN.</p>\n</div>",
