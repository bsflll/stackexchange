    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I use x64dbg and IDA Pro the process is 32bit. I'm not sure if I'm doing this right or not because I'm getting a crash which I'm not sure if it's caused by me doing something wrong or the startup process of the application failing for some reason because it can't find the window.</p>\n<p>Basically what I'm trying to do is change the window title of some application on startup. I'm trying to achieve this by setting a break point on the <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632680(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">user32 function</a> <code>CreateWindowExA</code> and then attempting to change the <code>lpWindowName</code> parameter.</p>\n<p>Here is what execution looks like when the bp is hit:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gKGKv.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"code\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gKGKv.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Where you see the string \"Title possibly\" originally contained what was the windows title, so I assume that's the location I need to change. When changing at that address is when I get the error though.</p>\n<p>Sorry for any ignorance, I'm new to this and practicing. Thanks.</p>\n<p>Edit: I worked on this a little more and made a dummy program to help me figure out what was happening. So the <code>CreateWindowExA</code> function in this application used the same pointer for both <code>lpClassName</code> and <code>lpWindowName</code> args. So patching the program to push just a string instead of that pointer successfully achieved what I was aiming for.</p>\n</div>",

Are all those instructions leading up to the <code>call user32.76F8AA9C</code> down the bottom the functions prologue and then the actual call the function being called? That's kind of the conclusion I came to and all the <code>dword ptr ss</code> pushes above <code>call user32.76F8AA9C</code> being the functions parameters?</span>",

I would not change that parameter there, but outside in user code (familiarize yourself with the <code>stdcall</code> convention, its what WinApi uses). The parameter you are shooting for is three pushes above the <code>call CreateWindowExA</code> in user code. Either change the pointer or the content under it and don't forget to null-terminate.</p>\n</div>",
