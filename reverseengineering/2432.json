But assembly data types are rather different from those of C, so many C types can be accessed this way.</p>\n<p>The instruction you provided is basically equivalent to C code:</p>\n<pre><code>typedef dword_t ...;\ndword_t eax = *(dword_t *)((char *)esi + 0x14);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This instruction can be used to access 4 contiguous bytes no matter what the C type of those bytes is - in the line above, you could (on a 32 bit system) define <code>dword_t</code> as <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>void *</code> or another type of the appropriate size, and it would still work the same way, it's just bits and bytes travelling from one place to another. With a reasonably smart compiler, this can even be used to read entire structs or arrays in one step, as long as their length is small enough.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But this later on could be used as a pointer if that's what you'd like?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As I said, it is not possible to say what the original C type of those bytes is just from this context. You have to look at other places where this value is used and look for indicators of the specific type. If you see it used in <code>[eax]</code> or a similar expression - it's probably a pointer. If it's used in a more complex expression, like <code>[eax + ecx]</code>, one of the two is a pointer and the other is an array index/byte displacement from that pointer, but there's no telling which is which just from that line, more context is needed.</p>\n</div>",

Could i just ask one small last thing: lets say something like this is apparent: <code>mov eax, DWORD PTR [ecx + esi*4 + 0x18]</code> would that indicate that we have an array of structs? Ecx could be the base adr, esi*4 the size of one element and 0x18 the offset inside the struct to the member we want to access? Not saying that it <i>has</i> to be so, but it could?

In other words:</p>\n<pre><code>operation target, source\n</code></pre>\n<p>Other syntaxes are available under (depending on version):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Options-&gt;Debugging Options-&gt;Disasm</li>\n<li>Options-&gt;Code</li>\n</ul>\n<p>E.g. <code>IDEAL</code>, <code>HLA</code> and <code>AT&amp;T</code>.</p>\n<p>There is also quite a few other options for how the disassembled code looks like. Click around. The changes are instantaneously so easy to find the <em>right one</em>.</p>\n<p>Numbers are always hex, but without any notation like <code>0x</code> or <code>h</code> (for compactness sake I guess – and the look is cleaner (IMHO)). Elsewhere, like the instruction details below disassembly, one can see e.g. base 10 numbers – then denoted by a dot at end. E.g. 0x10 (16.)</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>(And here I stride off …)</em></p>\n<h2>When it comes to reading the code</h2>\n<p>(Talking Intel)</p>\n<p>First off tables like the ones at <a href=\"http://ref.x86asm.net\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">x86asm.net</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.sandpile.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sandpile</a> are definitively valuable assets in the work with assembly code. However one should also have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1: Basic Architecture.</li>\n<li>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2 (2A, 2B &amp; 2C): Instruction Set Reference, A-Z.</li>\n<li>… etc. (There are also some collection volumes.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer Manuals</a>.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of good sections and descriptions of how a system is stitched together and how operations affect the overall system as in registers, flags, stacks etc. Read e.g. <code>6.2 STACKS</code>, <code>3.4 BASIC PROGRAM EXECUTION REGISTERS</code>, <code>CHAPTER 4 DATA TYPES</code> from the <em>\"Developers\"</em> volume.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>As mentioned x86amd and Sandpile are good resources, but when you wonder about an instruction the manual is a good choice as well; <em>\"Instruction Set Reference A-Z\"</em>.</p>\n<p>Your whole line is probably something like:</p>\n<pre><code>00406ED6     8B46 14           MOV EAX,DWORD PTR DS:[ESI+14]\n; or\n00406ED6     8B46 14           MOV EAX,DWORD PTR [ESI+14]\n</code></pre>\n<p>(Depending on <em>options</em> and <em>Always show default segment</em>.)</p>\n<p>In this case we can split the binary as:</p>\n<pre><code>8B46 14\n | |  |\n | |  +---&gt; Displacement\n | +------&gt; ModR/M\n +--------&gt; Opcode\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note that there can be prefixes before opcode and other fields as well.

This is to lessen complexity and increase efficiency.</p>\n<p>Each of these registers also have a <em>hidden part</em> aka <em>\"shadow register\"</em> or <em>\"descriptor cache\"</em> which holds <em>base address</em>, <em>segment limit</em> and <em>access control information</em>.

ES, DS and SS are not used in 64-bit mode.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Result</h2>\n<p>Read a 32-bit value from segment address ESI+disp8. Example:</p>\n<pre><code>ESI = 0x005056A0\n\nDump of DS segment:\n           0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f\n005056A0  00 00 00 00 9C 8F 41 7E 4C 1F 42 00 C0 1E 42 00  ....œA~LB.ÀB.\n005056B0  E0 1F 42 00 70 20 42 00 48 21 42 00 4A A8 42 7E  àB.p B.H!B.J¨B~\n\nESI + 0x14 = 0x005056B4 =&gt; 70 20 42 00 …\n\nEAX = (DWORD)70 20 42 00 = 00 42 20 70 (4333680.)\n</code></pre>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Simulate in C</h2>\n<p>One problem with your example is that <code>esi</code> is an integer (strictly speaking). The value, however, can be that one of a segment address. Then you have to take into consideration that each segment has a <em>base address</em>, (offset), – as in:</p>\n<pre><code>seg = malloc(4096);\nseg[0] \n    |\n    +---&gt; at base address, e.g. 0x505000\n\n       +----------------+\n       |                |\n       |                |\n        …\n505000 |                | seg[00 - 0f]\n505010 |                | seg[10 - 1f]\n505020 |                | seg[20 - 2f]\n        …\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, as it is ESI, that segment would be the one pointed to by DS.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>To simulate this in C you would need variables for the general-purpose registers, but you would also need to create segments (from where to read/write data.) Roughly such a code <strong>could</strong> be something like:</p>\n<pre><code>void dword_m2r(uint32_t *x, struct segment *seg, uint32_t offset)\n{\n    *x = *((uint32_t*)(seg-&gt;data + (offset - seg-&gt;base)));\n}\n\ndword_m2r(&amp;eax, &amp;ds, esi + 0x14);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where <code>struct segment</code> and <code>ds</code> are:</p>\n<pre><code>struct segment {\n    u8 *data;\n    u32 base;\n    u32 size;\n    u32 eip;\n};\n\nstruct segment ds;\nds.base = 0x00505000;\nds.size = 0x3000;\nds.data = malloc(ds.size);\nds.eip  = 0x00;\n</code></pre>\n<p>To further develop on this concept you could create another <code>struct</code> with registers, use defines or variables for registers, add default segments etc.</p>\n<p>For Intel-based architecture that could be something in the direction of this (as a not to nice beginning):</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;\n\n#define u64  uint64_t\n#define u32  uint32_t\n#define u16  uint16_t\n#define u8   uint8_t\n\nunion gen_reg {\n    u64 r64;\n    u32 r32;\n    u16 r16;\n    u8   l8;\n};\n\nstruct CPU {\n    union gen_reg accumulator;\n    u8 *ah;\n    union gen_reg counter;\n    u8 *ch;\n    …\n    struct segment s_stack;\n    struct segment s_code;\n    struct segment s_data;\n    …\n\n    u32 eflags;\n    u32 eip;\n    …\n};\n\n\n#define RAX   CPU.accumulator.rax\n#define EAX   CPU.accumulator.eax\n#define AX    CPU.accumulator.ax\n#define AH    *((u8*)&amp;AX + 1)\n#define AL    CPU.accumulator.al\n…\n\n\n/* and then some variant of */\nESI = 0x00505123;\ndword_m2r(&amp;EAX, &amp;DS, ESI + 0x14);\n</code></pre>\n<p>For a more compact way, ditching ptr to <code>H</code> register etc. have a look at e.g.\nthe code base of <a href=\"http://www.virtualbox.org/svn/vbox/trunk/src/VBox/Additions/x11/x11include/xorg-server-1.14.0/regs.h\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">virtualbox</a>. <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> require some form of pack directive for most compilers to prevent filling of bits in structs – so that e.g. AH and AL really align up with correct bytes of AX.</p>\n</div>",
