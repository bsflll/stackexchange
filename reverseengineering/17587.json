    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am breaking my head the last few days over how you should extract the firmware from a USB device I searched all over the internet but I could not find a straight forward way to do it.\nJust to clarify I am trying to do this over the USB connection it self but if this isn't possible then that is just fine.\nI found some things about flashrom online but I don't really understand how it works and I don't know if it is capable of flashing / reading USB firmware ( I mean USB sticks and other peripherals)</p>\n<p>Any help would be very much appreciated</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n</div>",

Then usb drive is being shown as some new usb device, to which a flasher program can connect and upload/download the firmware. In most cases switching to this programming mode requires to connect specific pins on the usb drive board. Or it automatically switches to the programming mode when usb drive firmware gets corrupted.</p>\n</div>",
