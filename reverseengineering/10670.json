    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm working on a Linux x86_64 ELF binary using IDA 6.6.</p>\n<p>When I run the Hex-Rays Decompiler on a function (by pressing F5) it always shows me the pseudocode for the <code>_init_proc</code> function, no matter what I run it on. It's stuck on that function and won't show me anything else in the pseudocode view. No errors are displayed or printed to the log.</p>\n<p>If I produce the C file (Ctrl+F5) the full pseudocode is generated, so it's just an interface issue.</p>\n<p>This is driving me mad. Things I've tried:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Restarting IDA</li>\n<li>Recreating the database</li>\n<li>Deleting all decompiler information for <code>_init_proc</code></li>\n<li>Deleting all decompiler information for the function I'm trying to decompile</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Has anyone encountered this behaviour before? Any suggestions?</p>\n</div>",
