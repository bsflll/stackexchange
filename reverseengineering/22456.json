    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>For my own amusement, I dumped the files of an old Nintendo DS video game I have (the company has long since gone bankrupt/closed) and am trying to extract the assets. I have recovered game text, videos, and sound, but one 58-MB file by the name of <code>graph.dat</code>, which contains the game's graphics (probably) is giving me a hard time. </p>\n<p>Importantly, the game's text was stored in a custom format which the developers appear to have created for the game, so I strongly suspect <code>graph.dat</code> to contain a custom graphics format as well.</p>\n<p>I was able to break the graphics file into segments by reading metadata records left in a separate file, <code>graph.dti</code>. The metadata file contained 1910 records, separated by 44 chunks of intermediate data. Each record listed off a set of contiguous addresses in <code>graph.dat</code>, which yielded three binary data blobs once chunked out of that file.</p>\n<p>The first blob in each record, which I've nicknamed 'Huey', might be some sort of header. It's always either 32 bytes or 512 bytes long.</p>\n<p>The second blob, 'Dewey', is of variable length, ranging from 704 bytes to 49 KB in size. I suspect it contains the actual image data.</p>\n<p>The third blob, 'Louie', is always 1536 bytes in size. </p>\n<p>I suspect 'Huey' may be color palette data, and 'Louie' is some sort of color index, but I can't be sure. </p>\n<p><strong>Does anyone have any ideas?</strong> Tossing 'Dewey' into GIMP's raw data import was spectacularly unsuccessful.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lioncheese.com/WhatTheDuck.zip\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Link to a sample of four different images (I'm assuming) from the file.</a> Filenames were provided by my unpacker tool and were not present in the original metadata. I have 1,906 more of these where this came from, so just ask if you need them.</p>\n</div>",

The pixel data (stored in <code>dewey</code>) indexes into a palette of RGB555 values stored as u16le (stored in <code>huey</code>). You didn't provide any, but I guess the 32 byte <code>huey</code> files are just palettes of 16 colors - the corresponding pixel data may consist of tightly packed 4-bit indexes.</p>\n</div>",
