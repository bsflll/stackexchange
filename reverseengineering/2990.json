When analyzing a program, I find it helpfull.</p>\n<p>Functions that are referenced very often typically are common functionality. An example would be stuff like <code>strcmp()</code>, <code>malloc()/free()</code>, <code>strlen()</code>, etc..</p>\n<p>Some of those are quite easy to identfiy (like  a <code>strcmp()</code> implementation), and giving a name to those functions early on, makes the analysis of the rest more easy.</p>\n</div>",
