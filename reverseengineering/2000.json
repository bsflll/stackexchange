The tools I find (e. g. ResourceTuner) work for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable\" rel=\"noreferrer\">PEs</a> only.</p>\n<p>Any idea for tools to facilitate the resource extraction? Could be several steps too, e.g.  one program extracting the raw resources, one displaying them in a proper form.</p>\n</div>",
