If you want to find a function that edits your player health (and possibly find a static address of for example player class) you can just simply right click the address of health you found, then click <code>Find out what writes to this address</code>. All addresses (in the middle of some function) that written to your health will be listed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Xymoh.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Cheat Engine\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Xymoh.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>You can then copy the address that belongs to some function and inspect the function in for example Ghidra.</p>\n</div>",
