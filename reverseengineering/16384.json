I encountered this line near the end of the file and am puzzled to its meaning:</p>\n<pre><code>nop    WORD PTR cs:[rax+rax*1+0x0]\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case <code>rax</code> contains <code>0x2329</code>.  However, <code>nop</code> means '<em>do nothing</em>', so I am puzzled as to why there are arguments included on the line.  The code is loaded with <code>libc</code> function calls so I am assuming the source code is C/C++ and not GAS.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/11971/nop-with-argument-in-x86-64\">This post</a> has good content but perror's explanation is more apropos and contains more \"why\" than a mere recital of the Intel docs.</p>\n</div>",

It is similar however I believe the response \"The one-byte NOP instruction is an alias mnemonic for the XCHG (E)AX, (E)AX instruction\" is not valid on IA-32 and 64 processors.  At least according to the Intel documents.</span>",

And, in this case one may want to pad with \"<em>more than one byte at the time</em>\", this is why they added extra arguments (that are just ignored most of the time).</p>\n<p>See: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">NOP instruction</a> (Wikipedia) and <a href=\"http://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/NOP.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">NOPâ€”No Operation</a> (x86 Instruction Set Reference).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>They can also be used to delay a bit the ALU in between two memory fetches in order to give the pipeline a chance to get a correct prediction of the data values. And, this is probably your case because this instruction perform a small arithmetic computation when computing <code>rax+rax*1+0x0</code>, therefore the ALU has is really delayed because of this operation.</p>\n<p>See: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_slot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Delay Slot</a> (Wikipedia).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
