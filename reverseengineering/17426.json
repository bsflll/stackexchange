It usually involves exploiting a known vulnerability within a program which will handle the file in some way. Here are some examples:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Windows will try to extract information from the file to display the icon and preview when looking at the folder inside explorer (such as PDF or image thumbnail). One example was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Metafile_vulnerability\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Windows Metafile Vulnerability</a> which could be exploited only by previewing the file in explorer.</p></li>\n<li><p>Another attack vectors is the builtin Windows Search. To extract the information necessary for a full text search Windows will scan the files in the background and use the file parser to extract the content. A bug in the file parser can thus lead to code execution.  </p></li>\n<li>The file targets a vulnerability in your antivirus which triggers when the file is scanned  </li>\n<li>The file targets a vulnerability in your file system such as NTFS where the filename or another property could trigger the bug  </li>\n<li>A library file (ex. dll) could get executed when saved to the same directory where an application vulnerable to <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Binary_planting\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">binary planting</a> is executed from</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
