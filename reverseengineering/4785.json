You can then run the program as modified and debug, or produce a new executable (ELF, Macho-O, PE/COFF).</p>\n<p><strong>IDA Pro (Linux, Windows, OS X)</strong></p>\n<p>Enable the patching menu by editing the <code>idagui.cfg</code> (with an editor with elevated privileges):</p>\n<pre><code>DISPLAY_PATCH_SUBMENU    = YES          // Display the Edit,Patch submenu\n</code></pre>\n<p>Use the patching menu under Edit to insert raw operation codes. Note by default IDA only auto-assembles for the IBM PC; see the Intel or ARM manuals for opcodes. IDA can then produce a new executable but often it may not work, and instead you need to resort to producing a <code>.dif</code>.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Patchers</strong></p>\n<p>If you would like to create a patcher, I recommend <em>dup2 patcher</em>. Once you have your new executable, compare the old and new for differences in the raw hex, and then specify the changes that need to be made into the patcher creator. (Either it replaces something at a specific offset, or searches for a set of bytes and replaces those.)</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Alternate Methods</strong></p>\n<p>Remember that manually editing the assembly instructions of a program is not the only way to alter control flow. Instead, you could use a DLL hook; see for example the InfoSec article <a href=\"http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/api-hooking-and-dll-injection-on-windows/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>",

It seems it's easier to install and get the GUI working now, so I'll give it a go. In principle, of course it should be able to do it, it's just a matter of how much may not be automated for you.</span>",
