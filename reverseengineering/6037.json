Anytime I feel like checking the disassembly and memory state I just hit <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Pause</kbd>.</p>\n<p>But, what if I want to see the very first instructions of the program ? How do I start the application so that it immediately enters debug mode before even starting execution ?</p>\n</div>",
