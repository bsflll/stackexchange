After attempting to decompile I get the error: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Decompilation failure:\n  11E1640: too big function</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've increased my max function size for decompilation to 512K (defaults at 64), the main function is approx. 400K. But this is too much processing and IDA froze for at least 5 minutes before I gave up.</p>\n<p>Is there an alternative approach to decompiling a large (400K) function using Hex-Rays decompiler? Maybe partial decompilation, or non-default decompiler configuration.</p>\n<p><em>IDA: Version 7.2.181105</em></p>\n<p><em>Hex-Rays Decompiler: v7.0.0.170914</em></p>\n</div>",

It'd be good if you would state both the IDA and Hex-Rays versions, so there is a chance we can better help. Alternatively you could send an email to the Hex-Rays support. In the past they were generally very helpful whenever I ran into an issue.</span>",

I've heard it can decompile larger functions without much error.</p>\n<p>According to them it supports decompiling a whole binary file. So it possibly could decompile this function without much hesitation. Although I can't promise anything.</p>\n<p>Good luck! :-)</p>\n</div>",
