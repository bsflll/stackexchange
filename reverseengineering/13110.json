    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I wrote a simple program on my STM32F4 Disco MCU which only turns a LED on, and I am trying to RE my compiled binary. After decompiling the binary, I started my analysis at the first instruction set and treated it like a main function because it calls the other subroutines in the program. These subroutines are comparing, adding, subtracting, ... memory from addresses in the Flash, SRAM, or RAM. Example:</p>\n<pre><code>LDR             R1, =0x80003EC  // r1 = 0x80003EC\nLDR             R2, [R1]        // r2 = 0x80003EC\nLDR             R3, [R1,#4]     // r3 = 0x80003F0\nADD.W           R4, R1, #0xC    // r4 = *(0x8000404) + 12\nLDR             R0, [R1,#8]     // r0 = 0x80003F4\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the example above, the content of R1 (memory address 0x80003EC) is getting 12 added to it and stored in R4 but I have no idea what value resides in that memory address (0x80003EC)! The program continues to use the mysterious value stored at 0x80003EC. Example:</p>\n<pre><code>LSR             R0, R1     // r0 &lt;&lt; r1\n</code></pre>\n<p>The cycle of referencing unknown numbers keeps continuing. Without knowing the original value, there is no way to figure out the logic flow. All I see is mathematical operations to unknown numbers and flow control that is determined from the operations. </p>\n<p>How can a program like this be reverse engineered? \nIs there a way to view the original values of memory?</p>\n</div>",

I will do some further investigation. Thanks for the help!</span>",
