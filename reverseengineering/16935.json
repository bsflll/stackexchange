This was kind of a requirement to avoid having the majority of system binaries duplicated on 64bit machines to execute 32bit code (which is still pretty common to be solely distributed).</p>\n<p>This isn't quite the case for debuggers and some process manipulation tools that in some cases are required to bundle 64bit helper processes or ship both 32 and 64 bit binaries. Switching between 32 and 64 bit execution modes is indeed only a far jump away, but supporting that by a debugger is a lot more complicated. Transition/translation functions must be provided for the debugger's internal states (not the the debugged process's state, some APIs simply cannot cross process bitness boundaries, etc.</p>\n<p>This is not to say it's impossible, merely to explain why this may not be available yet.</p>\n</div>",
