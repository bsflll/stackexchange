So if I change the exe file name I need to change the source code.</li>\n<li>Example 1: \"\\x55\\x8B\\xEC\\x8B\\x45\\x08\\x03\\x45\\x0C\" this is the address point format and it is not easy to decode like example 2: \"0x40133C\" (more easy)</li>\n<li>Example 2: don't work because \"detourFunction\" is deprecated. Now there is \"detourAttach\" but I don't known how migrate to it in this case.</li>\n<li>Example 2: is more easy but old. I don't known if will work in the future (32 or 64 bit)...</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Can you help me please to take a decision or suggest me a better/easier solution ?</p>\n</div>",

Look at the bytes at 401670 in your executable, the opcodes are translated into assembler instructions by your disassembler, eg /x55/x8B/xEC is translated to \"push ebp, mov ebp, esp\", so this is standard function prolog.</span>",
