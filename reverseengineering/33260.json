I find sharedassets0.resource file, but not sure what is really is.<br/>\nIs it possible to extract this way? Am I missing something?</p>\n<p>The APK file is here. <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QRYDN4KEOQq-PtilyooWAEIw6620PuvK/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">APK</a><br/>\nThe extracted output from apktool is here. <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QRYDN4KEOQq-PtilyooWAEIw6620PuvK/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Output</a></p>\n</div>",
