One such application built-in to Windows is the Task Manager.  Right-click on the task bar and you will see it in that menu.</p>\n<p>If you prefer command-line, you can use tasklist (again, built-in to Windows).</p>\n<p>If you are trying to perform malware analysis, and you are looking for an automated solution, then I suggest using a sandbox.  A popular free and opensource one is <a href=\"https://cuckoosandbox.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Cuckoo Sandbox</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are analyzing the malware by hand, then you will have to look for the different ways that you mention.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CreateProcess</a> takes a pointer to a PROCESS_INFORMATION structure as its tenth argument.  After CreateProcess returns, you can look at this structure to find the PID of the child.  A simpler way would be to breakpoint on CreateProcess, modify the dwCreationFlags to include <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/procthread/process-creation-flags\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SUSPENDED</a>, step-over the CreateProcess call, then run either Task Manager or tasklist to see the child process's PID.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocess\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OpenProcess</a> is easier.  It takes the PID as the third argument.  So when you see a call to OpenProcess, just look at the arguments to find the PID.</p>\n<p>Depending on which tools you are using, you may be able to script this, such as with IDA Python, OllyScript, or x64dbg's or WinDbg's built-in scripting.</p>\n</div>",
