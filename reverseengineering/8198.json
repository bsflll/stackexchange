    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>As we know, time is the bane of reverse engineering. I am wanting to know how are some ways that I can save time in reverse engineering? I have taken some thought and I have been going through many programs and finding that even if the program is considerably different I am able to find up to 255+ identical garbage/redundant functions. I was thinking this morning if there was a way to somehow fingerprint these, that it would save me a considerable amount of time.</p>\n<p>In short, I would like to know:<br/>\nHas anyone tried to fingerprint or make a database of these redundant functions?</p>\n<p>Also, what are some other ways that I can save time in my reversal process?</p>\n</div>",

The static code varies in register assignment, relative pointer addressing to external object code and other details but is mostly identical across binaries.</p>\n<p>IDA uses the FLIRT system to solve this problem.\n<a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/tech/flirt/in_depth.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/tech/flirt/in_depth.shtml</a></p>\n<p>Basically it filters those bits that vary across linker executions and matches the remaining pattern against a list.  For very short functions there are many collisions, but for functions longer than ~30 bytes or so it's very good at identifying what you're looking at.</p>\n<p>If you're using IDA then it comes with the tools to create your own FLIRT signatures.  If you're not using IDA then you would have to make a tool to pull apart your particular static libraries, disassemble the first opcodes, filter the variable bits (this is tricky), and create a database to link names to patterns.  You could apply the patterns as appropriate: borland libraries for borland program, MS runtime for visual studio, etc.</p>\n</div>",
