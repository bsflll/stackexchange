            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">I doubt there's an easy solution. If it's using system API calls to validate the certificate you might be able to intercept that and return true. If not, you're going to have to dig into the application enough to either find and replace its pinned cert or knock out the code that does cert validation, and work around any anti-tamper code that may be in place. Either that or discover the pinned cert's private key, but that's infeasible.</span>",
