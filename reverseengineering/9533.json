I compiled the C# code and ran it in the VirtualKD-2.8 directory. the first problem is gone but the virtual box said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unable to load R3 \"C:\\VirtualKD-2.8\\VBoxKD64.dll\": Not signed ... (VERR_LDRVI_NOT_SIGNED)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again I start googleing... the problem is for <code>VBox &gt; 3.1</code>, it force signed dll loading in windows. so I signed the DLL by a self generated sign ( and of curse I added it to my trust list ). now the virtualbox braks with</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unable to load R3 module \"C:\\VirtualKD-2.8\\VBoxKD64.dll\" None of 1 path(s) hav a trust anchor.: ... (VERR_CR_X509_CPV_NO_TRUSTED_PATHS).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>so I used a globally trusted sign to do the job but I got a FATAL error from vbox...</p>\n</div>",

Virtual Box will not load DLLs that are not owned by <em>NT SERVICE\\TrustedInstaller</em> so we have to add Virtual-KD directory to it's kingdom. ( read <a href=\"https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff404240.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> if you have no ida about what I say )</p>\n<p>Also it is a good description in the avast package named <em>Install.txt</em>.</p>\n</div>",
