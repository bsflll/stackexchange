In one of the functions, the compiler has reused the stack space of one of the passed in arguments as a local variable of a different type, but the same size.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to rename a stack variable part of the way through a function? At the moment, I'm using a manual operand, but its not optimal.</p>\n</div>",
