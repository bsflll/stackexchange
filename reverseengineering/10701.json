    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So, as you may know, many android bootloaders are based on the Little Kernel project on codeaurora, and as such one could say you have partial source to most android bootloaders, typically in the firmware packages you can find on the vendor sites, minus the proprietary bits most vendors add instead of the standard open source fastboot protocol.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, what would be the best method to approach this disassembly?</p>\n<p>I am currently working against the output of <code>objdump -D</code> on the binary and comparing that to the same output on the compiled object files from the little kernel build. There are a number of 1:1 matches, but there are some portions that, while apparently analogous, are not quite correct. One would assume this to be due to changes made by the company, but I can't be sure on this matter.</p>\n</div>",

The reasons are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Bootloaders are quite small and simple code requiring only small amount of external calls (even system calls are few). </p></li>\n<li><p>This is ARM assembly code, which means that this is aligned-instructions. There is no way to confuse the disassembler by shifting one byte ahead the code.</p></li>\n<li><p>There is no real obfuscation in these programs, except for small compiler tricks or a few optimization.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, even if there will probably be some extra work afterward, most of the code should be recovered nicely with a simple linear sweep.</p>\n</div>",
