            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">Are you intending 115 in to be in hex, or decimal? By default the MASM number base is 16, which you can change with <code>n</code>. I know you suggest \"115\" to be in hex, but in your last expr, you dereference an unaligned pointer at 0x12 past <code>%ebp</code>.  Btw, you can specify decimal numbers with the \"0n\" prefix (as opposed to \"0x\" for hex). It's a good habit to use a prefix whenever you specify _all_ of your numbers. This way you can prevent a symbol lookup in case you mistype a hex number that's full of alpha-digits. Same deal with registers, by prefixing them with \"@\".</span>",

            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">With regards to combining numerical expressions, the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> isn't a numeric expression, but you probably realize that \"==\" returns a 0 or 1 (you can test your expressions with <code>? expr</code>). So, if you just use a binary <code>&amp;</code> between both comparisons, you can get the entire expr to return 1, which'd result in <code>j</code> executing the first command.  Wrt your list, at least one of those should work. It might help to clarify whether you're trying to deref a pointer at <code>@ebp+0xc</code> and check its value for 0x115, or check that <code>@ebp+0xc == 0x115</code>. You can also use <code>.if (...) {}</code> if quoting is messing you up.</span>",
