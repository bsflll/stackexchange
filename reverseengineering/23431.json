    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm new to Ghidra so go easy on me. Running it on Windows.</p>\n<p>After successfully extracting a Bluetooth door lock's firmware from a nRF51, I proceeded to decompile it using Ghidra. My aim is to able to read some of its original source code, even though I understand it won't be as clean as the original.</p>\n<p>But, after analyzing the bin file, I get tons of error. Architecture used/tried to solve this issue was both the ARM Cortex LE 32 bit and the ARM v6 LE 32 bit. Looked for solutions on the internet and I did not find anyone with the same issue. All of the errors are <code>Bad Instruction</code>.</p>\n<p>Here's pictures of two different analyze:</p>\n<p>Without ARM Aggressive Instruction Finder (Prototype)\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5Ipa2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5Ipa2.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>With ARM Aggressive Instruction Finder (Prototype)\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n6tM7.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n6tM7.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>The reason I posted two pictures of my code browser because those two different analysis gave me different amount of bookmark. I know it's because of the Instruction Finder but who knows this might help you to help me.</p>\n<p>I have also tried adding a line into my <code>ia.sinc</code> file as suggested by a user named <em>nsadeveloper789</em> on a <a href=\"https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues/22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">GitHub issue</a> but it did not solve my issue. I have also tried the <code>No Return</code> method from a <a href=\"https://initrd.net/stuff/ghidra/GhidraDocs/GhidraClass/Advanced/improvingDisassemblyAndDecompilation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PDF lesson</a> (page 11) and no luck as well.</p>\n<p>Did used SVD-Loader as well but still doesn't solve the issue as the SVD-Loader's script itself might have an issue and I've commented on this issue on GitHub (currently no specific solution). You can have a look at this issue <a href=\"https://github.com/leveldown-security/SVD-Loader-Ghidra/issues/1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>Does anyone knows how to solve this issue? I've been trying for a week or two now and even asked this in the unofficial Ghidra's Discord group but no answer yet.</p>\n<p>Looking forward for your answers. Thanks in advance.</p>\n<p>Here's a link to download the bin file:\n<a href=\"https://filebin.net/5abhimciwdfr5gfi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://filebin.net/5abhimciwdfr5gfi</a></p>\n</div>",
