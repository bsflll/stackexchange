If it was pure squashfs, without any additional header, just generate the new firmware file out of your set of files via mksquashfs <a href=\"https://elinux.org/Squash_FS_Howto#Creating_and_using_squashed_file_systems\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://elinux.org/Squash_FS_Howto#Creating_and_using_squashed_file_systems</a>\nOtherwise, you'll need to append header/footer to the squashfs file to make it look like the original firmware.</p>\n</div>",
