    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>How does Qualcomm's QPST work? Or what protocol/commands does QPST use? As I wanted to develop an app like it, I searched for AT commands. But I can't find out any AT commands that allows me access(read/write) my old phone's internal file system(firmware). Any helps like the name of the commands/protocols that QPST uses are appreciated.</p>\n<p>Or if my question is off-topic, where should I ask? </p>\n</div>",
