And, unfortunately, there's almost no solid references apart from two or three which broadly cover the subject. Many tools (linkers, loaders, assemblers, debuggers, ...) remain a mystery for most of you. When it comes to linkers and loaders, the main reference is <em>Linkers and Loaders</em> by John R. Levine (<a href=\"http://linker.iecc.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://linker.iecc.com/</a>). Another reliable source of information is the official <code>ELF</code> binary format documentation. But these are merely introductions to how a certain, or most, technologies work.</p>\n<p>Now, here's an answer to your question (why are the <code>GOT</code> and <code>PLT</code> sections still included in static <code>ELF</code> binaries?): <strong>PERFORMANCE</strong>.</p>\n<p>More explanations ... Suppose you have this C code:</p>\n<pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n    #include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\n    int main(int argc, char **argv)\n    {\n        char str[1024];\n\n        strcpy(str, argv[1]);\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", str);\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>No need to be a genius to figure out that all it does is copy a command line parameter into a string and print it out. Here's the <code>main</code> function in assembly:</p>\n<pre><code>     000000000040105e &lt;main&gt;:\n     40105e:   55                      push   rbp\n     40105f:   48 89 e5                mov    rbp,rsp\n     401062:   48 81 ec 10 04 00 00    sub    rsp,0x410\n     401069:   89 bd fc fb ff ff       mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x404],edi\n     40106f:   48 89 b5 f0 fb ff ff    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x410],rsi\n     401076:   48 8b 85 f0 fb ff ff    mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x410]\n     40107d    48 83 c0 08             add    rax,0x8\n     401081:   48 8b 10                mov    rdx,QWORD PTR [rax]\n     401084:   48 8d 85 00 fc ff ff    lea    rax,[rbp-0x400]\n     40108b:   48 89 d6                mov    rsi,rdx\n     40108e:   48 89 c7                mov    rdi,rax\n     401091:   e8 3a f2 ff ff          call   4002d0 &lt;__rela_iplt_end+0x38&gt;\n     401096:   48 8d 85 00 fc ff ff    lea    rax,[rbp-0x400]\n     40109d:   48 89 c7                mov    rdi,rax\n     4010a0:   e8 fb 09 00 00          call   401aa0 &lt;_IO_puts&gt;\n     4010a5:   b8 00 00 00 00          mov    eax,0x0\n     4010aa:   c9                      leave\n     4010ab:   c3                      ret\n     4010ac:   0f 1f 40 00             nop    DWORD PTR [rax+0x0]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that at the address <code>401091</code> you have a call to a function stored in the <code>PLT</code> (the label is more expressive).

Second, if you look closely at the code you'll notice that this function identifies the CPU - by dissecting the return values of the <code>cpuid</code> instruction (<code>4187d6</code> and <code>4187f7</code>) - (more accurately the micro architecture and other features such as cache size, ...) you're running your <code>ELF</code> binary on, and then decides which implementation suites that configuration best. This way, the <code>strcpy</code> function called in the above C code will always be the fastest possible, whatever architecture you're on (Intel: Nehalem, Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell, ...; AMD: Phenom, Opteron, ...; ...). Keep in mind that those fast implementations have been hand optimized and fine tuned for each of the possible target architectures. </p>\n<p>So that's what the <code>PLT</code> and <code>GOT</code> sections are used for in your static <code>ELF</code> binary file.</p>\n<p>Now, if you want to investigate this yourself, you should compile the <code>C</code> code above with GCC version 4.9 (which is the one I used) using the <code>-static</code> and <code>-g3</code> (debug symbols) flags. Then, disassemble the binary file using <code>objdump</code> and the <code>-D</code> switch in order to have all the <code>ELF</code> sections. You can then go through all the sections and explore the assembly code. You can also run the binary file using <code>gdb</code> and set breakpoints at key locations and run the program step by step.</p>\n</div>",

Currently, many glibc low level functions such as\n<strong>memcpy</strong>, <strong>strcmp</strong> and <strong>strlen</strong> use this feature.
