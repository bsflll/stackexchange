    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>folks, I'm marine engineer and recently got in touch with simulator software with my professor at the Simulator Department of my university. Today I thought we could dump the original installation and copy to the class computer so we can teach it without the needs of going to the department which is a bit far from here.</p>\n<p>Said that, we have made a copy to my computer and we are currently trying to skip license checks using x32dbg.</p>\n<p>My first attempt was disable the network license check and so far it has worked, this is the piece of Assembly code from x32dbg:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/i4WlU.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\".\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/i4WlU.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>By changing the jump condition to jump if equal I managed to bypass it and now it goes directly to the Hardware License Check.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vBpkd.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\".\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vBpkd.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>Then the next idea I had was to set the code: 83F8 <strong>01 75</strong> 23 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 83F8 <strong>00 74</strong> 23 to skip the illegal license error but it unfortunately didn't work, I tried on the old version and this seems to be enough so I don't know where to look after.</p>\n</div>",

If your goal is simply to use software for free, you could probably find cracked software on the Internet without much effort.</span>",
