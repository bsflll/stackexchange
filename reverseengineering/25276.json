This can be done by going to Edit -&gt; Tools Options. This would bring you to a page as seen in the screenshot below</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ihwZg.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ihwZg.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Under the Analysis options in the Decompiler folder, there is a checkbox called \"Eliminate unreachable code\", uncheck that and apply the option. I hope this helps!</p>\n</div>",
