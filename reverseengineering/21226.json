    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm working with an .exe which imports the old DirectX DLL DDRAW.DLL. The problem is, Ghidra doesn't know about it and shows all imported DDRAW functions as having no parameters. I know, I can edit functions to add the paramaters and define the missing datatypes, but I expect there's an automatic way to do it. Is there an option to simply load ddraw.h from the DirectX SDK and import all the function signatures and types?</p>\n</div>",
