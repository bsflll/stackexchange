Looking at the PE structure we can see the entry point is in the .text section and the file has a few imports:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/eT3iZ.png\"/></p>\n<p>Disassembling this entry point shows some code that looks normal. The main function gets the command line arguments and passes them to another function  before terminating:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/c8BA6.png\"/></p>\n<p>Looking at this other function we can see a strcpy to a stack destination buffer with an attacker supplied source buffer.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NjQYe.png\"/></p>\n<p>The challenge from the training perspective is to exploit this stack based buffer overflow in order to gain arbitrary code execution (which is beyond the scope of this answer).</p>\n</div>",
