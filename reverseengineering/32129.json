A quick comparison:</p>\n<div class=\"s-table-container\">\n<table class=\"s-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Order 1</th>\n<th>Order 2</th>\n<th>Difference</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>90,823,491</td>\n<td>90,784,756</td>\n<td>38,735</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2022-12-28 20:59:51</td>\n<td>2022-12-27 19:10:05</td>\n<td>92,986 (seconds)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Dividing the difference of seconds by the difference of the 6 character number:</p>\n<pre><code>92,986 ÷ 38,735 = 2.4 (approx.)\n</code></pre>\n<p>It would therefore seem that the number increases by 1 every 2.4 seconds. The result of 60 ÷ 25 also happens to be 2.4 which means 1/25th of a minute can be represented by a character from the base 25 system.</p>\n<p>Following the assumption of the number increasing by 1 every 2.4 seconds it seems that the first datetime (or \"epoch\") is approximately <code>2016-02-01 00:00:00</code>.</p>\n<p>Therefore to decipher the final value of <code>H4ZQ3K</code> in the first receipt:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>90,823,491 × 2.4 = 217,976,378.4 seconds</li>\n<li>2016-02-01 00:00:00 + 217,976,378.4 seconds = 2022-12-28 20:59:38.4</li>\n</ol>\n<p>...but note how the predicted timestamp is incorrect - off by 12.6 seconds (the other receipt comes out at 2022-12-27 19:10:14.4 - 9.4 seconds ahead).</p>\n<p>I'm stumped as to what's causing the error - does anyone have any ideas?</p>\n<p>Some more codes for reference (note how the predicted timestamp is never more or less than 60 seconds):</p>\n<div class=\"s-table-container\">\n<table class=\"s-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Code</th>\n<th>Last 6 chars (decimal)</th>\n<th>Purchased</th>\n<th>Predicted</th>\n<th>Ahead by (seconds)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>7MXW-NLH4-ZQ3K</code></td>\n<td>90,823,491</td>\n<td>2022-12-28 20:59:51</td>\n<td>2022-12-28 20:59:38.4</td>\n<td>-12.6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>M3NW-YRH4-F6XN</code></td>\n<td>90,784,756</td>\n<td>2022-12-27 19:10:05</td>\n<td>2022-12-27 19:10:14.4</td>\n<td>+9.4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>MNKW-M6H4-7FQX</code></td>\n<td>90,662,940</td>\n<td>2022-12-24 09:57:46</td>\n<td>2022-12-24 09:57:36</td>\n<td>-10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CRGW-ZYHN-KHBP</code></td>\n<td>90,490,545</td>\n<td>2022-12-19 15:01:03</td>\n<td>2022-12-19 15:01:48</td>\n<td>+45</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CQMW-L9HN-KNC7</code></td>\n<td>90,488,127</td>\n<td>2022-12-19 13:25:56</td>\n<td>2022-12-19 13:25:04.8</td>\n<td>-51.2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>M9JW-QCH6-PT3Z</code></td>\n<td>90,170,362</td>\n<td>2022-12-10 17:34:42</td>\n<td>2022-12-10 17:34:28.8</td>\n<td>-13.2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>7NLW-NFH6-7XLV</code></td>\n<td>89,884,719</td>\n<td>2022-12-02 19:08:02</td>\n<td>2022-12-02 19:08:45.6</td>\n<td>+43.6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>MLZW-Y3HD-YTP9</code></td>\n<td>89,842,386</td>\n<td>2022-12-01 14:55:38</td>\n<td>2022-12-01 14:55:26.4</td>\n<td>-11.6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>MBQW-RCHD-YNQ9</code></td>\n<td>89,832,311</td>\n<td>2022-12-01 08:12:04</td>\n<td>2022-12-01 08:12:26.4</td>\n<td>+22.4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>MP4W-6DHM-QNNC</code></td>\n<td>88,550,775</td>\n<td>2022-10-26 17:51:16</td>\n<td>2022-10-26 17:51:00</td>\n<td>-16</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>7HGW-RFRG-9JX9</code></td>\n<td>85,342,886</td>\n<td>2022-07-29 15:15:30</td>\n<td>2022-07-29 15:15:26.4</td>\n<td>-3.6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>MJFW-YNRK-P66H</code></td>\n<td>84,690,759</td>\n<td>2022-07-11 12:30:01</td>\n<td>2022-07-11 12:30:21.6</td>\n<td>+20.6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CRFD-NZRZ-JZGP</code></td>\n<td>83,179,845</td>\n<td>2022-05-30 13:13:26</td>\n<td>2022-05-30 13:13:48</td>\n<td>+22</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><hr/>\n<p>Python functions for encoding/decoding:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>CHARS = \"CM7WD6N4RHF9ZL3XKQGVPBTJY\"\nBASE = len(CHARS)\n\ndef encode(num):\n    encoded = \"\"\n    while num &gt;= BASE:\n        encoded = CHARS[num % BASE] + encoded\n        num //= BASE\n    return CHARS[num] + encoded\n\ndef decode(encoded):\n    num = 0\n    for x, c in enumerate(encoded):\n        exp = len(encoded) - x - 1\n        num += (BASE**exp) * CHARS.find(c)\n    return num\n</code></pre>\n</div>",

Does the survey website validate and reject codes if you change the last letter to ‘correct’ the timestamp? None of your examples change the minute, only the seconds, and an order number and time to the nearest minute would be enough to identify a given order.</span>",

I thought about the possibility of it being check digit as well - but then I wonder how that could work - did they invent their own check digit system for base 25 or modify an existing decimal one (if that would even work) etc. - might be a dead end, sadly.</span>",

As you've got there numbers that overflow end up as even too so the doubled digits will only end up even, meaning that you could swap the trailing 3 for a 7 and the checksum wouldn't change.
