    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm using NEPacketFilterProvider, which intercept all outgoing/incoming packets from all interfaces and protocols. on packet event I get callback to PacketHandler which has the following signature :</p>\n<pre><code>public typealias NEFilterPacketHandler = (NEFilterPacketContext, nw_interface_t, NETrafficDirection, UnsafeRawPointer, Int) -&gt; NEFilterPacketProvider.Verdict\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm particularly interested in the <code>NEFilterPacketContext</code> object which is currently opaque and has no documentation. I was wondering if this object can provide me insights about the packet's source app (either PID or procname)</p>\n<p>Is it possible to extract this info from the object NEFilterPacketContext ?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n</div>",

It has no API; all you can do is pass it around.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Finding out what app it come from is going to be tricky. If you delay the packet (resulting in an <code>NEPacket</code>) you may find useful info in the\nmetadata property. However, Iâ€™d advise against deferring every packet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
