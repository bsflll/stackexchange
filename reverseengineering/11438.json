So, \"Run -&gt; local windows debugger\" is wrong. Start the win64_remotex64 server manually, then have IDA connect to it.</span>",

Once the debugger is running, you can connect to it \"remotely\" and debug. You can check <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/debugger/cross-win-linux/win32towin64.shtml\">this tutorial</a> for more specific details.</p>\n</div>",

Here's how you can debug x64 processes on a local machine with IDA Pro:</p>\n<p>(1) Create a .bat file with the following:</p>\n<pre><code>\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA 6.5\\dbgsrv\\win64_remotex64\" -Pnh8sy261\n</code></pre>\n<p>in this case it's the location of <code>win64_remotex64</code> or remote debugger and <code>nh8sy261</code> is just some random password. You pick it. Make sure though not to put any spaces after the <code>-P</code> parameter and the password.</p>\n<p>(2) Run batch file from (1) as admin.</p>\n<p>(3) Open 64-bit version of IDA Pro as admin. (File <code>\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA 6.5\\idaq64.exe\"</code>)</p>\n<p>(4) Pick <code>Go</code> to work on your own. Then in the blank IDA Pro window, in the menu go to <code>Debugger -&gt; Run -&gt; Remote Windows debugger</code>. Then in the <code>Application</code> pick your application with the <code>...</code> button. Specify debuggee parameters and directory, if needed. Then in the <code>Hostname</code> add <code>127.0.0.1</code>, port as <code>23946</code> and password as what you typed above in the batch file:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4EZU5.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4EZU5.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>You can also check to <code>Save network settings as default</code> for later access. Then click OK.</p>\n<p>(5) At this point the debugger should load the <code>debuggee</code> process and you should be able to step through it.</p>\n</div>",
