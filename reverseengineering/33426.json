    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to modify ARK: Survival Evolved's server (ShooterGameServer.exe) to simulate a larger number of players by adding virtual dummies. I've found some key data structures with Cheat Engine, but I'm having problems and would like your help.\nMy goal</p>\n<p>I want to add virtual dummies to the game, specifically by modifying the server's maximum number of players (B134) and current number of players (CF38) to make the server look like it has more players (e.g., increasing the number of players from 10 to 15).\nKnown information</p>\n<p>With Cheat Engine, I've locked down the logic for the game to read the number of players:</p>\n<p>If the server is not accessed:<br/>\nThe number of players is stored in vstdlib_s64.dll + 0x00049400 -&gt; [0x0][0x58][0x18][0xE0][0x434] (I'll call it ID 6).<br/>\n0x434 is a status flag and has a value of 0 if the server is not accessed.</p>\n<p>I'm guessing that B134 (maximum number of people) and CF38 (current number of people) may be stored at offsets near 0x434 (e.g. 0x438 and 0x43C), but I can't confirm that.</p>\n<p>After entering the server:<br/>\nThe status flag (1FB8577A22C, the path is vstdlib_s64.dll + 0x00049400 -&gt; [0x0][0x18][0x90][0x48][0x60]) changes to 1.</p>\n<p>Number of players switched to tier0_s64.dll + 0x0004D9F0 -&gt; [0x3E8][0x410][0x30][0x28] :<br/>\n0xD80: B134 (maximum number of people, e.g. 10).<br/>\n0xE84: CF38 (Current number, for example, 0).</p>\n<p>Access function:<br/>\n7FFE4C7F1076 (ShooterGameServer.exe module) frequently accesses vstdlib_s64.dll + 0x00049400 with instruction mov rax,[rax+00049400].</p>\n</div>",
