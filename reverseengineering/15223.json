    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Unlike <code>LogMeIn</code> or <code>GoToMyPC</code>, <code>TeamViewer</code> does not have any driver files except for the <code>INF and GPD</code> files. <code>LogMeIn</code> and <code>GoToMyPC</code> have their own configuration and driver dlls, while TeamViewer uses the <code>default unidrvui.dll for config and unidrv.dll as driver file</code>. </p>\n<p>I don't seem to understand how Teamviewer is able to develop a <code>virtual printer driver</code> without writing their own driver dll.</p>\n<p>VNC also seems to follow similar way, they use <code>unidrvui.dll and unidrv.dll</code>, but they have one more custom dll <code>VNCui.dll</code> (guess this is also a config dll).</p>\n<p>Have anyone tried to reverse engineer <code>TeamViewer</code> or <code>VNC's</code> virtual printer driver? Please shed some light on this.</p>\n</div>",
