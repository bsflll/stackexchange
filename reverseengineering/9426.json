It starts with: <code>NSCR1000</code> as below:</p>\n<pre><code>$ hexdump -Cn8 ~/Library/Saved\\ Application\\ State/com.apple.Terminal.savedState/data.data\n00000000  4e 53 43 52 31 30 30 30                           |NSCR1000|\n</code></pre>\n<p>It's used by <code>windows.plist</code> file which can be decoded by:</p>\n<pre><code>plutil -convert xml1 -o windows.plist windows.plist\n</code></pre>\n<p>What kind of method I can use to read that <code>.data</code> file? Or where do I start?</p>\n<pre><code>$ strings data.data | head -10\nNSCR1000\np+5v\n0&gt;[t\nkJX6X\n@NSCR1000\n</code></pre>\n<p>This file is automatically generated by Terminal app when you start and start typing something, so the terminal data is stored there.</p>\n</div>",

I highly encourage you to do that as it would be very interesting reading for everyone especially if you could explain your technique of finding the right answer in a simple way. So many developers could benefit from your experience, please do!</span>",
