    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I was trying to test and intercept traffic from an app developed on <strong>Rhodes</strong> open source framework, I setup a proxy with burp, and of course I have installed burp certificate on my device hence I can intercept other apps on my device but I am unable to see the traffic of the app in <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.path_solutions.premierbank&amp;hl=en_US\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">question - its link</a> on burp suite instead the app works fine and connects to the remote server without even appearing any error related to certificate on the <strong>event Log</strong> of the burp suite. in reversing the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.path_solutions.premierbank&amp;hl=en_US\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">app</a> I concluded that it is using https protocol to connect to the server(would be happy to confirm it <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.path_solutions.premierbank&amp;hl=en_US\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">app link here</a>). in my testing when I have installed the app in a Genymotion Emulator and burp suite set up to intercept traffic, can only see <strong>traffic</strong> going to local host address; forexample:</p>\n<pre><code>http://127.0.0.1:44895\n\nPOST /app/Settings/do_pathlogin HTTP/1.1\nHost: 127.0.0.1:44895\nContent-Length: 65\nAccept: */*\nOrigin: http://127.0.0.1:44895\nX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 8.0.0; Samsung Galaxy S6 Build/OPR6.170623.017; wv) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Chrome/58.0.3029.125 Mobile Safari/537.36\nTransition-Enabled: true\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8\nReferer: http://127.0.0.1:44895/app/Settings/index_callback\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nAccept-Language: en-US\nConnection: close\n\nfromPage=login&amp;operation_key=HOME_REP&amp;username=user&amp;password=pass\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>I don't have any idea why this behaviour the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.path_solutions.premierbank&amp;hl=en_US\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">app</a> is showing, in the real device this won't show up, i.e, traffic to the address <code>127.0.0.1</code>.\nAs other researchers would recommend, tried to sniff network traffic of the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.path_solutions.premierbank&amp;hl=en_US\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">app</a> with wireshark  and activated the capture traffic of the wireshark, I was expecting to sniff or even decide whether app is using UDP protocols, but did not appear any traffic from the app!.</p>\n<p><strong>I wanted some help how can I capture the traffic of this <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.path_solutions.premierbank&amp;hl=en_US\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">app</a>?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>what am I missing?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>what other steps do I need?</strong></p>\n<p>I would really happy to help me about this.</p>\n<p>You can get the app in question <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.path_solutions.premierbank&amp;hl=en_US\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n</div>",

Would be happy if you give me steps to install burp certificate in the system credentials for <b>genymotion</b> emulator. Nevertheless if it was certificate issue, why I cannot see an error log in burp? The app does connect to the server without an issue in real device when burp was still on.</span>",

But you should first install your root Ca cert as user certificate so you get the correct file as <code>c8450d0d.0</code> is only the valid name for the mitmproxy root ca cert. However I would recommend to use a real phone. Banking apps often refuse to work on emulators.</span>",
