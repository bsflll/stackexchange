Of course, most diff tools work on ASCII text, but there are some that deal with binary files.</p>\n<p>Some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://radareorg.github.io/blog/posts/binary-diffing/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">radiff2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HxD</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are more and you probably will find one that matches exactly your need.\nIf you would like to see your modifications in a nice visual manner with already bytes being presented as opcodes there are some options too. I haven't used them (so can't give you my recommendations) but there are at least two that I know of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zynamics.com/binnavi.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BinNavi</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/filcab/patchdiff2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PatchDiff 2</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
