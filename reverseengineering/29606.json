Additionally, the application calls <code>System.loadLibrary(\"libMyLib.so\");</code> to load that library.</p>\n<p>How can I debug this shared library?</p>\n</div>",

I would assume that this is still valid even for apps that comprise of multiple APK files (split APK). So you should better search for <code>libMyLib.so</code> in file-system and when loaded in list of loaded modules. On a rooted device my recommendation would be to use <a href=\"https://frida.re\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">frida.re</a></span>",
