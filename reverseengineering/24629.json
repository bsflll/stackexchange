Also support for <strong>CAN bus</strong> (OBD2 scanning and sniffing) has been added. Supported protocols: ISO9141, ISO14230, ISO15765, CAN Raw.</p>\n<p>The program is still growing. I added lots of new features in the last months.</p>\n<p>Now it can also download the <strong>flash memory</strong> from the MT05 ECU with the calibration tables, correct the checksum and program the flash memory (tuning).</p>\n<p>HUD ECU Hacker finds <strong>calibration tables</strong> automatically in a flash memory file. It finds approx 170 tables and 500 scalar values.\nCalibration tables can also be displayed as 3D model.</p>\n<p>Download and detailed description here:\n<a href=\"https://netcult.ch/elmue/HUD%20ECU%20Hacker/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://netcult.ch/elmue/HUD%20ECU%20Hacker/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XTK5s.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"HUD ECU Hacker Control\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XTK5s.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/poGcy.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"HUD ECU Hacker Dashboard\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/poGcy.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tX8PI.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"HUD ECU Hacker Graph\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tX8PI.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tIzbr.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"HUD ECU Hacker Delphi MT05 Calibration Table Tuning\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tIzbr.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Z0N7f.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"HUD ECU Hacker Delphi MT05  Calibration Table Tuning 3D\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Z0N7f.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

Stock Ecu is wantao, similar to mt05 but not tuneable by this software.</span>",
