Because the begin address of <code>GOT</code> table can't be decided until link time..</p>\n<p>So my questions are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is modifying linker a right way to do this ..? Is there any other way?</p></li>\n<li><p>How to modify the linker in this issue..? I basically have no experiences before.. </p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

The postprocessor could alternatively modify the assembly code or create 2nd/3rd generation assembly code to be assembled again, using binary and disassembly as source. Probably it could be done by modifying (or rewriting) the code of my answer to your SO question: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20506524/can-i-combine-all-the-sections-objdump-s-d-elf-file-generate-into-a-re-assem/20510168#20510168\" title=\"can i combine all the sections objdump s d elf file generate into a re assem\">stackoverflow.com/questions/20506524/â€¦</a></span>",
