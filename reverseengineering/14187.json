This allows you to break as soon as the value becomes visible on the stack.</p>\n<p>You use it like this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"stack.contains\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wJ0Fh.png\"/></p>\n<p>This will break as soon as the value <code>00E60000</code> appears on the stack:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"break\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vckBm.png\"/></p>\n<p>It should be easy enough to extend this plugin and tailor it to your needs...</p>\n</div>",

But the only problem is that I am not a C++ developer. I assume Visual Studio is needed to build the plugin? Or is there a compiled binary available?</span>",
