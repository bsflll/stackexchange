    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Starting my RE adventures with IDA Pro, I'm opening a windows .exe file in it. While debugging the file, the debugger runs fine and exits with a return 1 value:\n<strong>Debugger: process has exited (exit code 1)</strong>.\nThe problem is all this happens in a second! Before feeding the .exe to IDA Pro, I have tried to open it with double-clicking. The windows console shows itself and fades away in a glimpse; The only way I can get the .exe running with the console remaining open, is by the cmd. I guess IDA Pro debugger is simply exiting for the same reason the console fades in normal running the .exe! So I'm stuck with a .exe file running fine but I don't get the chance to debug it and monitor the flow of the program!</p>\n</div>",

By default no breakpoints are applied.</p>\n<p>You can add a breakpoint on program entry (among other events) in the Debugger Options. In Debugger Options, check the box that says \"Suspend on process entry point\", or any of the other events available.

The interesting part is that the debugger won't exit for specific breakpoints while it does for other ones. I didn't have the issue with Ollydbg. However, I find it much more easier to navigate through IDA Pro GUI. I have tried the events too but they basically are not worth the effort. Even when the debugger suspends and I move to the breakpoint, the debugger again exits</span>",

For Ida look into Ida stealth, Scylla Hide, or Titan hide. Probably others but these are the plugins which I know of that can help you get by anti debugging.</span>",
