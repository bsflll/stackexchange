There's a local variable (that either I have incorrectly typed, or Ghidra did it itself) that I try to retype to <code>int</code>. They are the same size in memory. It has some incorrect <code>enum</code> type.</p>\n<p>I right-click on it and select \"Retype variable\" and then type \"int\" and click OK:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/y8pYNg0w.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/y8pYNg0w.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Ghidra starts churning something and then after a second or two ... nothing changes.</p>\n<p>Why is it refusing to change the type this local variable?</p>\n</div>",

If you do take that route, please include a link to the issue in this post. It's also possible there's a related issue there already, I haven't checked.</span>",
