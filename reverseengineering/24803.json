    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am studying the way that can be used to check if a given password for an encrypted zip file is correct or not. I see this link:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/199545/how-does-a-zip-file-detect-a-correct-password\">How does a zip file detect a correct password?</a></p>\n<p>In the answer of this question, it said CRC is used to check if a password is correct. It also paste a code snippet from Info-zip to prove this.</p>\n<p>However, after carefully studying the Info-zip source code, as below:</p>\n<pre><code>    if ((ush)(c | (b&lt;&lt;8)) != (GLOBAL(pInfo-&gt;ExtLocHdr) ?\n                           ((ush)GLOBAL(lrec.last_mod_dos_datetime) &amp; 0xffff) :\n                           (ush)(GLOBAL(lrec.crc32) &gt;&gt; 16)))\n</code></pre>\n<p>I find when there is ExtLocHdr in the zip item, the lower 2 bytes of last_mod_dos_datetime, instead of the CRC, will be used to verify the password. But this is not mentioned in the file format specification in <a href=\"https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT</a> at all.</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n</div>",
