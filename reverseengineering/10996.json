It is used in at least ZyXEL P-724 firmware images. Running <code>file</code> doesn't show anything.</p>\n<p>Comparing the files I have, I found there seems to be a fixed-size header of around 20 bytes (checked with two files drastically different in both size and contents -- namely, <code>HTPCode</code> and <code>RasCode</code>). Poking around <code>BootExt</code> I can see decompression-related string, but nothing that would give away the exact algorithm.</p>\n<p>The suspected header bytes are (bytes that differ marked out):</p>\n<p><code>08 00 xx xx 71 A8 1A xx 17 2A 7C 60 xx C2 02 0C 20 83 10 00</code></p>\n<p>A sample containing the original image, extracted ROM object, and the compressed data itself: <a href=\"https://yadi.sk/d/lBRqhldYjRMPf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://yadi.sk/d/lBRqhldYjRMPf</a></p>\n</div>",
