As you can hopefully see in my screenshot the line with the CMP and the [EAX]  in question is selected, but there is no text in the box below, which is what's tripping me up.  My EAX register shows 02C10A7C, which is outside of the maximum used memory address 00AE1FFA.  I'm new to Ollydbg, is there a setting somewhere that might enable/disable those hints in that box?</span>",
