I assumed there were separate executable files inside the image, but, by your comment, looks like the entire file is the executable? As for the device's CPU, it's a Broadcom BCM5357C0. According to binwalk, this is little endian MIPS (MIPSEL) code.</span>",

This usually means that this is a single executable file and not a mashup of many. What you should do now is figure the correct loading address of the firmware so that you can analyze it. This can be done either by looking at specs (for the processor), using the device's shell, or by maximizing the number of string references.</span>",

Unfortunately I don't have access to a shell on the device, since it doesn't appear to have an UART port or anything. I'll try to look up processor specs, but in case I don't find anything useful, could you explain the part about maximizing the number of string references?</span>",
