This isn't a standalone executable - it's literally just a snapshot of running memory.</p>\n<p>I'm looking for a tool that will help me identify assembly instructions within this binary file.  Does such a tool exist?  </p>\n<p>I know you can use OllyDebug or IDAPRO to analyze executables.  However, since this is a full memory dump, it'a not clear to me whether these tools are still applicable.  For a raw memory dump there isn't a clear entry point that IDA can start with.</p>\n<p>Any suggestions would be very helpful.  Thanks!</p>\n</div>",

To find them in a memory dump (kernel or user mode), you can run the WinDbg command</p>\n<pre><code>.imgscan\n</code></pre>\n<p>From WinDbg help:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The .imgscan command scans virtual memory for image headers.</p>\n<p>The .imgscan command displays any image headers that it finds and the header type. Header types include Portable Executable (PE) headers and Microsoft MS-DOS MZ headers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was able to verify this in user mode, but with the only Windows XP kernel mode dump I currently have, it does not output anything.</p>\n<p>Example output from a user mode dump:</p>\n<pre><code>MZ at 000007fe`ff4d0000, prot 00000004, type 00020000 - size db000\n  Name: ADVAPI32.dll\n</code></pre>\n<p>So all the necessary information to get the DLL is available. In case of a user mode dump I have used</p>\n<pre><code>.writemem &lt;FileName&gt; &lt;Range&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>to write the DLL to disk and analyze later. </p>\n<p><code>&lt;Range&gt;</code> is according the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/address-and-address-range-syntax\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">address and range syntax</a>, e.g.</p>\n<pre><code>.writemem advapi32.dll 000007fe`ff4d0000 Ldb000\n</code></pre>\n<p>This probably won't work for kernel mode dumps because parts of the module may have been swapped to disk, so the DLL in memory is no longer complete.</p>\n<p>This approach will also not find code that was generated on the fly.</p>\n<h2>Finding potentially executable code</h2>\n<p>Code that can be executed must reside in a memory block that has the <code>executable</code> flag set.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the command</p>\n<pre><code>!address -f:&lt;filter&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>is broken in WinDbg 6.2.9200. It should work in user mode dumps and output a list of start and end addresses that are executable.</p>\n<p>At the moment I only get</p>\n<pre><code>0:067&gt; !address -f:PAGE_EXECUTE\n\n        BaseAddress      EndAddress+1        RegionSize     Type       State                 Protect             Usage\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0:067&gt; !address -f:PAGE_EXECUTE_READ\nInvalid filter arguments.
