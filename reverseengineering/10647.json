    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a laptop that I recently lost the BIOS Admin password for. I contacted the manufacturer and, after giving them some information about my BIOS (version, uuid), they sent me a file, <code>smc.bin</code> to put on a USB stick and boot in order to reset the BIOS password.</p>\n<p>I'm interested in how this works and what the binary file is. I'm skilled with linux, but don't know much about reverse-engineering. What tools can I use to examine this binary? What's a introductory thought-process to determine what a binary file like this is?</p>\n</div>",
