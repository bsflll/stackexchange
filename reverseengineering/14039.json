In any case, how could i figure out how to unpack kkrunchy executables?</p>\n</div>",

I've been able to get a dump of the exe following some of your steps but i needed to cheat here (put a hw breakpoint directly :(). I didn't understand the step where you say \"Now go ahead and use that Trace into beyond trace record function to step through while skipping the instructions that were already traced over.\" , I haven't been able to see that label \"OEP Jump\" , look at my <a href=\"http://screencast.com/t/wRShlBtGa8BY\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">screen</a> , i don't see the same labels than you, once i've step after the ret i've pressed \"ctrl+/\" till i've reached <code>0x005F214E</code> , +1</span>",

I marked it with comments, but you can see the counts in the info box below.
