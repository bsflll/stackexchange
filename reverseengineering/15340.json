Serna - @fjserna </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><strong>Why does it work?</strong></h2>\n<p>This is what I understand:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each page is 0x1000 bytes (4kb). </li>\n<li>Each block smaller than 0x1000 would be allocated from the end of the page backwards.</li>\n<li>Therefore, by taking the page size and subtracting the block size from it, retrieved from the block's address last 3 digits that we get using the &amp; operator, you get its actual size.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>It seems a bit voodoo, because:</strong> </p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>In order for the subtraction to work, the inspected allocated block address must be aligned with 1000. Does HPA align everything in pages somehow? I didn't find any resource with enough information about it. Is there any other way that HPA makes this formula work with?</p></li>\n<li><p>How does the AND operator actually makes the value return only the last 3 digits? I don't get its logic.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Could anyone be kind enough to explain these things for us?</p>\n</div>",
