I want to dump the software it runs.</p>\n<p>As far as I can tell, there's no external flash on the device, so it must be running off of the internal flash.</p>\n<p>I've identified the SWD pins on the package and the designers helpfully left tiny attachment points to them.</p>\n<p>As someone who's never done this on the hardware side, now what? What hardware do I need to attach to this core? What software? (I keep reading about openocd - is there something better?) How hard of a journey am I starting here?</p>\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n</div>",

As far as I understand, the protection works by disallowing data reads from the flash and only allowing instruction-fetch reads. Can you even implement OTA in a system like this?</span>",
