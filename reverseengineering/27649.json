Is there any way to do the same with NT kernel? I could not find a way to test even reactos kernelwith qemu.</p>\n<p>Also can <code>.efi</code> files be run? In that way I can try <code>bootmgr.efi</code> to load <code>ntoskrnl.exe</code>.</p>\n</div>",

The NT kernel requires an environment such as UEFI or legacy BIOS and relies on it, for example, to load additional drivers. It also expects to be loaded in a certain manner by the pre-loader (winload.efi) while Linux has less strict requirements.</p>\n<p>This is why QEMU can provide built in support for booting Linux - it’s much simpler to implement. For Windows you need to prepare a disk image with the file system and a UEFI environment such as OVMF. The Windows kernel uses registry (BCD - Boot configuration data) for configuration instead of command line arguments so it’s trickier to implement.</p>\n</div>",
