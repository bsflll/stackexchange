            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>In your screenshot, you can see a thin strip of gray between the title of the window (<code>Functions window</code>) and the column headers (e.g. <code>Function name</code>). If you hover your mouse in that gray area, it will expand and the title text (<code>Functions window</code>) will appear again, as in the following screenshot:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Cy2K4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"mouseover on the gray area beneath the title\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Cy2K4.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Once that happens, hold down the left click button and move the window. You will see a number of icons appear around the edges, and in the center of the IDA window, as follows:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4ChPt.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"after clicking/dragging the gray area\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4ChPt.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Your first option is to ignore those icons, and drag the window into the area with the tabbed window names (e.g <code>IDA View-A</code>, <code>Pseudocode-A</code>, etc). The window will become an ordinary tab again. This is probably what you want.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can drag your mouse onto one of the aforementioned icons to get a split-screen view. I recommend playing with them to get an intuitive feel for what the icons do, but here's a textual description:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leftmost/center-left icon : the current tab will now be split into two panes, with the one you dragged in on the left, and the active one on the right</li>\n<li>Rightmost/center-right icon: ditto, except the one you dragged will be on the right</li>\n<li>Topmost/center-top icon: the screen is split into two panes; the existing tabs will be in the bottom pane, and the current window will be in the top pane by itself</li>\n<li>Bottommost/center-bottom icon: ditto, except the one you dragged will be at the bottom</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
