I have a set of <code>.idb</code> files which will not be opened by IDA 7.</p>\n<p>What I have tried so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Opening the file directly in IDA as recommended <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/238.shtml\" rel=\"noreferrer\">in the manual</a>. It's not listed as an option in the open menu, and when forced, it says it can't disassemble the file.</li>\n<li>Rename the <code>.idb</code> file to <code>.id0</code>. It first reports that the file is not closed, asking to repair it. If I say Yes, it reports <code>bTree error: bad B-tree header</code>.</li>\n<li>Rename the <code>.idb</code> file to <code>.i64</code>. It shows <code>Please use 32-bit version of IDA to open &lt;file&gt;</code>. There is no 32-bit version of IDA 7 Freeware.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

It's also listed in the manual (<a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/444.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/444.shtml</a>). Basically:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Export from IDA old to <code>.idc</code> (this will generate an IDC file)</li>\n<li>Run new IDA with switch <code>-x</code> with your old IDB database (From my experience, this just opens IDA and autoanalyzes everything again, I'm not sure if that's the expected behavior)</li>\n<li>Execute the IDC file with IDA new (This is supposed to apply all manual work you've done in your old IDB database and apply it to the new database).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That said, I haven't had any luck getting this to work, but it's supposed to, so maybe you'll have better luck than me, please report back if you have any :).</p>\n</div>",
