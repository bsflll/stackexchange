For example, this is a call to a location which is not a proper function:</p>\n<pre><code>call    loc_11B4460\n</code></pre>\n<p>And this call does not return, so all code after it is removed as dead code by the decompiler:</p>\n<pre><code>.text:00CA5E6B   call    sub_4E5CE9\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see it by the dashed line added by IDA after the call (these lines are added to show breaks in code flow. You can also probably see the break in the code flow in the graph view as well. </p>\n<p>You can remove the no-return flag from the target function by editing its properties, and for the first call you need to check why IDA could not create a function at <code>loc_11B4460</code> and fix it. </p>\n<p>The decompiler relies on IDA for the disassembly, so if your disassembly is bad you’ll get bad decompilation (aka garbage in-garbage out).</p>\n<p>Check also <a href=\"https://hex-rays.com/products/decompiler/manual/faq.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the FAQ</a> for some of the other common problems. </p>\n</div>",

In your case it looks like it failed to analyze stack.\nSame thing was in IDA 7.0, and even in 7.2. What's the situation in further IDA versions I don't know.</p>\n</div>",
