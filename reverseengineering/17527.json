I copied the files to a thumb drive before setting the machine up for reimaging. Though the AV software kept saying it was removed, it kept coming back.</p>\n<p>I noticed 3 outbound connections. Two were to Amazon AWS servers and one was to a machine in Panama based on the IP.</p>\n<p>All the included .bat files are the same as below. I've checked against different encryption types but haven't had any luck figuring out the commands in the file. All of the executable have a 3 character extension. Looked at them in a hex editor and am unable to pull any useful data.</p>\n<p>This is more out of curiosity than anything. </p>\n<pre><code>    echo KWvBTeEhoOBvYGBOV0L9i07izYZQZ6eUNvN\necho UHCxEg2gVic\necho FgXcH8LAyBRqqlUil8L\necho EqXkXZQa0\necho 3BPrg\necho ptGFX9BkqRJM50l0ZhOy4FHpc2TYBtayl70\necho FfStAj3XYV5w9u\nstart \"Lnvqgn8kWPwvFipqD8tLpq\" \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Gm Ugc\\iqgux rez.dcah\"\necho f199qjLWdJ6URiTJLa3AC0\necho bF6MorMQoqttAWAMHa\necho Kpme1Fkmm\necho kLShOlr2t\necho sTNvUyM5FjoN89YzL3CFCdi5d6bknL\necho K6n2kL9BxaAY9NlDD8tFg\n</code></pre>\n</div>",

IDA  still the de-facto standard and has a free variant however it may not work for 64bit binaries. That being said, Rootkit.Fileless.MTGen is a generic detection and can be multiple different kinds of malware with a rootkit component</span>",
