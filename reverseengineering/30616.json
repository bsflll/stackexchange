It has a 5 digit 7 segment LCD display. My objective is to be able to read what is displayed on the LCD display with a Raspberry Pi. This is what the PCB looks like: <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EgyKB.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"crane scale PCB\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EgyKB.jpg\"/></a>\nIt looks like there are 15 input pins to the LCD module at the top of the PCB. Could I read some of these with the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi to determine what is being displayed on the screen?</p>\n</div>",
