So, how can I fix this?</p>\n</div>",

One possible workaround could be to set the <code>IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE</code> flag in the PE Header which would give it an additional 1GB of address space, e.g using <code>editbin</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>editbin /LARGEADDRESSAWARE  windasm32.exe\n</code></pre>\n<p>However this may lead to bugs and/or crashes if the program is not prepared to handle addresses above <code>0x80000000</code>. And it may still not be enough for the program you're trying to disassemble.</p>\n<p>I would strongly suggest using another, more modern disassembler instead that can handle big files. If you can't find the functionality you need, ask a new question about it.</p>\n</div>",
