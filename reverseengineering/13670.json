    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to make a small proxy dll that will be able to print out all the files that a game tries to access from disk.</p>\n<p>I'm using a dinput8 wrapper dll as my proxy dll, from where I've managed to attach a console and print out stuff. But I think I don't understand how exactly I am supposed to hook the ReadFile function.</p>\n<p>First of all I am not sure if this is possible at all, considering that I want to create and export a wrapper function for ReadFile, whose declaration is in a completely different dll from the one I'm wrapping.</p>\n<p>What I'm trying right now (and its not working) is to declare a ReadFile_wrapper function, which is practically calling the original function right now:</p>\n<pre><code>extern \"C\" BOOL WINAPI ReadFile_wrapper(HANDLE hFile, LPVOID lpBuffer, DWORD nNumberOfBytesToRead,\n                        LPDWORD lpNumberOfBytesRead, LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped)\n{\n    MessageBoxA(NULL, \"Reading\", \"\", 0);\n    return ReadFile(hFile, lpBuffer, nNumberOfBytesToRead, lpNumberOfBytesRead, lpOverlapped);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also I'm declaring a definition in the .def file, so that the export function is named like the original ReadFile function</p>\n<pre><code>...\nReadFile=ReadFile_wrapper\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm obviously missing something critical here, so any help is highly appreciated.</p>\n</div>",
