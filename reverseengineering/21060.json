    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm reversing engendering a plugin. This plugin is loaded into memory by the main program. \nI disassemble the plugin with radare2 but I don't know how to debug it.\nI try with gdb but same problem. </p>\n<p>I know is possible because I have done it in Hopper but I don't know to to do it with radare2 or gdb.</p>\n<p>one of the obstacles is, I load the plugin with radare2 to disassembler it but I can't put any breakpoint because is not set it in debug mode. Also, I can't set the debug mode because the plugin can't start by it self. Maybe I need I command that will start my main program before the debug? is there anything like that in radare2? I was reading about rarun2 but I can't make it work for something like this </p>\n<p>Any ideas?\nThanks</p>\n</div>",
