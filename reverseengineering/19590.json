    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I load a reference elf that I cross-compiled for AArch64 into IDA Pro, idb2pat to generate a .pat which I then process through sigmake.</p>\n<p>I then use the signature file (in the appropriate IDA Pro directory) to work on a commercial image, however it only identifies perhaps one or two functions (of many hundreds) even though I know the binary I am examining was built off the reference source that I used to build the reference elf that I generated a .pat (and then a signature for).</p>\n<p>The commercial elf has all debug/compiler info stripped... pretty ruthlessly so I have to guess what gcc it was compiled with and then cross-compile the reference source using this guessed gcc version.</p>\n<p>My question is how important is the compiler version when building an elf to generate signatures from? If I get the version incorrect will all my signatures simply fail to match the target binary I am working with?</p>\n<p>Thanks for any help!</p>\n</div>",

A different version of compiler may have drastically different register allocator or optimization algorithms, which may result in very different binary for the same source. In addition, <code>idb2pat</code> probably is not tuned for AArch64 and might not mark relocatable bytes properly, leading to overly restrictive patterns. A better option is to generate patterns from the object files (<code>.o</code>) or static libraries (<code>.a</code>) with <code>pelf</code> since it can use relocation information to mark wildcard bytes.</p>\n<p>If you have just a single binary, I would suggest to just match it against the source code manually, using straight old human intuition and references between functions/string literals. This will likely be faster than finding the correct compiler version and options.</p>\n<p>Another option is to use a more flexible diffing utility like <a href=\"http://diaphora.re\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Diaphora</a>  which has more algorithms besides fixed byte pattern matching.</p>\n<p>If you need this on scale, you'll need to gather many compiler versions and try various options that affect code generation (at least the optimization level, i.e. <code>-O0, -O1, -O2, -O3</code>). You should also try other compilers like llvm/clang (both the public version and <a href=\"https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/compilers/arm-compiler\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ARM's customized one</a>).</p>\n<p>For a quick test, you can use <a href=\"https://godbolt.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Compiler Explorer</a> on some short code snippets to see if you can find a compiler and set of options to match the code you're seeing in the binary.</p>\n</div>",
