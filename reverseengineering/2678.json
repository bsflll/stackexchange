    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I encountered a strange x86-32 instruction (opcode <code>0x65</code>) decoded by <code>objdump</code> as <code>gs</code> (not <code>%gs</code> but <code>gs</code>). I found it while a full linear sweep of a binary (<code>objdump -D</code>), so the decoding was surely incorrect. But, still, <code>objdump</code> didn't decode it as a <code>(bad)</code> instruction, so it means that it can be encountered and I would like to know what does it means.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of this instruction:</p>\n<pre><code>080484fc &lt;_IO_stdin_used&gt;:\n 80484fc:       01 00                   add    %eax,(%eax)\n 80484fe:       02 00                   add    (%eax),%al\n 8048500:       48                      dec    %eax\n 8048501:       65                      gs     &lt;======================= Here!!!\n 8048502:       6c                      insb   (%dx),%es:(%edi)\n 8048503:       6c                      insb   (%dx),%es:(%edi)\n 8048504:       6f                      outsl  %ds:(%esi),(%dx)\n 8048505:       20 57 6f                and    %dl,0x6f(%edi)\n 8048508:       72 6c                   jb     8048576 &lt;_IO_stdin_used+0x7a&gt;\n 804850a:       64 21 0a                and    %ecx,%fs:(%edx)\n 804850d:       00 44 6f 64             add    %al,0x64(%edi,%ebp,2)\n 8048511:       67 65 20 54 68          and    %dl,%gs:0x68(%si)\n 8048516:       69                      .byte 0x69\n 8048517:       73 21                   jae    804853a &lt;_IO_stdin_used+0x3e&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that searching for this instruction on the Web is quite difficult because of the <code>%gs</code> register which mask all other possible hit.</p>\n<p>So, is it a real \"instruction\" or is it glitch produced by <code>gas</code> ?</p>\n</div>",

The opcode <code>0x65</code> correspond in fact to a prefix corresponding to <code>%gs:(mem_ref)</code>.

You cannot make decisions on \"good\" or \"bad\" disassembly while feeding it with bad input.

It's the segment override prefix (prefixes are considered to be part of the instruction).</p>\n<p>Most memory accesses use <code>DS</code> segment selector by default except those involving <code>ESP</code> or <code>EBP</code> register (they default to <code>SS</code>) and some \"string\" instructions (<code>movs</code>, <code>scas</code> etc). Segment override prefixes allow you to use another segment selector to access your data. E.g. in DOS times the <code>CS</code> override was commonly used to access data stored in the code segment (such as jump tables):</p>\n<pre><code>seg001:00EA shl bx, 1 ; SWITCH\nseg001:00EC jmp cs:off_13158[bx] ; switch jump\n...\nseg001:0588 off_13158  dw offset loc_12DD7 ; DATA XREF: _main+E6r\nseg001:0588            dw offset loc_12DE5 ; jump table for switch statement\nseg001:0588            dw offset loc_12DE5\nseg001:0588            dw offset loc_12DE5\n</code></pre>\n<p>The 80386 added two extra segment registers (<code>GS</code> and <code>FS</code>) and the corresponding prefixes.</p>\n<p>Since the <code>GS</code> prefix does not actually affect the following instruction (<code>insb</code>) in the code snipped above, GAS opted out for printing it on a separate line.</p>\n<p>In some of the following instructions you can see how it affects the disassembly:</p>\n<pre><code>64 21 0a       -&gt;  and %ecx, %fs:(%edx)\n^^                           ^^^\n67 65 20 54 68 -&gt; and %dl, %gs:0x68(%si)\n   ^^                      ^^^\n</code></pre>\n<p>BTW, 67 is another prefix, this time the <em>address size</em> override. It is why the instruction uses the 16-bit <code>SI</code> register and not the full <code>ESI</code>.</p>\n</div>",
