    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have been thinking about it lately and was wondering if a Man In The Middle attack could be established physically on a motherboard.</p>\n<p>The goal would be to intercept the signals between two components and to manipulate the signals as well. I assume this could be done through drilling holes in the circuit, and having a separate device bridge a new connection.</p>\n<p>Would this be possible?</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n</div>",

There is also a device out there for breaking BIOS passwords on certain thinkpads by connecting to an IC of some sort but I can't find the article.</p>\n<p>Although those methods probably differ in some aspects from a MITM attack, the way you describe would seem perfectly valid based on those devices.</p>\n</div>",
