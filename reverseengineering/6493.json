And <code>hProcess</code> is a handle to <code>explorer.exe</code>. </p>\n<h2>What I want to know</h2>\n<p>Related to <code>lpStartAddress</code>, I have found the following lines:</p>\n<pre><code>  ...\n  push ebx\n  push [ebp+nSize]\n  push offset loc_402B58\n  push [ebp+lpStartAddress]\n  push [ebp+hProcess] \n  call WriteProcessMemory\n  ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, this function writes the content of <code>offset loc_402B58</code> into the region of pages started at <code>lpStartAddress</code> (which was allocated some lines before).\nNow, when I go to <code>offset loc_402B58</code>, I see the following (note: I use IDA PRO):</p>\n<pre><code>loc_402B58:\n push esi\n mov esi, [esp+8]\n lea eax, [esi+14h]\n push eax\n call dword ptr[esi]\n test eax, eax\n mov [esi+10h], eax\n jz short loc_402B80\n lea ecx, [esi+46h]\n push ecx\n push eax\n call dword ptr [esi+4]\n test eax, eax\n jz short_loc402B80\n call eax\n push 0\n call eax                  &lt;----- edited because i have forgotten it\n push 0                    &lt;-----                    ''\n call dword ptr [esi+8]    &lt;-----                    ''\n\nloc_402B80:     \n xor eax, eax\n pop esi\n retn 4\n</code></pre>\n<p>So my question would be: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What does the assembly at <code>loc_402B58</code> and <code>loc_402B80</code> ?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
