Here is a paper about <a href=\"http://www.comp.nus.edu/~liangzk/papers/asiaccs11.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jump Oriented Programming</a>. Also, <a href=\"https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~s/papers/noret_ccs2010/noret_ccs2010.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Return Oriented Programming without Returns</a>. They went through libc-2.7 (/lib/i686/cmov/libc-2.7.so of Debian Linux 5.0.4) and found alternative gadgets. These included gadgets ending in <code>jump</code>,<code>call</code>,<code>jump+call</code>,<code>ret</code>. Logically there will be more <code>ret</code> rop gadgets however there are still some extremely useful non-return gadgets such as the one below.</p>\n<pre><code>popa ; Load all registers\ncmc ; No practical effect\njmp far dword [ecx] ; Back to dispatcher via ecx\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also seeing a call to a register is not uncommon especially when dealing with C++ binaries that leverage vtables for objects.</p>\n<p>When ROP-ing on ARM its almost mandatory to use less traditional gadgets. Which includes branches into registers,e.g. <code>BX LR</code> (the most traditional return) or <code>BLX R3</code>, or straight loads into the program counter, e.g. <code>LDMFD SP!,{R3,PC}</code></p>\n<p>As for are there non-useful rop gadgets, of course. There are many gadgets that will lose you control of execution. Depending on the amount of gadgets you have, you wont always have control of all registers so if you cant control say <code>edx</code>, any rop gadget that ends with a <code>call [edx]</code> is now not useful.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Added details about ARM Gadgets and link to Return Oriented Programming without Returns for more complete references.</p>\n</div>",

No, this was never published, but we were told we had to follow the academic format for the paper.  </p>\n<p>What your question references is actually a summary of three previous papers, which means you're missing some valuable detail on Schacham's excellent work. And of course, a long list of hacker's going back at minimum to phrack 49's Aleph One piece.  There's a graphic <a href=\"http://blog.zynamics.com/2010/03/12/a-gentle-introduction-to-return-oriented-programming/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>  that details the long history that has culminated in the creation of ROP.  It was essentially a roadmap for my own research.  </p>\n<p>The paper that will explicitly answer your question is \"The Geometry of Innocent Flesh on the Bone: Return-into-libc without Function Calls (on the x86)\"  as <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/4050/4053\">perror</a> has already suggested.  In it is provided pseudocode that tells you we're looking for \"non-boring sequences\" which is defined fully in section 2 with pseudocode.  Later papers demonstrated that ROP was cross-architecture in nature and we can use certain jmp sequences that <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/4055/4053\">jbh discussed.</a> </p>\n<p>A link to my non-peer reviewed unpublished summary is <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz6zvJtgt4nsS3lqb1VJVUx2Z1k/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here.</a>  Included is a list of references, which I will just drop here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1  FX &amp; Halvar Flake , We Can Take it From Here.
