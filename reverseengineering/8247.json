The second breakpoint is for deleting that hardware breakpoint. </p>\n<p>In the condition script for the hardware breakpoint you can do whatever you want: check for a specific value being written, check surrounding values etc.</p>\n<p>Note: <a href=\"http://www.cheatengine.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CheatEngine</a> was written expressly for tasks like that. You might get results quicker and more easily if you get CheatEngine instead of trying to make sense of IDAs meagerly documented - and often quite bizarre - interfaces.</p>\n<p>Here's a rudimentary script that you can adapt by modifying the test in <code>target_check_()</code> and adapting the stack offset in <code>set_target_breakpoint_()</code>. The values there are from a quick test that I did to ensure that the code works. This is for IDA 6.7; it will definitely not work with the free IDA (v5.0).</p>\n<pre><code>#include \"idc.idc\"\n\nstatic main ()\n{\n   set_helper_breakpoints_(LocByName(\"test_ufuncs_t\"), 0);\n}\n\nstatic target_check_ (ea)\n{\n   auto e;\n\n   try\n   {\n      Message(\"DbgDword(%x): %x @ EIP %x\\n\", ea, DbgDword(ea), EIP);\n\n      return DbgDword(ea) == 0x410A10;\n   }\n   catch (e)  {  Message(\"error: %s\\n\", e.description);  }\n\n   return 0;\n}\n\nstatic set_target_breakpoint_ (term_bpt)\n{\n   auto target_ea = ESP - 0x70;\n\n   Message(\"target_ea %a\\n\", target_ea);\n\n   SetBptCndEx(term_bpt, form(\"DelBpt(0x%x) &amp; 0\", target_ea), 0);\n   AddBptEx(target_ea, 4, BPT_WRITE);\n   SetBptCndEx(target_ea, form(\"target_check_(0x%x)\", target_ea), 0);\n\n   return 0;\n}\n\nstatic set_helper_breakpoints_ (init_bpt, term_bpt)\n{\n   if (term_bpt &lt;= 0)\n      term_bpt = FindCode(GetFunctionAttr(init_bpt, FUNCATTR_END), SEARCH_UP);\n\n   Message(\"set_helper_breakpoints(): %s %s\\n\", GetFuncOffset(init_bpt), GetFuncOffset(term_bpt));\n\n   AddBptEx(init_bpt, 0, BPT_DEFAULT);\n   AddBptEx(term_bpt, 0, BPT_DEFAULT);\n   SetBptCndEx(init_bpt, form(\"set_target_breakpoint_(0x%x)\", term_bpt), 0);\n   SetBptCndEx(term_bpt, \"0\", 0);\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
