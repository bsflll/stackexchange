    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am using IDA Pro 7.6 on win32 x86 binaries.</p>\n<p>I'm trying to use the ida_hexrays interface to decompile subroutines. I want all of the local variables and arguments of the subroutine to have integral types, no pointer types. I made this function to do all the processing for me</p>\n<pre><code>import ida_hexrays\nimport ida_typeinf as ida_type\nimport ida_lines\n\ndef decompile_function( function_location ):\n    decompile_handle = ida_hexrays.decompile( function_location, flags = ida_hexrays.DECOMP_NO_CACHE )\n\n    for local_variable in decompile_handle.lvars:\n        type_info = local_variable.type()\n\n        try:    \n            if ida_type.is_type_ptr( type_info.get_decltype() ):\n                pointed_object = type_info.get_pointed_object()\n\n                if ida_type.is_type_integral( pointed_object.get_decltype() ):\n                    local_variable.set_lvar_type( type_info.get_pointed_object() )      \n        except:\n            pass\n\n    decompile_handle.refresh_func_ctext()\n\n    pseudo_code = decompile_handle.get_pseudocode()\n    decompile_result = \"\"\n\n    for code_line in pseudo_code:\n        decompile_result = decompile_result + ida_lines.tag_remove( code_line.line ) + \"\\n\";\n\n    return decompile_result\n</code></pre>\n<p>When I decompile, I can see in the variable list that all of the variables are integral types</p>\n<pre><code>unsigned __int8 v7; // al\nint v10; // eax\nunsigned int v11; // esi\nconst char v12; // cl\n_DWORD v13; // eax\n\nv13 = (_DWORD *)v11;\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, as you may notice above, <code>v13 = (_DWORD *)v11</code> v13 is improperly being set as a pointer. As it turns out, none of the code except the variable declarations gets changed. This happens for every subroutine that I try to decompile with this.</p>\n<p>But when I right-click and use reset pointer value, the code changes and it would look like <code>v13 = v11;</code>. What is the issue with my code, or is IDAPython/IDAHexrays to blame? How do I make it actually reset the pointer value and not just in the declaration list?</p>\n</div>",

If you had a <code>vdui_t</code> object instead of a <code>cfunc_t</code> object, you could call <code>vdui_t::refresh_view</code> with the <code>bool</code> parameter set to <code>True</code>. Alternatively, you could invoke <code>decompile</code> again after the loop that modifies the variable types.</span>",
