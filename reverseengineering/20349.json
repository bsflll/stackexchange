For your specific question, you'd do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select the instruction you want to change</li>\n<li>Go to <code>Edit -&gt; Patch Program -&gt; Assemble</code></li>\n<li>Replace the instruction in the text box with the instruction you'd like it to be.</li>\n<li>Click OK</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The original instruction will now have been replaced with the new one.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/ida-program-patching/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">This article</a> has more info and examples of using the other options in the <code>Patch Program</code> submenu.</p>\n</div>",

It's also possible that the error message is accurate and that feature really isn't available for iOS binaries; I'm not sure. Regardless, here are two examples of people using alternative methods to patch iOS binaries; maybe one of them will help. <a href=\"https://www.zdziarski.com/blog/?p=2172\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">zdziarski.com/blog/?p=2172</a> <a href=\"https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/ios-application-security-part-26-patching-ios-applications-using-ida-pro-hex-fiend\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">resources.infosecinstitute.com/â€¦</a></span>",
