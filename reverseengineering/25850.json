I can run it and extract many addresses:</p>\n<pre><code>[0x5579ca2e2196]&gt; afl~[0]\n0x5579ca2e2060\n0x5579ca2e4fe0\n0x5579ca2e2090\n0x5579ca2e20c0\n0x5579ca2e2100\n</code></pre>\n<p>How do I do run another command on each of those addresses? Let's say I want to print first byte of each of them or set a breakpoint with <code>db</code> on each address.</p>\n<p>I read about iteration, but it looks like it only works on flags with something like <code>sym.*</code>, but not on arbitrary outputs, so I can't do this:</p>\n<pre><code>p8 1 @@ `some command which produces many addresses`\n</code></pre>\n<p>I know that I can save output to a file and then use something like <code>p8 1 @@.my_file</code>, but it looks strange that I need to create a file for that.</p>\n<p>Basically, I want a way to run a single radare command (possibly with parameters) for every line of output of another radare command.</p>\n</div>",
