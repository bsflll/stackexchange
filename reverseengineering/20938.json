When I try to run the binary with the proper static version of qemu, i get an error with FPU mode ex:</p>\n<pre><code> chroot . ./qemu-mips-static bin/busybox\n qemu: Unexpected FPU mode \n</code></pre>\n<p>I can't find anything on this error.  I have tried this on several different firmwares and i keep getting the same error. </p>\n<p>The OS is Kali linux with qemu-user-static installed and the qemu-mips-static static binary place in the root directory of the unpacked firmware.</p>\n</div>",

It seems to be specific to MIPS, you can find the structure <a href=\"https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/b98a66201dbc7cf3b962f4bb260f66100cc75578/include/elf.h#L101\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, this structure is stored inside a specific ELF segment, the code in charge to read it is <a href=\"https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/c4e0780ed1ffd056f205348d387a61b4136a45df/linux-user/elfload.c#L2431\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. I suggest you to make sure this segment is present and if it contains correct values. I think you can dump this information with <code>readelf(1)</code>.</p>\n</div>",
