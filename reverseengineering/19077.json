From my initial google searches, it's my understanding that an obb can be basically any type of file. The only lead I have is the magic bytes at the start of the file spell out \"AP_Pack!\", but I couldn't find any format matching it.</p>\n<p>This is where I'm currently stumped so any next steps would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n</div>",
