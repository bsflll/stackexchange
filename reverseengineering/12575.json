    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Good Evening,</p>\n<p>currently, I am struggling around with a problem of getting the parameters of the wsasend function. The only parameter where found out something is this one:</p>\n<p><code>mov qword ptr ss:[rsp+60],rsi</code></p>\n<p>This should be the something with count because it's between ~60 - ~3000 (pausing application ~60, !pausing application ~3000) Not after the functioned was called so this couldn't be the \"bytes send\" parameter.</p>\n<pre><code>mov rsi,qword ptr ss:[rsp+80]\nmov qword ptr ss:[rsp+28],rsi\n</code></pre>\n<p>These 2 lines are one parameter ? I guess because rsi gets a value which is than used one instruction later.</p>\n<p><em>Maybe someone can give me a hint on how to find the correct parameters.</em></p>\n<p>Before I have found this function I thought parameters are only passed to a function via push but after some research, I have found out that this is compiler dependend and I find it difficult to find the parameters.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ILF3B.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ILF3B.png\"/></a></p>\n<pre><code>int WSASend(\n  __in   SOCKET s,\n  __in   LPWSABUF lpBuffers,\n  __in   DWORD dwBufferCount,\n  __out  LPDWORD lpNumberOfBytesSent,\n  __in   DWORD dwFlags,\n  __in   LPWSAOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped,\n  __in   LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE lpCompletionRoutine\n);\n</code></pre>\n</div>",

The rest of the arguments are pushed on the stack.</p>\n<p>This is <em>not</em> compiler dependent, every compiler that produces calls to windows functions has to adhere to this convention. (It is OS dependent though, the convention for Linux is different)</p>\n<p>If you want to learn more, google for <code>x64 ABI</code> (ABI is for Application Binary Interface).</p>\n</div>",

I also didn't now about different convention between x32 and x64. Thanks !</span>",
