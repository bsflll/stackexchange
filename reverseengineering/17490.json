If you run Linux, there may already be a precompiled package available for your distro.</p>\n<p>For 2, there <em>are</em> some decompilers which can produce C pseudocode from x86-64 binaries. Alternatively, tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/trailofbits/mcsema\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">McSema</a> can perform <em>lifting</em> to LLVM bitcode which can then be recompiled to PPC (in theory).</p>\n</div>",

However, is there software that actually \"translates\" the binary itself to run natively on PPC? Also, sorry I didn't state this in the answer, but McSema uses commercial software, which I can't use. Are there any alternatives to this? Thanks again!</span>",
