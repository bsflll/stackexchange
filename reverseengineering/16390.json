In order to do that I tried to use QEMU.  </p>\n<p>Sadly, no matter what, I'm getting a system crash.<br/>\nI started with:</p>\n<pre><code>$ qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a9 -hda R8300-V1.0.2.100_1.0.82.chk \nWarning: Orphaned drive without device: id=scsi0-hd0,file=R8300-V1.0.2.100_1.0.82.chk,if=scsi,bus=0,unit=0\nqemu: fatal: Trying to execute code outside RAM or ROM at 0x04000000\n</code></pre>\n<p>As far as I can understand QEMU has a driver but he doesn't know what do to with that.\nSo I tried to specify more params manually:</p>\n<pre><code>qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a9 \\\n   -drive file=R8300-V1.0.2.100_1.0.82.chk,format=raw \\\n   -device scsi-hd,id=scsi0-hd0\n\nqemu-system-arm: -device scsi-hd,id=scsi0-hd0: No 'SCSI' bus found for device 'scsi-hd'\n</code></pre>\n<p>I tried to play with some different device type, but it seems that I can't find the correct bus.<br/>\nI even tried to split the image into different pieces (kernel and filesystem), but I still got a crash.</p>\n<p>I'm pretty new to reverse engineering, can I have some hints or suggestions on what should I do to boot my firmware image?</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>. \nPlaying a little with the command I was able to get a different error message:</p>\n<pre><code>$ qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a9 -cpu cortex-a9 \\\n   -redir tcp:8888::80 -m 512 \\\n   -drive file=R8300V1.0.2.100_1.0.82.chk,format=raw \\\n   -device scsi id=scsi0-hd0,if=ide-hd\n\nqemu-system-arm: -device scsi: drive with bus=0, unit=0 (index=0) exists  \n</code></pre>\n<p>I tried to specify a different bus, unit and index, but the error is still the same</p>\n</div>",

Instead, try to run a single target binary with <code>qemu-system-arm -E PATH=\"/bin:/usr/bin\" -E OTHERENVVARS=foo -g 10000 ./myTargetBinary</code>.</p>\n<p>See slides 27+ in my presentation <a href=\"https://files.sans.org/summit/hackfest2015/PDFs/IoT-Devices-Fall-Like-Backward-Capacitors-Or-the-Month-Josh-Was-Forced-to-Wear-Pants-Josh-Wright.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://files.sans.org/summit/hackfest2015/PDFs/IoT-Devices-Fall-Like-Backward-Capacitors-Or-the-Month-Josh-Was-Forced-to-Wear-Pants-Josh-Wright.pdf</a>. You may need to setup the appropriate <code>chroot</code> for the necessary libraries in <code>myTargetBinary</code>. Often, errors in running a binary requires more analysis to identify missing conf files, necessary environment variables, specific hardware access, etc., requiring some preliminary static disassembly prior to runtime analysis.</p>\n</div>",
