But according to HexRay's command line switches for IDA Pro, there is supposed to be an .exe for command line interface. I'm not sure if it's just because I am using the free version. </p>\n</div>",

Some of the switches (like <code>-A</code>, <code>-T</code>, <code>-L</code>) also work, but for example <code>-B</code> and <code>-S</code> are disabled.</p>\n<p>If you want the text-mode <code>idat</code> executable, you need the full version (Pro or Starter).</p>\n</div>",
