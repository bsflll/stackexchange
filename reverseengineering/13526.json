WinDbg is setup correctly, windbg attaches a process just fine on itself. WinDbg has been added to the PATH variable.</p>\n<p>When i try to launch debugging from ida PRO,or attach I get the error:</p>\n<p>\"Could not initialize WinDgbEngine (..) %1 is not a valid Win32 application\"</p>\n<p>ideas? seems like something is wrong with parameters passing?</p>\n</div>",

I don't remember the exact details but opening .dmp files directly with WinDbg required setting up the shell extension registry key somewhat differently. Can you open a .dmp file by double clicking it? If not, you could research that and that might also solve your issue.</span>",

It only happens if you try to double click a dump file without having the correct permissions. I know it's pretty basic, but always run IDA Pro or WinDBG as administrator and that message should not appear.  </p>\n</div>",
