You forgot to mention how you decompiled and modified the APK - please include the commands for decompiling, recompiling, signing and so on. When an app crashed it usually prints errors on <code>adb logcat</code> look at it to understand what is going wrong. Also check the code for code that checks the app signature and integrity. May be the crash is performed intentionally because the signature is wrong? Jadx decompile errors are common, that is nothing unusual some byte code is extremely difficult to recompile to Java language.</span>",

As listed on the jadx Github page \" Please note that in most cases jadx can't decompile all 100% of the code, so errors will occur\" <a href=\"https://github.com/skylot/jadx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">github.com/skylot/jadx</a> you could check their troubleshooting guide for specific issues, but I wouldn't get your hopes up too much.</span>",
