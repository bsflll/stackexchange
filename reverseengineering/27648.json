However I can't seem to solve it, despite double checking everything and investing multiple hours.</p>\n<p>My task is to reverse engineer the following functions to high-level C-code and determine the return value of <code>f(1,2,3)</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Given Task:</strong>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Aunk6.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Task image\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Aunk6.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>This is my approach:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2P3uy.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"My approach image\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2P3uy.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>\n<p><code>f(1,2,3)</code> can not be determined, because line 6 in <code>function f</code> results in a jump to <code>loc_56C</code>, where <code>g(2,3)</code> is called. In line 14 <code>push dword ptr [ebp+0Ch]</code> is used, however only 2 parameter are supplied for <code>function g</code> at line 16 (8 Byte), meaning we do not know what lies on that memory location (12 Byte above base pointer). As a result, the return value can not be determined.</p>\n<p>Is it true, that <code>f(1,2,3)</code> can not be determined?</p>\n</div>",
