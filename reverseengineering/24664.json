I want to get objdump like disassembled input. <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity16/sec16_paper_andriesse.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This</a> paper says that they used cfgfast for their analysis. So, I checked that class, but couldn't find particular methods to print the assembly. For e.g. in radare2, I can do -</p>\n<pre><code>r2.cmd('aaa')\nr2.cmd(f'pd $s &gt; {filename+\"_radare.txt\"}')\n</code></pre>\n<p>to get the disassembly after analysis.</p>\n</div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>In angr, there are multiple ways to print out what you want. You can reference functions or basic blocks. All you need to print out disassembly is an address:</p>\n<pre><code>import angr\np = angr.Project(\"/bin/true\",auto_load_libs=False)\nblock = p.factory.block(p.entry)\nblock.pp()\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, I load the <code>true</code> binary, excluding its dynamic libraries, and I ask it for the disassembly at the entry address of the binary. The <code>pp</code> function stands for pretty print, and it will allow you to print assembly in a pretty format. </p>\n<p>Now getting every disassembled address in a linear format, like objdump, is much more hacky in angr. It would be much more advisable to use <a href=\"https://github.com/angr/angr-management\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">angr-management</a> and copy the linear disassembly from the GUI, but for the sake of this question, here is a hacky script to get every basic blocks disassembly:</p>\n<pre><code>import angr\np = angr.Project(\"/bin/true\",auto_load_libs=False)\ncfg = p.analyses.CFGFast()\ncfg.normalize()\nfor func_node in cfg.functions.values():\n    if func_node.name.startswith(\"__\"):\n        continue\n    else:\n        for block in func_node.blocks:             \n            block.pp() \n</code></pre>\n<p>It is important to note that the disassembly may not be in order, though it will specify it's address -- this is because we disassemble in the order angr discovers functions. </p>\n</div>",

May I ask why? angr is not particularly better at producing linear assembly as opposed to objdump. If you want a more CFG feel, try angr-managment (which will get you all the assembly plus decompliation).</span>",
