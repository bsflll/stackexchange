    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'd like to mark some data as being an enum, and have that automatically propagate to all uses of this piece of data. Both direct accesses to the data (e.g. <code>cmp data_with_enum_type, enum_value</code>), and future use by any register it is copied into (e.g. <code>mov al, data_with_enum_type | cmp al, enum_value</code>).</p>\n<p>Is this possible in IDA, or something that could be straightforwardly scripted, or something an existing plugin may handle?</p>\n</div>",
