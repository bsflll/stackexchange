    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have bought a USB frame grabber (<a href=\"http://www.hauppauge.co.uk/site/products/data_hvr1900.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Hauppauge WinTV HVR 1900</strong></a>) for a personal research project. A SDK exists, but unfortunately the company does not seem too keen on distributing it. I have to extract frames from a video stream in my software, and although it works perfectly with my webcam stream, it does not work with the frame grabber (that works perfectly with the bundled soft).</p>\n<p><strong>The frame grabber has an integrated MPEG-2 encoder, so the output stream should be MPEG-2</strong>, but since it does not work, I guess it is not standard. VLC is able to read the stream, though. <strong>Since it seems I will have to reverse engineer to get my soft to read the output stream, and as I have never done that kind of thing, could someone please give me a hint on how to proceed about that?</strong> I mostly have experience with the python language.</p>\n</div>",

You can debug the data-flow through VLC to see how VLC handles the format, allowing you to understand the format itself.</span>",
