    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm using IDA 6.1 32-bit version.</p>\n<p>I'm pretty new to IDA and Hex-rays decompiling. My goal is to generate some C source from a 32-bit PE executable. I know this file is 32-bit PE executable. I've looked at the header struct in a hex editor and confirmed that it has the PE header segment. When I dissassemble the file in IDA Pro, it recognizes that it is an x86 PE executable file.</p>\n<p>Further, IDA produces the following output after analyzing the header segment:</p>\n<pre><code>; Format      : Portable executable for 80386 (PE)\n; Imagebase   : 400000\n; Section 1. (virtual address 00001000)\n; Virtual size                  : 011DAC9D (18721949.)\n; Section size in file          : 011DB000 (18722816.)\n; Offset to raw data for section: 00001000\n; Flags 60000020: Text Executable Readable\n; Alignment     : default\n; OS type         :  MS Windows\n; Application type:  Executable 32bit\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, when I select a function and attempt <kbd>F5</kbd> to open the Pseudocode window, I am greeted with the unhelpful message:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Decompilation failure: FFFFFFFF: 16bit functions are not supported</p>\n<p>Please refer to the manual to find appropriate actions</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, I <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/decompiler/manual/failures.shtml#10\" rel=\"nofollow\">referred to the manual</a>, which is also unhelpful:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The message text says it all. While the decompiler itself can be fine\n  tuned to decompile 16-bit code, this is not a priority for now. May be\n  in the future it will support 16-bit code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The thing is that this isn't 16-bit code. What am I doing wrong?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>PS If I need to provide more information to help in answering this question, please let me know. I'm very new to IDA/Hex-rays and I'm not sure what else would be useful here.</em></p>\n</div>",
