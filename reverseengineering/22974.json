    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to get the disassembly of a very small binary file available <a href=\"https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsYP2RqBWCWrokQmsi4oN2igDK2m?e=fnrfXV\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. This file is cropped from part of another executable binary. </p>\n<p>When I open it with <code>r2</code> it automatically recognizes the architecture and can provide me with the diassembly: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZMnUy.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZMnUy.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>With Ghidra however, it cannot find the architecture automatically and I have to manually specify the language: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KTrmH.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KTrmH.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Even then, I'm getting the following as the disassembly:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uq58V.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uq58V.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I'm very surprised by how poor NSA's Ghidra is performing in such scenario compared to the open source radare2. Can someone describe what's going on and how can I fix it? </p>\n</div>",

They could try to analyze the bytes to detect if there's code, data or something else but you might also get some false-positives.</p>\n<p>In your case, you instruct <code>r2</code> to display those bytes as code (<code>pd - print disassembly</code>) and it does not recognize any architecture as it has x86 by default. You would get the same when you open no file (<code>r2 -</code> and then <code>e asm.arch</code>)</p>\n<p>In Ghidra you selected the architecture manually and to \"force\" the tool to do the same as your <code>pd</code> in radare2 just press <kbd>D</kbd>.</p>\n</div>",
