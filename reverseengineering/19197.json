However, there's still the random switches and strange ints everywhere. Can de4dot decode this? If not, is there another tool that can?\nI've opened it with dotPeek and dnSpy as well to the same result.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hastebin.com/uwulipuyit.cs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here's an example.</a> Most of the logic I need is in chains of these tasks. O6.K does not even exist.</p>\n</div>",
