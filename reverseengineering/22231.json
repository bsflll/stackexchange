I understand that one of the drawbacks of OS emulated sandboxes is that the malware can use uncommon API calls to crash the emulator/sandboxes. Does anyone know of such samples? It would be great if different samples asking for different APIs could be supplied.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n</div>",

If you take a look at what Sandboxie does, on top of their driver they also have a huge number of ring3 hooks on WinAPI. There are also lots of other things to check for, even as simple as their module being loaded. Point being that I don't think an individual example will really do much good because there are so many countless ways to detect it. The same goes for other sandbox emulation, VM's, etc.</p>\n</div>",
