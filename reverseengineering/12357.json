Performing a full dump of the process from memory and loading this new binary into IDA will indeed show you those new parts. The data has to come from somewhere though (ressource, compressed, encrypted, another file, Internet, etc).</p>\n<p>As you mentioning that the binary appears to be neither packed nor obfuscated, be sure to check you're not just into one of the loaded DLL of your binary (reversing one of the imported DLL might not be what you're willing to do?).</p>\n</div>",
