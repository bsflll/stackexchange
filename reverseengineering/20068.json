    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I updated a device over a firmware update software and sniffed the whole traffic with wireshark. There is a TCP Stream with ~30MB which I exported as raw data. The resulting file is <code>Zip archived data</code> but it has a CRC error when I try to extract it with binwalk/7zip.</p>\n<p>I also tried to export as hex dump and make <code>xxd -r -p dump outfile</code>.</p>\n<p>In the pcap file are many <code>TCP DUP ACK</code> and <code>TCP Out-Of-Order</code> packets. \nI wonder if the exported binary takes over these dupes or out-of-order stuff.</p>\n<p>I also tried <code>chaosreader -r dump.pcap</code> still corrupt.</p>\n<p>Extracting the .exe with 7zip failed also with checksum error.</p>\n<p>Any of you have any idea what I'm doing wrong?</p>\n</div>",
