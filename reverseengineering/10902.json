I would like to step through the APK instruction by instruction, and possibly set breakpoints on certain APIs or certain smali instructions.</p>\n<p>I've tried decompiling with apktool, loading into netbeans, and the connecting to the emulator, and I've also tried using IDA Pro, but I always get errors along the lines of \"JDWP error: Connection reset by peer\". I've tried with both the default Android emulator and Genymotion with Android 5.0.1.</p>\n<p>Has anyone had any success with this? Could you describe your setup and tools that you used?</p>\n</div>",
