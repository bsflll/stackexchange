I'm a complete newbie in reverse engineering so it's hard for me to learn how it works only using assembly code. I found out, there are a lot of original function names left in the dump:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7WfBE.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7WfBE.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Is it possible to get C code with original function names from this? I don't have Hex Rays decompiler tho.</p>\n</div>",

The code itself is still machine language and there's no way to directly translate that back into the original. Your best option is a decompiler like Hex-Rays, but that will still only give an approximation.</p>\n</div>",
