Apparently you can only change something if you have the original project.\nThe file contains pictures that I would like to change. \nI know that it has to work, because someone has already done it, but doesn't want to reveal the secret :)\nHere is the file I want to customize.\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Z-RCdVGJv_jkKHcL3o_saOZz8sluMMG1?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Z-RCdVGJv_jkKHcL3o_saOZz8sluMMG1?usp=sharing</a>\nIn the file is a Chinese and an English flag (as .png) which I would like to change / swap.</p>\n</div>",

Do a byte search for the start of the original PNG in the kzb file. Then you can overwrite the succeeding bytes with the modified PNG. However before that you need to ensure that both the original and modified PNG's are of the same size or you would overwrite other data.</span>",
