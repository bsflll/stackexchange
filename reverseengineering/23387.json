Do you have prints in the hkItemPos() or anything to verify?   Does the offset value make sense for the binary? That looks like a very very common search string I would guess you're hooking something else and when that gets called you crash</span>",

I have cut the search string so that the code was not very extensive. But definitely yes, it hooks to the right function.</span>",
