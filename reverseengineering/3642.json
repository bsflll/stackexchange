One thing to note is that memory references through indirect memory addressing (pointers) won't be tracked explicitly in IDA (or any publicly-available reverse engineering tool).  I.e., to know what memory is being read or written to by a <code>char **</code> type, you have to know where it points.  Another example is accessing an array of structures.  This often happens in a loop, where some base pointer or index variable is updated for each iteration, and will not leave direct memory references to the individual array elements.</span>",
