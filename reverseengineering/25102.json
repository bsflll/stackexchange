    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Is it possible to remotely debug IDAPyhton scripts using VSCode and ptvsd? I found a few tutorials on the net, but no one is working. In the past, using the same protocol I was able to connect to Maya from VSCode and to remotely debug Pymel scripts. So, from IDA python console I entered:</p>\n<pre><code>ptvsd.enable_attach(address=('localhost', 5678), redirect_output=True)\n</code></pre>\n<p>and eventually:</p>\n<pre><code>ptvsd.wait_for_attach(60)\n</code></pre>\n<p>A Python MsgBox appears telling a script is running... Now in VSCode I started the script to be debugged using the standard json configuration file for attaching to a remote debugger, but the connection is always refused.\nI tried to change the port (3528, 3000), the address (0.0.0.0) and to remove the redirect_output flag. No matter what, I wasn't able to connect. I tried also:</p>\n<pre><code>ptvsd.break_into_debugger()\n</code></pre>\n<p>But again, no luck.</p>\n<p>As a second question, is there a way to make the import statement recognize IDAPython modules (idaapi, idc, idc_bytes and so on) or to use autocompletion? I know IDAPython is bundled with IDA and not installed in site-packages, but I wonder if is there a solution (not to execute the script outside of IDA, but to have the modules and keywords recognized).</p>\n</div>",
