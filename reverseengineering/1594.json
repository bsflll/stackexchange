If you are unsure, you can check whether the cryptid bit is set with otool (see <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7038143/executable-encryption-check-anti-piracy-measure\">this page</a>).</p>\n<pre><code>otool -arch armv7 -l thebinary | grep crypt\n</code></pre>\n<p>(where thebinary is the executable binary - see the app's Info.plist, CFBundleExecutable key)</p>\n<p><strong>Pre Decryption:</strong></p>\n<p>if cryptid is 0, you can proceed on to the <em>Post Decryption</em> section. Otherwise, you will need to decrypt the app. The typical method in brief (with a jailbroken iOS device) is to</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install otool, gdb and ldid from Cydia</li>\n<li>Install the IPA on an <em>authorized</em> device</li>\n<li>Run otool on the binary to get information such as the size of the encrypted payload</li>\n<li>Launch the app and suspend it immediately</li>\n<li>Use gdb to dump the payload (beginning from 0x2000) <code>gdb -p &lt;process id&gt;</code> then <code>dump output.bin 0x2000 0xNNNN</code> where NNNN is the sum of the beginning (0x2000) and the payload size</li>\n<li>Create a new file, using the first 0x1000 bytes of the original binary, and appended with the dump file</li>\n<li>Use ldid to sign the new binary, and change the cryptid to 0 (so that iOS won't decrypt the decrypted app again)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are many tools of dubious purposes (piracy) which automates the process, however the above is the gist of how the process is done.</p>\n<p><strong>Post Decryption:</strong></p>\n<p>You can begin reverse engineering the code when you have access to an unencrypted copy of the binary.</p>\n<p>One possible tool is IDA Pro (Free version does not support ARM).\nIt may still be quite messy since much of iOS's code works with objc_sendMsg(). This IDA plugin may help: <a href=\"https://github.com/zynamics/objc-helper-plugin-ida\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/zynamics/objc-helper-plugin-ida</a></p>\n<p>When you are patching functions, an easier way to work (if you know Objective-C) is to use MobileSubstrate to hook the relevant functions.
