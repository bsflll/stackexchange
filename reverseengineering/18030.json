In Visual Studio debugging memory, it shows <code>S_OK</code> with <code>CoCreateInstance()</code> and all the function pointers of that COM interface. I saw this <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2530/what-are-general-guide-lines-for-reversing-com-objects\">question</a> but that uses IDA to reverse a DLL.</p>\n<p>I've followed an <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070428122627/http://geekswithblogs.net:80/hdevos/archive/2004/03/15/2936.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a> which shows finding methods definition using Visual Studio debug mode. I've both CLSID and IID from which I get the interface pointer.</p>\n<p>So, my question is how can I find the (undocumented) function definitions? Is there any easy general guidelines to follow? It will be easy if someone show an procedure with Visual Studio, reversing with IDA is bit more complex.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> According to the answer I reverse the DLL in IDA but the assembly shows the</p>\n<pre><code>off_180002230   dq offset off_1800023D0 ; DATA XREF: .rdata:off_180002480↓o\n                dq offset ILxssUserSession\n                dq offset IUnknown_QueryInterface_Proxy\n                dq offset IUnknown_AddRef_Proxy\n                dq offset IUnknown_Release_Proxy\n                dq offset ObjectStublessClient3\n                dq offset ObjectStublessClient4\n                dq offset ObjectStublessClient5\n                dq offset ObjectStublessClient6\n                dq offset ObjectStublessClient7\n                dq offset ObjectStublessClient8\n                dq offset ObjectStublessClient9\n                dq offset ObjectStublessClient10\n                dq offset ObjectStublessClient11\n                dq offset ObjectStublessClient12\n                dq offset ObjectStublessClient13\n                dq offset ObjectStublessClient14\nunk_1800022B8   db  22h ; \"             ; DATA XREF: .rdata:0000000180002DE0↓o\n</code></pre>\n<p>How can I relate those offset to a real function pointer? The current DLL is a proxy stub DLL and the real function is implemented/defined in another DLL. I've also seen this <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2822/com-interface-methods\">question</a> which shows to follow function pointers.</p>\n</div>",

Due to COM methods are virtual methods of C++ class, you'll be able to find VTBL for each COM class, and from there determine how many methods it has. Then you reverse each method to understand how many arguments it has and which are the types of arguments.</p>\n</div>",

IDA may recognize the arguments count automatically, but the types of the arguments are up to you to reverse engineer.

Yes the first 3 methods in ppv are always QueryInterface, AddRef and Release due to all COM classes are derived from IUnknown. If the class is derived from IDispatch (which is derived from IUnknown), then there's going to be GetTypeInfoCount, GetTypeInfo, GetIDsOfNames and Invoke.
