For example:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;addr&gt;      301ac1da               invalid\n</code></pre>\n<p>Looking up the hex code, I found out this is the <a href=\"https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0596/2020-12/Base-Instructions/AUTDA--AUTDZA--Authenticate-Data-address--using-key-A-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">AUTDA</a> instruction. Seems like for some reason Cutter / rizin cannot parse this kind of instructions.</p>\n<p>I tried to write <code>pd</code> in the console directly, but it gave the same results.\nVersion info:</p>\n<pre><code>Version 2.1.2\nUsing rizin 0.4.1 (9023f8b)\nBased on Qt 5.15.5 (Clang 13.0 (Apple), 64 bit)\nOptional Features:\nPython: ON\nPython Bindings: ON\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is there a way to make Cutter recognize this instruction?</p>\n</div>",
