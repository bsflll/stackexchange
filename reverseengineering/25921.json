Works fine in Android emulator, not a problem to attach and check some methods calls with parameters.... but some methods are not detected, looks like protection hides them.\nInteresting, but all lua files are starting with \"16c652b86b5b0bc516920e6cd3c3a074\" (16 bites) prefix, but it's not a key for XXTEA algo.</p>\n</div>",
