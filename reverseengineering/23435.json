    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have an old water purifier system that consists of a PDA and a main board (I think the ic is a Renesas) that communicate by RS232, I need to know the protocol they use to communicate in order to reproduce it from another device. I already have it practically done, below I detail the characteristics that I have been able to extract:</p>\n<p><strong>Protocol details</strong></p>\n<p>RS232</p>\n<p>Endian: LSB</p>\n<p>Baud rate: 9600</p>\n<p>Data: 8 bits</p>\n<p>Stop bits: 1</p>\n<p>Parity: Odd</p>\n<p>Packet size: 21 Bytes</p>\n<p>Character start / stop: 90</p>\n<p>Polarity: Positive</p>\n<p>Time between two bytes: 6.8 mS</p>\n<p>Time between packets: 1.9 s</p>\n<p>second-last (byte 20): checksum (simple sum of all data bytes + 90)</p>\n<p><strong>Message format</strong></p>\n<p>PDA (TX): 90 + (18 * data_byte) + checksum + unknown_byte</p>\n<p>Mainboard (TX): 90 + (18 * data_byte) + checksum + 90 </p>\n<p>I also already have an idea what each byte of data corresponds to, but the last byte (unknown_byte), I don't know what it corresponds to, it varies constantly even though the data is the same.

I also think it must be some sequence, but I have extracted a long sequence of values ​​and I have tried to locate some pattern but I don't see it. I have tried to externally send the same signal as the PDA with the last byte with a fixed value of 90 and the mainboard responds with the data, the problem comes when I try to update some parameter on the main board, which does not work and must be where it enters I play the last byte</span>",

This makes me think random number generator, probably <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">LCG</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">XOR shifter</a>. In both cases the algorithm can be reverse engineered with enough data. And if it is an RNG it will <em>eventually</em> repeat.</p>\n<p>Interestingly except for the 05, all values are 230 plus something from 0 to 16 (inclusive!!) There could be a mod-17 going on somewhere.</p>\n<p>Seen another way, they are all within 238 +- 8.</p>\n<p>Why an RNG? Beats me. Theoretically you could work out how many packets have been sent since it was turned on by observing a sequence of them. A strange sort of sequence number.</p>\n<p>If you aren't always seeing the same sequence... could it be a time-delta (the time since the last reading?) to prevent clock drift or something. I don't know what the point would be, and it's strange that the same value never repeats twice in a row. But it might fit with the theory that it isn't known at checksum-time.</p>\n<p>Good luck...</p>\n</div>",
