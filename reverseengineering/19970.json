This question isn't really a good fit for Q&amp;A (as it elicits opinion-based responses), but I'll defer to the community on this one. However, it's a bit unclear also what you're after. Do you mean an OS that could, say, run a sandbox in which the malware gets analyzed? Do you mean simply a desktop system (Kali comes to mind) which comes with a lot of RCE and forensics tools? Could you please clarify?!</span>",
