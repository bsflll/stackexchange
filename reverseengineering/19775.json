The sensor can handle 100fps. Blackmagic only provides Max. 30fps. So there is more to it than offered by Blackmagic.</p>\n<p>The <code>*.bin</code> files can be found in the Blackmagic Camera Setup and only there. In all other versions the <code>*.bin</code> files are not to be found. It concerns the following files: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VBD7E-E-8eVjextm0Z2AjaX7u3NKRPEF/view\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VBD7E-E-8eVjextm0Z2AjaX7u3NKRPEF/view</a></p>\n<p>The FPGA chip is Spartan 6 from Xilinx</p>\n<p>Is it possible to extract the firmware, then modify it and pack it back as firmware?</p>\n<p>I hope for some tips.</p>\n</div>",
