Have you checked if all prior and post bytes match  apart from these 5 bytes...... .......if the address is correct in  both. And relocations are accounted for then the bytes MUST be same</span>",

If so, the bytes could be changed by IDA (and dos4gw when it loads application) according to fixup table. More info in documention for LE format, like here: <a href=\"http://www.edm2.com/index.php/LX_-_Linear_eXecutable_Module_Format_Description\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">edm2.com/index.php/â€¦</a></span>",

            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">I think, you should edit Fixups Record Table. For you task you probably should remove one entry from it.  As for you second IDA screenshots - did you created new IDA database after editing file in hex-editor? As long as I know IDA will not automatically reflect changes - it creates database and later works only with it, you can even delete source EXE file - no problem for IDA.</span>",
