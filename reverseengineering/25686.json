    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm reversing a malicious 32-bit x86 Windows executable. Statically reviewing PE headers in Ghidra, I see that <code>ImageBase</code> is set to <code>0x400000</code> as expected. However, when the binary is loaded into memory, the initial RVA does not match the <code>ImageBase</code> defined in the file. For example, I have seen the in-memory base address set to <code>0x4B0000</code> and <code>0x900000</code>. This behavior occurs on a clean VM, and when debugging with Immunity and x32dbg as well as IDA Free.</p>\n<p>My understanding is that the Windows loader reads <code>ImageBase</code> and uses that offset to begin mapping sections into virtual address space. Because system code handles loading, and my system is clean upon first execution, my assumption is that the unusual <code>ImageBase</code> is a symptom of a loader nuance rather than tampering. I've never encountered this scenario and would appreciate any insights.</p>\n<p>MD5:  <code>1f63d04ee95ea041f2f6b1e818d94a7c</code></p>\n<p>SHA1: <code>823ad6abb05f2393c44cf4b7f1d00e32ac04d1d1</code></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><code>ImageBase</code> set to <code>0x400000</code> when viewing PE headers in Ghidra:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iLnaq.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"ImageBase set to 0x400000\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iLnaq.png\"/></a></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><code>ImageBase</code> in memory-mapped PE header (<code>0x4B0000</code>) does not match <code>ImageBase</code> set in static file:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vnAsT.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"PE header dump\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vnAsT.png\"/></a></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>PE sections mapped into memory with <code>ImageBase</code> at <code>0x4B0000</code></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YwnNp.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"PE sections mapped into memory\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YwnNp.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

After disabling ASLR on a fresh Windows 10 VM and restarting, I continued to see a non-<code>0x400000</code> <code>ImageBase</code> when loading the binary into various debuggers. I note this here only to rule out ASLR as the cause of the RVA randomization in this particular case.</span>",

In all builds later than that one, the switches that say they disable ASLR have no effect.  Also, in each disassembler: Ghidra, IDA, Binary Ninja etc, there is a setting to rebase the database to match the base address in memory. This can alleviate some of the pain.</span>",
