You first need to enable Developer Settings (if you have not done so already), then enable “Enable Bluetooth HCI snoop log”.</p>\n<p>I have not tried this myself yet, but according to the information I could find:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Communication should be logged to a file called <code>/sdcard/btsnoop_hci.log</code>.</li>\n<li>If your external storage dir is something else than <code>/sdcard</code>, modify the path accordingly.</li>\n<li>Some flavors of Android may use an entirely different path. Look for the <code>FileName</code> parameter in <code>/etc/bluetooth/bt_stack.conf</code> to find the correct path. (Some flavors of Android may put this file in <code>/system/etc</code> or <code>/vendor/etc</code>.)</li>\n<li>On some flavors of Android (including Android x86_64 CM 14.1), none of the above will work but you will find the log in <code>/data/misc/bluetooth/logs/btsnoop_hci.log</code> (you need to have root permissions to get the file).</li>\n<li>The resulting file can then be analyzed with Wireshark or similar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To get Bluetooth from an Android VM running on VirtualBox:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are on Linux (tried on Ubuntu 18.04):\n\n<ul>\n<li>Add yourself to the <code>vboxusers</code> group, e.g. by running <code>sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers your_user_name</code></li>\n<li>Log out and back in for the new group membership to take effect.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Start your Android VM.</li>\n<li>In Devices &gt; USB Devices, connect the Bluetooth adapter to the VM. It may have an inconspicuous name (mine is just called Intel [0001]).</li>\n<li>Optionally, add a USB filter to have the VM grab the BT device automatically whenever it starts.</li>\n<li>Be aware that the host system will lose access to the BT adapter while it is in use by the VM. If you have a BT mouse or keyboard, either replace it with a wired one, or get an additional BT adapter and use that for your VM.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In practice, however, I was unable to get a reliable Bluetooth connection from the Android VM. I can scan for devices and managed to pair the BT device (though that took multiple attempts), but I never managed to connect to the device. I suspect that is because Android is quite resource-hungry, and the overhead of virtualization along with a restriction to 2 out of 4 processor cores (which I have set this way to keep VMs from hogging my entire CPU) does not leave enough room for Android to run smoothly. Will need to retry with Android x86_64 on a USB stick, running on physical hardware.</p>\n</div>",
