    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a qemu instance running a custom Linux distribution, within which I'd like to debug an (already running) application. I have already embedded a <code>gdbserver</code> inside (and have a root shell available), so I can start it with <code>--attach &lt;pid&gt;</code>. I also have extracted and analyzed the binary I am interested in and have an <code>.idb</code> file for it. However, when I connect to the remote GDB through IDA (via <code>Debugger &gt; Attach to process</code>, and then selecting <code>0 - the running process</code>), it completely ignores everything in the database. No functions, no comments, nothing. ASLR is disabled, but if somehow still needed, I can provide <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps</code>. The question is, how do I inform IDA that the app it's looking at is the same as the database?</p>\n<p>If it matters, I'm running IDA Pro 7.5 on Windows</p>\n</div>",
