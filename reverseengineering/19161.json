My goal here is learning the most possible generic method to jump onto routines triggered by non standard buttons (created by any kind of UI framework).</p>\n<p>In order to ilustrate my concern I've created a dummy <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/g2oq37jz1p8vhwj/crackme1.exe?dl=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">crackme</a> - (in a range 0-10 I'd say level -1 :))</p>\n<p>For this exercise to be really useful let's assume:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The \"crackme\" doesn't contain any hardcoded serial you can use</li>\n<li>The \"crackme\" doesn't contain any activation message you can use to inspect the code around</li>\n<li>BMSG such as WM_PARAM/WM_LBUTTONUP, BT_CLICK won't do it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've created this little mcve to ilustrate better my real concern, on the real-world case I'm working on I'd like to read the routine triggered by a button from the beginning to end in order to decode the algorithm used.</p>\n<p>So yeah, the question would be, what are the methods to deal with this particular problem?</p>\n</div>",

I describe what could be done to find the button handler. There is probably no \"generic\" standard procedure working in all similar cases.</p>\n<p>However, although this is a special case, I assumed normal \"generic\" windows message behaviour. In that case I can expect somewhere a <code>WM_LBUTTONX</code> message, X being <code>UP</code> or <code>DOWN</code>, with values <code>0x201</code> or <code>0x202</code>. Thus I searched statically for the value <code>200h</code> in Ida, this being the start  of the \"Mouse group\" in the Windows <code>WM_</code> messages set. </p>\n<p>There are a number of locations found where a compare is made with <code>0x200</code>. On these I set a breakpoint. Two of these are hit on mouseclicks, and one of them investigates explicitely <code>0x201 (WM_LBUTTONDOWN)</code> and <code>0x202 (WM_LBUTTONUP)</code>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9Qqkr.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9Qqkr.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>If you step futher down the <code>WM_LBUTTONUP</code> path you come directly to the following location, with a call to <code>f_someMsgHandler</code> (as I called it):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/i0D6J.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/i0D6J.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>This function is called on several occasions, but the one corresponding to the mouse event is easily found, e.g. by setting a selective breakpoint. In this function, the following location leads directly to the handler of <code>WM_LBUTTONUP</code> of the \"Register\" button, being located at address <code>0x4fead0</code> (that address unfortunately hidden in the tooltip):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qHu5l.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qHu5l.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>To solve the crackme, it would possibly be easier to look for something like \"GetWindowText\".</p>\n<p>This shows, that in contrast to the OP's remark, it is very well possible to follow the trace of the standard windows mouse messages in order to find the proper handler.</p>\n</div>",
