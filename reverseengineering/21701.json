    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm new with frida and came to this problem.</p>\n<p>I have dll that I want to reverse engeneer(there are no debug symbols). Specifically I want to dump some data from a function. So I have this big function and here is the fragment of it:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Nty3s.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Nty3s.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Here you can see that some string(<code>pf4</code>) is moved to <code>edx</code>, but more important thing comes after that. You can see that <code>sub_575FD30</code>\nfunction is called couple of times. </p>\n<p>The most interesting thing for me is the <code>eax</code> register after the call. So what I want to do is to dump value of <code>eax</code> after the call of this function.</p>\n<p>I can't consider dumping something from <code>sub_575FD30</code> function because that function is called from many other places and I specifically want to dump <code>eax</code> after calling it in this specific example.</p>\n<p>My question is how can I acheive it using frida? Should I hardcode the instruction address(address of <code>push eax</code>) and get value of <code>eax</code>? Is it the correct way or is there some better way to achieve it? Any direction of how to achieve it and script example would be appriciated.</p>\n</div>",
