Ahead of time, you can scan the memory range you're interested in, then set a software breakpoint on all those particular spots. You can use the 'findall' or 'findasm' scripting command to add a breakpoint, or take some other action for each of those addresses.\nThere's also a tracing feature that single-steps through the execution. It'll be slower since you're breaking constantly. You can log and filter on that trace.</p>\n</div>",
