    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to reverse a qdsp6 modem file but I'm stuck with the (probably) compressed segments.</p>\n<p>There is also a third compressed segment which simply uses zlib but the other two are not recognized by binwalk. I also compared the header to the compressed segments of a Pixel 2 modem firmware. Pixel 2 uses q6zip and delta (as mentioned <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2021/security-probe-of-qualcomm-msm/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and maybe <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/16330/need-help-disassembling-qualcomm-qdsp6\">here</a>), but not even the first bytes of those segments match.</p>\n<p>Also searched for both segments offsets in the binary, but they can't be found as immediate. So simply looking for them to find the decompression function isn't possible.</p>\n<p>The entropy of them looks like that:</p>\n<p><strong>modem.b26</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KN5zl.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KN5zl.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Binwalk mentions parity information, but it is in the area of high entropy. So maybe it is a false positive?:</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; binwalk modem.b26\n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n25953729      0x18C05C1       MPEG transport stream data\n29114525      0x1BC409D       PARity archive data - file number 16432\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first few bytes are:</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; xxd -c 16 modem.b26  | head -n 3\n00000000: 3c9b 9ed4 bb7b 281c 050f 8a9c d875 4130  &lt;....{(......uA0\n00000010: 801d 8619 2c17 8028 2ea1 bbee db57 0160  ....,..(.....W.`\n00000020: e17c 846c 2a18 14c8 2db0 20ae f952 0041  .|.l*...-. ..R.A\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>modem.b28</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jUVIj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jUVIj.png\"/></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Binwalk returns nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first few bytes are:</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; xxd -c 16 modem.b28  | head -n 3\n00000000: 1200 0000 4c00 59ce 3c11 59ce 3c22 59ce  ....L.Y.&lt;.Y.&lt;\"Y.\n00000010: 3c33 59ce 3c44 59ce 3855 59ce f465 59ce  &lt;3Y.&lt;DY.8UY..eY.\n00000020: bc76 59ce bc87 59ce bc98 59ce bca9 59ce  .vY...Y...Y...Y.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Do you have any idea how to proceed to decompress those segments?</p>\n</div>",
