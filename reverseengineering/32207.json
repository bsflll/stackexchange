Here's why:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Analyzing malware demands the skill to read and track its behavior.</li>\n<li>A significant portion of malware targets Windows and Linux on x86 systems, which underscores the importance of x86 assembly knowledge.</li>\n<li>Based on data from <a href=\"https://portal.av-atlas.org/malware\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">av-atlas</a> and other sources, the next major targets are Android and MacOS, emphasizing the need for ARM assembly knowledge.</li>\n<li>The importance of ARM assembly in this area is growing as the number of devices with ARM processors increases, presenting more potential targets for malware.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By learning x86 assembly, you address most of your assembly language related malware analysis requirements, with ARM assembly serving as a beneficial, and at times necessary, addition.</p>\n</div>",
