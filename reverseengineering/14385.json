Obviously, this is not enough to encode 64-bit addresses which AArch64 may need to process. So there's two options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>use 64-bit pointers placed in the constant pool near the instruction and load them with the  <code>LDR</code> instruction. This is doable but such pointers need to be updated (relocated) if the image is loaded at a non-default address. </p></li>\n<li><p>Use PC-relative addressing to load addresses at a fixed offset from the current location (PIC code). This is the more common approach but the offset is still limited by the instruction size. So ARM designers came up with a clever hack: use two instructions to allow for a much wider range. </p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The ADRP instruction loads the address of the 4KB <em>page</em> anywhere in the +/-4GB (33 bits) range of the current instruction (which takes 21 high bits of the offset). this is denoted by the <code>@PAGE</code> operator. \nthen, we can either use <code>LDR</code> or <code>STR</code> to read or write any address inside that page or <code>ADD</code> to to calculate the final address using the remaining 12 bits of the offset (denoted by<code>@PAGEOFF</code>). </p>\n<p>So basically you can consider those instruction pairs as if the last one directly accesses the final address of the location before the <code>@</code> and you can ignore the suffixes if you don't plan to reassemble the file. </p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34003338/llvm-arm64-assembly-getting-a-symbol-label-address\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34003338/llvm-arm64-assembly-getting-a-symbol-label-address</a></p>\n</div>",
