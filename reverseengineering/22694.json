I looked at the Windows FW Update App in dnSpy, then pulled the FW bin directly.</p>\n<p>FCC Parts List gets me R5F5631BCDFP#V0, which appears to be a Renesas Electronics 32-bit Microcontrollers - MCU RX631 1MB/128KB.</p>\n<p>The latest FW bin for this model is here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mediafire.com/file/vp2drmh7dvgjpfi/BCD325P2_V1_08_01.bin/file\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.mediafire.com/file/vp2drmh7dvgjpfi/BCD325P2_V1_08_01.bin/file</a></p>\n<p>The FW bin looks packed or obfuscated, there are no strings and binwalk shows nothing.</p>\n<p>Could someone point me in the right direction?</p>\n<p>I would really like to get this loaded into a disassembler.</p>\n</div>",
