    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a weird bug that causes this crap:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7bKJU.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e86b24be-f278-4a53-9719-c5319596a6a2?upload=true\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7bKJU.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>There are plenty of dumb \"solutions\" a-la \"turn it off and on\" but none of them work and/or relevant, the shell apps simply refuse to cache icon for Vivaldi. I confirmed it by checking cache data at:\n<code>%localappdata%\\Packages\\Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\\TempState\\</code>\nIt contains 3 binary files:</p>\n<pre><code>TileCache_125_3_PNGEncoded_Data.bin\nTileCache_125_3_PNGEncoded_Header.bin\nStartUnifiedTileModelCache.dat\n</code></pre>\n<p>For us, only <strong>TileCache_125_3_PNGEncoded_Data.bin</strong> and <strong>TileCache_125_3_PNGEncoded_Header.bin</strong> are relevant.</p>\n<h1>WHAT I KNOW</h1>\n<p><strong>[TileCache_125_3_PNGEncoded_Data.bin]</strong>\nContains raw binary PNG data in chunks, smallest chunk seems to be 1024b, padded with <code>0</code> if PNG data is smaller than chunk size. If PNG data is bigger than chunk size it is expanded by 2x i.e. becomes 2x by 1024 - 2048 and so on. Probably optimized for binary reading. Extracting all PNG data reveals it is missing <strong>exactly that one Vivaldi icon</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>[TileCache_125_3_PNGEncoded_Header.bin]</strong>\nThe layout is also fairly simple, first 40 bytes is some header/meta data, 4bytes integer at offset <code>12</code> describes amount of entries, in my case 18, but should be <strong>19</strong>. After the header, there are entries itself, 18 entries, each 112 bytes:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9EvEd.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9EvEd.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Highlighted in red are: <code>[offset]</code>, <code>[all chunks size]</code>, <code>[padding size]</code> and <code>[height]x[width]</code></p>\n<h1>WHAT I DONT KNOW</h1>\n<p>The data highlighted in blue is unknown to me, but I'm fairly sure it is somehow describes the relation between cache entry and the Start Menu tile. I assume some of them might be GUIDs, especially 16bytes long ones, but quick search for these guides in Registry resulted in nothing.</p>\n<p>Knowing how that relation works could help me to manually insert the entry and fix this shit.</p>\n<p>Or I could reinstall whole system like a buffon, yes.</p>\n</div>",
