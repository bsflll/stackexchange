Next attach to the suspended process using your debugger, and resume all threads.</p>\n<p>Some other way would be to edit the PE file and change the bytes at the entrypoint to <code>EB FE</code>.\nThis is an instruction that jumps to itself, i.e. it is an infinite loop. Next start the application normally. Now use a debugger to attach to it. Restore the original bytes at the entrypoint and resume the process.</p>\n</div>",
