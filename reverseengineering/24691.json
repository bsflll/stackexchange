They will automatically be linked, which means that your imports in your main binary are resolved and you can jump to the library code via the GUI when looking at an external function call in your main binary.</p>\n<p>I am not sure if this violates your \"not to open a new instance of IDA or add the library in a new tab inside Ghidra\" requirement, because this will open a new tab, in your Codebrowser's <code>Listing</code> window.</p>\n</div>",

With some scripting it shouldn't be that hard to automate searching for the library names in some path, adding the found ones, linking them like the <code>External Programs</code> window and then running <code>FixupELFExternalSymbolsScript</code></span>",
