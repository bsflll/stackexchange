    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have to write an <code>IDAPython</code> script and I came across many false positives in IDA's function/code/data recognition.</p>\n<p><strong>Case 1 - Invalid function's end (rpcrt4.dll):</strong></p>\n<p>In some DLLs (especially in rpcrt4.dll) IDA recognize indirect/dereference calls as function's end and then misidentifies the next instructions (IDA's <code>no-return</code> kernel analysis flag is of course disabled so it is not the problem). </p>\n<p>Example (the unknown data is a valid <code>jmp</code> instruction):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3LrFm.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3LrFm.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Case 2 - Data in <code>.text</code> section is identified as code (ExplorerFrame.dll):</strong></p>\n<p>Most of Microsoft's DLLs are compiled with data at the beginning of the <code>.text</code> section and IDA successfully identifies it as data. However, sometimes IDA fail to treat these <code>heads</code> as data and treats them like code (my guess is that it has something to do with the misidentified <code>ret</code> instruction).</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LVEvs.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LVEvs.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Case 3 - code <em>inside</em> a function is identified as <em>data</em> (mimeTools.dll)</strong>:</p>\n<p>This case is a little bit weird because I don't see any reason to make this mistake. As you can clearly see IDA identifies code as data <strong>inside</strong> the function (the misidentified code is a lea instruction).</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wOWCL.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wOWCL.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Case 4 - mixed misidentified code (igc32.dll):</strong></p>\n<p>No need to elaborate, in the following example it should be all code but it gets identified as data:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lE62S.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lE62S.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>And another example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FWEwn.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FWEwn.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>So obviously my question is: did anyone experience one of these problem's before and know a possible fix to some of these problems? I need a solution that don't involve human interaction and can be applied using an IDAPython script.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n</div>",

IDA has seen a consistent improvement in addressing such as similar issues throughout version updates.</p>\n<p>It is however unrealistic to find and properly address all such cases, so these issues are prominent and are usually addresses manually or in a semi-manual manner. I bet there are plenty of plugins and scripts similar to <a href=\"https://github.com/nihilus/IDA_Extrapass\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Extrapass</a> but perhaps better maintained. You're also encouraged to create one yourself, that addresses the issues you encounter.</p>\n</div>",

If time is not of the essence, you can use a disassembling-technique following all available paths (most likely based on an IR). It is not anywhere near performant, but the distinction between code and data as well as the resolving of indirect branches are a plus.</span>",

My intent is to write a script that improve the recognition, I know that I won't be able to get 100% success.My question's purpose was to ask the fellows around if they experienced these issues and have an answer for some of them - that's why I asked \"did anyone experience one of these problem's before and know a possible fix to some of these problems\".</span>",
