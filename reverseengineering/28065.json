    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So I recently bought a new laptop (Acer Aspire A315-57g) on which I found that the cooling solution wasn't optimal, and I decided that I want more RPMs from my fan. However, I wasn't able to find a working software that is able to max it out.</p>\n<p>So I have IDA on my disposal, I have Win32, C, C++, x86/-64 asm knowledge - Visual Studio 2022 Preview with C++ workload installed - where do I begin?</p>\n<p>I tried numeral hacks (involving installing Acer gaming laptop tuning tool Predator control or something with simple WMI spoof), enabling \"Cool Boost\" in the registry for Quick Access, I tried Fan Control app from GitHub with different configs. Nothing budged though - the best I got is the rpm meter (in the Acer Predator control).</p>\n</div>",

I wouldn't hack anything here since you might kill your inbuilt fans or something more expensive. I'd buy a laptop stand, perhaps one that comes with fans or one where you can install some yourself. They improve airflow by themselves, too</span>",
