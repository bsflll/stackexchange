I'd like to try to follow what Miller <a href=\"http://fuzzinginfo.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/cmiller-csw-2010.pdf\">did</a> by downloading a bunch of benign PDFs and mutate them.  </p>\n<p>Miller began by reducing his corpus of PDF samples to a minimum by pruning samples that had similar code coverage.</p>\n<p>How is that specific step done?  That is, how did he determine what was a similar code coverage? </p>\n<p>I can imagine a tool that traces execution and records JMP/CALLs to get an execution graph, and I suppose you could diff those graphs.  But what about JIT code?  Wouldn't those graphs be very different since the JIT would likely be in different locations in memory?</p>\n</div>",

It will then find the least number of files needed to cover the most code. This will be the minimum set of files that should be used when fuzzing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But as far as I can see it uses the method you proposed, monitoring hits of all basic blocks of the application. It uses a pintool to do this. </p>\n</div>",

It however requires compiling your program with the <code>-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage</code> flags, which may not be an option if targeting closed source software.
