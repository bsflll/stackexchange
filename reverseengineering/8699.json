Up till now I've only done patching replacing existing code, not trying to insert additional code.</p>\n<p>Original</p>\n<pre><code>.text:000000018000A260                 cmp     [rax], r12d &lt;- RAX=0, crashes program\n.text:000000018000A263                 jz      short loc_18000A271\n.text:000000018000A265                 cmp     dword ptr [rax], 6\n.text:000000018000A268                 jnz     short loc_18000A276\n.text:000000018000A26A                 cmp     ecx, 40h\n</code></pre>\n<p>And further on:</p>\n<pre><code>.text:000000018000A21B                 mov     rcx, [rsp+388h+var_350]\n.text:000000018000A220                 call    cs:WindowsDeleteString\n.text:000000018000A226                 mov     [rsp+388h+var_350], r15\n.text:000000018000A22B                 mov     rbx, [rsp+388h+var_348]\n</code></pre>\n<p>I want to insert some new instruction, changing to jmp to patched code</p>\n<pre><code>.text:000000018000A260                 jmp     &lt;patched code&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Patched Code Idea - I can't find much suitable place to insert code - so was thinking of shortening some non-essential strings in .rdata section to insert this code - Is there any issue with this? Essentially what I am trying to do is if RAX = 0 , skip over the use of [rax]</p>\n<pre><code>cmp rax,0\njz .text:000000018000A21B ; The code point past using [rax]\ncmp [rax], r12d\njmp .text:000000018000A263 ; Continue program execution normally\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now it seems IDA \"Assemble\" doesn't always work, for example cmp rax,0 it says \"Invalid Operand\" So I had to patch bytes instead</p>\n<pre><code>48 83 F8 00 = cmp rax,0\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is there a way to get the \"assemble\" in IDA to reference my jump locations, using the location references in IDA. Or is there a suggested method to calculate how to build my jmp/jz instructions.</p>\n</div>",

If you ignore this you will trigger DEP and changing the segment to allow code executions is obviously not recommended as well.</p>\n<p>I would suggest to add a segment, extend the current segment or find some empty space in the current segment (maybe there's align bytes at the end). </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is there a way to get the \"assemble\" in IDA to reference my jump\n  locations, using the location references in IDA.

We do not plan to extend this feature, sorry</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Using assemble jz/jmp near ptr loc_000000018000A21B  the correct jmp was injected.</span>",
