    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to figure out why <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssavepanel?language=objc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">NSSavePanel</a> fails in my SwiftUI app. I tried every possible documentation, or asking on the Swift programming forums - to no avail.</p>\n<p>I'm originally a Windows programmer, and I am also a reverse engineer. The way I can see why some API doesn't work (on Windows) is usually by stepping into it with a live debugger/disassembler. This is what I want to do with the <code>NSSavePanel.runModal()</code> call. But I'm kinda new to macOS.</p>\n<p>So to test the concept, I built a simple C++ app with the Xcode (natively for ARM64 architecture, with the \"release\" configuration):</p>\n<pre><code>int main(int argc, const char * argv[])\n{\n    if(argc &gt; 2)\n    {\n        int a = atoi(argv[1]);\n        int b = atoi(argv[2]);\n        int c = a / b;\n        \n        printf(\"v=%d\\n\", c);\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I then configured Xcode to \"Debug -&gt; Debug Workflow -&gt; Always show disassembly\" and set a bp at the start. So I get this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PvvJP.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PvvJP.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I can somewhat step-over and -into ARM64 assembly instructions with ^F6 and ^F7 keyboard shortcuts, but the Xcode UI is not really showing values of registers (one needs to type <code>p $register</code> into the console) and to see memory one needs to use \"Debug -&gt; Debug Workflow -&gt; View memory\" option, which is very clunky.</p>\n<p>In other words, Xcode is not the best for this type of low-level debugging.</p>\n<p>So I'm wondering, if there's another live debugger/disassembler that can be used for this purpose?</p>\n</div>",
