But analyzing the disassembly Ghidra sees that only 4 bytes are being set to 0 in this line (for example a 32 bit register is used).</p>\n<p>One of the fix you can apply is by correcting the type of <code>local_res8</code> (<kbd>CTRL+L</kbd>) but it might be the case that the type is ok, and in fact only lower 32-bits are being set..</p>\n</div>",
