    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I overcame recent issues with a redefinition and finished my Plugin.</p>\n<p>In short this plugin uses Hex-Rays Decompiler to decompile a given file, analyzes properties of the pseudocode and then appends the results to a <code>.csv</code></p>\n<p>Now I tried to use this in batch mode, but was stumped as the following happened:</p>\n<p>Cmd input to call IDA:</p>\n<pre><code>idaw -A -c -Srecompile.idc input_file\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>recompile.idc</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;idc.idc&gt;\nstatic main() {\nWait();\nMessage(\"Hello world from IDC!\\n\");\nRunPlugin(\"REcompile vs Hexrays\",0); \n//Exit(0);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I obviously need to <code>Wait()</code> for Auto-Analysis. <code>Exit()</code> is commented since it's for use when this is all fixed.</p>\n<p>Now i do get the following output on execution:</p>\n<pre><code>The initial autoanalysis has been finished.\nHello world from IDC!\n\nLoadLibrary(C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA\\plugins\\REcompile vs Hexrays.plw) error: Das angegebene Modul wurde nicht gefunden.\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA\\plugins\\REcompile vs Hexrays.plw: can't load file\nHex-Rays Decompiler plugin has been loaded (v1.6.0.111005)\nHex-rays version 1.6.0.111005 has been detected, REcompile vs Hexrays ready to use\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see the script is executed before the plugins are loaded. I assume this is the reason why I get the <code>LoadLibrary</code> Error.</p>\n<p>If you have any other input or experience with plugin batch execution i'd be happy to hear from you.</p>\n<p>Greetings, \nViktor</p>\n</div>",
