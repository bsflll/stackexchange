It takes more work than I'd like to spend to test to see if the binary has changed as I muck with the compile options. I'm trying to optimize for fewer instructions.</p>\n</div>",

I'm rebuilding Protostar from source and optimizing for clarity. That means turning off things like alignment checks, canaries, and safety-wrappers <code>__chk_*</code> functions etc.</span>",

When you are using <code>r2pipe</code> (a python API for radare2), you may execute radare2 commands \"aaa\" and \"aflj\" to get details for every function (including number of instructions). I suppose, these commands are available in radare2 cli, without API calls.</p>\n</div>",
