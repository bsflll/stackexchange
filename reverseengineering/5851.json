    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>To test the debugging capabilities of Hopper, I wrote a simple C++ command line application, and tried to run it on the remote debugging server (with gdb). However, I learned after I failed to be able to interact with the application, from the author, that the Hopper server does not support CL apps currently. In other words, it seems the app has to have its own GUI.</p>\n<p>Are there any workarounds for this? Specifically, is there a way I can write a standalone C++ Mach-O executable which has its own version of terminal built into it (without all the features, just an interpreter)?</p>\n</div>",
