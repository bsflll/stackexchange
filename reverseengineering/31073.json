Sometimes I run a lot of commands and I would like to re-draw the current program state the way gef displays it when I step through the program (registers + stack + list view, etc...). Yes, I am able to get much of the same info with the <code>info registers</code>, <code>info frame</code>, etc... But I have not found a way to do this and it would be helpful.</p>\n</div>",
