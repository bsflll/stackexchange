            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>This answer could be better if you provided more context which exact assembler statements you have problems with.</p>\n<p>Generally, the compiler often has an instruction that moves a variable to a register at the start of something, works with that register for a while, then stores the variable back. In your case, think of <code>eax</code> as a temporary variable that copies <code>var1</code>, like this:</p>\n<pre><code>eax_temp_var1=var1;\neax_temp_var1=eax_temp_var1%var2;  // idivl; movl\nif (eax_temp_var1 == 0)            // testl\n    return 0;                      // movl $0, eax; jmp L4; leave; ret\nvar2++;                            // addl $1\nif (var2&lt;var1)\n    goto L5;                       // movl; cmpl; jl\nreturn 1;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Of course, a C programmer wouldn' write the first three lines like that, it would rather be</p>\n<pre><code>if (var1 % var2 == 0)\n</code></pre>\n<p>and part of the challenge of reverse engineering is simplifying code like this to understand what's going on.</p>\n<p>Please note that in the code snippet you posted, there's no jump back, as we don't know where L5 is; so there's no reason why this should be a loop. (Actually, i guess the whole thing is a primality test, and L5 ist just after the <code>jmp .L2</code>, which would make it a loop).</p>\n<p>Also, when the program arrives at L4, <code>eax</code> will either contain a 0 or a 1, so this will never return var1.</p>\n<p>Lastly, i used var1%var2, not var1/var2. You commented \"Remainder in edx\" yourself; then <code>edx</code> is moved to <code>eax</code>, then <code>eax</code> gets tested if it's zero. So, it's the remainder, not the quotient, that gets tested.</p>\n</div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>The end part is missing but it pretty much looks like a naive function to test for primality. It tries to divide param with every number from 2 to (param - 1). If the remainder is zero, then the function has found a divisor and returns 0. Else it returns 1.</p>\n<p>Something like:</p>\n<pre><code>bool is_prime(int param)\n{\n    int var1;\n\n    for (var1 = 2; var1 &lt; param; var1++)\n    {\n        if (param % var1 == 0) return false;\n    }\n\n    return true;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>-20(%rbp) is the parameter; that would be param.</p>\n<p>-4(%rbp) is a local variable; that would be var1.</p>\n</div>",
