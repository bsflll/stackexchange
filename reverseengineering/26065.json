    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am reverse engineering a very old game and when I load up the executable in Ghidra, I see a handful of imported dlls</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3VRH4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3VRH4.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I do however not see one of the DLLs the game uses to wrap various client rendering Direct X 7 calls. I have loaded (and analyzed the separate dll) but can't seem to figure out how I can get the game exe to recognize the dll. My hope is (because the DLL has function names that I can see via Dependency Walker), that I can see the calls by name to the DLL. I am able to see them via ollydbg (possibly because the game is running).</p>\n<p>Am I missing something?</p>\n<p>I found <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/22044\">this post</a> here which looks relevant.</p>\n<p>I do not see the <code>EXTERNAL</code> identifier, but instead something like this:</p>\n<p><code>iVar3 = (*(code *)FLOAT_006e5188)(param_1[1],iVar3,&amp;local_24);</code></p>\n<p>This is a function pointer pointing towards the function in the DLL. How can I fix this?</p>\n</div>",
