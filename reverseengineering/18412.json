    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm a beginner in reverse engineering, and as a beginner I started to read <a href=\"https://beginners.re/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Reverse Engineering for beginers\"</a>.<br/>\nHere is the hello world program from the book (taken from chapter 3, page 12) :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now let’s try to compile the same C/C++ code in the GCC 4.4.1 compiler in Linux:\n  gcc 1.c -o 1 Next, with the assistance of the IDA disassembler, let’s see how\n  the main() function was created. IDA, like MSVC, uses Intel-syntax5.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>main proc near\n\nvar_10 = dword ptr -10h\n\n     push ebp\n     mov ebp, esp\n     and esp, 0FFFFFFF0h\n     sub esp, 10h\n     mov eax, offset aHelloWorld ; \"hello, world\\n\"\n     mov [esp+10h+var_10], eax\n     call _printf\n     mov eax, 0\n     leave\n     retn\nmain endp\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are two lines I don't understand at all : </p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>and esp, 0FFFFFFF0h</code></li>\n<li><code>sub esp, 10h</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>From what I understood from the book, we add <code>0FFFFFFF0h</code> (equals -16) value to ESP in order to align the stack to a 16byte boundary for optimisation.\n<br/>\nMy question is : why do we add -16 and then substract 16 to the stack? It seems pointless to me, can't we substract directly 32?\nSecond, if I'm understanding well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the program starts with EBP = ESP, because nothing is on the stack. </li>\n<li>Then EBP is pushed to the stack. Assuming the program is 64bit, ESP is now EBP - 8 (because of the 64bits). So now we have ESP != EBP.</li>\n<li>Then we copy the content of ESP into EBP. So we have EBP = ESP, and EBP = fristEBP (EBP when the program started) - 8. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why do we need to modify the value of EBP? <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4584089/what-is-the-function-of-the-push-pop-instructions-used-on-registers-in-x86-ass\">PUSH instruction is supposed to change the value of ESP</a>, not EBP, so why would there be any problem not modifying EBP value at the function prolog?</p>\n<p><br/><br/>\nSo now we have EBP = ESP, and both are fristEBP (EBP when the program started) - 8. So now we are adding -16 to the stack, so ESP becomes ESP - 16 (ESP - 24 if we consider that we've been adding -8 to the stack). <br/>\nWhat is -24 have to do with a 16byte boundary?\nWhy do we substract 16 again from the stack with <code>sub esp, 10h</code>?</p>\n<p><br/>\nNotes : I'm sorry for the english, and sorry if I'm asking dumb questions, the book isn't clear enought and I failed to find explainations on the net.</p>\n</div>",

So it will clear the lower nibble for the last byte in the address. This is how the alignment is done and not by adding anything. Only later you <code>sub</code> 16 to have room for the local variables.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why do we need to modify the value of EBP?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We use <code>EBP</code> to store the initial <code>ESP</code> value. <code>EBP</code> is pointing to the current stack frame. This is the place for local variables created withing the function. Before we modify <code>EBP</code> it is stored on the stack so that we can restore it before we leave the function.</p>\n</div>",
