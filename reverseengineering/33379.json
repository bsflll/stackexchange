    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a .NET 8 MVC project structured in three layers: Business, WebAPI, and Model. I want to convert it into a desktop application, so I used Electron.NET. However, I faced serious security concerns regarding my DLL files, as they can be easily decompiled.</p>\n<p>I have tried obfuscation, but it is not strong enough for my needs. Ideally, I need to compile my code into a lower-level language like C++ or any other method that would make reverse engineering much harder.</p>\n<p>Key Points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>My project contains Views (Razor Pages/Views), so Minimal API is not\na suitable alternative.</li>\n<li>I need a way to hide or encrypt my DLL files or convert them into a\nmore secure format.</li>\n<li>I am open to alternative solutions, such as using another technology\nto compile or protect my code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What are the best practices to secure my Electron.NET applicationâ€™s backend code? Would AOT compilation or using a different language help? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n</div>",
