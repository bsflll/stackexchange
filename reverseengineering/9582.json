But the kernel will refuse to <code>exec</code> the program unless it has the correct x bit (your user/group ids define which one is the correct one) set. You can set the x bit for yourself, the owner, only (if you want to prevent others from executing the binary); or you can set the x bit, start the process, and remove the x bit again (if you want to prevent yourself from running it accidentially). But to start a process that runs the binary, you need the x bit.</p>\n<p>If you really really want to execute the binary's code without setting it executable, you could probably write a program to read its header, <code>mmap</code> the sections you need, read the binary into those sections, possibly fix up relocations, and jump to the entry point. But you'll have a long, arduous way in front of you to get this right, and it probably won't be possible to get <code>llvm</code> recognize any symbols in the binary. So while doing this might be a theoretical possibility, there's really no point in trying.</p>\n</div>",
