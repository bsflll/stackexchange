    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to learn about injecting a DLL into a process and I wanted to simply execute a code which injects an already built DLL so that I could then check with OllyDbg if it worked.</p>\n<p>I am using the code below for this:</p>\n<pre><code>LPCSTR DllPath = \"E:\\\\testdll.dll\";\nGetWindowThreadProcessId(FindWindowA(0, \"Calculator\"), &amp;ProcessId);\nHANDLE hProcess = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, ProcessId);\nLPVOID pDllPath = VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, 0, strlen(DllPath) + 1, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE);\nWriteProcessMemory(hProcess, pDllPath, (LPVOID)DllPath, strlen(DllPath) + 1, 0);\nHANDLE hLoadThread = CreateRemoteThread(hProcess, 0, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandleA(\"Kernel32.dll\"), \"LoadLibraryA\"), pDllPath, 0, 0);\nWaitForSingleObject(hLoadThread, INFINITE);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Apparently this worked (I have added a MessageBox inside the DLL in order to check that) but I can't find my DLL inside the 'Executable Modules' in OllyDbg. Also, the code inside the DLL keeps running even if I close the process it was injected into.</p>\n<p>What did I do wrong?</p>\n</div>",

I'm a bit surprised that it works, but it would explain why your DLL code is actually executed, not visible in the calculator module list and persists even after exiting the calculator.</p>\n</div>",
