    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I wanted to look at how does the Windows API get the size of a file, so I opened kernel32.dll in a disassembler. I searched for GetFileSizeEx, and it seems to call a stub(?), but the disassembler cannot find the body of that function. Can you shed some light on what am I looking at?</p>\n<p>GetFileSizeEx</p>\n<pre><code>.text:0000000180024D90 GetFileSizeEx   proc near          \n.text:0000000180024D90                                     \n.text:0000000180024D90                 jmp     cs:GetFileSizeEx_0\n.text:0000000180024D90 GetFileSizeEx   endp\n</code></pre>\n<p>Navigating to GetFileSizeEx_0 looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>.idata:0000000180082078 ; BOOL __stdcall GetFileSizeEx_0(HANDLE hFile, PLARGE_INTEGER lpFileSize)\n.idata:0000000180082078                 extrn GetFileSizeEx_0:qword\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is no function body whatsoever. Where can I find the functionality regarding this, or where does it call forward to?</p>\n<p>Edit:\nThe idata section seems to be for imports, but it is still uncreal where does it import the GetFileSizeEx_0 function.\nI have found the library it gets the import from, but the function body is not there.</p>\n<pre><code>.rdata:0000000180001A27 GetFileSizeEx   db 'kernel32.GetFileSizeEx',0\n.rdata:0000000180001088 off_180001088   rva GetFileSizeEx\n</code></pre>\n<p>What is this RVA part of the rdata section?</p>\n<p>I found the actual function body in KernelBase.dll, but I don't understand from the above, how should I have come to this conclusion.</p>\n</div>",
