    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Basically, I have this 64 bits game.exe file which is about 400mb. It takes about 24 hours to do the analysis of the file in Ida pro 64 bits free version.\nProblem is i have to do it again cause there were some errors apparently.\nSo my question is this, when i run that game.exe and i attach xdbg64 to it, it shows me the assembly code of the whole process, but when i instead run that game and try to attach Ida Pro's debugger to it i don't get the same kind of information, so is there a way to display the whole program's assembly in Ida pro and also use the decompiler on some of the function while the game.exe is running?\nMy goal is to make a single player mod for this game by hooking a specific funtion.\nI attached two screenshots that show the same address for both programs:</p>\n<p>xdbg64:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FghHJ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"xdbg64\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FghHJ.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>idaProFree:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VyDjw.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"idaProFree\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VyDjw.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

However, the general method of using the debugger of ida to analyse/decompile certain specific functions of the running .exe makes sense compared to analyse the whole .exe file when it's not running?</span>",
