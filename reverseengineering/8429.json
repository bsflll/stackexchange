There are so many zeroes in your packets, we can only guess how they're used in the checksum bit. However, this certainly isn't a CRC (the output bits should change more depending on the input if it was), this seems rather like a primitive scheme to me (xor each byte with something, add up the values, xor the result with something else) since in many cases, adding 1 to a nibble subtracts 1 from the checksum.</span>",

Finally I got it.. it's actually not a CRC so Guntram was right!!! the formula is add up all the values then XOR with 0x55 (Magic Number) and so far everything is a hit if I try this formula to all data packets.</span>",
