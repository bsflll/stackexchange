Otherwise, if you prefer a command line tool (which, BTW, doesn't require IDA), you can use <a href=\"https://github.com/joxeankoret/pyew\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pyew</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/joxeankoret/pyew/blob/VERSION_3X/gcluster.py\" rel=\"nofollow\">gcluster.py</a> script.</p>\n<p>If you prefer to write something yourself, please remember that comparing 2 binaries is not a trivial task. That said, I will explain how the comparison of the call graphs of 2 binaries works in both gcluster.py and Diaphora:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, a binary is loaded in a tool and code analysed. The tool can be Pyew (gcluster) or IDA (Diaphora).</li>\n<li>The code analysis step gathers information relative to functions, the call graph and flow graphs (basic blocks of each function and their relationships as well as function's relationships).</li>\n<li>Using that information, I calculate the cyclomatic complexity of each function that has more than 1 basic block.</li>\n<li>Using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gödel numbering</a> I assign a prime number corresponding to each <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity\" rel=\"nofollow\">cyclomatic complexity</a> (that's it, for each function).</li>\n<li>Then, with all these prime numbers corresponding to all functions, I multiply them to have a large number \"hash\". This step is what the inventors, Halvar Flake and @rolfrolles, call \"Small Primes Product\" in their \"<a href=\"https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.zynamics.com/es//downloads/bindiffsstic05-1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Graph-based comparison of Executable Objects</a>\" paper.</li>\n<li>The result of the multiplication is the program's call graph signature.</li>\n<li>If the call graph signature is equal for 2 binaries, the call graph is very likely the same for both binaries. I say \"very likely\" because small functions are ignored and, also, using the cyclomatic complexity of a function as a fuzzy identifier is, fuzzy: 2 totally different functions can have the same cyclomatic complexity. In any case, the call graph signature is more than good enough in most cases (I'm yet to see a case were it isn't).</li>\n<li>If the call graph signature is different, factor the primes (which you already have calculated), remove these in both sets (i.e., in both binaries) and calculate the % of difference with the remaining primes (which correspond to functions) in both binaries.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Another way of comparing call graphs is doing it by traversing both graphs and calculating the differences between 2 graphs (considering that you have some way to determine that a function F in binary A is equal to function F' in binary B, something that is not trivial). I don't recommend you doing so unless solving how to do so is your problem/what you want to do.</p>\n<p>My 2 cents.</p>\n</div>",
