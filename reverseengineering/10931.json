    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I made a mistake when trying to import some additional binary data into one of my long-time IDA databases. I unintentionally overwrote some empty RAM space, so I tried reverting it back to \"space\" by undefining or converting the imported code to data. But no such luck - the regions are now filled with thousands of \".byte 0\" lines instead.</p>\n<p>The database has a ton of comments and renamed variables/functions and I would rather not start over from scratch just to fix this, so is there any other way I can undo this silly mistake? I'm still pretty new to IDA so I hope a potentially dumb question is forgiven here.</p>\n<p>I use IDA 6.1 if that changes anything.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div>",
