    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I defined a new code section in my assembly program, which is going to be compiled into 32-bit ELF binary, on x86.</p>\n<p>I use the linker scripts to assign a specified address for this new code section, it works. However, I noticed that this new section does not be loaded to the memory, after some debugging!</p>\n<p>I use <code>readelf</code> and figure out that there is no \"execution\" privilege of this new section:</p>\n<pre><code>[15] .trampoline       PROGBITS        080483d0 004020 000117 00      0   0 16\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then I did this:</p>\n<pre><code>objcopy --set-section-flags .trampoline=alloc,code a.out\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, I got this warning:</p>\n<pre><code>BFD: stQWykoH: warning: allocated section `.trampoline' not in segment\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now I realize that I didn't explicitly assign a <code>segment</code> information to my new section!!</p>\n<p>So here is my question:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>How to assign a <code>segment</code> information to a new code section I defined? I double-checked the linker script (follow instruction <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9508290/how-to-specify-base-addresses-for-sections-when-linking-or-alternatively-how-to/9550165#9550165\">here</a> to dump), and I have no idea how to modify the script... </p></li>\n<li><p>I just want to add a new executable section to my assembly program, and assign a fixed address to this new section. So am I on the right way now?</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
