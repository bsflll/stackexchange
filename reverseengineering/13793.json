    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>No matter what I do, I can't seem to be able to get my Windows 10 (64-bit, build 1607) to apply any patches in custom SDB's (as described in the <a href=\"https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-14/materials/Erickson/WP-Asia-14-Erickson-Persist-It-Using-And-Abusing-Microsofts-Fix-It-Patches.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">article of Jon Erickson</a> from 2014).</p>\n<p>I'm using Jon's <a href=\"https://github.com/rustyx/sdb-explorer/releases/tag/0.9\" rel=\"nofollow\">sdb-explorer</a> to generate a patch SDB from the following source (assuming calc.exe's PE checksum is 0000BE15 and the entrypoint RVA is 0x2900):</p>\n<pre><code>!sdbpatch\nAPP=calc.exe\nDBNAME=calc_test\nP:calc.exe,0xbe15\nR:calc.exe,0x2900,CCCCCCC3\n!endsdbpatch\n</code></pre>\n<p>The exact commands are:</p>\n<pre><code>sdb-explorer.exe -C calc-test.txt -o calc-test.sdb\nsdbinst.exe -p calc-test.sdb\n</code></pre>\n<p>The install is successful but has no effect - <em>calc.exe</em> still starts and runs normally.</p>\n<p>Hence my question - has the PATCH mechanism been removed or somehow crippled in Windows 10?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><sup>p.s. I need this for legitimate reasons - I'm trying to patch the touchpad utility which is posting mouse wheel messages which don't work in Windows 10 UWP apps, but the utility is signed with uiAccess=\"true\", so I can't just patch the executable.</sup></p>\n</div>",

The Windows\n  10 version does not have the function SeiApplyPatch. This is what is\n  responsible for performing the PATCH. It appears that Microsoft has\n  removed this feature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, it seems you can <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aionescu/status/790123280409690112\" rel=\"nofollow\">still use shims</a>, although apparently not on all binaries.</p>\n</div>",
