    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a bluetooth LE home automation style device, that connects to a mobile app. There are 2 values which are updated roughly every second. I'm trying to extract these numbers from the payload. I've narrowed the frames down to these examples below.</p>\n<pre><code>00-02-7B-02-9E-00-0F-3B-84-DD-30\n00-02-7C-02-A8-00-0F-3B-84-DD-30\n00-02-7C-02-A9-00-0F-3B-84-DD-30\n00-02-7B-02-A2-00-0F-3B-85-60-42\n00-02-7C-02-AD-00-0F-3B-85-1E-B9\n</code></pre>\n<p>The 2 numbers I'm trying to extract should be a PSI/bar/other pressure value of around 50psi/339bar and the other should be between 1 and 5ish. </p>\n<p>It looks like the values are split on the <code>00</code> in the hex.</p>\n<p>I've been using this tool <a href=\"http://www.scadacore.com/field-tools/programming-calculators/online-hex-converter/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hex to int converter</a> to try and split the hex up, but I can't get the values I'm expecting. </p>\n</div>",
