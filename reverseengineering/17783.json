    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to write a small application that can show for each\nline of the de-compiled psuedo code of a certain function\nthe assembly instruction that responsible for it.</p>\n<p>for example if we have a function invocation in the pseudo code - i want to show all the push to stack instructions + the call instruction:</p>\n<pre><code>sample_function(a,b)\n\n//will be mapped to:\n\npush b\npush a\ncall sample_function\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've tried to scan the objects that are returned by the <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idapython_docs/ida_hexrays-module.html#decompile\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">decompile</a> method and gone through some examples: <a href=\"https://github.com/idapython/src/blob/master/examples/vds1.py\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">vds1</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/idapython/src/blob/master/examples/vds4.py\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">vds4</a>, ... Haven't found a solution.</p>\n<p>Is this mapping is saved somewhere? In IDA i can access the other direction when it shows in the assembly the pseudo code as comments.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div>",
