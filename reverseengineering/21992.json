    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>When I use the context menu \"List cross references to\", a window opens with a list of all positions found which references the position, and I can double click to a function. But then the window closes, because it is a modal window. Is it possible that it stays open (non-modal) or is there another way to open it again quickly without jumping back and selecting the context menu item again?</p>\n</div>",
