Now what i don't understand is how to find specific functions such as some sort of spawning function so i can spawn an npc to act as another player.</p>\n<p>I guess what i need is specific books or tutorials that will help with reversing functions or looking for specific functions to call. Any help would be greatly appreatiated.</p>\n</div>",
