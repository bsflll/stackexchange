This means that if the file has data that contains a certain range of byte values (e.g., printable ASCII characters), those bytes will generate coordinates in the same general area of the 3D plot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is how AVR32 code looks like:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Visualisation of AVR32 code\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/q5HPW.gif\"/></p>\n<p>To get this, use the <em>--3D</em> option:</p>\n<pre><code>$ binwalk --3D yourfile.exe\n</code></pre>\n</div>",

If your input consists of a random distribution of some restricted set of characters (say, only printable ASCII characters), then you'd have a smaller cube of points inside the larger 3D cube (see the red cube in the GIF above - that's ASCII data). The flat vertical and horizontal red &amp; yellow planes you see are executable code.</span>",
