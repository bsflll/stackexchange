Absence of Compression Signatures</strong></p>\n<p>The relevant <a href=\"https://github.com/devttys0/binwalk/blob/master/src/binwalk/magic/compressed\" rel=\"noreferrer\">compression formats that Binwalk detects</a> are as follows: bzip2, lzop, lzip, lrzip, LZO, 7z, gzip, rzip, LZMA, zlib, and LZ4. Since running Binwalk against <code>H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin</code> returns no results even though Binwalk normally will recognize any of these compression formats is the first indicator that something other than or in addition to compression is going on.</p>\n<p>Every tool has its limitations however, so I attempted to find byte sequences within the file header indicating the beginning of a sequence of compressed bytes manually by using the information from a zenhax.com forum post called <a href=\"http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=27\" rel=\"noreferrer\">How to recognize the compression algorithms with your eyes</a>, looking for Bzip2, zlib, gzip, LZMA, LZMA 86 head, LZMA 86 dec, LZMA 86 dec head, LZMA efs, LZMA headerless, LZMA2 and LZMA2 headerless compression signatures in particular. Here are the first few bytes of each compression signature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>zlib: <code>78 da</code></li>\n<li>gzip: <code>1f 8b</code></li>\n<li>LZMA, LZMA 86 head, LZMA 86 dec, LZMA 86 dec head, LZMA efs: <code>5d 00 00 00</code></li>\n<li>LZMA headerless: <code>00 44 94 a6</code></li>\n<li>LZMA2: <code>18 e0 07 ce</code></li>\n<li>LZMA2 headerless: <code>e0 07 ce 02</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The information regarding compression in the answers to this question on SO was also helpful: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19120676/how-to-detect-type-of-compression-used-on-the-file-if-no-file-extension-is-spe\">How to detect type of compression used on the file? (if no file extension is specified)</a></p>\n<p>By \"file header\", what I mean is the first 300 bytes or so (this question was used as a reference: <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/3593/re-compressed-backup-file-router-linux-based-so-is-it-compresed-with-zlib\">RE Compressed backup file,router linux based so is it compresed with zlib?</a> since this question, also by Vido, involved ZTE router firmware and its compression signature was found).

The most interesting and useful was a file called <code>H201LV2.0.bin</code>, shared via <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/hhyqni6i0pfx4z3/H201LV2.0.bin\" rel=\"noreferrer\">DropBox</a>. Here is a diff of the headers of the two files:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/47HeA.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"diff\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/47HeA.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Interestingly, there is a 16-byte sequence both have in common at offset <code>0x00003214</code> (is this possible if the files really are encrypted? It seems odd):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JJjcy.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"diff 2\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JJjcy.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>When Binwalk is run against <code>H201LV2.0.bin</code> it is similarly unsuccessful:</p>\n<pre><code>$ binwalk H201LV2.0.bin \n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n</code></pre>\n<p>Additionally, there is another RE.SE post titled <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/11626/zte-encrypted-backup-config-file\">ZTE encrypted backup config file</a> regarding ZTE config backups of a different product, ZTE Speedport Entry 2i, that are also suspected of being encrypted. One the config.bin files shared in a <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/k0dprjt17bh5eqn/config.bin?dl=0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">link</a> in the comments under this question also has similar header structure to <code>H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin</code> but seems to be from an older firmware version. It appears that others are having difficulty with the same issue.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Data Entropy and Entropy Analysis</strong></p>\n<p>There is an <a href=\"http://blog.superuser.com/2011/03/21/compression-and-encryption/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">interesting article on compression and encryption on the SE superuser blog</a>. Here are two points from the text:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Compression searches for patterns and replaces them with smaller tokens representing those patterns</li>\n<li>Encryption obfuscates the data ideally creating an output with no discernible patterns in it</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Differentiating between compression and encryption can be attempted using statistical methods. This has been discussed in the context of firmware analysis by <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/users/1408/devttys0\">devttys0</a> in 2 articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.devttys0.com/2013/06/differentiate-encryption-from-compression-using-math/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Differentiate Encryption From Compression Using Math</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.devttys0.com/2013/06/encryption-vs-compression-part-2/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Encryption vs Compression, Part 2</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>From the first article:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...there are a few tests that can be performed to quantify the randomness of data. The two that I have found most useful are chi square distribution and Monte Carlo pi approximation. These tests can be used to measure the randomness of data and are more sensitive to deviations in randomness than a visual entropy analysis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Existing tools, such as ent, will perform these\n  calculations for us. The real problem is how to interpret the results;\n  how random is encrypted data vs compressed data? This will depend on\n  both the encryption/compression used, as well as the size of your data\n  set (more data generally means more accurate results). Applying these\n  tests to a (admittedly small) sample of files with varying size which\n  had been put through different compression/encryption algorithms\n  showed the following correlations: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Large deviations in the chi square distribution, or large percentages of error in the Monte Carlo approximation are sure signs\n  of compression.</p></li>\n<li><p>Very accurate pi calculations (&lt; .01% error) are sure signs of encryption.</p></li>\n<li><p>Lower chi values (&lt; 300) with higher pi error (&gt; .03%) are indicative of compression.</p></li>\n<li><p>Higher chi values (&gt; 300) with lower pi errors (&lt; .03%) are indicative of encryption.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These value ranges can be used as heuristics in the analysis of the file. </p>\n<p>This is the result of using Binwalk to perform entropy analysis of <code>H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>$ binwalk -E -J H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin \n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     ENTROPY\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1024          0x400           Rising entropy edge (0.972587)\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xytCt.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"entropy 1\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xytCt.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>And using <code>ent</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>$ ent H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin\nEntropy = 7.981641 bits per byte.\n\nOptimum compression would reduce the size\nof this 19716 byte file by 0 percent.\n\nChi square distribution for 19716 samples is 650.33, and randomly\nwould exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.\n\nArithmetic mean value of data bytes is 126.7613 (127.5 = random).\nMonte Carlo value for Pi is 3.133292757 (error 0.26 percent).\nSerial correlation coefficient is 0.039397 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).\n</code></pre>\n<p>Synopsis: According to the graph, entropy distribution between byte offsets (decimal) ~1000 to ~19000 is fairly uniform. This is expected with encrypted data:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Encrypted data is typically a flat line with no variation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The chi square distribution is <strong>650.33</strong> and the pi error is <strong>0.26</strong>. The chi square value is on target for what is expected with encrypted data but the pi error value is <em>very</em> far off target, according to devttys0:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Higher chi values (&gt; 300) with lower pi errors (&lt; .03%) are\n  indicative of encryption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Part of the problem is the small file size of ~20KB and low entropy in the file header, which we know is not encrypted. Excluding data known to be unencrypted from analysis will increase accuracy. Encryption looks like it begins at around offset <code>0x00000124</code>, so a python script can be written to skip past the first 292 bytes and write the rest to an auxiliary file:</p>\n<pre><code>#!/usr/lib/python\n\nwith open(\"H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin\", \"rb\") as input_file:\n    with open(\"auxiliary_H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin\", \"wb\") as output_file:\n        output_file.write(input_file.read()[292:])\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now analysis can be performed on just the (suspected) encrypted data block without the unencrypted file header:</p>\n<pre><code>$ binwalk -E -J auxiliary_H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin \n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     ENTROPY\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0             0x0             Rising entropy edge (0.973372)\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fsNZx.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"aux entropy\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fsNZx.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>With <code>ent</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>$ ent auxiliary_H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin\nEntropy = 7.990521 bits per byte.\n\nOptimum compression would reduce the size\nof this 19424 byte file by 0 percent.\n\nChi square distribution for 19424 samples is 256.03, and randomly\nwould exceed this value 47.01 percent of the times.\n\nArithmetic mean value of data bytes is 128.0505 (127.5 = random).\nMonte Carlo value for Pi is 3.143651529 (error 0.07 percent).\nSerial correlation coefficient is 0.011183 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).\n</code></pre>\n<p>These results are interesting: the graph indicates approximately uniform entropy throughout the file, but now the chi square distribution (<strong>256.03</strong>) and the pi approximation error (<strong>0.07%</strong>) are <em>both</em> within the bounds of what is expected for compressed data!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lower chi values (&lt; 300) with higher pi error (&gt; .03%) are indicative of compression.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With that said, these new values are relatively close to their respective boundary conditions. That is, 256.03 is relatively close to boundary condition of 300 for the chi square distribution and 0.07% is relatively close to the boundary condition of 0.03% for pi approximation error, so it is difficult to say with confidence that the file really is encrypted or if it is compressed based on this. </p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Evidence supporting the hypothesis that the file is encrypted is confounded by some of the results of the entropy analysis. Therefore I will venture that the file is encrypted but I cannot prove it using the methods I described here.</p>\n<p>I hope that these findings (or lack thereof) will prove useful to others performing their own investigation of this file. Perhaps a professional will be able to definitively answer this interesting question.</p>\n<h2>Suggestions, Other Paths</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do you have a suggestion on what should I try ?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>1. More Rigorous Statistical Analysis</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.random.org/statistics/information-entropy/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Entropy analysis, while useful, is not enough</a>; additional <a href=\"https://www.random.org/analysis/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">statistical methods</a> should be employed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Information entropy is often used as a preliminary test for\n  randomness. Generally speaking, random data will have a high level of\n  information entropy, and a low level of information entropy is a good\n  indicator that the data isn't random. (A low level of entropy isn't\n  definitive proof that the data isn't random, but it means you should\n  be suspcious and submit the generator to further tests.)</p>\n<p>However, the converse relation doesn't hold, meaning a high degree of\n  information entropy is no guarantee of randomness. For example, a\n  compressed file (e.g., a ZIP file) has a high level of information\n  entropy, but is in fact highly structured, and it will fail many other\n  tests for randomness. Hence, you have to be a little careful using\n  information entropy as a metric for randomness. To get meaningful\n  results, you really need to combine it with other tests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>2. Recovering the encryption module</strong></p>\n<p>This speculation in the answer to <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/11626/zte-encrypted-backup-config-file/13808#13808\">ZTE encrypted backup config file</a> may provide an avenue of investigation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I imagine that the core functionality to perform the encryption is the same across the ZTE reuters (common config.bin suggests this), so imagine it's just a case of figuring out the method, and what keys/iv are used to decrypt it again...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the module within the firmware responsible for performing the encryption is found, the encryption algorithm can be reverse-engineered. I think access to the device is required for this, given the absence of easily available ZTE router firmware images.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Ciphertext Analysis</strong></p>\n<p>Something I did not pursue was analysis of the (suspected) ciphertext with tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/fwhacking/bfcrypt\" rel=\"noreferrer\">bfcrypt</a> or <a href=\"http://www.hexblog.com/?p=27\" rel=\"noreferrer\">FindCrypt</a> in order to determine the encryption algorithm employed to encrypt the file.
