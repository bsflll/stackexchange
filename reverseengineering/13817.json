    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have picked up a rooted Acer phone and dd-ed the <code>LK</code> partition to analyze it in IDA. The goal is to pinpoint the routine processing fastboot commands. Stripping first 512 bytes produces apparently meaningful disassembly. However, the cross reference of the string <code>fastboot: processing commands\\n</code> doesn't look very meaningful. This has led me to believe that the image might need to be re-based to some address to get the references correct. Any idea how I can do that?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n7hby.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n7hby.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/cdzcl.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/cdzcl.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

Your string references look perfectly fine to me; loading the offset between the current instruction and the string, then adding PC, is the standard ARM way of getting position independent code. More about that in my answer <a href=\"http://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/4475/4154\">here</a>.</span>",

Of course this can be done with IDAPython.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From this shift the address may be concluded.</p>\n<p>In addition you can cross-reference function prologues with jumps and calls with absolute addressing. </p>\n<p>BTW, if I'm not mistaken you will probably find an interrupt table at the start of the image - absolute jumps like in the following example:</p>\n<pre><code>00000000   LDR   PC, =Reset\n00000004   LDR   PC, =Undef\n00000008   LDR   PC, =SVC\n0000000C   LDR   PC, =PrefAbort\n00000010   LDR   PC, =DataAbort\n00000014   NOP\n00000018   LDR   PC, =IRQ\n0000001C   LDR   PC, =FIQ\n</code></pre>\n<p>The values of the loaded addresses may hint an area to search for.</p>\n</div>",
