Once such applications are compiled, the logic is contained in one dll. After opening this dll into IDA, it appears pretty clear that the file contains a .NET part (located in the section <code>.rdata</code>) and generic stub as native code in the <code>.text</code> section.</p>\n<p>Did anyone already succeed to extract the .NET code in the <code>.rdata</code> section and open it in a standard decompiler?</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n</div>",
