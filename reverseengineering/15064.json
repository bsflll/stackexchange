So, the object may be passed to a function starting from the offset of that virtual table.</p>\n<p>I'm trying to find a way how to pass the pointer to an offset within an object to a function in IDA decompiled view.</p>\n<p>I tried to set the type of the function argument something like struct-&gt;field * or struct.field * but that doesn't work.</p>\n</div>",
