    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Is it safe to assume that, in the general case, the name of the section containing the user code (not the compiler generated code) is <code>.text</code>? I spot-checked several ARM, x86 and MIPS binaries (PE and ELF) and it seems to be the case.</p>\n<p>I suppose the compiler/linker can be configured to chose a different name. In which cases would one want to change it? Are there known examples (CPU arch, compiler, etc.) where there is no <code>.text</code> section? What are other frequently used names? Can user code be put in other sections than the <code>.text</code> section?</p>\n<p>Or is the name <code>.text</code> required to be a valid PE / ELF and thus always chosen? The <a href=\"https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/elf/elf.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ELF specification</a> for example mentions the name <code>.text</code> several times, so does the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PE specification</a>.</p>\n</div>",

For example, Delphi compiler uses CODE, and various packers use custom names (UPX00 etc.) or even garbage.</p>\n<p>AFAIK the only section name that is somewhat enforced is <code>.rsrc</code> - I think Explorer may not show the file icon if resources section is renamed.</p>\n</div>",
