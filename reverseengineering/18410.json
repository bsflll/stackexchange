    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>When I'm using Windbg (in kernel mode) to step into assembly, I would encounter context switching once in a while - which is annoying.</p>\n<p>So, for example, I placed a breakpoint for a process - let's call it <code>A.exe</code> using <code>bp /1 /p &lt;EPROCESS OF A&gt; nt!NtDeviceIoControlFile</code>. <code>A</code> runs, hits the breakpoint and as I am stepping into the assembly, sometimes, the context switches - so the current process, instead of <code>A</code>, becomes <code>B</code>. </p>\n<p>Is there anyway to prevent this from happening?</p>\n</div>",
