I have already found the location of this string literal within the executable; I want to somehow deduce what the memory address of this string will be at runtime, so I can search the binary file for this address to find the instruction that references the string. How should I proceed?</p>\n<p>I am using a Windows x64 AMD architecture. The executable in question is also 64-bit.</p>\n</div>",
