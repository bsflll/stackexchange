But yeah, usually obfuscation.</p>\n<p>You can try to deobfuscate this .Net binary by using <a href=\"https://github.com/0xd4d/de4dot\" rel=\"noreferrer\">de4dot</a> which is doing an incredible job with deobfuscating obfuscated .net applications. de4dot's engine was later used to create <a href=\"https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy\" rel=\"noreferrer\">dnSpy</a> which is my favorite .Net decompiler.</p>\n<p>The separating dots are the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/member-access-operator\" rel=\"noreferrer\">dot Operator</a>, just as in most popular programming languages, the dot operator is used to access members of variables, types, etc. \"Members\" can be a method, attribute, and others. </p>\n<p>In your case, <code>\\u0001</code> is a method of <code>\\u0002</code> which is a member of the variable <code>\\u0013</code>.</p>\n</div>",
