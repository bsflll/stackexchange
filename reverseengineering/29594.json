Then you can't do this in frida JavaScript as the JS code is executed on Android side. You can only use <a href=\"https://frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#communication-send\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">send()</a> on client side but the you have to implement python code on server side to handle those sent messages.</span>",
