For example, you can see another one after the unconditional <code>jmp</code>, and there should be one after each <code>retn</code> instruction. In graph view they correspond to the end of function graph nodes.</p>\n<p>The most probable cause for the one after call is that the called function has been detected as <em>non-returning</em>.</p>\n<p>You can go inside the call and see if \"Attributes: noreturn\" is printed in the function header. If the function does, in fact, return, you can clear the flag by editing the function properties (<kbd>Alt-P</kbd>).</p>\n</div>",
