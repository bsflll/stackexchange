    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to use a gdb client running on my host machine to talk to a GDB server running on a debug probe.  I can connect using the \"target remote\" command, and I can single step, use monitor commands to restart, etc.  I can not set breakpoints though, because GDB insists there is nothing loaded at the address I specify because I have no executable and no symbol table.  It replies:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No symbol table is loaded.  Use the \"file\" command.\n  Make hw breakpoint pending on future shared library load? (y or [n])</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I tried providing it the raw binary firmware image, but that didn't work, and besides, I'd like to set hardware breakpoints, and set them anywhere I darn well please, including RAM where things are loaded during initialization, and I'm not about to create an ELF file just to get GDB to get out of the way.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to make GDB ignore its symbol table and just set hardware breakpoints?</p>\n</div>",
