And if you look closely it there is a pattern how much off they are from the original.</p>\n<p>For example, at offset <code>0x58</code>, there's supposed to be <code>push edx</code> so the byte should be <code>0x52</code>, but you have <code>push esp</code> which is <code>0x54</code>. Since the article mentions that this part is encrypted with a xor (with a single digit key), let's see how those values are off</p>\n<pre><code>In [7]: 0x52 ^ 0x54\nOut[7]: 6\n</code></pre>\n<p>So this is exactly the key mentioned in the article. If we compare the rest of those off instruction we will notice that they are off by the same value.</p>\n<p>Conclusion - this part of code shown in Ghidra was not decrypted and should be preprocessed before analysis.</p>\n</div>",
