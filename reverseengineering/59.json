There is <a href=\"http://www.macromonkey.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=65&amp;t=705\">a reimplementation</a> as a plugin (but I haven't tried it).  </p></li>\n<li><p><code>memcpy.idc</code> from IDA's idc directory. Very simple but useful when dealing with firmwares that copy code around.</p></li>\n<li><p><code>renimp.idc</code> when doing PE unpacking. Though recently it's been supplanted by UUNP's <a href=\"http://www.hexblog.com/?p=403\">manual reconstruct</a> feature.</p></li>\n<li><p>a tiny script to save selected bytes to a file. Useful for extracting embedded binaries from droppers.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<hr/>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;idc.idc&gt;\nstatic main()\n{\n  auto s,e,f,name;\n  s = SelStart();\n  e = SelEnd();\n  if (s==BADADDR || e==BADADDR)\n    return;\n  name = form(\"dump_%08X.bin\", s);\n  f = fopen(name,\"wb\");\n  Message(\"Saving %a-%a to %s...\", s, e, name);\n  savefile(f,0,s,e-s);\n  Message(\"done.\\n\");\n  fclose(f);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<hr/>\n<p>Also, I often write small IDC or Python snippets that do something specific to the binary I'm reversing, e.g. parsing a custom symbol table, or converting some specific byte sequence to code. These are usually not reused much.</p>\n</div>",
