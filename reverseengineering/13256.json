The only useful resource which I could found so far was a dataset provided on <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kaggle</a>. However, the only note how the <code>ASM</code> files have been generated is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This was generated using the IDA disassembler tool.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>My problem:</strong>\nThere are no details about the specifice process of disassembling: I could not find any additional information if or how the disassembler considers special obfuscation mechanisms and if it could be ensured, that the files contain meaningful assembler instructions.</p>\n<p><strong>To recall the question:</strong> I'm looking for malware samples (windows) with the corresponding disassembly to download in bulk, which have been ideally counterchecked for meaningful instructions (e.g. constant code of the malware).</p>\n</div>",

The closest I can think of is labs files from \"Practical Malware Analysis\", at <a href=\"https://practicalmalwareanalysis.com/labs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://practicalmalwareanalysis.com/labs/</a>. Each of the files is described and analysed in the \"Answers\" section of the book, including IIRC obfuscated samples, but actual disassembling is left as an exercise for the reader :)</p>\n<p>Another way to achieve your goal is to look for summary articles on topics that interest you, such as <a href=\"https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2014/07/obfuscation-android-malware-and-how-fight-back\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2014/07/obfuscation-android-malware-and-how-fight-back</a> (Android in this case), take hashes listed in them and download (bulk or not, up to you) samples from VirusTotal.</p>\n<p>A rather dated Windows malware analysis set of tutorials with emphasis on reversing - <a href=\"https://fumalwareanalysis.blogspot.com.au/p/malware-analysis-tutorials-reverse.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://fumalwareanalysis.blogspot.com.au/p/malware-analysis-tutorials-reverse.html</a></p>\n</div>",
