The problem is the version used is 3.3.14.2 which no longer has official de-compiler support.</p>\n<p>I have tried looking for 3rd party de-compilers but none of them worked for me. I've read somewhere that the <code>.exe</code> generated by AutoIT is just an embedded interpreter for AutoIT and the script source code but obfuscated.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know how it is compiled so I can use OllyDBG to try and de-obfuscate the script?</p>\n<p>Of-course the <code>.exe</code> is packed with UPX but can easily be unpacked. So the only problem is script obfuscation. (If my understanding is correct)</p>\n<p>I've tried dumping the application memory but didn't find any readable script there. I've also used OllyDBG to run the application but it gave me the error <code>This is a third-party compiled AutoIt script</code>. Bit confused why but attaching to the running application works okay.</p>\n</div>",
