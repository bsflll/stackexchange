I came to the conclusion that the files have been obfuscated with <a href=\"https://www.php-obfuscator.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.php-obfuscator.com/</a> and no deobfuscate tool that I know can convert php goto/labels to loops so I strongly think this is not a duplicate question. Can goto/labels be converted to while/foreach loops?</p>\n</div>",
