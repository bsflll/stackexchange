The game is also packed in Termida/WinLicense, can't unpack it as it keeps crashing during the process, but I managed to get a memory dump and a Dr. Watson <code>crashdump.dmp</code>.</p>\n<p>I posted screenshots of WinDBg below and a IDA PRO of the line that it seems to crash on any idea how to repair this?</p>\n<p>Everytime I attempt to load up the game I get this a Dr. Watson error box\n<img alt=\"8\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wH44s.png\"/>\n<img alt=\"1\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rlHCi.png\"/>\n<img alt=\"2\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iUmCw.png\"/>\n<img alt=\"3\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MERKD.png\"/>\n<img alt=\"4\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2qvF3.png\"/>\n<img alt=\"5\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NvMZH.png\"/>\n<img alt=\"9\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hHOSl.png\"/>\n<img alt=\"10\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DF41L.png\"/>\n<img alt=\"6\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pcAQk.png\"/>\n<img alt=\"7\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1ZIsP.png\"/></p>\n<p>Anyone give me any advise how to fix this game so it loads up? Anything I need to install on my computer to make it run?</p>\n<p>Here is the game binaries and dll files.\n<a href=\"https://www.mediafire.com/?3g3ro8qt7hbaqr3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.mediafire.com/?3g3ro8qt7hbaqr3</a></p>\n</div>",

The decompilation above may have effectively been written as:</p>\n<pre><code>if (InterlockedIncrement(...) == 1)\n{\n    Log_Error(...);\n    Log_Error(..., L\"\\r\\n\", ...);\n    if (something())\n    {\n        ...\n    }\n    FORCE_CRASH();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You may want to take a closer look at the data at <code>off_203C1C8</code>, <code>unk_1BC2AE8</code>, and <code>a1</code> to get some more hints. But if it were me, I'd just uninstall the game and move on. I wouldn't be able to trust developers who forcibly crash their program if I have a firewall enabled.</p>\n</div>",

If you really want to pursue this, I'd recommend getting in touch with TERA's support staff.</span>",
