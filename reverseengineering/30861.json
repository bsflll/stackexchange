I did this by injecting Frida gadget and resigning the app some time ago. What iOS version is installed on the phone? Besides that I would first try to read the calculated address and check if you really find the expected host name before overwriting it.</span>",

Have you tried changing it to something of the same length just to confirm that is not the issue? Also what errors did you get when it failed with frida?</span>",
