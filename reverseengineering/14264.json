    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>While debugging inside a loaded <code>exe</code> process (using <code>IDA Pro</code> as a disassembler, and <code>WinDbg</code> as a debugger) I can right click the code view and select <code>Graph view</code>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IC3DL.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IC3DL.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>That will switch it to this nice code-flow view that is much easier to read:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ESTGC.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ESTGC.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>But if I step into a system DLL (in this case <code>mshtml.dll</code>) I can't seem to get that same <code>Graph view</code> command, and instead I get this generic view:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HIJDJ.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HIJDJ.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>So I was wondering, if there's a way to enable <code>Graph view</code> for a system DLL as well?</p>\n</div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>IDA can only display functions in graph mode, so in order to see that code as a graph, you must:</p>\n<h3>Find the start of the function</h3>\n<p>Search for a prologue, such as <code>push ebp</code>, <code>mov ebp, esp</code><sup>1</sup>, and find the start of the function. If it gets hard, you can always load debug symbols<sup>2</sup> and find the start like that.</p>\n<p>1: Actually, most Microsoft DLLs are compiled with the hotpatch option, which means that the prologue is prefixed with <code>mov edi, edi</code> (<a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110921-00/?p=9583\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here's why</a>), so searching for that instruction should be very easy.</p>\n<p>2: In the WinDbg command line, write <code>.symfix</code> to fix the symbols path and <code>.reload /f mshtml.dll</code> to reload the symbols for that module. Alternatively, go to <code>Debugger</code> -&gt; <code>Debugger windows</code> -&gt; <code>Modules list</code>, find <code>mshtml.dll</code> in the window, right-click it and choose \"Load debug symbols\". Then, simply use the <code>Functions</code> window or the status bar to find the start of the function.</p>\n<h3>Make it a function</h3>\n<p>Put the cursor at the start, and press <kbd>P</kbd>. Now press <kbd>Space</kbd> and you'll be in graph mode!</p>\n</div>",

What I didn't realize is that it takes <code>Ida Pro</code> some time before \"Graph view\" option becomes available, i.e. it evidently needs to scan the module after symbols are loaded. After that it will work just fine!</span>",
