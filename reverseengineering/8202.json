The point here is to recover precisely the encryption scheme of CTB-Locker to see if there is a way to break it.</span>",

Most of them wanted to know if it’s possible to restore the compromised files without paying the ransom. The answer is simple: it’s impossible without knowing the Master key! That key resides on the malicious server and it’s the only way to restore every single compromised file.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And, follow a full analysis of the encryption scheme of CTB-Locker. A good reading for anybody wants to know more about it !</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://zairon.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/ctb-locker-encryptiondecryption-scheme-in-details/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CTB-Locker encryption/decryption scheme in details</a>, by Zairon, February 17, 2015.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
