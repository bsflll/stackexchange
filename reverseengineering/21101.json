Yet IDA, Ollydbg and Capstone decode this instruction as the above.</p>\n<p>This instruction appears in a section of code that is overlapped to obfuscate it, so I'm pretty certain the unsupported prefix is simply there to support the overlap.</p>\n<p>My question is how does the processor handle this instruction? Does it just ignore the prefix, throw an illegal instruction, or ignore the instruction entirely?</p>\n</div>",

With compiler, runtime library and operating system\n  support, Intel MPX brings increased security to software by checking\n  pointer references whose normal compile-time intentions are\n  maliciously exploited at runtime due to buffer overflows.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Intel MPX provides four new registers named bnd0-bnd3 that are use to set bounds to avoid memory attack. I recommend you to read <a href=\"https://intel-mpx.github.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.00719.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a>, and <a href=\"https://xem.github.io/minix86/manual/intel-x86-and-64-manual-vol1/o_7281d5ea06a5b67a-398.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a>.</p>\n<p>Getting back to your question. I think is going to work as a normal jmp because the bound registers are not initialized. How I know that? Your opcode is EB and if you read the articles you will read this.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An application compiled to use Intel MPX will use the REPNE (F2H)\n  prefix (denoted by BND) for all forms of near  CALL, near RET, near\n  JMP, short &amp; near Jcc instructions (BND+CALL, BND+RET, BND+JMP,\n  BND+Jcc). See <a href=\"https://xem.github.io/minix86/manual/intel-x86-and-64-manual-vol1/o_7281d5ea06a5b67a-399.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Table  17-4</a> for specific opcodes. <strong>All far CALL, RET and\n  JMP instructions plus short JMP (JMP rel 8, opcode EB) instructions \n  will never cause bound registers to be initialized</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reading that I also understand why IDA was not giving you wrong code.</p>\n</div>",
