    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to rescue some data from our hardware. On the board I have a pair of Samsung k9f4g08u0d NAND chips. Each chip has been dumped to include every block, including the spare areas. If I invert every byte on the dumps and interleave both chips (such that the output is <code>chipA[0],chipB[0],chipA[1],chipB[1] ...</code> etc) I can see that there is ascii text throughout the dump. Based on the data sheets for 1 chip I know the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blocks: 4096 per device</li>\n<li>Pages: 64 per block</li>\n<li>Page Size: (2K data + 64 spare) = 2112 bytes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But because the chips are interleaved together there are actually (4K data + 128 spare) = 4224 bytes of data per page.</p>\n<p>The spare area is Adjacent, rather than separate, so each section of 512 bytes of data in a page is immediately followed by 16 bytes of spare data (or out-of-band: OOB).</p>\n<pre>\nAdjacent layout:\n+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+\n| 512 | 16 | 512 | 16 | 512 | 16 | 512 | 16 | 512 | 16 | 512 | 16 | 512 | 16 | 512 | 16 |\n+--^--+-+--+--^--+-+--+--^--+-+--+--^--+-+--+--^--+-+--+--^--+-+--+--^--+-+--+--^--+-+--+\n   |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |\n   +----+     +----+     +----+     +----+     +----+     +----+     +----+     +----+</pre>\n<pre>\nSeparate layout:\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n| 512 | 512 | 512 | 512 | 512 | 512 | 512 | 512 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 16 |\n+--^--+--^--+--^--+--^--+--^--+--^--+--^--+--^--+-+--+-+--+-+--+-+--+-+--+-+--+-+--+-+--+\n   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\n   +----------------------------------------------+    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\n         |     |     |     |     |     |     |         |    |    |    |    |    |    |\n         +---------------------------------------------+    |    |    |    |    |    |\n               |     |     |     |     |     |              |    |    |    |    |    |\n               +--------------------------------------------+    |    |    |    |    |\n                     |     |     |     |     |                   |    |    |    |    |\n                     +-------------------------------------------+    |    |    |    |\n                           |     |     |     |                        |    |    |    |\n                           +------------------------------------------+    |    |    |\n                                 |     |     |                             |    |    |\n                                 +-----------------------------------------+    |    |\n                                       |     |                                  |    |\n                                       +----------------------------------------+    |\n                                             |                                       |\n                                             +---------------------------------------+</pre>\n<p>When only analyzing the spare area, I can see the first 3 bytes seem to increment. I think the first two bytes are the block number and I believe the 3rd byte is the page number. After the \"page number\" value is <code>0x3F</code> it resets to <code>0x00</code> and the \"block number\" increments. I know nothing about what the remaining 13 bytes are but I assume some, if not all, are ECC bytes.</p>\n<p>The problem is there are some blocks that appear multiple times in the dump. For example, there are three sections with \"block number\" of <code>0x2C47</code> and I know this is probably because of wear leveling with NAND; however, I don't know how to read the pages/blocks that are good so I can mount/extract it. It seems to follow no standard, and believe me - I have searched a lot haha. The system was running QNX6.</p>\n</div>",
