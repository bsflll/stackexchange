    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to RE a Novatek NT96650 based trail cam. This device is circa 2012, and has a MIPS32 24Kec core.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have copies of the firmware,</li>\n<li>I have extracted the contents of flash,</li>\n<li>and have a pretty good assembly language listing of it from Ghidra.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But I am now stuck trying to get any further. The listing shows the detail of (what I assume is) device drivers for memory-mapped peripherals, but the <strong>Novatek</strong> device and dev environment are not documented. Without the ability to (say) isolate LCD management code or flash access code, I am really struggling to make any sense of it.</p>\n<p>I do not have any low-level access to the device, or the ability to upload amended firmware. Does anyone have any suggestions on other information sources I could use or techniques I could try? I did wonder if Novatek's SoC architecture is maybe similar to other MIPS vendor's devices, and I might get some clues from that. Does anyone have any idea if that idea is a runner, and if so where I could look?</p>\n</div>",
