How can I debug the following file with an older version? I know I can try to compile it an older one, but it seems to me like a very daunting task. I tried to load an older libc by downloading one from libc.blukat.me with pwntools, but it doesn't see it.</p>\n<p>edit: the target cpu arch is x86 64bit.\nThank you!</p>\n</div>",

Suppose you can find the original media for <a href=\"https://repology.org/project/glibc/versions\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Fedora 26</a>, that might work. A chroot and building glibc yourself could also be an option, but you seem reluctant to do that. If you are ready to tinker <a href=\"http://www.bitwagon.com/rtldi/rtldi.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> could be worth a shot.</span>",

See, the issue is that even though you may be able to get a version that formally carries the version number 2.25, it stands to reason that - unless you happen to get the earliest available package for that distro - you will get something that is patched <i>somehow</i>. So building stuff from scratch is typically the easiest with your requirements. Projects like LFS, Yocto and Buildroot make it almost trivial to build complete systems (suitable for chroot) tailored to your needs.</span>",

You have a few options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run the program in a Docker container with an OS that corresponds to the target libc. (For example, <code>docker run -it -v $(pwd):/run ubuntu:20.04 /run/binary</code>). This has the advantage that if your binary depends on any other system libraries, you can get the right versions via <code>apt</code> or similar.</li>\n<li>Extract both <code>ld.so</code> and <code>libc.so</code> from a compatible version or libc package (e.g. <a href=\"https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/amd64/libc6/download\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/amd64/libc6/download</a>) and run a command like <code>LD_PRELOAD=./libc.so ./ld.so ./binary</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that if you use a <code>libc</code> without using the corresponding <code>ld.so</code> (for example, if you do <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./binary</code> and the <code>libc</code> in the directory does not match your system <code>ld.so</code>), you will probably get segfaults or unexpected behaviour, as <code>libc</code> and <code>ld.so</code> use shared data structures that change between versions.</p>\n</div>",
