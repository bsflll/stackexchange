    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm making a Linux module (my first one) for a closed-source, enclosed (no hardware access) device.\nUsing Wireshark I found what to send and where, so I tried the following command in user space Python and it works:</p>\n<p><code>handle._controlTransfer(0x21, 0x09, 0x0300, 3, data, 8, 0) #packet sent, device reacts</code></p>\n<p>Sadly I can't get it to work in the kernel module:</p>\n<p><code>usb_control_msg(dev, usb_sndctrlpipe(dev, 0), 0x09, 0x21, 0x0300, 3, data, 8, 0); //packet sent, device doesn't react</code></p>\n<p>even by creating the urb myself:</p>\n<pre><code>urb = usb_alloc_urb(0, GFP_KERNEL);\ncr = kmalloc(sizeof(struct usb_ctrlrequest), GFP_KERNEL);\ncr-&gt;bRequestType = USB_TYPE_CLASS | USB_RECIP_INTERFACE;\ncr-&gt;bRequest = 0x09;\ncr-&gt;wValue = cpu_to_le16(0x0300);\ncr-&gt;wIndex = cpu_to_le16(3);\ncr-&gt;wLength = cpu_to_le16(8);\nusb_fill_control_urb(urb, dev, usb_sndctrlpipe(dev, 0), (void *)cr, data, 8, urb_callback, context);\nusb_submit_urb(urb, GFP_ATOMIC);\nkfree(cr);\nusb_free_urb(urb);\n//packet sent, device doesn't react\n</code></pre>\n<p>When I say the device \"reacts\" I mean it flashes with another color so there is no ambiguity in the success of the command.</p>\n<p>I logged everything with Wireshark and the packets are identical (except for <code>urb_id</code> and <code>urb_ts_*</code>)</p>\n<p>Would you have any advice for me? Something I forgot or how to debug more?</p>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>\n<p>Full working Python code</p>\n<pre><code>context = usb1.USBContext()\nhandle = context.openByVendorIDAndProductID(VENDOR_ID, PRODUCT_ID)\nusb1.libusb1.libusb_set_auto_detach_kernel_driver(handle._USBDeviceHandle__handle, 0)\nusb1.libusb1.libusb_set_auto_detach_kernel_driver(handle._USBDeviceHandle__handle, 3)\nhandle.claimInterface(0)\nhandle.claimInterface(3)\nhandle._controlTransfer(0x21, 0x09, 0x0300, 3, data, 8, 0)\nhandle.releaseInterface(3)\nhandle.releaseInterface(0)\n</code></pre>\n</div>",

Maybe the problem isn't with the data itself, maybe the device need to be initializated somehow before sending the payload?</span>",

I put some logs and the usb_control_msg line above but got the same results.  Also I realised something new, with Python there is another packet prior to the correct one : an interrupt coming from the device right after the first interface is claimed. I don't think it's relevant though.</span>",
