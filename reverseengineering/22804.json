    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Ok so I am total noob here. I wanted to play with the bin from an instrument cluster I work on a lot. I was able to pull the bin off the MCU with a J-link. If I erase the chip and flash it with a bin from it or another cluster it works but if I change anything in the bin it won't work.. Don't worry I am not messing with the Odo value thats stored on an EEprom and easy to change lol.</p>\n<p>Learned a little about bin patching via youtube/google and ran the bin through binwalk. doing  that binwalk says </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Decimal: 211720  HEX:0x33b08 Description: crc32.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm guessing this CRC not matching is making it fail to boot. If I look at the bin with HxD I don't see anything that matches what Binwalk is saying but I am probably looking at it wrong. Where do I find the CRC in this bin from what address is this crc checking because if I use HxD or online CRC generators It doesnt match anything in the bin also...</p>\n<p>I am sure I am not describing this all correctly I am still learning and climbing mt. stupid.</p>\n<p>All I want to do is change some of the error messages to say something funny. I am just doing this for the novelty and to learn something new.</p>\n<p>Linked Github with the bin, <a href=\"https://github.com/garnerm91/07-14-GM-cluster-BINs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Github link</a></p>\n<p>BTW all edits I make are one for one changes so I am not shifting anything around in the bin. The attached is unedited and works. </p>\n</div>",
