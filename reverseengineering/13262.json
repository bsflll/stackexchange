I made some changes to the WebUI of the router, and now I want to put it back together into a .bin file so that I can flash my router with it. How do I go about it?</p>\n</div>",

From the link:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This isn't a binwalk related question, as binwalk does not re-build binary images. However, you might want to take a look at the firmware mod kit, which uses binwalk for extraction and can re-build many router firmware images automatically (it may even work on this particular firmware): <a href=\"https://code.google.com/archive/p/firmware-mod-kit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://code.google.com/archive/p/firmware-mod-kit/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now unfortunately, <em>firmware-mod-kit</em> hasn't been updated for a while, but is probably your closest bet. Otherwise, you may want to use the output of <em>binwalk</em> and try to \"cut and paste\" original and modified sections of the firmware file using the <a href=\"http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dd.1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">dd</a>. Note that this will likely work only with very simple firmware images, as anything with checksums and sections/file length will have to be modified manually. I was able to make it happen in very limited cases where the firmware was mostly a header with a file system appended to it.</p>\n</div>",
