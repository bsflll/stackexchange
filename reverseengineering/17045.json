            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>The answer is complete for the questioner's #2, but let's dig a little-deeper into #1.</p>\n<p>There are other ways to analyze malware which implements anti-virtualization, vm-detection, sandbox detection, and sandbox evasion techniques. However, does the malware also include environmentally-keyed detection or evasion techniques, such as the ones outlined here -- <a href=\"https://www.vmray.com/blog/sandbox-evasion-techniques-part-4/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.vmray.com/blog/sandbox-evasion-techniques-part-4/</a> -- (aka context-aware malware aka environment-sensitive)?</p>\n<p>Cuckoo is an excellent sandbox for features and behavior extraction, so it's not always wise to jump to windbg or other classic bare-metal debugging (although sometimes it is wise to do this). If the built-in cloaking solution for Cuckoo, <a href=\"https://github.com/jbremer/vmcloak/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">vmcloak</a>, can prevent the malware from detecting or evading it then you still get all of the benefits of Cuckoo.</p>\n<p>Some of these can be elicited early-on during static analysis or even during simple Yara triage. There are also advanced ways of performing Yara triage that will catch malicious processes in-the act, such as Godaddy's procfilter -- <a href=\"https://github.com/godaddy/yara-rules/blob/master/features/virtualbox_detection.yara\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/godaddy/yara-rules/blob/master/features/virtualbox_detection.yara</a></p>\n<p>If you use dynamic analysis to elicit the sandbox detection, evasion, or context-aware malware techniques, be sure to know your limitations. <a href=\"https://github.com/secrary/makin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">makin</a> is a good starting framework to determine those anti-debugging capabilities.</p>\n<p>A lot of this depends on your goal with malware. What do you want to know about them; what questions do you have? Do you need to extract Proactive Threat Indicators for internal-only blacklists or will you be sharing them? Do you need to deconfig RATs that are operating on systems in your network? For example, a focus on nation-state RATs might warrant a jump to the -- <a href=\"https://github.com/ctxis/CAPE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/ctxis/CAPE</a> -- tool or similar.</p>\n<p>If you want a simple solution to scaling sandbox-based automation with stealth functionality that surpasses vmcloak, check out -- <a href=\"http://drakvuf.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">drakvuf.com</a></p>\n<p>I am definitely interested in more of the bare-metal techniques (especially the AMT RAM cloner!) spoken to by @ekse in the primary answer. These are also very-valuable! However, just because you have bare metal doesn't mean that context-aware malware techniques such as time bombs, logic bombs, and specifically-targeted malicious logic won't be an additional problem -- you'll have to account for them!</p>\n</div>",
