The problem is that you need to modelize so much from the environment (system calls answers, interaction with other programs, ...) that most of them also use concrete execution when the program venture outside of their model.</p>\n<p>But, you should look for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_execution\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">symbolic execution</a> tools such as <a href=\"https://angr.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">angr</a>, <a href=\"https://miasm.re/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">miasm</a> and many others.</p>\n</div>",
