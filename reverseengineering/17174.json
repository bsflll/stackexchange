If the first time you run IDA is with the <code>-S</code> flag, IDA will hang on that screen and you'll need to manually accept it (either in that execution or a previous one). You could also work around it by manually creating the marker IDA uses, but i'll let you figure that out yourself.</p></li>\n<li><p>While running, IDA pops up multiple other dialogs you'll need to accept, answer and approve (the disassemble a new file, one loading symbols, etc...) those may be automatically dismissed by providing the <code>-A</code> flag (A stands for autonomous). This won't avoid the license agreement mentioned in the previous paragraph, and will even make it hidden and harder to accept.</p></li>\n<li><p>Your script may no be behaving with IDA. This basically means that IDA is designed as an interactive tool and not a command line tool, and one side-effect of that is that it will not automatically perform a peaceful exit once the executed script is done. You'll have to call <code>idc.Exit(exitcode)</code> when your script finished, or otherwise it'll just hang in there forever. You may also want to consider calling AutoWait()` at the beginning of your script.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>P.S.</p>\n<p>You may want to consider the <code>-A</code> and/or <code>-c</code> (and there's a small chance you'll want to look at <code>-a</code> as well) flags instead of the <code>-t</code> one (which I don't think will do what you desire).</p>\n</div>",
