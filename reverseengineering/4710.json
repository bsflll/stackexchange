After looking at how an executable is made, I found that the variable's content was stored in a data segment, since it's a global variable. With p7zip, I got this data segment, but is there a way to parse it or to know where each fragments begin and end by disassembling the EXE?  (I'm knew to reverse engineering, so I'm just wondering how everything is working.)</span>",
