Adding the size of the return address to this value might clean up that portion of the decompilation output.</p>\n<p>To see/edit that setting you can right-click on the function name in its definition (for some reason I don't see it when I try from a call site) in the Listing view.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1h0u4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"screenshot-of-edit-function-purge-menu\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1h0u4.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

You could try a fresh load of the PE and just make the change there? It's hard to say without seeing the sample itself.</span>",
