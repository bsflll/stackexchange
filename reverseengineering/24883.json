I don't think you're able to declare a variable-sized array in C. The compiler wouldn't know how many bytes to allocated for it. That's why there is a length field, to let the programmer know how many elements are in the array which would most likely be malloc'd</span>",

From Ghidra help (search for \"flexible array\"):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A flexible array is added to the end of a structure by adding a last row specified by the base DataType (e.g. char) then invoking the array action and specifying an element count of 0.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So you can't create a flexible array in 1 step.  Enter the data type for the variable-length structure member first.  Then select the row for that new structure member and press the <code>[</code> key to invoke the array action.  Entering 0 as the element count in the resulting dialog will create a flexible array.</p>\n<p>Ghidra flexible arrays have limited functionality.  From Ghidra help:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The use of flexible array components is not currently reflected in decompiler results or listing reference markup. Its primary purpose if to reflect the C/C++ source definition of a structure with correct alignment and structure sizing.</p>\n<p>While C/C++ support flexible arrays anywhere within a structure, Ghidra only supports the case where it is the last structure component.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
