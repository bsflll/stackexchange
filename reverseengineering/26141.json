    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I was trying out a simple heap overflow example (<a href=\"http://highaltitudehacks.com/2020/09/05/arm64-reversing-and-exploitation-part-1-arm-instruction-set-heap-overflow/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://highaltitudehacks.com/2020/09/05/arm64-reversing-and-exploitation-part-1-arm-instruction-set-heap-overflow/</a>) but replicated the relevant code in x86/x64 to understand it better. This is the code I used</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    char *name = malloc(0x6);\n    char *command = malloc(0x6);\n    strcpy(command,\"whoami\");\n    strcpy(name,\"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzls -l\");\n\n    system(command);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I noticed that if I compiled the code and ran it normally, I will get system to execute \"ls -l\" and does a folder listing. However, if I was stepping through the binary using lldb from start to midway and proceed to continue the rest of the execution while inside lldb, I will see \"whoami\" executed instead.</p>\n<p>I am testing this on a Mac OS and I am not sure if this is due to lldb or Mac OS behaviour?</p>\n</div>",

Just curious though, my rationale for putting this in RE is because I was reversing it and the binary's behaviour looks different under lldb.
