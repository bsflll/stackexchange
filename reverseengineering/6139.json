    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>A week ago, I've loaded an app into Olly, as an exercise and out of curiosity. It has been successfully loaded and I've found out that there's no protection of any kind applied (all strings are \"plaintext\", no anti-debugging techniques, simply nothing).</p>\n<p>Today, I wanted to come back to said program and suddenly I'm unable to load it into Olly - even before Olly starts its analysis (the bar in the bottom of the window), the process terminates and I land in ntdll.dll.\nIf run without a debugger, the exe works fine - there seem to be no problems.</p>\n<p>I'm really puzzled because since then I've made two changes to my PC: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Installed Nod32 4 (disabled it, nothing changed)</li>\n<li>Downloaded WDK 8.1 from this page:\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg454513.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg454513.aspx</a> (uninstalled, didn't help either)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've also tried this on another PC which hasn't been even powered on for the last month and is basically a clean Win7 install, still to no avail.</p>\n<p>At the first glance, this probably looks like battling a TLS Callback protection, but as I said, I'm <strong>certain</strong> the exe has no protection at all, as I've been able to play around with it a couple days ago.</p>\n<p>Are there any 'common' causes for such behavior?</p>\n</div>",
