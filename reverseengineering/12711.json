    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've been slowly working on getting into the workings of a set-top box. I hit a snag when the firmware that it downloads is encrypted. I managed to find some pictures of the circuit board (but haven't opened up my device <em>yet</em>) and I have been reading up on communicating over the on-board serial port. I have zero experience with this, other than what I've read on <a href=\"http://devttys0.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://devttys0.com</a> and <a href=\"http://jcjc-dev.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jcjc-dev.com/</a> and various other sites.</p>\n<p>So my question is this - Since I'm such a newbie at this, is anyone willing to look at these pictures and help me figure out where a serial port might be hidden? </p>\n<p>Pictures @ <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qzd2jpjlv1ieehu/0Am6ttruYe\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qzd2jpjlv1ieehu/0Am6ttruYe</a></p>\n<p>Any thoughts? Thanks for your time!</p>\n</div>",

So thankfully I don't need to find the serial ports (for now). Thanks for your answer, Jonas, I'll happily accept your answer!</span>",

At a glance I can't find a port in the photos. You should try to get some really high resolution top and bottom pictures.</p>\n</div>",
