My intention is to replace the sounds with my own. However, I have been unable to identify the chip and therefore cannot interface with it.</p>\n<p>Here is a picture and schematic of the board, developed using a multimeter in continuity mode.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wTIYJ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"circuit board\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wTIYJ.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NLEWH.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"board schematic\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NLEWH.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Here is a closeup of the chip.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YePfS.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"chip\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YePfS.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>I believe the markings are as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>JFK8-4\nP04003\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is also a \"triforce\" logo, for a company which I have not identified yet.</p>\n<p>Pins 1 and 8 are particularly interesting, as they are not connected to anything. I assume they were used to program the chip, but am not able to identify a protocol if any exists.</p>\n<p>It would be appreciated if anyone can locate a datasheet. I would also be happy with advice on identifying the function of the unconnected pins.</p>\n</div>",
