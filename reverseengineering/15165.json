I have found a memory mapped (via mmap2) region which contains the file I'm interested in. I've created a memory snapshot and I'd like to copy this specific area into a file.</p>\n<p>Sadly I haven't been able to find good instructions on how to do this, any help would be most appreciated. </p>\n</div>",

I'm only suggesting this because IDA's not that good at exporting EXEs. You may also want to try ollydbg with a dumping plugin.</span>",
