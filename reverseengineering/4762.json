Given the high-level overview from the source code, one could spot the function and possibly the line where the instruction belongs, but so far I know no program that could do the same.

In certain cases, yes. Modern compilers tend to optimize code too aggressively. Even having all the debug info the compiler produces is sometimes not enough to map the precise location of the given insn, which can be demonstrated by trying to do source-level debugging on such an application.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Didn't properly notice you build the binary by yourself.
