    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm working to adapt an stress excercise test software so that it can work with a treadmill that uses a different communication protocol.</p>\n<p>The communicate via a RS232 cable, with a USB-RS232 adapting device on the laptop end.</p>\n<p>I have created a pair of virtual ports using com0com and have written a program in VB (using Visual Studio) that can open, read and write on the virtual ports. The purpose being that the program can work as a translator.</p>\n<p>I have the treadmill protocol but not the software one, so I'm trying to listen to what the software tells to the virtual port and figure out what protocol it's using.</p>\n<p>Is this option viable? Are there any further reading material / software I could use?</p>\n<p>The only messages I got sof far were:</p>\n<p>\"?\" when first running the test</p>\n<p>\"ìù 015ñ 000\" when I set the treadmill on/off</p>\n<p>If I don't answer, the software displays the message \"treadmill failed\". If I send any array of characters, it doesn't display the message and appears to start the test.</p>\n</div>",
