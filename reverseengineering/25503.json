How do they know if it's a valid instruction and which it is? I don't imagine they just had every single instruction stored in a table as that'd be very inefficient.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Found this source online that I think does this in around 700 lines (<a href=\"https://github.com/btbd/disassembler/blob/master/disassembler.c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/btbd/disassembler/blob/master/disassembler.c</a>). If something like this is possible, why are there others that have a lot more code and logic?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div>",
