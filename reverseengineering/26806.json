I think I need to import all of the raw files into the same program tree. I've tried using <code>analyzeHeadless</code> to import all of the shared libraries into the project, but I don't see way to place them into an existing program using that tool (it instead creates a new program for each file). Let me know if I'm doing something wrong.</p>\n</div>",

Given the <code>dll</code> tag I am assuming you are concerned about <code>.dll</code> files.</p>\n<p>On importing a program for the first time you can select <code>Options</code>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8o7Xa.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt='Picture of the \"Import $filename\" dialog' src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8o7Xa.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>and then activate \"Load External Libraries\"\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/L7EOL.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/L7EOL.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Configure the paths properly via <code>Edit Paths</code>.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nQrPM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nQrPM.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>The paths are searched for shared libraries that are specified as imports in actual program you are importing. If you have already imported the program you can still fix this with ELF files as described in <a href=\"https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues/396\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this issue</a> but for some reason there is no premade script for PE files, i.e. <code>.dll</code>s. There might still be a way to do this manually though, the idea is just to also have imported the relevant DLL file so you can link it to a program that requires it as an external library. The relevant functions will then be properly linked.</p>\n</div>",
