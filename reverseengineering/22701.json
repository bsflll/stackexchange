If you dedicate one register as a register that's likely going to contain an address, you could physically optimize the wiring so fetching data from memory pointed at by <code>x8</code> is fast. You don't want to do that for all of them, so you pick one register with special treatment and make using it as a memory-pointing register a convention.</span>",
