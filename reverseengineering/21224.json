Given that I've a full range of elements to monitor I was trying to find a way to programmatically add such breakpoints. </p>\n<p>To achieve a similar result I've used to instrument the <code>setAttribute()</code> function of such DOM elements replacing it with a wrapper that uses the <code>debugger;</code> instruction to trigger the debugger. Anyway this approach fails when dealing with innerHTML or innerText assignments given that there is no way of achieving operator overloading in js. </p>\n<p>Can someone suggest me a practical solution?</p>\n</div>",
