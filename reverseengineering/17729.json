However, without enabled optimizations, the compiler always stores parameters and local variables in the local stack frame (remember that the stack grown downwards - i.e., towards smaller addresses - on ARM).</p>\n<pre><code> add     fp, sp, #0\n</code></pre>\n<p>This instruction doesn't set fp to 0, but rather to the current value of sp. fp serves as a reference to local information on the stack that remains constant during the execution of F. The old frame pointer, parameters and local variables are then stored at negative offsets from fp.</p>\n<pre><code> sub     sp, sp, #20\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, 20 Bytes of space are reserved on the stack, so that subsequent stack operations (e.g. calling another function from inside of F) do not modify the local stack frame of your function F.</p>\n<pre><code> str     r0, [fp, #-16]\n</code></pre>\n<p>This copies r0 (Parameter a) into the local stack frame at address fp-16. The complete stack frame looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code> fp- 4: old fp\n fp- 8: local variable c\n fp-12: local variable i\n fp-16: parameter a\n fp-20: parameter b\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that sp points to fp-20 (since sp is copied to fp at the beginning of the function and sp is then decremented by 20). This is correct, since on ARM processors, the sp always points to the last used element on the stack, i.e. the next push operation decrements sp first (to fp-24) and writes data to the new sp address.</p>\n</div>",

Let's have a look at the instructions one by one.</p>\n<pre><code>add     fp, sp, #0\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is an <em>add</em>, so the operation is <code>fp = sp+0</code>, or <code>fp=sp</code>. An analog on x86 would be <code>mov ebp, esp</code></p>\n<pre><code>sub     sp, sp, #20\n</code></pre>\n<p>This would look like <code>sub esp, 20h</code> on x86. Basically, it allocates 0x20 bytes of stack space for local variables.</p>\n<pre><code>str     r0, [fp, #-16]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Unlike most ARM instructions, here the left operand (<code>r0</code>) is <em>not</em> the destination, but <em>source</em>. This instruction <em>stores</em> (<code>str</code>) the value of the register r0 at the location <code>fp-0x16</code>. An x86 analog would look like:</p>\n<pre><code>mov [ebp-10h], eax\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, as you can see, it <em>does use</em> the value of <code>r0</code> as an input and only stores it on the stack as a temporary variables (later it retrieved again to perform the addition). The same happens with the second argument in <code>r1</code>. If you add some optimization flags for the compiler (e.g. <code>-O1</code> or <code>-O2</code>), it's likely that it will manage to perform the operation without having to store \nintermediate results on the stack. Here's the result I get for <code>-O1</code> with GCC 7.2.1:</p>\n<pre><code>F(int, int):\n  add r1, r0, r1\n  add r0, r1, r1, lsl #2\n  add r0, r1, r0, lsl #1\n  bx lr\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, there is no stack involved anymore, and the compiler even managed to convert a loop of additions into an optimized multiplication-add using shifts.</p>\n</div>",
