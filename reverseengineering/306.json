It's a standard-looking comic though without much action, but the picture's alt title says \"Wait for it.\". I waited but nothing happened (tried in Opera and IE9) so I took a look at the page source.</p>\n<p>Next to the picture's <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag there was a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> which included the following URL:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://imgs.xkcd.com/static/time07.min.js\">http://imgs.xkcd.com/static/time07.min.js</a></p>\n<p>I tried to make sense of it, but I can't figure it out. Can someone explain how it works and what was supposed to happen?</p>\n</div>",

I hope someone can post an overview of the script's main parts and how they interact. I, for one, am lost in all the callbacks and closures.</span>",

The bulk of the script seems to be an implementation of EventSource - which, while important, is not terribly interesting for our purposes, so I've omitted it here. After some Googling around, I am in fact fairly certain that the EventSource implementation used here is <a href=\"https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource\">https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource</a> - after minifying and beautifying that code, it looks very similar to what shows up in time07.min.js.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As far as I can tell, it has no magic in it and serves just as a simple way for the server to let the client know when there is a new image. </p>\n</div>",
