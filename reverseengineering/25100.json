So I don't have the source code with me. Anyways, I am used to seeing codes that start like the one below, and is clear to me what is actually going on there. </p>\n<pre><code>push ebp\nmov ebp,esp\nsub esp,10h\n</code></pre>\n<p>But my worries came when I saw one that looks like this below</p>\n<pre><code>mov edi,dword ptr [0E9A474h];\nimul eax,dword ptr [edi+5AF4h],70h;\ncmp dword ptr [ebp+eax-35DCh],0h;\nje some_location\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the prologue for the function doesn't have any instruction like this</p>\n<pre><code>sub esp,10h\n</code></pre>\n<p>At least I could have known the size of the stack the function is using for local variable storage.</p>\n<p>And additional question is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is this a good programming as far as assembly language is a concern?</li>\n<li>Can there be any collision in memory between this function and another?</li>\n<li>Is it possible to know the limit of this function in the stack? Either the Size</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

Yes i suspect maybe another function is responsible for setting this value or maybe within the program itself. But what exactly is setting this value in the stack for this other function to test it. I am really confuse here. Any idea i will greatly appreciate</span>",

It will not stop you from accessing (even modifying) other function's memory as long as your program has enough privileges to do that. I think this answers your first two questions.</p>\n<p>Regarding your third question, in general, it is not possible. However, usually, you can look for the instructions modifying <code>esp</code> (like <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, etc.) and infer it from them. If you showed us the entire function, it would be easier to tell the size in this particular case.</p>\n<p>In fact, the instructions you have shared with us don't seem to access local variables of this function or of any other either. I don't know what are the values stored in <code>edi</code> and <code>ebp</code> registers, but I guess they point to some dynamically allocated data on heap.</p>\n</div>",

Indeed you have help me. thanks</span>",
