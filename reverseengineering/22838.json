    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've been researching on how to modify the textures of Crazy Taxi 3 for a while now and I have pretty much hit a brick wall.<br/>\nThe game stores its texture assets in <code>.art</code> files, which, from what I understand, contain several textures in each of them, due to there being many banks of textures. There is also a <code>Sprites</code> folder containing these files that indicate the same.<br/>\nA quick Google search led me to believe that this may be the <a href=\"http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/ART_(AOL_compressed_image)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">AOL Image Format</a> used in its software, however AOL 9.0 kept throwing errors when trying to open the files. No dice.<br/>\nAfter searching more I found that <a href=\"http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/ART_(PFS:_First_Publisher)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PFS: First Publisher used this extension as well for its clip art</a>. The files do not exactly match <a href=\"http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/ART_(PFS:_First_Publisher)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the structure documented in this wiki</a>, but every .art file has something that looks like a table of information <em>in that structure</em> at the start, and then possibly image data. I have also observed that the string <code>GXTX</code> is repeated many times, may suggest that it might be a pointer of the beginning of a new image.<br/>\nOther than that, I have no idea how this file format may work. It seems like it is uncompressed image data, however after opening it in many programs I have given up and need help.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 1</strong>:<br/>\nI have found a great tool called <a href=\"https://forum.xentax.com/blog/?p=821\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Texturefinder</a> that helped me figure out that these textures are compressed with DXT, however I am unsure which version, as half of a certain texture bank may look great in DXT1, while another half looks jumbled until I switch to DXT3 or 5. The container format possibly has information on which algorithm to use in a table before the images, as at the start of each texture file there is plenty of non-image data, or at least data that this tool can not decide. Here are a few examples of this working in one algorithm vs the other:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Ukd5l.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"DXT1a @ 512px width\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Ukd5l.png\"/></a> <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jhI9l.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"DXT3 @ 256px width\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jhI9l.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>So, here is an updated list of what I have gathered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>.art</code> files contain the string <code>GXTX</code> many times, usually followed by about 12 bytes that have small values (something like <code>80 00 80 00 00 80 00 00 01 00 05 00</code>), likely an image separator</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wiki.polycount.com/wiki/DXT\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The files contain many textures compressed with DXT</a></li>\n<li>Textures may be compressed with differing forms of DXT (possibly DXT1 and DXT3)</li>\n<li>Textures in banks may have differing widths/heights</li>\n<li>Every texture bank has a sizeable amount of non-image data at the start</li>\n<li>The textures are upside down</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://anonfiles.com/35E491Jcn5/samples_zip\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here are some more samples for comparison.</a></p>\n</div>",
