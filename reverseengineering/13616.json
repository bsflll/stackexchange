Everytime I tried to use it, it produces very large zip file that fill the disk until I reach a disk full error (using Linux).</p>\n<p>I am trying to understand what I did wrong, so here is a simple scenario hopefully to understand what I am doing wrong.</p>\n<p>Steps:</p>\n<pre><code>$ dd if=/dev/zero of=head bs=1 count=512\n$ dd if=/dev/zero of=tail bs=1 count=512\n$ wget https://github.com/devttys0/binwalk/archive/master.zip\n$ cat head binwalk-master.zip tail &gt; full\n$ binwalk -z -C demo -D 'zip archive:zip:unzip %e' full\n</code></pre>\n<p>Could someone please let me know why I am seeing the following:</p>\n<pre><code>$ find demo\ndemo\ndemo/_full.extracted\ndemo/_full.extracted/483BD.zip\ndemo/_full.extracted/200.zip\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where is this file coming from ?

But, because there is not any information in the header about the size, the worst case should be used and the whole remaining file should be written out.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because the header identification cannot be perfect and false positives are possible, you cannot assume that the second header means the end of the first zip.</p>\n<p>If you want to extract the zip files without tail, you can do the followings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reverse the structure of the binary file. Generally every image part starts with a header with exact size information. You have to identify the header and size or offset values in it.</li>\n<li>If you works with a flash image, then you can perform entropy analysis, which helps to split the whole image into smaller parts.</li>\n<li>In a flash image, the parts are generally separated with several <code>0xFF</code> bytes from each others. You can also use this information to extract the image parts.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
