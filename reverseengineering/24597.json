    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am writing a script in IDA Pro. I noticed that when I rename functions with \"n\" in the <em>disassembly</em> view, that same function is not being renamed in the <em>decompilation</em>. </p>\n<p>I have never noticed this before. Is this normal operating behavior? If so, how can you automatically transfer the names from the disassembly view to the decompilation view? </p>\n<p>(I have notice this also happens when I rename functions with a script). </p>\n</div>",
