Its basic ideas are not a trade secret and are in fact described in the <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/ppt/decompilers_and_beyond_white_paper.pdf\">white paper</a> by Ilfak Guilfanov which accompanies <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00EqvVtLdJo\">the presentation</a> he gave in 2008.</p>\n<p>I'll paste the relevant part here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Local variable allocation</h3>\n<p>This phase uses the data flow analysis to connect registers from different basic blocks in order to convert\n  them into local variables. If a register is defined by a block and\n  used by another, then we will create a local variable covering both\n  the definition and the use. In other words, a local variable consists\n  of all definitions and all uses that can be connected together. While\n  the basic idea is simple, things get complicated because of\n  byte/word/dword registers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's simple on the surface but of course the implementation has to account for numerous details. And there's always room for improvement. There's this passage:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For the time being, we do not analyze live ranges of stack variables\n  (this requires first a good alias analysis: we have to be able to\n  prove that a stack variable is not modified between two locations). I\n  doubt that a full fledged live range analysis will be available for\n  stack variables in the near future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, for stack variables the approach right now is simple: each stack slot is considered a single variable for the whole function (with some minor exceptions). The decompiler relies here on the work done by IDA during disassembly, where a stack slot is created for each access by an instruction.</p>\n<p>One current issue is multiple names for the same variable. For example, the compiler may cache the stack var in a register, pass it to some function, then later reload it into another register. The decompiler has to be pessimistic here. If we can't prove that the same location contains the same value at two points in time, we can't merge the variables. For example, any time the code passes an address of a variable to a call, the decompiler has to assume the call may spoil anything after that address. So even though the register still contains the same value as the stack var, we can't be 100% certain. Thus the excess of variable names. User can override it with manual mapping, however.</p>\n<p>There are some ideas about introducing function annotations that would specify exactly how a function uses and/or changes its arguments (similar to Microsoft's SAL) which would alleviate this problem, but there are some technical implementation issues there.</p>\n</div>",

In particular, he defines a memory model for x86 in terms of concepts such as \"abstract locations\".  Here is his description for that concept:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As pointed out earlier, executables do not have intrinsic entities\n  like source-code variables that can be used for analysis; therefore,\n  the next step is to recover variable-like entities from the\n  executable. We refer to such variable-like entities as a-locs (for\n  “abstract locations”).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sound familiar vis-a-vis your question?  You should read this thesis, although be warned that -- like most documents about abstract interpretation -- it is terse and unfriendly reading.</p>\n<p>[1]  <a href=\"http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bgogul/Research/Thesis/thesis.html\">http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bgogul/Research/Thesis/thesis.html</a></p>\n</div>",

A variable is not a concept known in computer architecture, it's reminiscent of a higher level of understanding.</p>\n<p>The best answer I can give you is, if you're doing <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20140723114846/http://www.mimisbrunnr.net/~munin/blog/binary-analysis-isnt.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Compiler Output Analysis</a> (which you are), you can look for the conventions used by that compiler to store variables, probably as a combination of registers and variable \"spillage\" into locations on the stack frame.</p>\n<p>The bad news is it's compiler dependent. The good news is most compilers are more-or-less similar.</p>\n<p>You could attempt to determine signed-ness by observing the conditional operations that work off a value (assuming the developer didn't make a mistake such as comparing a signed and unsigned value).</p>\n</div>",

It simply seems to assume that anything which can be a variable is. This can lead to gross over-estimation of the number of variables. You generally have to map quite a lot of variables as aliases in order to get a clean decompilation. It's still an awesome product though.

I suppose on top of what any of us could come up with, Hex-Rays (the company) has probably come up with a bunch of heuristics to identify things as this or that. And I concur, having tested the beta of the decompiler plugin, I wasn't convinced at all. It was misleading me a lot where IDA never was.
