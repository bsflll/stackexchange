    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am running windows 8.1 and OllyDBG 2.0. When I attach to a process and view the executable modules, I want to open one. However, when I double click on one of the modules, it won't open in the main OllyDBG window, which it should. Has anyone else had a similar issue or have a solution? I run OllyDBG as administrator and I even tried running it in compatibility mode for XP. I can provide more information if it is needed to fully answer my question.</p>\n</div>",
