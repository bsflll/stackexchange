Is reverse engineering simply a very hard puzzle or are there binary out there that is simply impossible to reverse whether by hand or via decompiler?</p>\n<p>NOTE: I know the answer might be \"it depends on platform and programming language\" so I am going to assume the language used is C++ since it's generally considered impossible to reverse it.</p>\n</div>",

A C++ compiler creates a binary from source code.  A C++ decompiler would create source code from the binary. </p>\n<p>It's not possible, generally, to recreate <em><strong>the</strong></em> source (comments, macro definitions and local variable names, for example often don't exist in any form in the final binary), so what we're left with is attempting to create <em><strong>some</strong></em> source that is functionally equivalent.</p>\n<p>One simplistic way to do this would be to disassemble an executable binary, instruction by instruction, creating C++ equivalent code for each machine instruction.  This would literally do the job, but the results would be utterly unusable for humans.</p>\n<p>As the source language becomes more complex, automatically reversing it into a useful, readable, idiomatic form becomes more of a challenge.

Generally you want to learn more than just how to run the program -- like how to modify it in a useful way.</p>\n<p>Researchers are still trying to figure out which definitions of obfuscation are useful.  <a href=\"http://www.iacr.org/archive/crypto2001/21390001.pdf\">This famous paper</a> says you can't hide all the secrets all the time.  They define a \"secret\" to be anything you can't get from just running the program over and over and analyzing the output.  <a href=\"http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/451\">This recent paper</a> demonstrates a way to make it impossible to tell which equivalent source code was the original.  Their technique is the \"best possible\" obfuscation, in that it hides any secrets that can be hidden.</p>\n<p>One of the <a href=\"http://eprint.iacr.org/2004/060\">first successful obfuscations</a> was for point functions, that output \"yes\" when you type in a secret password.  You obfuscate this program by coding the MD5 hash of the password (like the Unix login function does).  You can run the program, but you can't crack the password.  Does that count as being \"impossible to reverse\"?</p>\n<p>Some aspects of software static analysis have been known for some time to be formally hard.  For example, see <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.35.2337\">this paper</a> and its references.</p>\n<p>I don't know of any research specifically on making it difficult to modify a program's behavior in a certain predictable way.

First, the <a href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9or%C3%A8me_de_Rice\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rice's theorem</a> (as previously mentioned by @perror) and a more constructive result of <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.35.9722\" rel=\"nofollow\">Landi. W</a> assert that a general verificator does not exist, that means we cannot write a verificator V so that when we gives V an arbitrary program P and a non-trivial property p (a trivial property is one that exists in all programs, e.g. the magic byte MZ exists in all PE files is a trivial property), V can answer P has p or not. So that means the perfect obfuscation exists ?, the answer is trivially No, that is because we never require a such strong verificator (that gives deterministic answer for all programs), we need only a verificator for some useful classes of programs. </p>\n<p>Second, <a href=\"http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/PS/obf4.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barak et al</a> (as previously mentioned also by @perror) asserts a somehow contradict result: there are some classes of programs that cannot be obfuscated, namely no matter what they are obfuscated, that is easy to write a verificator to answer these programs have a given property p (or not). There is actually no contradiction here because the Rice's theorem applies in the context of \"all programs\" and the result of Barak et al applies for the context of \"several programs\", indeed we have:</p>\n<p>Third, the result of <a href=\"http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hoeteck/pubs/obf-point-stoc05.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wee. H</a> says that we can always hide (i.e. obfuscate) some properties given a class of special programs named <em>point functions</em>. Again, that does not mean the obfuscation is possible in general because this result applies in the context of \"several programs\".</p>\n<p>Fourth, the result of <a href=\"http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/451.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Garg. S et al</a> says that we can obfuscate any program so that any property computed from the obfuscated one is \"trivial\". So that means the perfect obfuscator exists?, and if it exists then it contradict to the result of <a href=\"http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/PS/obf4.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barak et al</a>?, obviously No, because the two results have used actually two different definitions of triviality, in the first one a property is trivial if it exists in all programs having the same semantics (so this definition is weaker than in the second one).</p>\n<p>In the real (i.e. practial) world, I have so little experience that I cannot give any useful idea. But I doubt that the game obfuscator vs de-obfuscator will evolve in some very clever ways and we still have many gaps to work in (as an obfuscator or as a de-obfuscator).</p>\n</div>",
