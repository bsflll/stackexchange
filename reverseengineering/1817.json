    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Is there any disassembler (not only a live debugger) second to IDA in capabilities? IDA is wonderful, and somewhat amazing in how robust and useful it is for reversing. However, it is quite expensive to properly license. Is there <em>any</em> viable alternative, or does IDA hold the monopoly on this market?</p>\n<p>I don't expect an alternative to be as good as IDA, just looking for other options that may be more affordable, and useful <em>enough</em>.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Preferrably, multi-platform support should exist, though that's optional. MIPS, ARM, x86, and x86-64 would be nice, but a disassembler that handles any one of those is a good option to know about.</p>\n</div>",

Applications, system DLLs, device-drivers\n  and Microsoft .NET assemblies are all candidates for offline analysis\n  using either PEBrowse programs.  The information is organized in a\n  convenient treeview index with the major divisions of the PE file\n  displayed as nodes.  In most cases selecting nodes will enable\n  context-sensitive multiple view menu options, including binary dump,\n  section detail, disassembly and structure options as well as\n  displaying sub-items, such as optional header directory entries or\n  exported functions, that can be found as part of a PE file unit. \n  Several table displays, hex/ASCII equivalents, window messages and\n  error codes, as well as a calculator and scratchpads are accessible\n  from the main menu (calculator, messages and codes in PEBrowse\n  Professional only).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is an awesome tool with a lot of useful feature regarding executable analysis and there is also a version that could be used and an interactive debugger.</p>\n</div>",
