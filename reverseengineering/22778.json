That is, <strong>2 Bytes</strong>.</p>\n<p>The instruction you are patching (<code>mov byte ptr ds:[ecx+0x72], al</code>) is <code>88 41 72</code> and so takes up <strong>3 Bytes</strong>. See the problem already?</p>\n<p>That means you are only patching the first two bytes of the instruction and need to pad it with a single-byte NOP (no operation, i.e. <code>90</code>) in order for all subsequent instructions to be correct.</p>\n<p>Otherwise the processor will start decoding at <code>&lt;patched-instruction&gt;+2</code> and assume that it is correct. Which it probably isn't.</p>\n<p><s>Not sure what all those screenshots are supposed to be about. They seem to have no relation to the instructions you said you were patching ...</s></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Now that you have posted the screenshot of the patch site, we can even potentially tell you what the CPU was trying to execute.</p>\n<p>The patch site before your patch was directly at the return from a function:</p>\n<pre><code>88 41 72                mov    BYTE PTR [ecx+0x72],al\nc2 04 00                ret    0x4\n; ------ end of function\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n</code></pre>\n<p>After your patch it would have looked like this:</p>\n<pre><code>b0 01                   mov    al,0x1\n72 c2                   jb     0xffffffc6\n04 00                   add    al,0x0\n; ------ end of function\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n90                      nop\n</code></pre>\n<p>Still 12 Bytes overall (6 inside the function you were patching), but a completely different meaning. We can guess that either the jump instruction was taken and led into a location which gave the access violation, or that the condition (of <code>jb</code>) didn't evaluate to true and the CPU executed the <code>add</code> followed by 6x <code>nop</code> and then ended up in a completely different function (at least this looks like a function prologue) but with the stack still in place from the call to the previous function and so on ...</p>\n</div>",
