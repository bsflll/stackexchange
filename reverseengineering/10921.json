For virtual functions there is also a pointer to a table of pointers that is the first offset in the structure.  Each class member is a specific offset from the beginning of the structure.  The easiest way to see this is to create a class, and assign different members to values that you know.  Then look in IDA and see the offsets that are modified with those known values.</p>\n<p>Here is a good article that describes the layout. <a href=\"http://www.openrce.org/articles/full_view/23\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.openrce.org/articles/full_view/23</a></p>\n</div>",
