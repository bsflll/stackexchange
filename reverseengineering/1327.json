I'd like to add PDB support to <a href=\"http://www.hopperapp.com/\">Hopper</a> using <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/pdbparse/\">pdbparse</a>, but I haven't been able to get it to use external libraries.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, I suppose one could just dump the debug symbol offsets to a text file and read that, but it seems like a clunkier solution (since you wouldn't be able to, e.g., auto-download symbols from the MS Symbol Server).</p>\n</div>",
