It has Android and iPhone apps but unfortunately, there's no PC interface.</p>\n<p>I was thinking that if the camera was broadcasting video, it should be possible to use VLC on a PC or Linux to watch the broadcast video and perhaps sound.</p>\n<p>From the setup instructions, I know the iBaby has net connectivity through your home wifi.  Yet when I look at my modem/router's list of clients, I don't see it.</p>\n<p>I'm currently in the Android app looking at my baby, and logged into my modem, looking at the list of attached clients.  I don't see the iBaby in the list of wireless clients (or any clients at all).</p>\n<p>How is this possible?</p>\n</div>",

Different routers do it differently - some show all associated WiFi clients, other only clients using DHCP, some anything that has shown up on ARP. </p>\n<p>The iBaby M6 manual download doesn't appear to work at the moment, but reading the <a href=\"https://ibabylabs.com/support/m6-general-usage\" rel=\"nofollow\">questions on their site</a>, it sounds like you had to connect a USB cable to transfer the WiFi settings into the camera before it would connect. It then appears to be a \"cloud\" based (read \"connects to an external server). </p>\n<p>The only way you are really going to see what is going on is sniffing or proxying the traffic from your phone. I would suggest using something like Burp Suite or Fiddler to do this, and see what is going on.</p>\n</div>",
