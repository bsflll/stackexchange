They appeared under different contexts, thus I assumed that they were different structs. However, as the contexts merge, I realize that these are in fact the same struct.</p>\n<p>Now I would like to get rid of <code>struct B</code> and replace all its occurance with <code>struct A</code>. Is it possible to do that without manually changing everything?</p>\n<p>I know that I can define <code>struct B</code> as containing just one <code>struct A</code> as its member, but this feels less optimal and creates unnecessary syntax in decompiled code.</p>\n</div>",
