    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I need to debug .so of my.apk, I'm working on a phone with android 5.0, using ida 6.8's android_server. It seems ok for attaching ida to the process, but when clicking something on the apk there is message box that shows an exception(see the image), and breaks at this line:</p>\n<pre><code>system@<a class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"6e081c0f030b19011c052e0c01011a40010f1a\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">[emailÂ protected]</a>:7314709E DCB    8\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the 'call stack' window is empty.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/p55Ot.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"boot.oat exception\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/p55Ot.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>The problem happens with android 5.x + ida 6.8,  or android 7.0 + ida 6.8\nbut it works fine on android 4.x + ida 6.5</p>\n<p>But I tried another apk, there is no such problem.\nAny idea? </p>\n<p><strong>Update 1</strong>\nAccording to comments from @ws, it's something wrong with segment type: ARM(0) and THUMB(1), here's what I tried:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Press Alt+G at that line, a window popups and shows the segment register value is 1, I modified it to 0, run.</li>\n<li>Then it breaks at another place with same exception. I did that again.</li>\n<li>Then it goes to boot.oat, but this time is different. Even after modified it to 0(ARM), it breaks at this line about 6~7 times\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YpvZW.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YpvZW.png\"/></a></li>\n<li>And finally it breaks at some random code with same exception, such as memset in the image below. Then program crashes if continue run.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GZlUd.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GZlUd.png\"/></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
