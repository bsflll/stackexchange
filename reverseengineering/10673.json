    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am looking at the firmware for my router <a href=\"http://internethelp.centurylink.com/internethelp/modems/c1000a/firmware/CAC002-31.30L.76.img\" rel=\"nofollow\">C1000A/C1000A-D</a> and I am having some difficulties in mounting and otherwise emulating this. From what I have read, the general process for reverse engineering firmware is to extract the firmware and run it in Qemu or mount it to your filesystem.</p>\n<p>I have managed to extract what I believe to be the filesystem from the following </p>\n<pre><code>$&gt; binwalk -e --dd=\"lzma:7z:7zip -d %e\" CAC002-31.30L.76.img\n</code></pre>\n<p>I see that there is a tool that will try to mount this runs called <code>unjffs2</code> when I run this it fails with a seemingly unsolvable issue of a driver not being loaded. However oddly enough, a file system mounts and there is just a bunch of empty folders.</p>\n<pre><code>$&gt; ./unjffs2 4000.jffs2\nConverting image to little endian...\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00033fe8, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00033fec, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00033ff0, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00033ff4, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00033ff8, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00033ffc, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00063f68, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00063f6c, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00063f70, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00063f74, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00063f78, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00063f7c, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00063f80, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00063f84, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00063f88, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00063f8c, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00063f90, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00063f94, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00063f98, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00063f9c, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00063fa0, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00063fa4, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x00063fa8, 0x0000\n...\nWrong bitmask  at  0x000f3ff0, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x000f3ff4, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x000f3ff8, 0x0000\nWrong bitmask  at  0x000f3ffc, 0x0000\nmodprobe: FATAL: Module mtdchar not found.\n2033+1 records in\n2033+1 records out\n1041200 bytes (1.0 MB) copied, 0.00570635 s, 182 MB/s\nJFFS2 image mounted to jffs2-root\n</code></pre>\n<p>At this point,  since I don't see any <code>mtdchar</code> driver in my system (Ubuntu based). </p>\n<p>I think the best method would be to run in Qemu.
