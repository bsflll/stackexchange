    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>When I'm stepping through a debuggee process with IDA+WinDbg (as a debugger), I need to track one parameter by executing the following API (from within the breakpoint):</p>\n<pre><code>//C++ code\nSCROLLINFO s;\ns.cbSize = sizeof(s);    //0x1C\ns.fMask = SIF_POS | SIF_TRACKPOS;   //0x4 | 0x10\nGetScrollInfo(hWnd, SB_VERT, &amp;s);    //SB_VERT = 1\nprintf(\"pos=%d, track=%d\", s.nPos, s.nTrackPos);\n</code></pre>\n<p>So I came up with the following Python script to do this from a breakpoint in IDA:</p>\n<pre><code>import ctypes\nfrom ctypes import wintypes\nhwnd = 0x00020208\nuser32 = ctypes.WinDLL('user32', use_last_error=True)\nclass SCROLLINFO(ctypes.Structure):\n    _fields_ = ((\"cbSize\", wintypes.DWORD),\n                (\"fMask\", wintypes.DWORD),\n                (\"nMin\", wintypes.LONG),\n                (\"nMax\", wintypes.LONG),\n                (\"nPage\", wintypes.DWORD),\n                (\"nPos\", wintypes.LONG),\n                (\"nTrackPos\", wintypes.LONG))\ns = SCROLLINFO(cbSize=0x1C,\n        fMask=0x14,\n        nPos=-1,\n        nTrackPos=-1)\nuser32.GetScrollInfo(hwnd, 1, ctypes.byref(s))\nprint s.nPos, s.nTrackPos\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which I thought seemed to work and gave me some values:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lJrw0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lJrw0.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>But then when I got to the actual code in the process that was doing the same:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jzBlJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jzBlJ.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>The result it received for <code>s.nTrackPos</code> was 1 instead of 8 that is reported by my Python script. Here's the memory dump for the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winuser/ns-winuser-tagscrollinfo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SCROLLINFO</a> struct:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pLN9u.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pLN9u.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>So what am I doing wrong here? Why is the Python script returning the wrong value?</p>\n</div>",

I used asm so that I could enclose it in <code>PUSHFD</code>, <code>PUSHAD</code> and then at the end in <code>POPAD</code>, <code>POPFD</code>, <code>JMP self</code> instructions. I would then change IP to it whenever I needed to do the check, execute it and get the result and then change IP back to where I was before. (I just had to remember to write down the previous IP.) Kinda like a poor man's version of the task switcher. That's a little bit more work, but at least I could rely on the results.</span>",
