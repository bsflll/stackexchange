Try to get any other python plugins available on hex-rays <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download.shtml</a>  and put it in the same directory. Check if IDA is able to see it after restart. Of so - your plugin is not formatted well. If not - possibly this is a wrong folder.</span>",
