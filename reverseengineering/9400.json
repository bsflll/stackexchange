And as he said, they're internal functions and thus not publicly documented. However, that doesn't mean we can't find the code behind these functions.</p>\n<p>You can download the Intel Fortran Compiler from <a href=\"https://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers/try-buy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers/try-buy</a></p>\n<p>You can then extract the <code>.obj</code> files from the <code>IFCORE</code> library to find the code behind the functions you listed above. For example, the code for <code>for__key_desc_test_item()</code> is in <code>for_desc_item.obj</code> in <code>libifcore.lib</code>:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"libifcore.lib\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wWcfY.png\"/></p>\n<p>Decompiling with <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/decompiler/index.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hex-Rays</a> yields:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"for__desc_test_item\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZO0mW.png\"/></p>\n</div>",
