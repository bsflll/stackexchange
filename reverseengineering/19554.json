Let's break it down what happens when it's being called with <code>asm(0xb6, 0xc6)</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>push    ebp\nmov     ebp, esp\n</code></pre>\n<p>Those two lines are what's is called the function prologue. We first save the calling function stack frame (<code>ebp</code> is tracking that) and in the second one, we set our function stack frame to be equal to the current stack location.</p>\n<pre><code>mov eax, DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]\nmov ebx, DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc]\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above lines are loading our passed arguments to <code>eax</code> and <code>ebx</code>. Since in <code>cdecl</code> arguments are passed via stack in reverse order, so after those lines in <code>eax</code> we will have <code>0xb6</code> and <code>ebx</code> will be equal to <code>0xc6</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>mov eax, ebx\n</code></pre>\n<p>The value from <code>ebx</code> is stored in <code>eax</code>, thus we drop the need of the first line from the previous fragment. Also since this is the last use of <code>eax</code> in this code it can be interpreted as a return value as this is also a convention in <code>cdecl</code>. So the return value, in this case, would be <code>0xc6</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>mov esp,ebp\npop ebp\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is just bringing back the stack as it was when we enter the function - also called function epilogue.</p>\n<pre><code>ret\n</code></pre>\n<p>And return back to the caller.</p>\n<p>Having analyzed that it's just obvious that this function returns the second argument that's being passed to it.</p>\n<pre><code>int second(int a, int b)\n{\n    return b;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You could compile this code to a library and use it from C code:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nextern unsigned int _test (unsigned int, unsigned int);\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    printf(\"%x\\n\", _test(0xb6, 0xc6));\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>and compile it with <code>gcc -m32 -o run asm.o call.o</code>. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>./run <br/>\n  c6</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You could verify that it's the case without running it by for example using <a href=\"https://godbolt.org/z/5gAK5m\" rel=\"noreferrer\">godbolt</a> but since the code that assigns the first value to <code>eax</code> and then replaces it with the second is actually not needed - it could just use the second argument from the beginning - it won't be generated even w/o any optimizations. </p>\n</div>",
