    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to extract an object file (.obj) from a Windows static (.lib) library so I can patch it in IDA, then rearchive it back into the library.  I am doing this because IDA won't allow me to patch a static library containing multiple object files.</p>\n<p>I am trying to use the ar that comes with mingw.  The file I am looking to extract has a full path (e.g. \"E:/some/path/to/filename.obj\" - the forward slashes are correct).  I can see this file as listed when I run <code>ar -t library.lib</code>.  However, when I run <code>ar -x library.lib E:/some/path/to/filename.obj</code> I get an error \"no entry E:/some/path/to/filename.obj in archive\".</p>\n<p>What am I doing wrong please?   Or can I apply a patch to an object file within a static library using IDA directly?</p>\n</div>",
