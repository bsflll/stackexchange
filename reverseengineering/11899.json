By the time you can attach a debugger you just need to check if the stack and heap are ReadWrite or ReadWriteExecute. </p>\n<p>In Windbg you can use either !vprot or !address to get this information. In Olly I believe there's a window under view that will give you a list of the memory regions in a process and their associated protections.</p>\n<p>Additionally you can check the PE header of an executable to see if it supports DEP or not. The <a href=\"https://github.com/corelan/mona\" rel=\"nofollow\">mona</a> plugin gives you a quick command to see this, but there are probably others as well.</p>\n</div>",
