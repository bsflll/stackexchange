(<a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/11147/21966\">more info</a>)</p>\n<p>i get something like this :</p>\n<pre><code>Address  Length Result\n-----------------------\n0x853978 (43): hello\n0xfb5e1a8 (86): hello alex !\n</code></pre>\n<p>now i want to know how can i get/find reference address for them ? </p>\n<p>I try with <code>WinHex</code> but i cant, i don't know how can i do this, is it possible to find reference assembly address in file form memory address (for ex : <code>0x853978</code>) or this is not possible in any way.</p>\n<p>anyone can help ?</p>\n</div>",
