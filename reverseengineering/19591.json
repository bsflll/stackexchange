I know that the name of these commands is slightly misleading, so <code>dist-upgrade</code> will <i>not</i> upgrade from disto version x to x+1 or so. But the package selection criteria differ. However, once you <i>know</i> exactly what you're trying to achieve, you can mix and match these commands as needed.</span>",
