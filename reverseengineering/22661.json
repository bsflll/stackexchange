    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Python versions, this method has been tried on: 3.7.5, 3.6.0, 3.5.0, 2.7.17? (I know, I'm just too desperate to get my source back.)</p>\n<p>I have problem with decompiling an exe. I kind of deleted the wrong folder and now I'm left with the <code>.exe</code>, made by pyinstaller and nothing else. So basically I googled how to <code>decompile pyinstaller exes</code> and I found that first I use this: <a href=\"https://github.com/countercept/python-exe-unpacker/blob/master/pyinstxtractor.py\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/countercept/python-exe-unpacker/blob/master/pyinstxtractor.py</a> to dissasemble to <code>.pyc</code> files and then <code>uncompyle6</code> to get the source. The problem is that <code>pyinstxtractor</code> doesn't return the source code in <code>.pyc</code> format so I basically had to convert it myself and then add the \"magic numbers\" to it so that <code>uncompyle6</code> sees it as <code>.pyc</code>. If you are wondering how I got the magic numbers, well I just used a hex editor to see the magic numbers of another <code>.pyc</code>, that <code>pyinstxtractor</code> spat out and then I just pasted them in the main file. So after that, I write</p>\n<pre><code>uncompyle63 name_of_pyc.pyc\n</code></pre>\n<p>and I get this error: </p>\n<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"c:\\python\\lib\\site-packages\\xdis\\load.py\", line 208, in load_module_from_file_object\n    co = marshal.loads(bytecode)\nValueError: bad marshal data (unknown type code)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"c:\\python\\lib\\site-packages\\xdis\\load.py\", line 208, in load_module_from_file_object\n    co = marshal.loads(bytecode)\nValueError: bad marshal data (unknown type code)\n\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"c:\\python\\lib\\runpy.py\", line 193, in _run_module_as_main\n    \"__main__\", mod_spec)\n  File \"c:\\python\\lib\\runpy.py\", line 85, in _run_code\n    exec(code, run_globals)\n  File \"C:\\Python\\Scripts\\uncompyle6.exe\\__main__.py\", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;\n  File \"c:\\python\\lib\\site-packages\\uncompyle6\\bin\\uncompile.py\", line 194, in main_bin\n    **options)\n  File \"c:\\python\\lib\\site-packages\\uncompyle6\\main.py\", line 261, in main\n    source_encoding, linemap_stream, do_fragments)\n  File \"c:\\python\\lib\\site-packages\\uncompyle6\\main.py\", line 161, in decompile_file\n    source_size) = load_module(filename, code_objects)\n  File \"c:\\python\\lib\\site-packages\\xdis\\load.py\", line 116, in load_module\n    get_code=get_code,\n  File \"c:\\python\\lib\\site-packages\\xdis\\load.py\", line 222, in load_module_from_file_object\n    \"Ill-formed bytecode file %s\\n%s; %s\" % (filename, kind, msg)\nImportError: Ill-formed bytecode file Bot.pyc\n&lt;class 'ValueError'&gt;; bad marshal data (unknown type code)\n</code></pre>\n<p>What are some other ways to decompile pyinstaller executables (If this one is useless)?</p>\n</div>",
