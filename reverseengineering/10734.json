When I press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> and go to the <code>7FEEC617750</code> memory address, I get an expression like <code>push rbx</code> which is not the value shown in the ollyDBG. </p>\n<p>I am pretty confused by how I should use the offsets and stack in ollyDBG. <em>I simply want to know how to access the value of pointer shown in the comment of ollyDBG <code>[7FEEC617750]</code> and also find out what accesses and writes to <code>[7FEEC617750]</code>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>P.S</strong> Thanks to AcidShout for pinpointing, indeed, the debugger is <code>x64_dbg</code> the cousin of ollyDBG :)</p>\n</div>",
