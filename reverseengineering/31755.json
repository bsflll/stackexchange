    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm analyzing a mac OS framework, and while redefining types in the decompilation view,<br/>\nI wish to define one of the types as a type defined as <code>NSData</code> class which is defined inside <code>CoureFoundation</code> framework that is in the Imports tree:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uRtNF.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uRtNF.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>I've added this frameworks as a program to the project, analyzed it, and set it as external program in the imports tree for my first framework:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/u7xOo.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/u7xOo.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OwiQo.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OwiQo.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/79NoL.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/79NoL.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>Now after doing all this I still cannot use the classes and types defined from <code>CoreFoundation</code> or any other external library. I even tried to run <code>FixupELFExternalSymbolsScript.java</code> plugin but it only works for ELF and not Mach-O.</p>\n<p>What can I do for my first framework which depends on the types and classes defined in other frameworks to be able to access them so I could use them in the decompiler view?</p>\n<p>If it matters I'm analyzing these macOS frameworks on a Windows host.</p>\n</div>",
