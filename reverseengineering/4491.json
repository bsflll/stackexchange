It's unclear if it explicitly allows assignments or if it's just a side effect that sometimes works.</p>\n<p>Try something like this instead: <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/170.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">SetRegValue(al-1, \"al\")</a></p>\n<p>I don't have IDA on hand to test this out, but the function returns true so it might avoid the problem you're seeing.</p>\n</div>",
