    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm working on bypassing the anti-debug checks of an unpacker in x64dbg. My end goal is to bypass all of the checks so that I can run the (unmodified) process with a debugger attached without any problems. </p>\n<p>To bypass the checks I've encountered so far, I have a process of ~15 actions of setting breakpoints, stepping over instructions, skipping syscalls under certain conditions, etc, and it takes at least a couple of minutes to get up to the point where I left off. </p>\n<p>Since doing this stuff manually is time-consuming and error-prone, I'd like to automate it.</p>\n<p>I was thinking of building a C++ application that will launch the executable, attach and bypass all of the checks I've solved so far, then suspend the program and detach, so that I can attach with x64dbg and resume my reversing... or perhaps it's a better idea to do this with an x64dbg plugin? What's the best way to do this?</p>\n</div>",

Not trying to be snarky, I typically do that when simple binary patching won't do. That may lead to additional problems with VM detection, and if the target is a game this usually doesn't work at all, of course.</span>",
