    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a function with the first few instructions defined as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>sub  rsp, 0x80\nlea  rbp, [rsp + 0x20]\nmov  qword [rbp + 0x58], rsi\nmov  qword [rbp + 0x50], rbx\nmov  qword [rbp + 0x70], rcx\nmov  dword [rbp + 0x78], edx\nmov  eax, dword [rbp + 0x78]\ntest eax, eax\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, in order we have:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>stack frame of <code>0x80</code> -- fine</li>\n<li>some kind of structure at <code>RSP+0x20</code> -- probably</li>\n<li>set some member of RBP at offset <code>0x58</code> to <code>RSI</code></li>\n<li>the same for offset <code>0x50</code></li>\n<li>the same for offset <code>0x70</code> -- wait what? <code>RBP+0x70</code> is <code>0x10</code> bytes beyond our stack frame.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It seems like we have an on-stack structure at RBP yet it's accessing data from the caller's frame. If we were accessing data from the caller, I would have expected the compiler to use one base register for the current function (as we saw with the RBP usage) and then another register for the caller's data offsets, say some offset from RSP. I understand the compiler isn't <em>required</em> to follow that pattern, so my question is:</p>\n<p>Is there some C or C++ that could generate this assembly sequence in practice or am I looking at weird obfuscated code?</p>\n<p>EDIT:\nThis is a windows binary. There are two parameters to this function, RCX and RDX.</p>\n</div>",
