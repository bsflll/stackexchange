They are so slow and have many problems with loops and rep-prefixed.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned in my comment the driver initializing tracing wast 30 min (I want to draw each IOCtl graph).</p>\n<p>Again as I mentioned in my comment I use Virtual-KD and VMWare (Is it any faster configuration ?).</p>\n<p><strong>1.I'm not in user mode.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2.problem is slow speed.</strong></p>\n</div>",
