    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I tried posting this on stack overflow with no luck, hoping I can get some more answers here.</p>\n<p>have an app running on my iPhone via XCode by way of USBC -&gt; Lightning cable. I would like to analyze the USB packets that go between XCode and the device when I install an app from Xcode to the device. I open up wireshark, and I see a few interfaces that seem like an obvious choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone USB: en6</li>\n<li>en12, en13 (these only showed up when I plugged the phone in, they disappeared when unplugging, so I figured they're related)</li>\n<li>Thunderbolt 1-4: en1-4 (I have it plugged into one of my thunderbolt ports, so maybe?)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've tried running wireshark as sudo, I've also tried turning the interfaces off and then on again using <code>sudo ifconfig &lt;interface&gt; off/on</code></p>\n<p>When I run Wireshark on en6, en12, and en13, I see traffic that looks like it correlates with when I build in XCode and the app starts running, but I don't see anything that looks like it's big enough traffic to copy the code from XCode to the phone, and then run it. All I see are some DHCP discover packets, and some MDSN packets.</p>\n</div>",
