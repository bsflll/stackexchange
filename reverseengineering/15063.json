It's a Cortex 10-pin 0.05\" JTAG/SWD Connector.</p>\n<p>(See <a href=\"http://support.code-red-tech.com/CodeRedWiki/HardwareDebugConnections\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n<p>I think it's JTAG because PIN#3 and 5 are on GND and it's close of CPU</p>\n<p>When I follow the wires, TCK, TDO, TDI goes on missing componant (red circle).</p>\n<p>Here is a picture :</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/k3Hlf.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/k3Hlf.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>First I was thinking an resistor array of 10K for pull up or pull down signals. </p>\n<p>But first, the left side pads doesn't seem to be wired to GND or Vcc</p>\n<p>Secondly it would be a 6 resistors array witch is not very common</p>\n<p>A last, array resistors have their pads wider on the ends (as the one of 100K*4 on the right bottom of the picture), witch isn't the case here.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>So what it could be ?</p></li>\n<li><p>Do you think there is a missing resistor on TMS ? as we can see (perhaps) a pad for resistor (go to GND)</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Regards</p>\n</div>",
