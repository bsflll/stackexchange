I would like to add that I am not interested in doing something professional or advanced more suitable to the employees of IT industry. I just want to make myself more intelligent and knowledgeable, possibly delaying dementia and preventing chronic diseases. That is, I am not interested in maintaining virtual machines to reverse engineer malware/illegal software. Thank you.</p>\n</div>",

When it comes to disclosing your findings or using said knowledge to clone the software functionally, that's when you touch the copyright/IP domain. But even then it depends on what this is about. For example to work toward interoperability (with a file format or protocol) a lot is allowed in several jurisdictions. But cloning a software based on reverse engineering it, in order to compete with the original maker is probably going to get you in trouble. But IANAL and probably few if any user here.</span>",

Such question is arguably also not a reverse engineering question. But the answer depends on time and jurisdiction. So instead of asking a bunch of laypeople (regarding <i>law</i>) about advice for a jurisdiction they may never have physically visited (and which <i>you don't even specify</i>) you'd be better off seeing a lawyer in <i>your</i> jurisdiction and asking pointed questions about the stuff you care about. That said: what you do within your own four walls won't cause issues until you publish.</span>",

Usually made by the community for other people to learn without braking the law. Crackmes have different levels that sometimes is even harder to crack than softewares published by companies.
