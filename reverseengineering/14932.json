    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to understand how an application I have been using is setting its data in XYZ coordinates which I wish to convert to HEX value. The application essentially shows me the XYZ in one format (float maybe), but I am only able to edit this data in HEX, so I need to understand the translation to make proper edits. </p>\n<p>First off lets look at the values displayed in the program</p>\n<p><strong>X = 1.085597\nY = 4.703604\nZ = -17.573305</strong></p>\n<p>The HEX values for these XYZ values is 12 bytes, which I assume is 4 bytes for X values, 4 for Y, and for for Z. Here is the HEX output:</p>\n<p><strong>19 B3 87 44 D6 FC 92 45 9C 4A 89 C6</strong></p>\n<p>So what I am wondering is if there is a way to ascertain (from the data I have provided) the formula that the application is using so I can convert the XYZ values to HEX values?</p>\n<p>Someone metioned it might be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">IEEE 754 standard?</a> but I'm new to hex editing so I'm not sure how to apply this or what it means.</p>\n<p>HEX values appear to be in little endian.  </p>\n</div>",
