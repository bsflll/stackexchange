When you check if operand type is <code>o_void</code> in <code>if op.type == idaapi.o_void: break</code>, you break out of the loop that iterates through the sequence of all operands in the instruction. So if first operand is <code>o_void</code>, it break and not check all other operands after it, which could potentially be valid operands. I noticed it after I saw that when you check if operand <code>is_mem</code> or not, you continue and don't break. I understand that on practice on x86 pretty much all the time third+ operands will always be null. But what about all other architectures?</span>",
