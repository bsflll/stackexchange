In practice, it means that it exports standard COM entry points such  as:</p>\n<pre><code> DllRegisterServer\n DllUnregisterServer\n DllCanUnloadNow\n DllGetClassObject\n</code></pre>\n<p>The most important for us is <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-dllgetclassobject\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>DllGetClassObject</code></a> as this is the one called by the host process to create the ActiveX control(s).</p>\n<p>To see where the code is located, you need to find the file implementing it. in IE, it can be done from \"Manage Add-Ons\" dialog. </p>\n<hr/>\n<p>For example, here are the details for the Flash control:</p>\n<pre><code>Name:                   Shockwave Flash Object\nPublisher:              Microsoft Windows Third Party Application Component\nType:                   ActiveX Control\nArchitecture:           32-bit and 64-bit\nVersion:                32.0.0.387\nFile date:              ‎3 ‎June, ‎2020, ‏‎03:53\nDate last accessed:     ‎16 ‎June, ‎2020, ‏‎21:19\nClass ID:               {D27CDB6E-AE6D-11CF-96B8-444553540000}\nUse count:              52850\nBlock count:            18\nFile:                   Flash.ocx\nFolder:                 C:\\Windows\\System32\\Macromed\\Flash\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, we need to analyze <code>Flash.ocx</code> (in <code>C:\\Windows\\System32\\Macromed\\Flash</code> for 64-bit or <code>C:\\Windows\\SysWow64\\Macromed\\Flash</code> for 32-bit IE).</p>\n<p>To debug, set the full path to the file in Debugger-Process Options-Input File, set breakpoint on <code>DllGetClassObject</code> then attach to the IE process. Once a page with a Flash control is loaded the breakpoint should trigger.</p>\n</div>",
