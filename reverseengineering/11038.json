It looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>typedef ReturnType (*certain_function)(void* this);\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>ReturnType</em> is a class which I don't know.\nI need to pass the returned value of type <em>ReturnType</em> to another function. </p>\n<pre><code>typedef void (*another_function) (ReturnType);\n</code></pre>\n<p>ReturnType neither is a primitive type nor a pointer, it's a class I don't got the definition for.</p>\n<p>I don't need to work with the class, hence I dont really need to know what it looks like.</p>\n<p><strong>My question is:</strong>\nObviously, I've got to make my own defintion of <em>ReturnType</em>, like:</p>\n<pre><code>class ReturnType {\n    public:\n        uint8_t padding[?];\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>But how precise does it have to be? Can I just use a insanely large value for <em>?</em> that definitly would offer enough memory for the class object, or does the size have to be exact? How is Return-by-Value/Call-by-Value done on ASM level? Complete object on the stack?</p>\n</div>",
