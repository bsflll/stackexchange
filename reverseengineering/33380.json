    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>In pseudocode view (after pressing Tab on assembly code), I can only see one current decompiled function. I can decompile and go to other functions (by double clicking on them) that are called from that function, and the new decompiled function will now be visible. The problem is that the pseudocode view only shows one decompiled function at a time. Is it possible to decompile and show all nested called functions from the current function?</p>\n</div>",
