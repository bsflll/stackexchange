    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to do some dynamic analysis on a couple of ELF binaries with <code>gdb</code>. However, since those two are directly downloaded (ELF binary file only) with no additional information related to compilation/linking etc., I am not able to set up the proper environment in order to run them within <code>gdb</code>.</p>\n<p>In particular, I am receiving the following errors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>warning: Error reading shared library list entry at 0x1600</code></li>\n<li><code>warning: Corrupted shared library list: 0x804c7c0 != 0x7c</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do you know how could I possibly resolve those issues or what can I do in order to set my environment properly for dynamic analysis?</p>\n<p>Thank you so much in advance for all of your input.</p>\n</div>",
