I read about the Aggressive Instruction Finder analysis and used it.

Is there any way to do that automatically for all/most undefined functions?</p>\n<p>Example for an undefined function:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KN028.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Screenshot\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KN028.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
