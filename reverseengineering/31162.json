    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a binary firmware that I'm trying to reverse engineer. I loaded it up on Ghidra, setting the file as raw binary, ARM Cortex, little endian. I used an address offset of zero for the file. And I seem to get good results. Here is the top of the file.</p>\n<pre><code>                             //\n                             // ram \n                             // ram:00000000-ram:0005d37f\n                             //\n             assume spsr = 0x0  (Default)\n                             MasterStackPointer\n        00000000 00  00  03  20    addr       DAT_20030000\n                             Reset                                           XREF[1]:     Entry Point (*)   \n        00000004 d5  2b  03  08    addr       DAT_08032bd5\n                             NMI                                             XREF[1]:     Entry Point (*)   \n        00000008 25  2c  03  08    addr       DAT_08032c25\n                             HardFault                                       XREF[1]:     Entry Point (*)   \n        0000000c 25  2c  03  08    addr       DAT_08032c25\n                             MemManage                                       XREF[1]:     Entry Point (*)   \n        00000010 25  2c  03  08    addr       DAT_08032c25\n                             BusFault                                        XREF[1]:     Entry Point (*)   \n        00000014 25  2c  03  08    addr       DAT_08032c25\n                             UsageFault                                      XREF[1]:     Entry Point (*)   \n        00000018 25  2c  03  08    addr       DAT_08032c25\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice how all the pointers point to <code>DAT_08######</code>? This is consistent with the well-known <code>0x08000000</code> offset typical on this architecture. But if I analyse the whole file with this offset, then this first part isn't \"decoded\" properly.</p>\n<p>I guess I have to split the memory mapping of the file. Currently it's as a single block, as indicated by <code>// ram:00000000-ram:0005d37f</code>.</p>\n<p>My question is where should I split the file, adding the offset from that point onward? Any good ways to have an educated guess? The first function, with the file as-is, appears at address <code>0x000001f0</code>, after the IRQ block.</p>\n</div>",

It looks like this code was dumped from the flash of the device and should be mapped to that memory space 0x08000000. You can create a byte-mapped mirror to the 0x00000000 memory space if there are unresolved mappings to that memory region. I have not found creating the mirrored memory to be required.</p>\n<p>You can re-create the interrupt block by referencing the data sheet for the processor and manually re-mapping. This is a good exercise since the interrupt block will vary from the Ghidra default to what the processor has available.</p>\n<p>I recommend using a tool such as SVD-Loader to help fill in all the peripheral information.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CMpaK.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Memory Map Screen shot\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CMpaK.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
