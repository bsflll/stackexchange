The R2 (SDA2) register is set to 0x80008400 and this value is used to read and write the address space \"near\" that value throughout the code.\nThe problem is that according to the reference manual that space is \"reserved\" and there is no MMU entry containing it.\nIs this a standard location for external eeprom or something along those lines? What am I missing?</p>\n</div>",
