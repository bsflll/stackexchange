But now I want to use WinDbg for scripting and when I try to set the same breakpoint, I get no breaks. </p>\n<p>In OllyDbg, the following breakpoint gets me exactly what I want: </p>\n<p><code>Address=75B0C4FA |  Module=KERNELBA | Active=Always | Disassembly=CMP EAX,103</code></p>\n<p>But when I try to set a breakpoint in WinDbg , it never comes back with anything:</p>\n<p><code>bp 75b0c4fa</code></p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff538903(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the MS Dev Center documentation</a> for the <code>bp</code> command, I should be able to reference addresses specifically, but in my searching, most people are using <code>bp</code> to reference API calls, such as <code>bp ReadFile</code> (which does break as expected). </p>\n<p>My questions: is it possible to use the breakpoint (75B0C4FA) using WinDbg?\nAnd if so, what am I missing in terms of adapting the address I have to make it work in Windbg? \nDoes it have to do with <code>bp ReadFile</code> accessing the ReadFile API calls for the main process, while with my breakpoint, it is trying to put breaks into sub module?</p>\n</div>",

Now in windbg find where kernelbase is loaded. Ssy 58xxxxxx. Add the 01xxxxx to this base address.

One thing I don't understand is this \"viz\" when I googled for it, it was mostly other responses from you on stack overflow, etc... Can you explain that? Thank you!</span>",
