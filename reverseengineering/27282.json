If the carry flag is CLEAR, the result is reduced by one.\" Why the result is reduced by 1 when the carry flag is CLEAR rather than SET? I think the SBC instruction subtracts the value of the carry flag from the result of subtracting operand2 from Rn, therefore the result is reduced by 1 when the carry flag is SET. Am I wrong?</p>\n</div>",
