    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Forgive me, I’m new, and not a programmer, but I am needing to see if this is possible.</p>\n<p>I have a study in my trading platform I had built a long time ago, lost the original, but have the compiled <code>.dll</code> file.</p>\n<p>Is there anyway to go about extracting the code, so I can update my study?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>It’s a <code>.dll</code> file that’s compiled, as a study.  Basically in my program, I load the <code>.dll</code>, and it loads the study to do what the code it programmed to do.</p>\n<p>Basically, I have a stock chart, with a custom <code>.dll</code> to plot lines at certain levels etc., the platform supports .dll compiled studies (like a plugin to do something within a program) they do this, so traders can write custom strategies/stuff for their own trading.</p>\n<p>The guy I hired a long time ago to code this study, is now gone, so I don’t have the source code to update the study with new stuff, just the compiled <code>.dll</code>.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for your help, I will appreciate it!</p>\n</div>",

Keep in mind that some languages like in the case of <code>.NET</code> use <code>IL</code> (a type of bytecode) that can facilitate when retrieving the source code, just as if it was developed in <code>VS</code>, <code>GCC</code>, or — simplifying — a language that works with the operating system's API is relatively easy for an experienced programmer to retrieve the source for you.</p>\n<p>Another factor to consider is the use of virtualized codes or protections that can hinder the reverse process by less experienced people, to help in your studies I recommend books like <strong>Practical Reverse Engineering</strong>, it will give you the basic concepts to start and understand the concepts necessary for a good analysis, as well as it will also present tools that will assist in your learning, this is the safest and most guided way for you to study.</p>\n</div>",
