There is a tool, <a href=\"https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-pdbutil.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">llvm-pdbutil</a>, that can generate them from YAML.</p>\n<p>Also, the compiler pipeline can generate CodeView debuginfo from LLVM IR's standard DWARF 2-style debug info format (apparently this happens during llvm CodeGen, not to be confused with clang CodeGen which is a way earlier process), and <strong>link.exe</strong> or (eventually) <strong>lld</strong> can slurp up that codeview and build a PDB out of it (de-duplicating type info in the process).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://llvm.org/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.html#codeview-debug-info-format\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://llvm.org/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.html#codeview-debug-info-format</a> says a bit about this, and the rest of that page discusses debug info in LLVM in general. Obviously clang has code to create type info, line number info, variable location/scope info, etc.  Again, the same DWARF 2-based debuginfo format is used regardless of intended output format, though there are a number of places in clang/lib/CodeGen/ that do something slightly different when CodeView is requested, and the clang \"driver\" does set some other options when codeview is enabled.</p>\n</div>",
