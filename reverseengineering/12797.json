    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I installed IDA Demo today, however I'm having a bit of trouble installing plugins. I'm trying to install a plugin called 'ClassInformer'. I followed all the instructions, editing the plugins.cfg file, copying the files to the plugin folder. However when I boot up IDA it gives me these errors:</p>\n<pre><code>LoadLibrary(C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA Demo 6.9\\plugins\\IDA_ClassInformer_PlugIn.pLW) error: The specified module could not be found.\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA Demo 6.9\\plugins\\IDA_ClassInformer_PlugIn.pLW: can't load file\n\nLoadLibrary(C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA Demo 6.9\\plugins\\IDA_ClassInformer_PlugIn.pLW) error: The specified module could not be found.\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA Demo 6.9\\plugins\\IDA_ClassInformer_PlugIn.pLW: can't load file\n</code></pre>\n<p>However the files are in the correct folder so I don't know why they can't be found. Here's a picture of the children of the folder.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bnaYi.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Folder Children</a></p>\n</div>",
