The cable, when connected without  any device at the other end, is detected by the computer as a serial communication port. I think this circuit is something designed by Nokia to help reduce additional circuitry on the phones that can be connected, and they work only with the Nokia PC Suite. Any brighter minds here might crack the code on its real purpose.</span>",

So, you have to measure resistance from gnd to 5v and compare it with another cable. Usually, the resistance is so high it's undetectable by a normal tester, and this also means there's nothing more than wire and plastic inside (for sure in any normal device).\nAlso, make sure to measure resistance backwards and forwards (I mean, swap the probes), because it is a semiconductor.</p>\n<p>You can measure also the data pair.</p>\n</div>",
