    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>When trying to compare the difference between two minified javascript files with random identifier names, about 95% of the changes are identifiers being renamed. I would like to use a tool that ignores these renames and just shows actual code addition and deletion.</p>\n<p>Such a tool would be very useful to easily see what an app has changed in an update.</p>\n</div>",
