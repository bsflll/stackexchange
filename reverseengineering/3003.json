You can also see <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/10168/setting-up-a-honeypot\">this</a> thread as the accepted answer here provides a lot of detail and perspective about what you should think about when you're setting up a honeypot.</p>\n<p>Any time you're doing any kind of analysis or interaction with malware you should be running it inside of a Virtual Machine. Security procedures aside you never know what you're going to run into when you're doing analysis. </p>\n<p>That being said, there is plenty of malware that operates differently if it detects it's running inside of a virtual machine vs. a real system but if you're just getting started I would recommend doing your analysis inside of a VM.</p>\n</div>",
