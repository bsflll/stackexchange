I can type in only the A-D0-9 characters and the space.</p>\n<p>The strange thing is, I can enter the username fine and interact with the CFE Bootloader CLI interface perfectly fine.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that the Linux kernel might be doing something weird with maybe the locale? Any ideas what I can check?</p>\n<p>I have tried two different USB → UART TTL devices and I have the same issue with both.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I've also tried resetting the USB → UART TTL Adapter in between entering the username and the password or interacting with the bash shell. So it definitely has something to do with kernel state. Possibly an anti-tamper / protection mechanism??</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Looks like <code>keymap.xml</code> is completely empty. Could this be the cause?</p>\n</div>",
