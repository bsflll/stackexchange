This should help find you the actual method body, at least it's what I have been using.</p>\n<p>I don't think it's ideal but also I don't know of a better way either.

While IDA Pro sort of supports Java decompilation (I guess you're interested in Android stuff), there are much more convenient decompilers for Java pseudocode. JEB is the best for Android, in my opinion. I haven't used it much recently, though.</p>\n<p>Or even \"decompile\" the whole dex into a text file via and grep.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/search?q=dex+decompiler\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.google.com.au/search?q=dex+decompiler</a></p>\n<p>If you're looking at pure Java - again, tons of \"decompilers\". Even IntelliJ has a plugin :)</p>\n</div>",
