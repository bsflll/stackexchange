There is something here related to <code>strace</code> equivalentes on windows (<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/864839/monitoring-certain-system-calls-done-by-a-process-in-windows\" title=\"monitoring certain system calls done by a process in windows\">stackoverflow.com/questions/864839/â€¦</a>). Sysinternals is probably the place to start.  2) If you have source, you could search for <code>HV_EVENTLOG_BAL_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</code> in a source file.</span>",

Not an easy route, but you could emulate the system in Qemu (<a href=\"https://qemu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/gdb.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">qemu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/gdb.html</a>), halt it early in the boot with the monitor, attach GDB and do some forensics.  More complex would be using Panda (<a href=\"https://github.com/panda-re/panda\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">github.com/panda-re/panda</a>).</span>",
