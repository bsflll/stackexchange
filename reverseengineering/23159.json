    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am reversing a BIOS and its code extensively uses SP register for 16-bit return addresses (and also things like \"bswap ESP\" to obtain a \"two-level-deep\" stack, and rarely \"mov mm7, esp\" to obtain a \"4-level-deep\" stack etc).</p>\n<p>It seems IDA does not track SP-related statements, even simple sequence of \"mov SP, F123h\" (inside the \"caller\" subroutine) followed by \"jmp sp\" (inside the \"callee\" subroutine) is not recognized. Therefore IDA can't show me a proper proximity view and I have to track the SP value and the whole control flow by hand.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to automate this process?</p>\n<p>I've read that I can add XREFs manually using ALT+F11. When I press ALT+F11 the callee dialog appears, but after I enter the address and click OK nothing happens. At least nothing visible.</p>\n<p>Why? Is it supposed to work only for \"call\" instructions, but not for \"jmp\"s? If not, where does the cursor have to be placed before pressing ALT+F11?</p>\n<p>P.S. I'm using IDA Pro 6.8.</p>\n</div>",
