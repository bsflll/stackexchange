    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I had recently this situation where in a program I was debugging I found:</p>\n<pre><code>03CD38D4:  8B15 8C5FF703  MOV EDX, DWORD PTR DS:[3F75F8C]\n</code></pre>\n<p>If I look for these bytes in the physical file I found nothing. I assumed this is because the reference to <code>3F75F8C</code>, which might change over each instance of the program, is being randomised by Windows. So I could not change the value directly in an hexed - say change <code>3F75F8C</code> to <code>3F75F88</code> (I suppose I can do it with some math involving the <code>base</code>, though).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can someone explain <strong>in detail</strong> how Windows proceeds when loading the PE file to randomise all these bytes? I have found <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/18556/how-do-aslr-and-dep-work\">posts</a> and info on how ASLR works, but I am more thinking on the steps that the OS makes to put the file in memory with the randomised addresses - i.e. how it goes from the actual bytes in the executable \"8B15 XXXX\" to \"8B15 8C5FF703\" as in my example.</li>\n<li>How the OS knows where the bytes that have to be randomised are (which exact addresses), and do it in a timely fashion?</li>\n<li>Will this OS process breaks if I <code>NOP</code> the whole instruction? (I am asking because I do not know if there is some sort of predefined index table, I only know there is a flag in the PE to mark ASLR)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n<p>As per the answer, what I undestood is that Windows will look into the <code>.reloc</code> section and will change one by one the references pointed in the section based on the random base. Then, if I modify the bytes of the instruction, since they have been defined in the <code>.reloc</code> section, my new bytes will be modified (probably I am wrong, but this is what I understood)</p>\n<p>However, I am not able to find out how Windows \"obtains\" the instruction:</p>\n<pre><code>03CD38D4:  8B15 8C5FF703  MOV EDX, DWORD PTR DS:[3F75F8C]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which is in file offset <code>482CD4</code> stored as:</p>\n<pre><code>MOV EDX, DWORD PTR DS:[B25F8C]\n</code></pre>\n<p>The image base is <code>400000</code> and base of code <code>1000</code>.</p>\n<p>I cannot find anything in the <code>.reloc</code> section that points to <code>03CD38D4</code>,<code>482CD4</code> or similar.</p>\n</div>",

So Windows uses the <code>.reloc</code> to find all \"pointers\" that have to be realocated, correct? I have been looking at <code>.reloc</code> with PEview and cannot find where the pointer to the instruction is. Knowing that the instruction is in <code>file offset=482CD4</code>, with original ref value=[B25F8C]<code>, being </code>image base=400000` and <code>base of code=1000</code>, how Windows creates the final value [3F75F8C]?</span>",
