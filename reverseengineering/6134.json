This is because one of these DLLs (<code>ole32.dll</code>) exports functions that are forwarded to the other DLL (<code>combase.dll</code>).</p>\n<p>Import REConstructor needs all adjacent thunks (without a <code>0x00000000</code> in between them) to be from the same DLL, so to fix this problem, you'll need to double-click on each of those <code>combase.dll</code> thunks and specify the forwarding function from <code>ole32.dll</code>.</p>\n<p>For example, double-click on the <code>combase.dll!CLSIDFromString</code> entry and tell Import REConstructor that its Import Table entry should actually be <code>ole32.dll!CLSIDFromString</code>, then double-click on the <code>combase.dll!CLSIDFromProgID</code> entry and tell Import REConstructor that its Import Table entry should actually be <code>ole32.dll!CLSIDFromProgID</code>, then the same for <code>CoTaskMemFree</code>, <code>CreateStreamOnHGlobal</code>, etc. Note that you'll need to do this for all <code>combase.dll</code> thunks in this block, not just the ones that are currently highlighted as invalid.</p>\n</div>",
