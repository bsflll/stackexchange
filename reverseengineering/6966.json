            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">There is a lot of overlap with the problem of code deobfuscation in general, even though here the obfuscation is by accident (poor compiler) rather than by design as with code obfuzzers. Similar problems are bound to crop up more and more, with the new crop of compilers which create huge binaries bloated by excessive inlining and unrolling. One side effect - compounded by global register allocation and optimisation (LTCG) - is that such binaries can become near unFLIRTable with IDA's current technology. That increases our analysis workload and makes removal of noise even more important.</span>",
