    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>i have the following assembly lines:</p>\n<pre><code>....\nLEA   EAX, DWORD PTR DS:[0x404212]\nMOV   DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-0x3CC], EAX\nPUSH  DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-0x3CC]\n...\n...\n...\nLEA   EAX, DWORD PTR DS:[0x404213]\nMOV   DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-0x3D0], EAX\nPUSH  DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-0x3D0]\n...\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, I asked myself how I can that piece of code translate into a higher language like C? Or a pseudo C language?</p>\n<p>But, for the the two blocks I have the following:</p>\n<pre><code> UNKNOWNTYPE *eax_pointer_1;     //points to 00404212\n UNKNOWNTYPE *eax_pointer_2;     //points to 00404213\n</code></pre>\n<p>In ollydbg, I see that at the address 00404212 there is the following line :</p>\n<pre><code>ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX], DH\n</code></pre>\n<p>and at the address 00404213, there is:</p>\n<pre><code>XOR BYTE PTR DS:[EAX], AL\n</code></pre>\n<p>So my question would be : Is that a correct transformation? Have you some ideas how I can the instructions at <strong>00404212</strong> and <strong>00404213</strong> make part of my transformation into a pseudo-C language?</p>\n</div>",
