    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am currently practicing for a CTF competition and one of the practice challenges is a buffer overflow exploit. Before this challenge I knew absolutely nothing about these exploits, but I've been reading into them and trying to understand the basics.</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n\nvoid win(void)\n{\n    system(\"cat flag.txt\");\n    return;\n}\n\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    printf(\"Give me some data: \\n\");\n    fflush(stdout);\n    char buffer[32];\n    gets(buffer);\n    printf(\"You entered %s\\n\", buffer);\n    fflush(stdout);\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So what I know so far is that I need to redirect to the <code>win()</code> function and that there is a buffer of 32 characters. I broke down the program into assembly and found that the <code>win()</code> function's address is <code>0x080484fd</code>. After that, I connected to the program's server and typed 32 characters and the function's address. The program only returned my input, and did not redirect to the <code>win()</code> function. I did some more reading and tried doing it from another shell with the command:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo python -c 'print \"a\"*32 + \"\\x08\\x04\\x84\\xfd\"' &gt;&amp; /dev/pts/2\n</code></pre>\n<p>Sadly, this did not get me to the <code>win()</code> function. What am I doing wrong? I've hit a total block and not sure what else to try. Any advice and help would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n</div>",

First, let's look at stack layout for Linux (i assume it is Linux because of <strong>sudo</strong> and it is more common than other Unix-like OSes).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/zgw0O.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Linux stack layout\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/zgw0O.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>old-EIP</strong> is not immediately after our buffer.</p>\n<p>I compiled your program in my 32-bit Linux Mint and as you can see\nGCC throw security warning.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xEsF6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"You can see GCC warning\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xEsF6.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>Lets, prepare our exploit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8BbSA.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Segfault\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8BbSA.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>Segmentation fault, most probably EIP tried to execute wrong address.

We just need to find function symbol and smack the stack (old-EIP) value with that address.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SA8tl.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Exploit in action\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SA8tl.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>I hope it made things little more clear for you.</p>\n<p>Little security warning for you: Do not use <strong>sudo</strong> unless you need it.</p>\n</div>",
