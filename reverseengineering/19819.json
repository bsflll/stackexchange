Disabling ASLR os-wide seems a bit overkill and dangerous.</p>\n<p>I can't put breakpoints before it gets written because I don't know the address.</p>\n<p>Ideally, there should be a menu on the \"memory\" page that says \"who wrote here\" and point me to the diassembler line that did so.</p>\n<p>How can I do this?</p>\n</div>",

I don't think page allocations are related to ASLR so disabling it won't help the random address. Maybe you can log calls to VirtualAlloc and find the one that allocates the page you're interested in. Then you can put a breakpoint inside the page at the relative address your value is going to be at.</p>\n<p>Another approach - find values you know are written in the same page before your value is written and calculate the target address based on them.</p>\n</div>",
