I'm no .Net expert, but from what I read marshaled code is some kind of serialization that can be applied on objects to transfer functional code over binary channels (such as a TCP connection, for example). From what I understand, I should be able to reverse it to an understandable, or at least bytecode-like format.</p>\n<p>I tried software like ILSpy and dotPeek but they don't seem to recognize the code in <code>Code</code> as being managed code, and provide no usable output.</p>\n</div>",

(It can be used to convert a single object to an array of bytes, but that's not really relevant here, since your code doesn't do that.)</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Now, to your code: <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.interopservices.marshal\" rel=\"nofollow\">The <code>Marshal</code> class</a> contains methods useful for interoperability, including converting between native and managed types.</p>\n<p>And that's exactly what <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zdx6dyyh\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>GetDelegateForFunctionPointer()</code></a> does: it converts from an unmanaged function pointer (pointing to some unmanaged code) to a delegate that can be called from .Net.</p>\n<p>To verify that this is indeed what your code does, I have created a slightly simplified version of it and put the x86 machine code for a very simple function into the byte array:</p>\n<pre><code>class Program\n{\n    private static readonly byte[] code =\n    {\n        0xB8, 0x2A, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, // mov eax, 0x2a\n        0xC3 // ret\n    };\n\n    private delegate int FuncInt();\n\n    private static void Main()\n    {\n        IntPtr ptr = AllocExecutableMemory(code.Length);\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; code.Length; i++)\n        {\n            Marshal.WriteByte(ptr, i, code[i]);\n        }\n        var del = (FuncInt)Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer(ptr, typeof(FuncInt));\n        Console.WriteLine(del());\n    }\n\n    private static IntPtr AllocExecutableMemory(int length)\n    {\n        // see http://www.pinvoke.net/default.aspx/kernel32.virtualalloc,\n        // but change the return type from UIntPtr to IntPtr\n        return NativeMethods.VirtualAlloc(\n            UIntPtr.Zero, (UIntPtr)length,\n            AllocationType.COMMIT, MemoryProtection.EXECUTE_READWRITE);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code prints 42 (=0x2A), as expected.</p>\n<p>This means that to analyze <code>Code</code>, you have to look at it as unmanaged code (most likely x86).</p>\n</div>",
