I found <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1684/are-there-any-free-or-low-cost-disassemblers-for-the-renesas-h8-family-of-proces\">this question</a> that mentioned objdump supports H8300 but when I use the command I get the following error:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>objdump: can't use supplied machine h8300</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I guess the files does not have the right format. From what I can see, they have the following format:</p>\n<pre><code>BeginLine\nAddress:HexData:ChecksumByte?\nEndLine\n</code></pre>\n<p>I also tried to export the HexData to a bin file but I still get the same error. What is the expected format?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VgmOw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VgmOw.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/E2eUV.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/E2eUV.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
