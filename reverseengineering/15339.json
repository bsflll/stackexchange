Microsoft CRT provides <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zb3b443a\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">functions <code>_c_exit</code> and <code>_cexit</code></a> for such cpurpose, but it seems glibc <a href=\"https://github.com/lattera/glibc/blob/master/stdlib/exit.c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">does not have anything similar</a>. So you may have to simulate calling of the <code>atexit</code> handlers manually to perform cleanup.</p>\n</div>",
