It has instruction of the format <code>CALL &lt;JMP.&amp;KERNEL32.SetUnhandledExceptionFilter&gt;</code></p>\n<p>I am not an expert in Assembly. I know that CALL is used to call a sub-routine and JMP is used to jump to a particular address in the memory but what is the result of using CALL with JMP? Could anyone clarify on it? Even pointers to where I could find answers would be very helpful. Thanks.</p>\n</div>",

Each time the API is used, this <code>JMP</code> is <code>CALL</code>-ed, so execution is transferred transparently, and at the end of the API, the original address of the caller being still on the stack, the caller will be transparently returned to.</p>\n</div>",

This avoids multiple calls to VirtualProtect() by the loader, in order to write all over the code space to every reference to any given API.</p>\n</div>",
