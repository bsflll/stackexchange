            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>There is an H8 port of GNU binutils (the target is called 'h8300' I believe) which includes <code>objdump</code>. It seems it's even available in Debian in the package <a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/sid/binutils-h8300-hms\"><code>binutils-h8300-hms</code></a> (might be outdated).</p>\n<p>Alternative GNU-based toolchains for many Renesas processors (including H8) are provided by <a href=\"http://www.kpitgnutools.com/\">KPIT</a> (free but requires registration). I think they've been contributing to mainline too but not sure how's their progress there.</p>\n<p>Just for reference, here's how to use <code>objdump</code> to disassemble a raw binary:</p>\n<pre><code>objdump -m h8300 -b binary -D myfile.bin\n</code></pre>\n<p>Renesas offers their own commercial compiler/assembler/simulator (and I <em>think</em> a disassembler too) suite called <a href=\"http://am.renesas.com/products/tools/coding_tools/c_compilers_assemblers/h8_compiler/index.jsp\">High-performance Embedded Workshop</a> (HEW) but I couldn't find out how much it costs. There is a <a href=\"http://am.renesas.com/support/downloads/download_results/C2000301-C2000400/evaluation_h8c.jsp\">downloadable evaluation version</a>, however.</p>\n<p>For a quick look at some hex you can also try the <a href=\"http://www.onlinedisassembler.com/odaweb/run_hex\">Online Disassembler</a>, it has a couple of H8 variants.</p>\n</div>",
