    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Most of file formats IDA handles are structured in a linear way, for example EXE or ELF or Java's Class file and so on.</p>\n<p>However when it comes to tree-structured file format, I can't come up with a good way to properly handle them.<br/>\nFor example, recently I met a obfuscated PYC file, and the code has an OLLVM-like obfuscation plus some junk bytes, so a strong disassembler like IDA is needed. The PYC file format is in fact some magic byte + python marshal data, which is easy to parse. However, the marshaled data is in tree structure. Here's an example: <a href=\"http://www.beesfun.com/2017/04/01/PyCodeObject%E5%92%8Copcode/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.beesfun.com/2017/04/01/PyCodeObject%E5%92%8Copcode/</a><br/>\nAs you can see in the parsed result, the root object is a <code>module</code> whose consts contain other functions in module, and the function in module can also have sub-functions in their consts.\nAlso <code>dis</code> module or <code>pytype</code> can be used to parse the PYC file</p>\n<p>Like Java's compiled file, PYC stores bytecodes and some metadata for each functions, functions call each other <strong>with name</strong> instead of address, bytecode believe the <strong>address starts from 0 in every function</strong>. So I studied the source code of module/java in idasdk73, trying to understand how the developers from HexRays cope with the Java class file format.<br/>\nThen I found Java module in IDA are making a separate segment for each method and slot area. Because the python bytecode assume address starts from 0 in every function, and in every function there's a separate const pool which is also indexed from 0, I decided to create a header segment, a code segment and a const segment. \nBut this same way won't work for a PYC file, as the PYC format is tree-structured (sub-functions are stored in parent const pools), and IDA does not allow overlapped segments. So I can't make the consts area a single segment.<br/>\nBut if I create a segment for each const, there will be tens of thousands of segments if the original py file is big.</p>\n<p>Is there a better way to make a loader for the <strong>tree-structured</strong> format like PYC?</p>\n</div>",

And in fact my pyc processor is adapted from his one. For the reason why I don't choose to use the non-overlapping approach, that's because I want to preserve the reference to const area, however const areas contain functions, and those functions may contain smaller functions. I can't imagine how to write a loader for things like this :(</span>",
