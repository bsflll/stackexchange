I checked on Procmon and when I run it with privileges local on the system it call <code>RegSetValue</code> for some keys while with the remove debugging it doesn't happen although now it runs with <code>High</code> integrity. Oh, maybe it identify when I use the debugger.. I will need to check it.</span>",
