    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Last night I was extending functionality of HexRaysCodeXplorer - implemented feature to automatically rename duplicating variables. It needs some fixes to work well, but the problem I cannot cope with is - how to preserve lvar names?</p>\n<p>This is how it works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Before:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qZJUo.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Before\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qZJUo.png\"/></a></p></li>\n<li><p>After:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BLaeM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"After\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BLaeM.png\"/></a></p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>These names do exist only till end of current Ida session. </p>\n<p>I have read about Ida's netnodes, but I don't think it's rational to store lvar names in this container and do renaming at the start of every session. I suspect there is some native way to preserve essential information (like in this case), but I cannot find it.</p>\n<p>Because I had to analyse c-tree, I used HexRays classes like: <code>ctree_visitor_t</code>, <code>cfuncptr_t</code> and <code>lvar_t</code>.</p>\n</div>",

As I'm guessing your lvar name generation algorithm is not very computationally expensive, you can just regenerate them every time a function is decompiled.</p>\n<p>(This is the approach used by my <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/contests/2013/#detox\" rel=\"nofollow\">CrowdDetox Hex-Rays plugin</a>.)</p>\n</div>",
