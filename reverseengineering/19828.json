    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>This question might sound very naive, however, I got stuck when one of my friends asked me where can I find the address of an initialized register in the stack.</p>\n<p>For e.g., <code>info registers</code> in gdb gives us a list of registers and their corresponding values which are basically stored into it.</p>\n<p>Is there any command or way in which I could find the addresses where the registers are actually located? If yes could someone please direct me towards it.</p>\n<p>I am glad my friend asked me this question since it was something which I didn't notice earlier because there had not been a time where there was any need of the address where the registers are located.</p>\n</div>",

Registers are named locations of a dedicated size residing in the CPU (as pointed out by Paweł). That is, while the registers comprise a big part of the state of a CPU, they are not on the stack (which is usually in memory). However, you may want to edit your question to explain better what you need. I have a hunch you may be interested in stuff like the return address on the stack or the <code>push</code>-ed <i>register values</i> (<b>not</b> <i>registers</i>). You really need to edit your question to make clear what you want.</span>",
