    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I use IDA Pro 6.1 to disassemble static linked binary on Windows 32bit</p>\n<p>See, in the interactive screen, this subroutine (which is in one library function) can be found:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"IDAPro asm display\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BjLOg.png\"/></p>\n<p>But as I use these two ways to generate asm code:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>File-&gt;Produce-&gt;Create ASM File</li>\n<li>IDC script to iterate all the functions</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In both ways I can find this library function, but I can not find the definition of the subroutine <code>$LN28_0</code>. Which means in the generated asm code, all the <code>jmp $LN28_0</code> is undefined.</p>\n<p>So, I am wondering if it is a bug of IDA Pro? Or, do I need to configure some things? </p>\n</div>",
