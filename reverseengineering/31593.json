    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am creating a digital forensic tool that gets all data of user from different platforms. I successfully have done extraction for Teams website but I am unable to do so for the desktop app. So far, I know that the cookies are stored in Local/Microsoft/Teams folder. The file has no extension although it is an SQLite3 database. It shows all the cookies but these are in encrypted form. Is there any way I can get the actual decrypted cookies?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>If the server encrypts cookies, it does not mean that the client is able to decrypt them. The client must just send back all the cookies to\nthe server.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The server is not encrypting instead the client desktop app is. The Microsoft API use plain cookies. And I can not use the encrypted ones in browser as that will not start session.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Why do you think they are encrypted in the first place instead of just being some identifier into a backend database with the actual\ndata?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>What makes you think that the client (and thus your tool) would have access to the key to decrypt the data - wouldn't this defeat the\npurpose of encryption in the first place?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think they are encrypted because they are under the column \"encrypted value\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VnQOy.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VnQOy.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I have found a library that decrypts cookies stored by chrome and other browsers. I think we can decrypt the MS Teams cookies if we have the keys for it using the following code</p>\n<pre><code>import browser_cookie3\n\nc = browser_cookie3.chrome(cookie_file=r\"C:\\Users\\Farhan Ahmed\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\MicrosoftTeams_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\LocalCache\\Microsoft\\MSTeams\\EBWebView\\Default\\Network\\Cookies\",\n                            key_file=\"Key file\")\n\nfor cookie in c:\n    print(cookie.name, end=\" \")\n    print(cookie.value)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The code does not work for now and give some errors. I am checking why that is happening.</p>\n<p>I will appreciate if someone shares a better way of doing it.</p>\n</div>",
