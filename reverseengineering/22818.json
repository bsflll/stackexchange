You'll have to compare these word values against a running game to find out what they represent.</p>\n<p>Finding the bitmap text \"D.P. Gray 1994\" in the map leads me to believe you are looking at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitemare_3D\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nitemare 3D</a>, and with that information you can find <em>several</em> map editors, such as the one at <a href=\"http://wolf3d.darkbb.com/t1981-nitemare-3d-mapeditor\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://wolf3d.darkbb.com/t1981-nitemare-3d-mapeditor</a>, which conveniently also tells you the same details I describe above (do note that that post is from 2011).</p>\n<p><sup>It took me less than 5 minutes to recognize \"the format\", and another 5 or so to google \"D.P.
