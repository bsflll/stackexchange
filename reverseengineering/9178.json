In\nthat case you might simplify the code until you get something\ncompilable, to identify the \"missing links\".</p></li>\n<li><p>In this way I have been able to recompile also more complicated<br/>\nsoftware. First do everything statically, until you have something<br/>\nwhere code is created in VS. Then test it and expand it.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Code parts which do not recompile in ILSpy or Reflector (each has its own strengths and weaknesses) can be exported in IL and perhaps manually rearranged to recompile in the tools, then further processed in Visual Studio. Unfortunately, VS does not allow for inline IL assembled code.</p>\n<p>For instance, Reflector protects itself (among other means like obfuscation) against recompilation with useless jumps confusing the recompiler. ILSpy mostly is able to cope with this.</p>\n<p>ILSpy for instance is not able to recompile subclasses (i.e. classes within a class). They just not show up in the class tree, when in C# view. In IL view, you see all of them.</p>\n</div>",

You hit the point: ILSpy doesn't generate a complete/correct project so in VS I saw the code that I want to edit but in the compiling VS generates a lot of errors. Unfortunately I don't know the complete \"desing\" of the software so I don't know which part I have to rearrange.</span>",

It may be - in particular for non-trivial assemblies - very well possible to identify the causes of errors of a VS project and link them to the IL view. The missing or erroneous parts may be reconstructed in C# from a manual conversion of IL code to C#. It is a similar but simpler procedure than the step from assembly to HL in other languages,  Understanding a \"design\" is very much easier in a HL view like C#.</span>",

In fact, this feature was actually removed from more\nrecent releases of this software. The old version that had this feature is\nno longer available, but it's still a decent and free .NET decompiler so if you want to check it out, it's called DotNet Resolver.</p>\n<p>There's also the Reflexil plugin for Reflector, which has already been mentioned, but it's also pretty unreliable and limited.</p>\n<p>If you really want to get things done, however, I'd recommend using the ILDASM and ILASM tools which are installed with Visual Studio. </p>\n<p>I know you want to be able to just edit the high level code, but that's just not very\nfeasible. You can use Reflector to export the source code generated from a\ndisassembled .NET application as a project, but then you have errors, missing\ndependencies, and the like to deal with.</p>\n<p>With ILDASM and ILASM you would be editing the MSIL directly, but it's really the best way to go about modifying a .NET application. MSIL is actually pretty\nsimple and you won't have to deal with the source code produced by tools like\nReflector, which are often riddled with errors. \nMoreover, you generally won't have to worry about obfuscation. In 99% of cases you will always be able to disassemble .NET applications down to MSIL\nand then reassemble them without any issue.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of resources online to aid you with both editing and understanding MSIL if you're not familiar with it. Good luck!</p>\n</div>",

As I wrote in above comment, yeah, the decompiler generates the code that I interested in but when I export it to VS the compilation failed due to the several errors. And without the complete knowledge of the software it is impossible to correct the errors (at least for me). I will try the tool in VS that you have mentioned modifying MSIL directly.</span>",
