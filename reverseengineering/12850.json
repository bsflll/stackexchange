    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am <strong>very</strong> new to Reverse Engineering, though it captivates me. Hence, I'm apologizing beforehand if I say anything ridiculous in the following, and hope you will help me find the way!</p>\n<p><strong>Context:</strong> I have an application which seems coded in Adobe AIR and running on my x64 Windows 7. This application does a lot of things, but what interests me is: it communicates with an <strong>XMPP</strong> server through port 5223, through <strong>SSL</strong>. My goal is to be able to read the XML requests sent by the client to the server <strong>before</strong> they are SSL-encrypted (so right after the request is created, but right before it is encrypted).</p>\n<p><strong>Unsuccessful tries:</strong> I attempted to set up a <strong>MitM</strong>, but the application won't accept my custom-crafted certificate because it is different from the real server certificate. I also attempted to use <strong>Echo Mirage</strong>, but without any success.\n<br/><br/><br/>\nI have read a bit about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking\" rel=\"nofollow\">hooking</a>, and figured it was adapted to my problem. I was thinking: if I can get the application to print the XMPP request before SSL-encrypting it, the job would be done. To do so, implementing a C# hook with <a href=\"https://easyhook.github.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">EasyHook</a> seemed like a good idea to me.</p>\n<p>Am I largely mistaken? If not, how exactly would I go about getting my hook function to print the requests, and before which function call should I place it?<br/>I am open to any documentation you might have for me!</p>\n</div>",

The function that you'd want to hook is the function that performs the SSL encryption, as it would be the function that receives the plaintext as input.</p>\n<p>The hard part is finding that encryption function. To do so, I recommend that you use <a href=\"https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/processmonitor.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Process Monitor</a> to capture the network-send events and double-click on those events to see the callstack. You can then use a disassembler and/or a debugger to analyze the functions in the callstack that are called prior to the low-level network send call. This will help you narrow down which functions to analyze so that you can more easily find the function that performs the encryption.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can try to find the encryption function by searching for cryptographic functions via a tool like <a href=\"https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/PEiD#Krypto_Analyzer\" rel=\"nofollow\">PEiD with its Krypto ANALyzer plugin</a> and then analyzing them with a disassembler.</p>\n</div>",
