A gadget can set a register value by <code>pop</code>ing a value from the stack, <code>mov</code>ing a value or adding/subtracting a register, followed by <code>ret</code> (which means you can usually find them at the end of functions), causing them to return to the next value on the stack (where the return address is expected to be), creating a <code>ROP Chain</code>.</p>\n<p>A simple example is when you want to execute a command using <code>system</code>.<br/>\nyou can (on a 64 bit OS) jump to a pop-return where the first value on the stack is your buffer address and the second value is the address of <code>system</code>, causing system to be called with your buffer as an argument in the correct register (rdi for linux, ecx for windows).<br/>\nOn a 32 bit os, the overflow is somewhat simpler. All you need is to oerride the return address to <code>system</code> and override the 4 bytes after it to be the address of you buffer. That will execute <code>system</code> with your buffer as the first parameter.</p>\n</div>",

What you require is to change the return address from the call to foo() to point to critical(), so that execv() receives the path \"/bin/sh\" as the parameter.  Normally, your shellcode would be the contents of critical() itself, and the return address would point to the buffer that holds the critical() function.</p>\n</div>",
