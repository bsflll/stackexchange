I was going through a program and noticed that IDA does make some mistakes on what it decides what on its pseudo code will be.</p>\n<p>Is there a list of common mistakes by IDA and do you think that it would be possible to get something to a compilable source?</p>\n<p>I thought I would test it out on some programs and one thing weird I noticed is that it will do:</p>\n<pre><code>v1 = thiscall();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where as in source I just have the <code>thiscall();</code>.</p>\n<p>I also noticed that it bloats a lot of things which is from the assembly itself.</p>\n<p>So my questions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a list of common IDA mistakes ?</li>\n<li>Can once I have worked back fairly close to source will IDA produce a header file ?</li>\n<li>Is it possible to get back to a source that I could at least compile code from?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Its looking like I might be able to providing if I knew the libraries and outline of the program well. Let me know what your thoughts and experiences from using IDA on this subject.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong>\nI found a project that actually did this. All functions are byte for byte in 100% accuracy. So yes my past self, it is indeed possible.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/diasurgical/devilution\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/diasurgical/devilution</a></p>\n</div>",
