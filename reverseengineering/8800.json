If an attacker can breach your server and copy your code from there, no authentication scheme will help you.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You somehow need to make sure that unauthorized users won't get their hands on a valid username/password combination.</p>\n<p>For example, imagine an authorized user publishes their username and password somewhere. How will you detect it and how will you deal with it?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Your application could still help an attacker with reverse-engineering the file format itself (but not your code directly). For example, they could try input various data into your application and observe how does the output file change.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Consider getting rid of the client application and instead make your application web-based.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
