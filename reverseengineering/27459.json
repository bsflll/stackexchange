It is the one at offset <code>0x1180</code></p>\n<pre><code> 115: int main (int argc, char **argv, char **envp);\n │           0x00401180      55             push ebp \n</code></pre>\n<p>but the rest is wrong.</p>\n<p>If we look at the code in the main function especially around the call to your first identified function we can see.</p>\n<pre><code>0x00401193      50             push eax\n0x00401194      6800214000     push str.Enter_Your_Pass_Key_:__n ; 0x402100 ; \"Enter Your Pass Key : \\n\" ; int32_t arg_8h\n0x00401199      e8b2feffff     call fcn.00401050\n</code></pre>\n<p>From the arguments passed to this function (const string \"Enter Your Pass Key\") we could indicate that the function at offset <code>0x1050</code> is more like a printing function than one that validates your input.</p>\n<p>Also further code that looks like this</p>\n<pre><code>0x004011a4      51             push ecx                    ; int32_t arg_ch\n0x004011a5      6818214000     push 0x402118               ; \"%s\" ; int32_t arg_8h\n0x004011aa      e811ffffff     call fcn.004010c0\n</code></pre>\n<p>indicates that here we take the input from the user so it would be hard to validate it before getting it.</p>\n<p>Spotting function that does the validation is also simple in this task, as it is just before some comparison and printing good/bad info.</p>\n<p>In here the comparison is at <code>0x11c1</code> and the function before is <code>0x0401100</code> and it takes the user input as an argument. So that's good indicators that it is the validation.</p>\n<p>And inside this function we can see that a interesting string is being loaded to a local variable</p>\n<pre><code>0x0040110d      c745f4f82040.  mov dword [var_ch], str.elite ; 0x4020f8 ; \"elite\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>and later it is being compared (byte by byte) with our input. So the valid input is for this program is \"elite\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ieyhA.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ieyhA.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
