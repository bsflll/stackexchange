    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm reverse engineering an ARM64 binary and I came across the following instruction</p>\n<pre><code>48 05 48 4A    eor w8, w10, w8, lsr #1\n</code></pre>\n<p>I looked up the definition of ARM64's <code>eor</code> instruction here: <a href=\"https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0473/m/arm-and-thumb-instructions/eor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0473/m/arm-and-thumb-instructions/eor</a></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the information in that documentation doesn't directly address the optional <code>lsr #1</code> part of the instruction.</p>\n<p>I understand this instruction would generally perform a Bitwise Exclusive OR between registers w10 and w8, storing the result in register w8. What I'm unsure about is the Logical Shift Right portion. Does this shift occur on the result of the EOR, or does it first shift one of the registers and then perform the EOR?</p>\n<p>Also, if anyone can recommend a good tool for testing this I would be appreciative.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n</div>",
