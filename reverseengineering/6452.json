    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm looking for a good front-end to GDB and looks like Hopper is a good alternative. Unfortunately, I wasted several hours but still couldn't make it working with gdbserver. Here are the steps I'm following:</p>\n<p><em>Note that, I actually need to attach the GDB, I can't run the program using GDB for several reasons.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I run <code>hopper-gdb-server-v3</code>. As far as I can see it's not possible to pass any parameters to this, it just doesn't care about arguments. So I think there's nothing to do wrong here.</li>\n<li>I run <code>hopper-v3</code> and opening the ELF binary I want to reverse.</li>\n<li>I'm running <code>Show debugger screen</code> and it wants me to choose GDB server. Unfortunately, the list is always empty.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am stuck at this point. Basically I can't select the <code>hopper-gdb-server-v3</code> in the Hopper itself. I cannot see any documentation in its webpage.</p>\n<p>Can anyone help me with this?</p>\n</div>",

If you can't get it to work I suggest you contact the developper, he's usually quite responsive. Also I don't think it's currently possible to attach to a running program.</p>\n</div>",
