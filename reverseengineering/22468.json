Do you guys have any idea or advise on how to identify the diode. The diode which I need to identify is D1 on the picture below. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/y8zVh.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"the diode which i want to identify is D1\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/y8zVh.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

These devices are typically packaged\nin tiny <strong>glass cylinders</strong> with a connecting lead at each end. A <strong>stripe</strong>\non the cylinder marks the diode’s cathode, making the opposite side\nthe anode. With some diodes, you may need a magnifying glass to see\nthe stripe clearly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(emphasis mine)</p>\n<p>IF you need more help with the circuit, I'd suggest asking on <a href=\"https://electronics.stackexchange.com/\">https://electronics.stackexchange.com/</a> where there are many more experts on this topic.</p>\n</div>",
