If you wish to request SH4 support in reko, just add an issue here (<a href=\"https://github.com/uxmal/reko/issues\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">github.com/uxmal/reko/issues</a>). It takes me about 2 weeks to complete basic support for a new architecture in Reko. It helps if you can supply a sample ELF file for that architecture.</span>",
