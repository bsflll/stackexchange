    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am working on a HEX string, which I figured out is a binary. I would like some pointers on what to do next after I have disassembled from hex to assembly. I'm just assuming that the architecture is possibly x86 and used onlinedisassembler.com to convert to assembly code.</p>\n<p>Is there a way I can run/debug using gdb? It's a challenge, so I would need to either run the assembly, debug it or do a static analysis and find out what's happening! Any help would be appreciated.</p>\n<p>The disassembled code looks something like this (not sharing the whole thing, just first two lines):</p>\n<pre><code>                       .data:00000000 77 90                            ja     0xffffff92\n                       .data:00000002 97                               xchg   edi,eax\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
