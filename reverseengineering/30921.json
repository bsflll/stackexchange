You might find this writeup I made recently for a challenge useful to hackily reverse it to get readable V8 assembly, but heads up it is on the longer side/not strictly focused on vercel/pkg reversing: <a href=\"https://github.com/JesseEmond/blitz-2024-registration\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">github.com/JesseEmond/blitz-2024-registration</a></span>",
