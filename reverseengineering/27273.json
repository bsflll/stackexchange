Dos program could run on architectures different from x86? The base address wasn't the same for every dos program?</p>\n<p>I tried also with IDA Free, but it says there are tons of problems\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CvkHr.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CvkHr.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I also tried with radare2 but it's really hard for me..</p>\n<pre><code>I've found this info through virustotal:\nFile type   DOS EXE\nMagic   MS-DOS executable, MZ for MS-DOS\nTrID    EXEPACK compressed DOS Executable (68.2%)\nTrID    Clipper DOS Executable (10.5%)\nTrID    Generic Win/DOS Executable (10.5%)\nTrID    DOS Executable Generic (10.4%)\nTrID    VXD Driver (0.1%)\nFile size   63.16 KB (64680 bytes)\n</code></pre>\n<p>EDIT: thanks to the advice I used radare + a graphical interface called Cutter. It seems to work properly but I can't understand how to export the whole pseudocode</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FqvaQ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"the pseudocode\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FqvaQ.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

A typical suggestion is to load DOS exe files at an address like 1000:0000, to prevent access to well-known memory areas of a DOS system being misidentified as access to memory areas belonging to the program. As the interrupt vectors and the bios state is near address 0, it is generally unwise to load EXE files with base address 0 into a reverse enigineering tool.</span>",

As long as you have no problems reading the parts you are interested in, and you don't rely on Xrefs being complete, there is no harm in having lots of problem in highly optimized library code.</span>",

GHIDRA includes a decompiler for free. IDA has an optional decompiler for a lot of $$$ (called HexRays), and AFAIK radare2 also includes some decompiler. In my experience, the GHIDRA decompiler output on segmented 16-bit executables is mediodcre. I don't think I tried other decompilers on 16-bit executables seriously, yet.</span>",
