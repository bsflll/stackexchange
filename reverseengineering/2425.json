I tried to decrypt virut.ce (this is one polymorphic malware) in ollyDbg but it is using anti debugging and anti emulation technique and so it is very hard to find virus body.</p>\n<p>I am able to get virus body of encrypted virus. But in case of polymorphic virus, decryption routine is morphed and hence it is difficult to obtain virus body.</p>\n<p>Can anyone suggest me better approach to get virus body. Or can suggest other simple polymorphic malware which I can debug in OllyDbg. My goal is to get virus body from polymorphic malware.</p>\n</div>",

Yes it bit hard to start work with it but it will pay back your time cost. By bypass my means some virus can detect even ether and prevent itself to decrypt.

Learn how malware detects this and think of a way around this detection mechanism. Read other papers and study how polymorphic and even metamorphic code works. I have always liked the metamorphism paper on OpenRCE <a href=\"http://www.openrce.org/articles/full_view/29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.openrce.org/articles/full_view/29</a></p>\n<h2>Getting there</h2>\n<p>In order to get this going I'd recommend writing a lot of unpacker plugins etc for IDA. See malware as unions. First analyse the first layer, build a plugin to automatically (staticly) unpack it (again IDA) and continue doing this till you get the entire thing to reverse. Remove the (bytepatch) anti-debug techniques and really get to know how this thing functions. </p>\n<p>Basicly hard malware is a long tedious process that can not be automated. Making it really fun to analyse them. If you want quicker analyses you can look at TitaniumCore or submit the sample to a VirusExchange site like offensive computing :)</p>\n<p><em><strong>Have fun and goodluck!</strong></em></p>\n</div>",

I'd recommend to do this either by hand or use open source software (Cuckoo box comes to mind as does ZeroWine).</span>",

The trouble is that a fair amount of malware includes anti-re beyond encryption, including techniques to detect or at least react to the presence of a debugger.  This means that while your idea is a good one it will not work in all cases because the malware may not successfully decrypt itself under a debugger.  This is why dumping the process is a more reliable approach though it is more difficult to then analyze the binary.</span>",
