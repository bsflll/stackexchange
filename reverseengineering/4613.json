    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have added support for type info handling in my IDA processor, and now in the <code>use_regarg_type3</code> event, I am mapping a parameter that I know is an <code>enum</code>. But, I am unsure how to set an <code>imm</code> operand to be <code>enum</code>, as you would if you pressed m key and selected the type manually.</p>\n<p>So, my question is what function do I call to set the op to be an <code>enum</code>, and how do I get any needed arguments for said function from the <code>tinfo_t</code> I have.</p>\n<h3>Edit 1</h3>\n<p>There is an <code>op_enum</code> function, but it wants <code>enum_t</code> and from the <code>tinfo_t</code> via <code>type.get_enum_base_type()</code> I get <code>type_t</code>.</p>\n<h3>Edit 2</h3>\n<p>I have it working using</p>\n<pre><code>qstring tname;\ntype.get_type_name(&amp;tname);\nenum_t enumt = get_enum(tname.c_str());\nop_enum(cmd.ea, x.n, enumt, 0);\n</code></pre>\n<p>But, it feels wrong to have to go via a string, and a little fragile. So, now the questions is: is there a better/safer way to achieve this ?</p>\n</div>",
