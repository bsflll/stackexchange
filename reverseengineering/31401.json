I can say I am able to connect to <strong>process (0)</strong> and start the machine (by using IDA 32bit,  IMO it has something to do with bios! or I don't know at all!).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>But after starting it I cannot get data back to IDA. when I try to suspend the machine via IDA it won't work at all and takes so long time without any chance.</li>\n<li>I also tried connecting to the machine via another IDA instance by a 64bit version of IDA and I can only connect to <strong>process (1)</strong> which breaks the line to debug processes already running!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Could someone help a bit on this tricky thing?</p>\n</div>",
