However, in my scenario, I don't have an access to the GUI and I want to deploy <code>Ghidra</code> for Headless Analysis.</p>\n<p>For some reason, just copying the plugin files to <code>&lt;ghidra_home&gt;\\Ghidra\\Extensions</code> doesn't do the trick, and it looks like it only partially installs the plugin, and only the GUI way does the complete job.</p>\n<p>Any idea how can I programmatically install plugins for Ghidra?</p>\n</div>",

Upon copying the files to the described folder, I am able to access classes from the extension - for example <code>from cppclassanalyzer.utils import CppClassAnalyzerUtils</code> successes, but it is not fully initalized because <code>CppClassAnalyzerUtils.getManager(currentProgram)</code> returns None.

Would you like to configure them?\"</code> dialog on starting the Ghidra GUI.</p>\n<p>This dialog is part of the method <code>ghidra.framework.project.tool.GhidraTool#checkForNewExtensions</code> and the actual install process happens <code>ghidra.framework.project.tool.GhidraTool#addInstalledExtensions</code>.</p>\n<p>The problem is that during the headless processing there is no tool available, i.e. <code>state.tool</code> is <code>null</code> and these methods don't seem to be intended to be run in a headless context. I don't quite understand what specifically makes it work afterwards, but overall I am reasonably confident that this is an issue with the specific plugin, and the fact that it requires the <code>ServiceManager</code> to provide the service even for the analyzers (which should be available in headless mode after unzipping).</p>\n<p>So this is an issue with this specific plugin which is somewhat hinted at in an already <a href=\"https://github.com/astrelsky/Ghidra-Cpp-Class-Analyzer/issues/18#issuecomment-753588038\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">existing issue</a></p>\n</div>",
