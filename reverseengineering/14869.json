Possibly some of them are routed to the unlabeled 7-pin pad at the top. To dump the firmware you can probably just use the <a href=\"https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Dump_002fRestore-Files.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>dump</code> command</a> (see the datasheet for memory ranges)</p>\n</div>",
