I understand it is not possible to run this plug-in via terminal/batch mode. Is there a way I can export the results to a more readable format such as a .pdf or a .txt? I need a more readable format then the .BinDiff and .BinExport formats that it generates. </p>\n</div>",

However the .BinDiff results are essentially an SQLite file and can be handled as one. Firefox has a plug-in to read these SQLite files found <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. For linux I have found that <a href=\"http://sqliteman.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sqliteman</a> works well. </p>\n</div>",
