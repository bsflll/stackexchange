It's because it doesn't enforce scope to it's variables so smart names cause conflicts. If they were postfixed with stack or data offset respectively there wouldn't be such problems.</p>\n<p>Alternatively maybe there is a switch in masm which can correct those errors.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TRAOD_P4_orig.exe.v2.data.asm(1058192) : error A2005:symbol\n  redefinition : Args TRAOD_P4_orig.exe.v2.data.asm(2724112) : error\n  A2005:symbol redefinition : Dest</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>; LINE somewhere in the code above\nDest            = byte ptr -404h\nArgs            = byte ptr  10h\n\n; LINE 1058192\n; char Args[]\nArgs            dd ?                    ; DATA XREF: _Caption_Draw:loc_523425\\u2191r\n\n; LINE 2724112\n; char Dest\nDest            db ?                    ; DATA XREF: sub_42DF68+38\\u2191o\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Apparently there was even a case where Memory was both a local variable and a data reference in the same function.</strong></p>\n</div>",
