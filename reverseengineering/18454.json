            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Every column value can be either a dot or the same column character. Those columns are boolean and the column character stands for \"True\" while the dot stands for \"False\". </p>\n<ul>\n<li>R stands for \"Returns\" and is True (has an \"R\" in the column's value instead of a dot) if the function returns. Functions may not return and this requires special handling by IDA and the reverse engineer.</li>\n<li>F stands for \"Far\" and is true for functions that are far functions, or false otherwise.</li>\n<li>L stands for \"Library\" function, and is true for functions IDA recognised as library functions (usually using <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/tech/flirt/in_depth.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">FLIRT</a>).</li>\n<li>S stands for \"Static\" function.</li>\n<li>B stands for a E/R/BP stack frame based function. As part of IDA's analysis functions that use the xBP register for easier stack access are marked so.</li>\n<li>T stands for Type and indicates whether a function has type information assigned. Either manually or automatically by IDA using FLIRT.</li>\n<li>the equal sign (=) indicates the frame pointer is equal to the initial stack pointer. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of those values can be manually accessible using the \"Edit function\" dialog (<kbd>alt+p</kbd>), like seen here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yNEtX.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"IDA edit function dialog\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yNEtX.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>This is also documented and can be found at <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/586.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hex-Rays website</a>, with a shorter explanation. </p>\n<p>Additionally, according to <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/18454/what-is-the-meaning-of-single-letters-in-idas-functions-window#comment29115_18455\">Arnaud Diederen</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>since 7.1, IDA also provides tooltips for those arguably cryptic single-letter columns.
