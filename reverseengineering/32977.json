    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am learning IDA and currently working with the debugger. In particular, I want to automate the interaction with my remote binary (from Windows Subsystem Linux - Ubuntu 22.04 instance), like what I can did with <code>pwntools</code>. These interactions cover readline, sendline, etc. that can automate my interaction with the binary, and sometimes sending non-ASCII characters. Are there anyways that I can work on this? At current time, I already setup the remote debugging with <code>Remote Linux debugger</code> from IDA.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div>",
