If I wanted to see what those strings are, what commands do I use in lldb? I've struggled several hours tonight just figuring out how to set (and delete the ones I got wrong) breakpoints. Please formulate any advice as if you're speaking to a brain-damaged monkey.</p>\n</div>",

(Anyone's welcome to correct me, I don't know what I'm talking about on this.) The values are (probably) in the stack. So run this command:</p>\n<pre><code>m read -c 8 -s 4 -f x $esp\n</code></pre>\n<p>The output will look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>0xbfffbe1c: 0x00012d46 0x0026a124 0x10632399 0xbfffbf70\n0xbfffbe2c: 0x00000000 0x00000002 0x11377c30 0xbfffbe68\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first value is the return value or something like that. Every word after that are the arguments to the function. They can be accessed with:</p>\n<pre><code>po 0x0026a124\npo 0x10632399\npo 0xbfffbf70\n</code></pre>\n<p>These gave output of decimal numbers (they're pointers after all, they were just addresses). Something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>(lldb) po 0x10632399\n274932633\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, to see the strings themselves, I did the following:</p>\n<pre><code>(lldb) expr ((char *) 2531620)\n(char *) $7 = 0x0026a124 \"NDPD:CryptHandler\"\n(lldb) expr ((char *) 274932633)\n(char *) $8 = 0x10632399 \"/Users/REDACTED/Library/Containers/com.REDACTED/Data/Library/Application Support/REDACTED/REDACTED/issues/-SOMENUMBER.pdn\"\n(lldb) expr ((char *) 3221208944)\n(char *) $9 = 0xbfffbf70 \"der\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Not quite the eureka I was hoping for. More likely, I need to wait for the return value to show something. On to more adventures for me.</p>\n</div>",
