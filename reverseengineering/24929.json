I understand assembly language. But, is there a better way than just going through the text file, instruction by instruction, trying to figure out what the program is doing?  I don't have IDA Pro but I have Ghidra. Would I use Ghidra somehow? Or would I just use a debugger like x64dbg?</p>\n</div>",

Typically tools like IDA or Ghidra would use a sort of database which cross-references contents from the binary in the disassembly. So in a sense by having a textual respresentation here and a binary there you have lost those cross-references and \"dumbed down\" the disassembly. So I'd suggest you start over and use the tool (e.g. Ghidra) for the purpose it was created for. If you <i>just</i> want a \"dumbed down\" disassembly, <code>objdump</code> can do that for you.</span>",

What I'm trying to do is analyze the obfuscation algorithm used and try and \"de-obfuscate\" it.</span>",
