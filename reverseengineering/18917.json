Raw formats are just intended to be mapped directly in memory without going through an operating system first. It is very common in the embedded software World.</p>\n</div>",

It gives several good hints to solve your problem. And, you do not really need to convert the raw format into something else once you identified it. Just disassemble it. :)</span>",
