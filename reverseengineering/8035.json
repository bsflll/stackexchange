I have the hardware, a JTAG programmer, the name of the chips (probably) under the hood (Altera Stratix III), and a picture of an unpopulated PCB:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"PCB\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yOmjC.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>How can I get this board doing something? How can I figure out how to interface with the FTDI USB chip? Or even how to turn one of the LEDs on?</p>\n</div>",

If the FPGAs are configured from JTAG programmable flash chips (Altera EPCs) you should be able to load those too.  If they are \"standard\" SPI flash devices, that'll be a bit more buzzing out to do once you've identified them.</p>\n<p>Anything else will require a clock.  Find a crystal oscillator on the board and bozz that out to the FPGA pins.</p>\n<p>You should then be able to make an LED flash (the \"hello world\" of FPGA land!).</p>\n<p>Buzzing out the Rx and Tx lines from the FTDI chip should then get you a potential terminal.  From there it should be dead easy (!)</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>OK, so without a bare board to help...  </p>\n<p>There is JTAG software which can scan the chain and tell you which signals are high and low, or drive individual pins high and low. This is commercial: <a href=\"http://www.topjtag.com/probe/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.topjtag.com/probe/</a> - I'm sure there is some non-commercial open-source somewhere too, but can't find it at the moment.</p>\n<p>You should be able to use this to step through all of the FPGA pins and find which one lights up the LEDs.</p>\n<p>Putting an LED on the FTDI Rx and Tx pins, you should be able to light them up too, or make them go off if they are floating high. </p>\n<p>The same should also work for the crystal I imagine too.</p>\n<p>You'll be creating contention on each signal which is actually driven from the non_FPGA end each time you step through, but for short periods (even seconds) that should be fine.</p>\n</div>",
