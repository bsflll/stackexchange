    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>from past few days i am fiddling with the firmware file of dvb s2 receiver of gx6605s processor.\nmy preliminary purpose is to <em><strong>read the hidden menu password</strong></em> for given firmware.(password used to hide-unhide menu)\nDump.bin extraction gives 7 other bin files boot.bin,data.bin,info.bin,kernel.bin,logo.bin,root.bin,table.bin..</p>\n<p>Kernel.bin is lzma compressed so using a hex editor i removed the lzma header to search the menu password but could'nt find it may be due to a lay man's approach.I also used binwalk with various commands to further extract the fragments but now clueless what to do next.\nI request the group members to help me &amp; guide me in choosing the appropriate approach.\nThank you..</p>\n<p>firmware link is shared below\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c2SyGaHu5I9P1jRCWKQomAYNQBYbgmg4/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c2SyGaHu5I9P1jRCWKQomAYNQBYbgmg4/view?usp=sharing</a></p>\n</div>",
