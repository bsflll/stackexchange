    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I was parsing some modified C++ headers with IDA when I come to some strange behavior. Imagine we have a structure like this (stored in a C header):</p>\n<pre><code>struct S\n{\n    enum {EN0, EN1};\n\n    int m1;\n} ;\n</code></pre>\n<p>When I parse it with IDA Pro the created type seems to threat the first unnamed enum as data member inside the structure. I'm thinking - is this correct behavior in the case?</p>\n<p>I tested this on online C compiler which seems not to count the enumeration inside <code>struct S</code> as part of its data (<a href=\"http://melpon.org/wandbox/permlink/AwbLoM0eUkZ9zfdl\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> - i tested sizeof of <code>S</code> when there is only enum in it and it gave size of 0). </p>\n</div>",
