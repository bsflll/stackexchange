    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm having a tough time finding any information at all concerning <em>physical memory addresses</em> and if/how I can get them from a program at runtime (Windows NT/10). When I run a program in OllyDbg and I'm at a breakpoint, for example, are the memory addresses in the dump, disassembler window, and memory map <em>physical</em> addresses or are these actually still virtual addresses? Do user-mode programs even have any concept of the physical memory or is this only between the kernel and the MMU? Thanks.</p>\n</div>",

Basically, you must use the directory table to map virtual address pages to physical ones.

I was confusing virtual addresses in memory with the \"dummy\" addresses that are displayed when the program is on disk. I forgot the official name for these but they are basically addresses just used as reference while the program is not yet in memory for disassembly purposes and once it's loaded, the addresses could change to wherever the loader places them, but what I've learned from you is that even still, the addresses will be shown as virtual addresses.</span>",
