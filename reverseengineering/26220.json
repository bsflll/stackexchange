    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've been trying to modify a data file within an app which has random lines of readable text but is mostly incomprehensible, it has no file extension.</p>\n<p>I think its compressed because I was able to find an older version of the same data file [same name, same location in game files] which has a much larger file size and is in plain text.</p>\n<p>By default in the game files, the encrypted/compressed version is used but if I replace it with the older version it still works[all changes between them are however not present], this makes me think that the game does some sort of check to see if the file is compressed then decompresses it if appropriate.</p>\n<p>What can potentially be done to decompress the current data file, or if its not compressed to convert it to plain text.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n<p>Edit 1:\nHere are links to the original data files:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ThunlNtdfwK_hiFpG6ioTkrTpd62E5KR/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">compressed</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mVU-gtYXglSCs6kX-fYWa5yu-neO-Nlo/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">uncompressed older version</a></p>\n<p>Thanks Gordon Freeman.</p>\n</div>",
