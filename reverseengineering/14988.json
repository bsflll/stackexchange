    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am researching some malware which loads multiple Sqlite Databases into memory during its operation. I've managed to dump the memory to disk in a large block however I cannot view the databases currently as I can't figure out how large the file should be.</p>\n<p>The headers appear intact however I can't easily figure out where the \"end\" of the database is. Can someone help me figure out what the byte size of the entire DB should be form this header? Or can someone suggest some software that is not picky on the format of the DB, eg if I include garbage at the end of the file it will automatically figure out where to stop.</p>\n<p>Format explained here:\n<a href=\"https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html</a></p>\n<pre><code>Header = SQLite format 3\n00 00 53 51 4c 69 74 65 20 66 6f 72 6d 61 74 20 33 00 \n\nPage size = 1024\n04 00 \n\nFormat write version\n01\n\nFormat read version\n01 \n\nBytes unreserved space\n00 \n\nMaximum embedded payload fraction (must be 64)\n40 \n\nMaximum embedded payload fraction (must be 32)\n20 \nLeaf payload fraction (must be 32)\n20 \n\nFile Change counter\n00 00 01 5f\n\nSize of the database file in pages (16)\n00 00 00 10 \n\nPage number of the first freelist trunk page\n00 00 00 09 \n\nTotal number of freelist pages.\n00 00 00 01 \n\nThe schema cookie\n00 00 00 03 \n\nThe schema format number.

Here is an example of one of the tables.</p>\n<p>Format of Dumped DB.

Why is this different?</p>\n<p>Starts at offset 784 (lots of padding before)</p>\n<pre><code>tablesqlite_sequencesqlite_sequence\nCREATE TABLE sqlite_sequence(name,seq)\nutableCommTypeCommType\nCREATE TABLE `CommType` (\n    `CommID` INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n    `CommName` TEXT NOT NULL\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>edit2: It appears I've dumped RAM that was used by the in memory database creation. I have lots and lots of the same CREATE TABLE strings in a sequence repeating with small changes. Most likely due to the code doing \"sql = sql + moreSql\" or something like that and I've just dumped these strings opposed to an entire in memory database. I need to do a bigger memory dump to find the actual DB</p>\n</div>",

I might try recreating the entire header manually and then appending the pages and see if it will open. If that fails I'll get the C# sqlite source code and step through it to see what specifically it disagrees with.</span>",
