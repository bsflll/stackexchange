The <code>method_4</code> has a type of <code>data_struct *(__thiscall *method_4)(void *not_sure, data_struct *data_struct, int a3)</code>. It looks like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n7zDr.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n7zDr.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Is there a way to actually click on <code>method_4</code> here and go to the pointer in the vftable/the underlaying <code>sub_&lt;something&gt;</code>? I seem to be stuck just having to go back to the vftable manually when I want to see what that function does.</p>\n<p>It feels like I need to somehow link the instance of <code>some_object</code> or rather its <code>_vftable</code> to the actual vftable memory location but not sure if that's a thing? Do I want too much? :)</p>\n</div>",
