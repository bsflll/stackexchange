    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to dump a few pieces of info that happen at the very beginning of the start up of a third party app and not after the app is running. I have debugged on other platforms and there is usually a way to load the app and then halt before start up in order to link into it for debugging. Is there a similar mechanism with Android debugging? Using ddms, I can connect and set break points once the app is running.</p>\n</div>",
