    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm wondering if anyone can assist me. I'm reverse engineering netgear r6250 firmware just for practice. I've managed to unpack the firmware using binwalk and in the root directory exist the www directory. Looking at the html code I notice the forms references cgi files. However checking through the entire file system I can't seem to find any cgi files. I've read this blog article that mention that in some netgear router and I quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>apply.cgi is not really a script, but a function that is invoked in the HTTP server </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I believe the cgi files might be embedded in the http binary which is located in /usr/sbin in my unpacked firmware version. I don't know if this indeed so. </p>\n<p>Can someone point me in the right direction so to know where I can find the cgi files or if they are indeed embedded in the httpd binary? Your assistance will without a doubt be appreciated.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>\n<p>The below show the screenshot using the find command to search for cgi files and server settings file from the root directory with no results:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/onvzJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"screenshot of searched cgi files and server setting files\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/onvzJ.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>This below image shows the listing of files in the etc directory:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fMozw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fMozw.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>If you notice there are two symbolic links that are both dangling due to missing linked file. So this leads me to believe that the cgi files (and possibly other files) are created in memory upon boot. What makes it worse is using firmadyne to emulate the firmware doesn't work as I don't get a NIC device up and running with an IP, and I've already emulate another netgear firmware (albeit an old one) using firmadyne. In all defense to the creators of firmadyne they mention that if this occurs its a bug and to report it, which I haven't done as yet. Bottom line is I can't emulate the firmware to prove (or disprove) that maybe the files are created during run-time. Anyway I will keep on researching for now.</p>\n</div>",

I'm using radare2 to disassemble and I'm fairly new to it and new to ARM assembly (more familiar with x86) so will try again. It seems the binary has been stripped of its symbols but I believe you're telling to look for a \".cgi\" string so will check and update you. Thanks</span>",

It's not an Apache, though. Looks more like homebrew. And guess what, a whole bunch of the <code>.cgi</code> names mentioned also in the HTML files inside <code>/www</code>.

For example only a single <code>.cgi</code> file existed in the whole rootfs.</p>\n<pre><code>$ find -name '*.cgi'\n./www/cgi-bin/genie.cgi\n</code></pre>\n<p>With <code>grep -R \\.cgi www</code> I was able to find a whole bunch of references to different \"files\" named <code>.cgi</code> used inside forms of the router's web interface.</p>\n<p>I then attempted to filter down the list a little further (inside <code>fmk/rootfs/www</code>):</p>\n<pre><code>grep -RPho '[^\"]+\\.cgi'|sort -u\n</code></pre>\n<p>There were some outliers in the resulting list, but the outcome was useful nevertheless.</p>\n<p>Armed with that knowledge I turned back to the rootfs in order to look for the web server. I could have used <code>find -name httpd</code>, as it turns out, but in reality I was looking through <code>/bin</code>, <code>/usr/bin</code> and <code>/usr/sbin</code> in that order and found a binary named <code>httpd</code> in the last one.</p>\n<p>Using <code>strings httpd</code> from inside <code>fmk/rootfs/usr/sbin</code> gave me further clues and definitely proved that this was no Nginx or Apache. With <code>strings httpd|grep \\.cgi</code> I was also able to verify that the quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>apply.cgi</code> is not really a script, but a function that is invoked in the HTTP server</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>appears to hold true.</p>\n<p>Using <code>readelf -d httpd</code> I figured out the dependencies (excerpt):</p>\n<pre><code>$ readelf -d httpd\n\nDynamic section at offset 0xae00c contains 31 entries:\n  Tag        Type                         Name/Value\n 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libnat.so]\n 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libnvram.so]\n 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libacos_shared.so]\n 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libcrypt.so.0]\n 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libgcc_s.so.1]\n 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libssl.so.1.0.0]\n 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libcrypto.so.1.0.0]\n 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libc.so.0]\n</code></pre>\n<p>to know which libraries to look at, should the need come up.</p>\n<p>Last but not least I loaded the ELF file <code>httpd</code> into IDA Pro 7.1, turned to the <strong>Strings</strong> subview using <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd> and started looking for the <code>.cgi</code> names. The <code>apply.cgi</code> you mentioned does not exist (verified by using <code>strings</code> on <code>httpd</code> and <code>grep -R apply\\.cgi fmk/rootfs/www</code>). So I needed to pick another CGI as an example.</p>\n<p>I went for <code>userlogin.cgi</code>, which was one of the first names to come up when searching for text <code>.cgi</code> from top down using <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> in <strong>IDA View-A</strong>.</p>\n<p>Listing the cross-references (<kbd>x</kbd>) to the string containing <code>userlogin.cgi</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>.rodata:000823DC aUserloginCgi   DCB \"userlogin.cgi\",0\n</code></pre>\n<p>turned up several references to <code>sub_F110</code> (<code>.text:0000F110</code>..<code>.text:0001289C</code>), which - when following these cross-references - turned out to be one central \"mega-function\" for parsing HTTP requests and handling the requests to any number of hardcoded <code>.cgi</code> and <code>.htm</code> \"file names\". (NB: make sure to look for references to strings containing <code>cgi-bin</code> as well.)</p>\n<p>So your suspicion, based on that quote, was true and with the sole exception of the <code>genie.cgi</code> found on the file system, all other <code>.cgi</code> \"files\" are handled directly by the massive 1.3 MiB <code>httpd</code> binary.</p>\n<p>The binary contains strings aplenty and apparently even some assertion strings among them.</p>\n</div>",
