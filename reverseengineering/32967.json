But because capitalism and self interests, it's locked behind a system app named \"DiagProtector\" (com.diagprotector). Now, what does it do? Yes! It protects the diagnostic port! If the 20 digit \"USB unlock key\" (I'm guessing it's the network unlock key) is correct, it allows you to enable/disable the serial and diagnostic ports. (It also misspells \"disabled\".)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pBbGgCEf.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt='Lol, \"disbaled\"' src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pBbGgCEf.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I want to cover more of my bases when it comes to figuring this phone out, so I want to reverse engineer that system app!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the program's code is outside the APK and inside an ODEX file. Fortunately, something like \"baksmali\" can convert it to a DEX file! Unfortunately, <em>HISTORY.</em></p>\n<p>The Android historians among you may recall that Android Lollipop was the first version to use the ART vm by default. Many others may recall that first releases of software tend to involve weird compatibility issues.</p>\n<p>It seems like the nonexistent gods have forsaken me, because <em>I CAN'T GET THIS THING TO CONVERT!</em> At all.</p>\n<p>Modern smali only touches Android 6.0 and above, this website (<a href=\"https://www.naldotech.com/how-to-deodex-applications-on-android-5-0-lollipop/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.naldotech.com/how-to-deodex-applications-on-android-5-0-lollipop/</a>) has DEAD LINKS, and just... AWFUL.</p>\n<p>So if anyone knows how to decompile odex'ed android 5 programs, please help me.</p>\n</div>",
