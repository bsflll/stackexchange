Most Armadillo unpackers available at <a href=\"https://www.exetools.com/unpackers.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.exetools.com/unpackers.htm</a> do not work with my executable because they only support an older version of Armadillo.</p>\n</div>",

What are you trying to achieve with the unpacked file?</p>\n<p>More often than not, you don't need it fully unpacked, so that it looks similar, if not the same, as the original file.</p>\n<p>In any case, with any packers, I suggest you just load up <strong>x64dbg</strong> with anti-anti-debugging plugins. Try a few configurations here and there - the standard hooks etc. should work.</p>\n<p>If you are looking at static analysis, you will want to use tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/NtQuery/Scylla\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Scylla</a> to dump the program at runtime and reconstruct the IAT (Import Address Table), which will give you information for calls to windows API / dlls.</p>\n<p>If the unpacker scripts don't work, perhaps there are tutorials online on how you can unpack it by hand - fully or partially? Even if the tutorial is an old one, it can usually still be a good reference. The packer's protection techniques do not really change at the core most of the time.</p>\n</div>",
