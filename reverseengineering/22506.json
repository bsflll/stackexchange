    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>When a breakpoint callback is triggered trying to automate the debugger inside the callback causes the application to become unresponsive. <code>x64dbg</code> continues functioning but the application itself doesn't resume execution.</p>\n<p>This is only happening when the functions are called inside the BP callback.</p>\n<p>Script:</p>\n<pre><code>from x64dbgpy import *\n\ndef handle():\n    pluginsdk.Run()\n\n\nBreakpoint.add(0x81755, handle)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Calling any function such as <code>pluginsdk.StepOver</code>, etc also causes the freeze.</p>\n<p>Does x64dbgpy not support automating the debugger inside breakpoint callbacks? Or am I doing something wrong? Suggestions would be great.</p>\n</div>",

This is related to the threading model and is further explained at <a href=\"https://x64dbg.com/blog/2016/10/20/threading-model.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://x64dbg.com/blog/2016/10/20/threading-model.html</a>, which links to some older resources.</p>\n<p>Recently there was an interesting development though, because it became possible to automate in the debug callbacks with x64dbgâ€™s built in scripting language (which I do not recommend). The idea now is to port this idea to a C api, which can then be used by plugins like x64dbgpy or x64dbgPlaytime.</p>\n</div>",
