Here command may contain multi‐\n   ple statements separated by newlines.  Leading whitespace  is  signifi‐\n   cant  in  Python statements!  In non-interactive mode, the entire input\n   is parsed before it is executed.\n</code></pre>\n<p>For example I've tried python3 -c \"import string \\n print(string.ascii_letters)\"\nbut it didn't work. So what is it new line?</p>\n</div>",
