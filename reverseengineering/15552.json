    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>The title seems little crazy, but I think that it is possible. Just think about it. If you create text file like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Hello world!\n</code></pre>\n<p>You get this checksum:</p>\n<pre><code>0ba904eae8773b70c75333db4de2f3ac45a8ad4ddba1b242f0b3cfc199391dd8\n</code></pre>\n<p>But if you change any letter like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Hallo world!\n</code></pre>\n<p>You get this:</p>\n<pre><code>bf1adae4567d9fb6b3bfb30cbf4dfdd2503e89a831cf3472c399b39fb9c73289\n</code></pre>\n<p>That means, that if I change any letter I always get another checksum, so there must be any way to get source file back.</p>\n<p>My question is: Is there any way to get source file back without creating all possible combinations and checking checksum?</p>\n</div>",

Thus, there can be multiple files that produce the same hash <em>and the same checksum</em>.  The only way to know that you have recovered the original file is to compare it with the original file.</p>\n</div>",
