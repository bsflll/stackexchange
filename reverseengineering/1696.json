I saw mainly three type of techniques in the wild which are: <em>metamorphic malware</em>, <em>oligomorphic malware</em> and <em>polymorphic malware</em> (I might have missed one). What are the main differences between theses techniques and what do they do ?</p>\n</div>",

We (anti-virus industry) define them this way: oligomorphic - decryptor with few variable elements, which does not affect the size or shape of the code.  It means that the variable elements are usually fixed-size instructions, but it can also apply to the register initialization.</p>\n<h1>Oligomorphic example</h1>\n<pre><code>std ;fake, might be replaced by cld / nop / xchg ax, cx / ...\nmov cx, size\nmov ax, ax ;fake, might be replaced by mov bx, bx / or cx, cx / ...\nmov si, decrypt_src\ncld ;fake\nmov di, decrypt_dst\nor ax, ax ;fake\nmov bl, key\nand bp, bp ;fake\ndecrypt:\nxor [di], bl\nxchg dx, ax ;fake\ninc di\ncld ;fake\nloop decrypt\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, the <code>di</code> register could be exchanged with <code>si</code>, for example.  Very simple replacement.</p>\n<h1>Polymorphic</h1>\n<p>decryptor with potentially highly variable elements, which does affect the size and/or shape of the code.  It means that all kinds of changes can be applied, including subroutine creation, large blocks of garbage instructions, code \"islands\", or even algorithmic register initialisation (example <a href=\"http://pferrie.host22.com/papers/bounds.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n<h1>Metamorphic</h1>\n<p>highly variable elements are applied directly to the body.  There is generally no decryptor in this case.  The same techniques for polymorphism are applied to the code itself.  The most famous example of this is the Simile virus from 2002 (details <a href=\"http://pferrie.host22.com/papers/simile.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).  There's a detailed paper on the subject with actual examples <a href=\"http://pferrie.host22.com/papers/metamorp.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n</div>",
