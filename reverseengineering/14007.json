Right now, I am trying to understand the instructions I see in OllyDbg, but it seems to follow a different syntax than the NASM syntax I am used to.</p>\n<p>This OllyDbg instruction for example doesn't seem intuitive to me, especially the <code>PTR SS:</code> part.</p>\n<pre><code>MOV DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+8],EBX\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am not looking for an explanation of this particular construct, but rather a documentation for the whole syntax. How can I find that?</p>\n</div>",

The <a href=\"http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Intel developer manuals</a> can give you more detail about what specific instructions do and what segments mean (in your case the memory location <code>[ESP+8]</code> uses the SS segment).</p>\n<p>On Windows <strong>user mode</strong> it is safe to ignore all segments (<code>SS:[ESP+8]</code> means exactly the same as <code>DS:[ESP+8]</code>), only the FS (32 bit) and GS (64 bit) segments have a meaning.
