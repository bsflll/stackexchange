    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>ive started studying reverse engineering, and in a binary i am trying to reverse i stumbled upon an unusual(to me) line of assembly in IDA PRO. and it looks like this</p>\n<pre><code>.text:00000000008A1C21                 mov     r8d, ds:(off_8A40FC - 400000h)[rcx+rax*4]\n</code></pre>\n<p>so i know that it moves something into the r8 register which is the size of a dword, but i do not understand what it moves into it ? something from the data segment, but im clueless as of how to interpret it, any help would be great.</p>\n</div>",

I recommend studying the assembly more, this is a bad question as its not giving full detail on what <code>rcx</code>, and <code>rax</code> is.</p>\n<p>Happy hacking! :-)</p>\n</div>",
