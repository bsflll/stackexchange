The binary is not stripped, and the debug symbols are clearly in place, so I have some hope that this is possible.</p>\n<p>Is there some tool that I can use to remove these symbols and replace them with a dynamic reference to an SDL .so file?</p>\n<p>I know that there is no guarantee of success (for instance some functions may have been inlined), but is there a reasonable way to try?</p>\n<p><em>bonus question:</em> Why are the symbols duplicated with <code>_REAL</code> and <code>_DEFUALT</code> suffixes? I thought those were for versioning with .so files. What would they be doing when statically linked?</p>\n</div>",

What I would do myself is the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create your own library in C or C++ that does <code>dlopen(\"your_new_sdl_lib.so\")</code>.</li>\n<li>Inject the library into your binary or patch it so it loads this library at startup.</li>\n<li>Hook every single <code>SDL_XXX()</code> call and forward the call to your new SDL library (or, alternatively, patch every <code>SDL_XXX()</code> function so that they call into your new library).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While I am sure you can get it to work, consider it's not guaranteed it will without a hard to measure amount of work. Not only because some functions might be in-lined, but because you might also have the problem of global variables being used outside of the <code>SDL_XXX()</code> functions.</p>\n<p>In the case of some functions being in-lined, you would need to patch these calls to forward to your new functions (finding which registers or memory positions contain whatever is required for the appropriate call), or cross your fingers and hope the function versions are still compatible (my experience says that in so many cases they are).</p>\n<p>Hope it helps.</p>\n</div>",
