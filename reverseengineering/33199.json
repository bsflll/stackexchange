    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>There are two or even more Android applications that somehow interact with each other:</p>\n<p>Application A invokes application B or sends request to it directly or via third application C. I don't have the source code for any of these applications.\nAre there any tools that I can use to perform dynamic analysis of this interaction. Preferably on Windows. I'd like to understand how these application interact.</p>\n<p>I'm thinking about the following scenario.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Connect a physical Android device to a PC</li>\n<li>Initiate the function which involves interaction between the applications</li>\n<li>Use some tool which can show which application/view is currently active on the device</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How is this done? How do I find out which part of application A initiates this interaction. And which part of application B is responsible for serving the request from the application A.</p>\n</div>",

This file contains the logging code that is executed when the method is executed. If the intent argument is not correctly printed you can modify the .js file(s) and change the logging code for e.g. printing sub-elements that are not covered by the standard .toString() implementation. Even modifications are possible.</p>\n</div>",
