It might not have all the sequencing information you're looking for but I used it as a basis to do something similar a while ago. </p>\n<p>If you don't want to do it dynamically with IDA's debugger, you can similarly use an IDA Python script to parse the callgraph of a binary. I think Grey Hat Python has a section on IDA Python if you don't want to/can't find open source resources (though I believe there are other plugins that do something like this).</p>\n</div>",
