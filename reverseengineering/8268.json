Obviously it's packed. I was told by PeID that there is only UPX inside. Ok, but <code>upx -d</code> simple crashed that's why I've concluded that this UPX may be scrambled somehow.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"IDA warning\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XEm04.png\"/></p>\n<p>Binary didn't run properly in debugger(windbg) for unpacking it so I've dumped exe from working process and tried to fix imports. Maybe I should have tried Olly with plugins? However IDA still warns me that some imports might be destroyed(see picture). My question is: did I unpacked it correctly? If no what else should I do to unpack it?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mega.co.nz/#!OU4X1a4Y!00wN9c72-4nRtNgF5t7ZdGLxDzjYE9G6CNakblHBUOs\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Unpacked</a></p>\n</div>",
