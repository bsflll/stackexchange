I am using IDA Free 8.2 on Windows 11 x64.</p>\n<p>On the graph view it is only showing the main function, which is different to the screenshot in the tutorial. Also, I get the below errors about signature files:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Could not find signature file 'vc32_14'</p>\n<p>Could not find signature file 'vc32ucrt'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unless I am mistaken, I think it is because I need to use an older version of IDA which includes those signature files, or I need to find the signature files and put them into <code>C:\\Program Files\\IDA Freeware 8.2\\sig\\pc</code> where they are currently missing.</p>\n<p>A) Where can I download IDA Free version 7.2 because the Hex-Rays website is only showing the newer version 8.2</p>\n<p>B) Additionally, is there a place where I could download missing signature files</p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WGWAY.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"First signature error\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WGWAY.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aHQRa.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Second signature error\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aHQRa.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Q2MfW.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Loaded\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Q2MfW.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

The default file layout of IDA looks different, you can try to enter the \"block flow mode\" (or what ever it is called) by pressing space. The error message may simply indicator that IDA Free does not contain FLIRT signature files.</span>",

My first priority is to resolve the signature errors, it appears older versions of IDA include those missing signatures but I cannot find a download anywhere. Next, is why it took me to a single block, whereas the tutorial shows several blocks joined together.</span>",

If you want older versions you have to download them when they are available and keep them. So the only way to get an older version of IDA Free is to check non-official servers and search for older versions.</span>",

You simply have selected a different function that does not make use of conditional branch ops (<code>if ...</code> in C code) . Select different functions of the executable and try to find the one that has a similar graphical layout.</span>",

You simply have to select the correct function. Most likely the function you search is at address <code>0x00401159</code>. Press <code>g</code> and then enter <code>401159</code> to go to this function.</span>",
