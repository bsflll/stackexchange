Even if I disable this through right click, it gets reseted every debug session. I also tried to save the desktop with the synchronization disabled, but it gets enabled again after session restart...</p>\n<p>How can I stop IDA from synchronizing these views?</p>\n<p>I have no plugins that could cause this behavior.</p>\n</div>",
