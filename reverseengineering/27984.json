    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to understand the usage of calls to CC_MD5 in an iOS application.</p>\n<p>From Apple's <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man3/CC_MD5.3cc.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">man page</a> I can see that when it is called it requires 3 arguments:</p>\n<pre><code>extern unsigned char *\nCC_MD5(const void *data, CC_LONG len, unsigned char *md);\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>*md</code> is a pointer to where the result will be stored and is also what will be returned.</p>\n<p>When <code>CC_MD5</code> is called I would like to be able to log the input data and the resulting hash and have tried using the following script with Frida, including different ways of printing the data at the return pointer:</p>\n<pre><code>Interceptor.attach(Module.findExportByName(\"/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib\", \"CC_MD5\"), {\n  onEnter: function(args) {\n    console.log(\"[+] CC_MD5 called with *data: \" + Memory.readCString(args[0], parseInt(args[1], 16)));\n    console.log(\"[+]                    *len:  \" + parseInt(args[1], 16));\n    console.log(\"[+]                    *md:   \" + args[2]);\n  },\n  onLeave: function(retval) {\n    console.log(\"[+] Resulting hash: \" + Memory.readCString(ptr(retval),16));\n    console.log(\"[+] Resulting hash: \" + retval.readByteArray(16));\n    console.log(\"[+] Resulting hash: \" + retval.readCString(16));\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>I understand that it will not always be printable text that is passed to the function as the input data however am having problems actually reading the resulting hash.  Below is an example of the output I am getting:</p>\n<pre><code>[+] CC_MD5 called with *data: MGCopyAnswerProductVersion\n[+]                    *len:  26\n[+]                    *md:   0x16f6d61f0\n[+] Returning *md: 0x16f6d61f0\n[+] Resulting hash: ��]vU\n�)��\n[+] Resulting hash: [object ArrayBuffer]\n[+] Resulting hash: ��]vU\n�)��\n</code></pre>\n<p>I don't know if I have misunderstood how <code>CC_MD5</code> is called or what I should be able to do with Frida?</p>\n</div>",

An example script for dumping raw memory data is embedded in this python script: <a href=\"https://github.com/poxyran/misc/blob/master/frida-read-process-memory.py\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">github.com/poxyran/misc/blob/master/…</a></span>",

Do you know if it is possible to format the output not to include the offset and ascii representation? I came across your comment <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/17835/print-b-byte-array-in-frida-js-script#comment38928_17841\">here</a> which I thought would help but the outpout is comepletely blank trying that.</span>",
