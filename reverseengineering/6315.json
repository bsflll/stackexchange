You can probably guess some things, e.g. the block size from the size of the encrypted data, but to know for sure you need access to the <strong>code which processes the file</strong> (e.g. the firmware dumped from the device or the firmware updater if it does the decryption). Without access to that this question can't really be answered.</p>\n</div>",
