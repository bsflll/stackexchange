    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to understand why if I do fetch() 4 times on the active web page, after the fifth fetch server returns response that I am a \"robot\"\nI am using google chrome\nI go the following link: <a href=\"https://ticketswestinw.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetEventInfo?ticketCode=GS%3ATWC%3AEARN20%3AEARN0807%3A&amp;linkID=twcorp&amp;shopperContext=&amp;pc=&amp;caller=&amp;appCode=&amp;groupCode=ARNBSB&amp;cgc=&amp;dataAccId=883&amp;locale=en_US&amp;siteId=ev_twcorp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tickets selling site</a> (might not open in non US countries). From the 'network' tab I 'copy as fetch' that very first request and paste it to the console and execute it</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3WwJ0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"copy the first page request from the network\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3WwJ0.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/K2t6Z.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/K2t6Z.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>after doing so 5 times, I start receiving \"robots\" response</p>\n<p>This is a good response:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rcj7x.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rcj7x.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>this is a \"robot\" response:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Edtca.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Edtca.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>And after that all requests made by the site itself return the same \"robots\" response everytime. But refreshing the page/opening new page, resets everything and I can send those requests again.</p>\n<p>My question is: how can I understand what happens when I open browser page? What happens that the server starts returning good responses again after I refresh the page?</p>\n<p>I was trying to drop cookies, but this didnt help.</p>\n<p>The code I use to send request:</p>\n<pre><code>fetch(\"https://ticketswestinw.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetEventInfo?ticketCode=GS%3ATWC%3AEARN20%3AEARN0807%3A&amp;linkID=twcorp&amp;shopperContext=&amp;pc=&amp;caller=&amp;appCode=&amp;groupCode=ARNBSB&amp;cgc=&amp;dataAccId=883&amp;locale=en_US&amp;siteId=ev_twcorp\", {\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"accept\": \"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9\",\n    \"accept-language\": \"en-US,en;q=0.9\",\n    \"cache-control\": \"max-age=0\",\n    \"sec-fetch-dest\": \"document\",\n    \"sec-fetch-mode\": \"navigate\",\n    \"sec-fetch-site\": \"same-origin\",\n    \"sec-fetch-user\": \"?1\",\n    \"upgrade-insecure-requests\": \"1\"\n  },\n  \"referrer\": \"https://ticketswestinw.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetEventInfo?ticketCode=GS%3ATWC%3AEARN20%3AEARN0807%3A&amp;linkID=twcorp&amp;shopperContext=&amp;pc=&amp;caller=&amp;appCode=&amp;groupCode=ARNBSB&amp;cgc=&amp;dataAccId=883&amp;locale=en_US&amp;siteId=ev_twcorp\",\n  \"referrerPolicy\": \"no-referrer-when-downgrade\",\n  \"body\": null,\n  \"method\": \"GET\",\n  \"mode\": \"cors\",\n  \"credentials\": \"include\"\n}).then(x =&gt; x.text().then(y =&gt; console.log(y)));\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
