    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to work out how to reverse engineer the checksum on infrared remote data stream for a heat pump.  I've established that it's not a CRC, and I've tried methods found on this forum.  It doesn't appear in other works like <a href=\"https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this one</a>.</p>\n<p>I'm tearing my hair out because it appears to be XOR, and it works some of the time. I'm reaching out to see if anyone here can give me some pointers.</p>\n<pre><code>0xCB8830C000191B\n0xCB8830200019FB\n0xCB8830A000197B\n0xCB8830600019BB\n0xCB8830E000193B\n0xCB8830100019C3\n0xCB883090001943\n</code></pre>\n<p>For info, the data changing is the selected temperature. The 4th byte, <code>0xC0</code> in the top item is 19 <sup>o</sup>C, the one below – <code>0x20</code> – is 20 <sup>o</sup>C. If you reverse all the bytes, the temperature makes more sense and needs 16 decimal adding.</p>\n<p>The checksum is the last byte. Working on <code>0xCB8830C000191B</code> and taking <code>0xCB</code> as the 1st byte, XOR bytes D1, D3, D4, D5, D6 = <code>0x22</code>. XOR this with <code>0x39</code> and you get the desired checksum of <code>0x1B</code>. This works for all the ones ending in <code>B</code>, but is off by 8 for the last 2. I can't find any data such as counting bits that gives me this difference.</p>\n<p>Anyone with some ideas please?</p>\n<p>To help other people trying to do the same, the stream comes from a Airton heat pump, which is only sold in France. It's also sold under Ferroli and Lamborghini (really!)</p>\n</div>",

Location of Temp in the stream is different, but calculation by <code>16 + 0x0</code> to <code>16+0xF</code> is the same.\nI think, your wording \"The 4th byte, 0xC0 in the top item is 19C, the one below 0x20 is 20C.\" is not correct here.</p>\n<p>However the following works for the small number of provided codes, above 4 bits are used for Temp and data are presented in 14 nibbles, thereof 12 data\nI assume that last byte is 1 nibble checksum and 1 nibble parity, then</p>\n<ul>\n<li>when last bit for Temp is even (2, 6, A, C, E), the nibble(13) at the end is <code>B</code>. When odd (1, 3) then <code>3</code>, just like a parity information.</li>\n<li>xor all nibbles (0) to (11), then xor(13) gives checksum nibble(12)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nevertheless it needs to be noted that considering just parity might be not good enough, when other bits in code are changing.</p>\n</div>",
