The format has no recognizable File Magic Number - and the file itself is filled with odd repetitive sequences of text like:</p>\n<pre><code>Enter/Down/Down/Enter/Down/Down/Down/Enter/Down/Down/Down/readme.txtAnd the path, to you, remains clear.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Any suggestions for avenues of research? </p>\n</div>",

On connection, the server transmitted the file contents. No shell, just that data response. The connection is closed at EOF with this <code>...?Enter/Right/P?p9LPi?Wh Enter/Right/readme.txtPK00+? End Transmission</code> My initial guesses are that either the flag is encoded in the file, or the file contains instructions on where to get the flag.</span>",

The presence of repeated <code>PK</code> sequences was the clue that this was actually a ZIP file. Ran <code>unzip</code> on the file - which turned out to be a somewhat corrupt ZIP. The file expanded to a huge stack of nested directories named Up, Right, Etc - and in one of those directories was the flag. Thanks again Paweł for the key clue!   </p>\n</div>",

But that leads to two questions - first, there are also many references to <code>/Right/</code> - which doesn't seem to make sense if it refers to a path. Secondly, there's no address that leads to a shell or directory structure (see above) - all we're given is that data. I do suspect there might be a location to connect to hidden in the file, but am not sure on how to follow up on that...</span>",

This file is the description to the flag path, the entrypoint is the server <strong><em>(which you can connect with netcat/telnet ...)</em></strong>. You have to use hints from that file to find out how to access to flag <em>(maybe readme.txt)</em>. In some cases, it just check all the characters you input as keys to open the box <em>(In the past, my challenge is all binary data with \"Open the box\" at last - I piped all the data to the netcat server and the flag was printed)</em>. Good luck!</p>\n</div>",
