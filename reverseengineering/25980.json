    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I was trying to extract data from an Android app which uses SQLcipher. SQLcipher is an extension of SQLite that encrypts database files with 256-bit AES.</p>\n<p>Within the APK, the library lies in <code>lib/libsqlcipher.so</code>. I'm curious if I can extract the encryption key simply by modifying <code>libsqlcipher.so</code>(e.g. modify <code>sqlite3_key</code> function so that it logs the encryption key to file). The plan is to compile my own version of <code>libsqlcipher.so</code>, repack APK, install it, and run it on a device.</p>\n<p>Will this method work as expected? It sounds too easy to be true:)</p>\n</div>",
