Process Monitor operations do not necessarily map directly to Native symbols, however, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2c0w1f/registrywhat_does_regsetinfokey_do/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">it seems</a> that this operation uses <a href=\"https://undocumented.ntinternals.net/index.html?page=UserMode%2FUndocumented%20Functions%2FNT%20Objects%2FKey%2FNtSetInformationKey.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">NtSetInformationKey</a>. When we examine that function though, we see that it has a parameter: <code>IN KEY_SET_INFORMATION_CLASS InformationClass</code>. Finally, undocumented.ntinternals.net states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Currently only KEY_WRITE_TIME_INFORMATION is supported.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When we look up <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff554226(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">KEY_WRITE_TIME_INFORMATION</a>, the definition is just a simple data structure which stores the last write time to the registry key. So the question then becomes, when ProcMon displays a last write time, but no RegSetKey or other write occurs, what is the purpose for setting this value and is a simple write to this member what is actually occurring?</p>\n</div>",
