    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Are there anyways I can learn what packageInfo.signatures[0] is so I can use it to apply the same algorithm in Python.</p>\n<p>To further explain:</p>\n<pre><code>    private static SecretKeySpec a(Context context) {\n        try {\n            PackageInfo packageInfo = context.getPackageManager().getPackageInfo(context.getPackageName(), 64);\n            if (!(packageInfo == null || packageInfo.signatures == null || packageInfo.signatures.length &lt;= 0)) {\n                return new SecretKeySpec(Arrays.copyOf(packageInfo.signatures[0].toByteArray(), 16), \"AES\");\n            }\n        } catch (NameNotFoundException e2) {\n            ThrowableExtension.a(e2);\n        }\n        return null;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This android app is sending some sort of a key that is changing based on timestamp with every request it is sending. And it is using the above code for creating a SecretKeySpec which then gets used in below.</p>\n<pre><code>    @NonNull\n    private synchronized String d(String str) {\n        byte[] digest;\n        try {\n            byte[] bytes = str.getBytes(\"UTF-8\");\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     this.r.init(2, this.l);\n            byte[] doFinal = this.r.doFinal(this.k);\n            byte[] a2 = Bytes.a(doFinal, this.j, bytes, doFinal, this.n.a().getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));\n            digest = this.q.digest(a2);\n            Arrays.fill(a2, 0);\n            Arrays.fill(doFinal, 0);\n        } catch (Exception e2) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(e2);\n        }\n        return jl.a(digest);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, I know that the function argument <code>str</code> is for some reason <code>currentTimeMillis * 1151</code> which gets used in <code>byte[] a2 = ...</code> line then gets hashed with sha1 there comes the time based changing part. What I can't find is what signatures[0] is in this context and how can I achieve it, in the construction of the class, <code>this.l</code> is assigned with SecretKeySpec ( signature[0] ). <code>this.r</code> is an AES Cipher. From the readings I made, I think the \"2\" in <code>init(2, this.l)</code> means decode mode.</p>\n<p>And Can you please explain to me what is the effect of filling <code>a2</code> and <code>doFinal</code> variables with <code>0(zeroes)</code> in this context as it doesn't get used anywhere else.</p>\n</div>",

Meaning, this is the first signature file that the Android system has read from the <code>META-INF/</code> folder inside the APK.</p>\n<p>Basically, what you'll need to do is unzip the APK, look inside the <code>META-INF/</code> and grab whatever file has the extension <code>.RSA</code> (unlikely, but it could be <code>.DSA</code>). This essentially what the <code>packageInfo.signatures[0]</code> is returning, with the <code>.toByteArray()</code> making a <code>ByteArray</code> object of the data.</p>\n<p>If you have any doubts, or are having issues further, I'd sugged using Frida to hook this function call and watch what is actually returned.</p>\n</div>",
