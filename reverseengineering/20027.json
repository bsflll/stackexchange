    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am using the Patch Program option of IDA Pro to edit the assembly of a binary at runtime.</p>\n<p>When I enter the following instruction:</p>\n<pre><code>mov rax, [rsp + 0x48]\n</code></pre>\n<p>I get an \"Invalid operand\" error from IDA Pro. I tried changing the above instruction to different variants as shown below:</p>\n<pre><code>mov rax, [rsp + 48h]\nmov rax, [rsp + 48]\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, it still gives me an error.</p>\n<p>This is a valid assembly instruction. I can edit the assembly in other softwares like x64_dbg and it works with the above disassembly.</p>\n</div>",
