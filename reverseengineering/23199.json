Now, as far as I have seen, they always contain relative offsets as address and don't contain absolute addresses of the destination.</p>\n<p>Now, can the relative offset between functions or instructions change if the binary is compiled again with the same compiler? How about with another compiler?</p>\n<p>Do you guys think using a call instruction as part of a signature is good?</p>\n</div>",

Because, you cannot tell if the instructions found by the disassembler are the ones that get really executed by the program. So, you might end up by making a signature based on some misconceptions issued from a broken analysis which may lead to an unpredictable behavior. Therefore, getting a signature on unaligned instruction sets might lead to an untrustable result.</span>",
