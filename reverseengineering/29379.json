It looks like what you call <code>function0</code>, <code>function1</code> and <code>functionX</code> are in fact parts of the same function, and just different basic blocks within the function.</p>\n<p>To your specific questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Nothing changes <code>r0</code>, <code>r1</code>, and <code>r2</code> between <code>0x20.b function1</code> and <code>0x28.cmp r0 #1</code>. So yes, they still hold the values from what you called <code>function0</code>. There is nothing in the code, or in assembly as general that implicitly zero out all registers.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>This is the place where the lr is fetched, and jumped to - it is supposed to hold the value of the caller function - The instruction after the call to what you called <code>function0</code>. the <code>lr</code> didn't change between what you called <code>function0</code>, <code>function1</code> and <code>functionX</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
