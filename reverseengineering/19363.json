The second one, <code>0x400c60</code> is what is located in that memory location. r2 is giving you hints about the actual result might be in the comments. It also informs you that 8 byte will be used for the operation with the <code>:8</code> suffix.</p>\n<p>So it looks like that at address <code>0x602090</code> there's a 8-byte value stored that constitutes as an address <code>0x400c60</code>.</p>\n</div>",
