I am sure he is calling a webhook, connecting to a bot or something that leave his token in it.</p>\n<p>I can see in IDA multiple calls to a folder named <code>.nexe/</code> which looks to me like the name of the compiler used: <a href=\"https://github.com/nexe/nexe\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">nexe</a>.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have tips to decompile a NodeJS application? I'm barely new in the reverse engineering, so if anybody could let me tips to decompile it...</p>\n<p>I don't know if nexe obfuscates the code, if there is better decompiler apps for NodeJS executable.</p>\n</div>",

Coincidentally, I also got my discord account hacked on November 3 (the same day you posted this question) by a wrapped NodeJS Windows executable. Just to be transparent, the malicious file that I ran was called HerosHour. I ran the <code>.exe</code> through a hex dump and saved just the human-readable ASCII text to a file. This does give you all of the JS code, but it also includes all of the NodeJS framework, as well as any dependencies. It's quite hard to read, but the source is definitely in there. Would you like to collaborate with me?</span>",

Ghidra seems promising, just don't know how to use it yet.</span>",
