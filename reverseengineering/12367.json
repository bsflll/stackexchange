I need to find out which operands are read to or written from (or both). According to the website, this is possible by doing operand.access, which holds CSACREAD | CSAWRITE flags.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.capstone-engine.org/op_access.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.capstone-engine.org/op_access.html</a></p>\n<p>However, if we look at the definition on github:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/blob/master/include/x86.h#L183\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/blob/master/include/x86.h#L183</a></p>\n<p>no operand[0].access exists!</p>\n<p>What's going on? Does this feature not exist yet? Was it removed?</p>\n</div>",
