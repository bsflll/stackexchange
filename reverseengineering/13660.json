After extending function end and correcting stack I've found that IDA doesnt refresh graph. The green nodes should be one continuous node. Is there any way to fix it?</p>\n</div>",

If function is flagged as \"noreturn\", IDA's analysis stops after calling it.</p>\n<p>So, in order to repair graph one should unflag \"noreturn\" (I once had a case, where I couldn't do it tho), undefine calling function, define it back.</p>\n</div>",
