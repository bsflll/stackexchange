    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Clarified, I meant the extended exent ringbugger stacktraces described by <a href=\"http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/jonathan/an-xevent-a-day-24-of-31-what-is-the-callstack/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jonathan Kehayias</a>.</p>\n<p>I recently discovered it was possible to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16320480/getting-link-exe-lib-exe-editbin-exe-and-dumpbin-exe-to-use-the-symbol-server\">get link.exe, dumpbin.exe, etc to download symbols from a symbol server</a>. SQL Server has the ability to capture its own call traces through extended events. <a href=\"http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/jonathan/an-xevent-a-day-24-of-31-what-is-the-callstack/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Traceflag 3656 lets you decode these stack traces with symbol files.</a>  As per <a href=\"http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/paul/how-to-download-a-sqlservr-pdb-symbol-file/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Paul Randal's blog</a>, you need to actually put the symbol files in the sql server binn folder, and it wouldn't use the symbol server. I decided to investigate to see how true this is. Using <a href=\"http://www.rohitab.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">RohitABs API Monitor</a>, I was able to see the following calls being made to DbgHelp.dll:</p>\n<pre><code>ImagehlpApiVersion (  )\nSymSetOptions ( SYMOPT_DEFERRED_LOADS | SYMOPT_LOAD_LINES | SYMOPT_UNDNAME )\nSymInitialize ( GetCurrentProcess(), \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\MSSQL11.MSSQLSERVER2012\\MSSQL\\Binn\\;C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\MSSQL11.MSSQLSERVER2012\\MSSQL\\BINN;symsrv*symsrv.dll*c:\\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols;C:\\Windows;C:\\Windows\\system32\", TRUE )\nSymRegisterCallback64 ( GetCurrentProcess(), 0x000007fec5a77810, 0 )\n    /* The following SymGetSymFromAddr() calls happen because fInvadeProcess  was set to true  */\nSymGetSymFromAddr ( GetCurrentProcess(), 3313710117, 0x000000001b06c060, 0x000000001b06b348 )\nSymGetSymFromAddr ( GetCurrentProcess(), 3313710116, 0x000000001b06c060, 0x000000001b06b348 )\n    . . . \n    . . . \n    . . . \nSymCleanup ( GetCurrentProcess() )\n</code></pre>\n<p>So it looks like my <code>_NT_SYMBOL_PATH</code>, with the symbol server is being added to the search path of <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms681351(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SymInitialize()</a>. If that is the case, why aren't symbols being downloaded from the symbol server?</p>\n</div>",
