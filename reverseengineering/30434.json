It can be used with Node.js, as\nwell as Electron and NW.js (check examples/ directory).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It obfuscates your Electron app. How do I go about decompiling it? x64dbg/Ollydbg won't recognize the file. Is it possible?</p>\n<p>There used to be a Ghidra plugin for this called <code>ghidra_nodejs</code> but it has been removed from Github (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220102202434/https://github.com/PositiveTechnologies/ghidra_nodejs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wayback machine link</a>).</p>\n</div>",
