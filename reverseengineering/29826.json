    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Suppose the decompiler came up with something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>if (Status &gt;= 0)\n{\n  // ... some other pseudo code\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is it possible to prettify this code with the <code>NT_SUCCESS()</code> macro, like this:</p>\n<pre><code>if (NT_SUCCESS(Status))\n{\n  // ... some other pseudo code\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>... which codifies the same condition as shown in the previous pseudo code? I haven't found a way as of yet. It's cosmetic, sure, but it still would be nice to be able to make this sort of adjustment.</p>\n<p>Version of IDA 7.7 with matching decompiler.</p>\n</div>",
