    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I was trying to emulate a firmware and as a part of the process I was interested in knowing what device files are being registered using mknod. In order to intercept those calls I had created a shared object file and just for a dry run, I was trying to preload this shared library while making a call to mknod to register a character device while doing user space emulation with QEMU like so.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>sudo strace chroot . ./qemu-mips-static -E LD_PRELOAD=\"/mknod.so\"\n  mknod chrdev4 100 0</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The files are in the correct place and I was following a tutorial very closely so I know am not making a syntactical as such, but my strace log showed my preloaded library not being accessed at all. Please note that in this case, my mknod is a symbolic link to the busybox binary which in turn executes the mknod syscall. I was wondering if that level of indirection could be an issue and possibly a reason as to why my library isn't getting preloaded? </p>\n</div>",

A complete command might look like this: <code>sudo strace chroot . ./qemu-mips-static -E LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"/\" -E LD_PRELOAD=\"mknod.so\" mknod chrdev4 100 0</code></span>",
