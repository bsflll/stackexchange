Possibly the data initialised is used later on, in <code>sub_180005AD0</code> for example, and since it doesn't contain what the program expects, it crashes. Try to debug the patched version: put a breakpoint at <code>1800060EA</code> and keep pressing <code>F8</code> (step over) until it crashes. You will find the procedure causing error.</span>",
