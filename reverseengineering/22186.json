    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am having some troubles with my learning of Assembly and reverse engineering. Specifically, I am learning about Global vs Local variables. For Global variables I have managed to get insights in assembly that they are stored in memory address. For Local variables I expect them to be stored on stack (theory), but my simple C code below, when being disassembled in Ghidra, does not show anything in main function.</p>\n<p>C CODE:</p>\n<pre><code>void main()\n{\n    int x = 1;\n    int y = 2;\n    x = x + y;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>GHIDRA OUTPUT:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DcGBz.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DcGBz.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Why can't I see anything in my Ghidra? It looks like an empty function to me, but clearly there should be some local variable declaration and then addition performed afterwards.</p>\n<p>I really apologize for opening threads here often, but this is the only source where I can get help for such things. On Reddit they do not allow posting questions and referred me here.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT - 25.09.2019:</strong></p>\n<p>As per suggestion I have added some code to my existing C Code to see if it will show up now in Assembly:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    int x = 1;\n    int y = 2;\n\n    x = x + y;\n\n    printf(\"Rezultat = %d\\n\", x);\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>For this I had to set entry point back to CRT initialize, otherwise I could not use stdio Library. This is now the result of main function in Ghidra:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uOCeM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uOCeM.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Now I am able to see the PUSH instruction and the value 0x03. This is probably the resulting value of addition 1 + 2, but I again can't nowhere see where are the local variables initialized nor where the arithmetic operation is performed.</p>\n</div>",
