    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to figure out how some minified and possible highly-obfuscated JavaScript works. There are thousands of lines spanning multiple JS files. I have had a lot of success debugging it in my Chromium browser using dev tools and local overrides where I can refactor code without losing it on the next page load.</p>\n<p>What's giving me problems are all the anonymous functions and types that look they were transpiled from TypeScript. They look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>var main = {\n    someFunction: function(a,b,c,d,e) {\n        //do a ton of stuff here\n    },\n    anotherFunction: function(d,e,f,g,h,i) {\n        //even more stuff\n    },\n    someProperty: { json object with more members }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If that were a class/object in .NET in the Visual Studio IDE, I would have all kinds of tools to help me figure out how such an object is built, all the places its members are referenced, etc. With a dynamic language like JavaScript, though, regular browser debuggers lack the information needed to give me that kind of insight into the code. Therefore, when I need to see where a property is initially set, there's no way to look for all the places it's referenced. You can use <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>, but, if there are multiple objects with the same property names, it's not a very effective approach.</p>\n<p>If I had the debugging power of an IDE such as Visual Studio, it would make reverse engineering this code so much easier. How can you make debugging JavaScript just as straight-forward?</p>\n</div>",
