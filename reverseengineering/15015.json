I am trying to debug an application from an embedded device. Everything seems to work fine except breakpoints on other threads. I am using IDAs remote gdb function to debug. Instead of breaking here <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YtC8p.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YtC8p.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>it gives me a SIGTRAP and goes to here <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qfLH2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qfLH2.png\"/></a>\nUsing hardware breakpoints also doesn't do the trick.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The problem doesn't seem to be IDA itself.\nI was using qemu-arm-static version 2.0.0. IDA seems to have the bug I mentioned above. Using commandline gdb-multiarch to try and debug it I get the following error after hitting the breakpoint:</p>\n<pre><code>Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.\n0xf67c523c in ??
