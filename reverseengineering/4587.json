    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have the following assembly line(I also added a C code implementation how I would do it in C):</p>\n<pre><code>     .................\nA:   MOVSX EAX, BYTE PTR DS:[ECX]     |   while(ecx != NULL){\n     ADD EDX, EAX                     |   \n     INC ECX                          |   char *eaxPtr = *ecx;\n     CMP BYTE PTR DS:[ECX], 0x0       |   int  edxValue += *(int *)eaxPtr;\n     JNZ SHORT A                      |   ecx++;\n     ADD EDX,0xB                      |\n     MOV EAX,EDX                      |   }\n     SUB EAX,0xB                      |   int eaxValue = edxValue;\n     RETN                             |\n</code></pre>\n<p>The thing is that I have stored the string \"30;,;1,73,:2\" in the register ECX. What the routine above does is to go through the string and add the components of the string like 30 or the ANSCII representation of for example ; and so on in the register EDX. \nAs result, I have the value 00000264 in EDX. \nWhat I do not understand is the end of the assembly line. Especially the lines: </p>\n<pre><code>     ADD EDX,0xB                      \n     MOV EAX,EDX                      \n     SUB EAX,0xB \n</code></pre>\n<p>Why we first add 0xB to the register edx, then store it to eax, and then subtract 0xB from eax ?\nThe whole is equivalent to the line: </p>\n<pre><code>     MOV EAX,EDX\n</code></pre>\n<p>Does somebody know why the compiler do it like that ? Because of optimization ? Or there any other reasons?</p>\n<p>By the way: Is my C code implementation correct ?</p>\n</div>",

I guess there's a few instructions in front of it that belong to the function but which you didn't post.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, you didn't post the preceding instructions, so we can just assume there was something there. For example, the programmer might have wanted to return -11 as an error code for an empty string, as in:</p>\n<pre><code>int sum=0;\nif (*ecx) {\n    do {\n        sum+=*ecx;\n        ecx++;\n    } while (*ecx != '\\0');\n    sum+=11;\n}\nreturn sum-11;\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, this is guesswork, because your code doesn't show the if condition.\nHow anyone would want to write his sourcecode like this, i don't know.</p>\n<p>I could think of three reasons for the compiler to produce this code:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No optimizations at all, and source code like mine above</li>\n<li>Intelligent avoidance of a conditional jump (these are evil because the processor instruction pipeline must be cleared if branch prediction fails), although i can't imagine a source code that would use it here.</li>\n<li>Optimization for space. Replace, in my example above, the <code>sum+=11</code> with <code>return sum</code>. This would translate into a <code>MOV EAX, EDX</code> and <code>RETN</code>. <code>ADD EDX, 0XB</code> needs a byte less and accomplishes the same.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Edit: I just tested it: <code>MOV EAX, EDX</code> and <code>RETN</code> need 3 bytes, <code>ADD EDX, 0xB</code> needs 3 bytes as well. So Optimization for space is not an issue here.</p>\n</div>",

Because it's certainly not a usual way to do this operation, any code which duplicates it verbatim would likely be used in a court of law as evidence of copying.  </p>\n<p>See <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11427995_42#page-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article on software watermarking</a> for a survey of current techniques and motivations for using them.</p>\n</div>",
