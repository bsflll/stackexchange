Certain strings exist such as <code>%s%s</code>, so I can assume that <code>printf</code> has been utilised, for example.</p>\n<p>However, when looking through the code, nothing stands out as obviously being library code. Is there a way to identify library functions just from looking at the assembly/decompiled output?</p>\n<p>Thanks,\nJames</p>\n</div>",
