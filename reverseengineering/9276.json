    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>When I define data as a structure with IDAPython, it appears in IDA View in a collapsed view. Out of curiosity, <strong>is it possible to <em>programmatically</em> expand the view of the structure?</strong></p>\n<p>For example, if I run <code>MakeStructEx(0x400000, -1, \"IMAGE_DOS_HEADER\")</code>, I see:</p>\n<pre><code>IMAGE_DOS_HEADER &lt;5A4Dh, 90h, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0FFFFh, 0, 0B8h, 0, 0, 0, \\\n                  40h, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0E0h&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>But I would like to see:</p>\n<pre><code>dw 5A4D                ; e_magic\ndw 90h                 ; e_cblp\ndw 3                   ; e_cp\ndw 0                   ; e_crlc\n... (lines removed) ...\ndd 0E0h                ; e_lfanew\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am using IDA 6.2.</p>\n</div>",

I think that it should work in IDA 6.2 too. There is a chance good chance that there is some IDAPython API designed specifically for that, but I was unable to find it. </p>\n<p>This definitely works in IDA 6.8.\nGood luck</p>\n</div>",
