Below is the snippet of the section I'm having trouble with:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;wdm.h&gt;\n\n#define MAX_PATH 260\nVOID listprocess() {\n\n    // Access the doubly linked list of processes\n    PEPROCESS currentProcess = PsGetCurrentProcess();\n    PLIST_ENTRY processListEntry = currentProcess-&gt;ActiveProcessLinks.Flink;```\n\n\nPS: I'm a beginner so please indulge me if it's too basic as question, Thanks!!!\n</code></pre>\n</div>",

Main reason is that the structure happens to change a lot. Best way to use it is to extract and convert it from the PDB file of the <b>exact</b> kernel version you're experimenting with into C and use the header in your program. There are some programs to convert PDB structures (named <code>UDT</code> in PDB parlance) to C header files (e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/wbenny/pdbex\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pdbex</a>) or online websites such as <a href=\"https://www.vergiliusproject.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vergilius</a>.</span>",
