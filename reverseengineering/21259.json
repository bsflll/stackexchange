    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am getting started with Ghidra, and am decompiling a simple program of mine. The platform is Linux (ELF) on ARM. I found in the decompiled code things like:</p>\n<pre><code>gTime._0_4_ = (undefined4)(time1 &gt;&gt; 0x20);\ngTime._4_4_ = (undefined4)time1;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, <code>gTime</code> is a global and <code>time1</code> a local. Both should be 64 bit integers (<code>uint64_t</code>). I've alreads set the types accordingly. This code is setting the high bits of <code>gTime</code> to the high bits of <code>time1</code> and the same for the low bits. Is there any way I could transform this to:</p>\n<pre><code>gTime = time1\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or is there e.g. an endianness issue here? At some places, it also has the similarly redundant:</p>\n<pre><code>uVar1 = CONCAT44(gTime, gTime._4_4)\n</code></pre>\n<p>I was expecting to be able to select the code and \"refactor\" it to an equivalent form. The only thing that I could find was the \"retype\" function, with works great, but not here. Any ideas how to clean up this code a bit?</p>\n</div>",
