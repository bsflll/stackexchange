In my experience it's mostly used when studying the stealth of game hacks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>HookShark is a detector of installed hooks and patches installed on the system (only usermode for now). It scans through the code-section of every loaded module of each running process and compares it with the file-image. If it detects discrepancies it tries to determine the type of hook or patch and reports it to the user.</p>\n<p>Currently implemented hook detection:</p>\n<p>* - Inline patches / Hooks (NOP, Exceptionhandler, relative Jumps, Custom patches)</p>\n<p>* - Other custom patches [...]</p>\n<p>* - VTable Hooks</p>\n<p>* - IAT and EAT Hooks</p>\n<p>* - Relocation Hooks</p>\n<p>* - Hardware Breakpoints</p>\n<p>* - PAGE_GAURD Candidates</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
