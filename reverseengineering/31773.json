It automatically does everything you've suggested, and the end result is the function's prototype, which will indicate register arguments in standard and non-standard locations.</p>\n<p>If you don't want to do that, then the answer is to re-implement everything that Hex-Rays does in the course of producing that information: namely, prolog analysis, data flow analysis, and call analysis.</p>\n</div>",
