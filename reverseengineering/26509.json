The code needs to be executed to understand what <b>this</b> means. Functions are mutable in javascript and can be defined (created) at runtime. You can have a function which creates functions through lambdas. To say ' I wan't to know what <b>this</b> means in a program ' is to say ' I want to know how the program is evaluated up to the point where this line of code is called.' The only way to know that is to evaluate the code.</span>",
