I created an AVD based on Pixel 2. Opening the ADB shell I get:</p>\n<pre><code>$ getprop ro.product.manufacturer\nunknown\n</code></pre>\n<p>I would like to change the string returned as property <code>ro.product.manufacturer</code>, because I have an app the refuses to run on an \"unknown\" device. How can I do that?</p>\n<p>The file <code>config.ini</code> for the AVD has a line</p>\n<pre><code>hw.device.manufacturer=Google\n</code></pre>\n<p>but this does not seem to be the same thing.</p>\n</div>",
