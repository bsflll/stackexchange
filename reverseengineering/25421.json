    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I want to fix a .plt segment in IDA Pro by replacing 12 bytes from start of every function in the .plt segment with the ones I specify.</p>\n<p>I want to just make each function return so I'm replacing opcodes to do this, but doing this by hand is a painful job. My fingers and palm hurt after I modified a single library, so I need a way to do that with IDA Python.</p>\n<p>It's an ARM 32 shared library, I know it doesn't matter here but specified for goodness sake.</p>\n<p>This is the hex I'm replacing in every function:</p>\n<p><code>00 00 a0 e1 00 00 a0 e3 1e ff 2f e1</code></p>\n<p>This is what this hex is all about:</p>\n<pre><code>    movs r0, r0\n    movs r0, #0\n    bx lr\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
