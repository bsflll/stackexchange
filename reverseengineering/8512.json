    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying understand how some parts of a closed source program distributed as a stripped binary implemented. When I run <code>ldd</code> on the program, it prints only 4-5 most basic C libraries as dynamic dependencies. (e.g. <code>libc</code>, <code>glib</code>, <code>gobject</code> etc.) However, when I run it in gdb or attach gdb to it and run <code>info sharedlibrary</code>, it prints a huge list of libraries. Indeed, that program clearly uses GTK for GUI, for example, but gtk libraries are missing in <code>ldd</code> output and shown in <code>info sharedlibrary</code> output.</p>\n<p>I was wondering does it work and how did they achieve this. Any ideas?</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n</div>",

When I <code>print (char*) $rdi</code> it printed \"libcairo.so\". Now, my question is, why would they do that? Those libraries export huge number of symbols, are they manually linking all of them? Any ideas why would I want this?</span>",
