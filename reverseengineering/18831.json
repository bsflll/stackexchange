For instance in the symbols for <code>ntdll.dll</code> for Windows 10 now, there's a lot of debugging strings that give the following folder as the location of their source files: <code>\"minkernel\\ntdll\\*****\"</code></span>",

However, it could be a fake to make something appear more legit. You're tagging the question as <a class=\"post-tag\" href=\"/questions/tagged/malware\" rel=\"tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'malware'\">malware</a> but I don't quite see the connection.</p>\n<p>Given the path it would not be inconceivable to think that this is some code that uses an older version of <code>ntdll.dll</code> loaded by another name. Stranger things have happened, such as loading a second <code>ntoskrnl.exe</code> to dodge a possibly patched <em>running</em> kernel.</p>\n<p>Anyway the RTM in <code>w7rtm</code> means release to manufacturer and refers to the very first release version of a Windows. And given that this refers to Windows 7, this is <em>several</em> years old by now.</p>\n</div>",
