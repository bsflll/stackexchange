    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am using Immunity Dbg v1.85 (the latest version to date). I spent about an hour analyzing a piece of malware, while making comments and relabeling functions from something like X.00402AC0 to something more useful like X.password_checker. After patching the malware to skip over the password checker function (Copy to executable &gt; All modifications) and saving it to a new file, I see all my comments and label changes have disappeared upon opening the patched version in the debugger.</p>\n<p>The interesting thing is when you terminate the debugger and then re-open the original unpatched executable, the comments and labels remain. It's only when you save binary modifications to a new file that they are lost. Needless to say, this is a huge inconvenience when working on complex binaries that need to be patched and shared.</p>\n<p>Is there any way to save changes to labels and comments to new executables in Immunity?</p>\n</div>",

These tutorials are about saving comments when analyzing an executable and what to do if comments aren't saved when working with DLL files called by the executable. When you patch a binary, you save it to a new executable, and the new UDD file is not created until the new executable is opened, so I don't think any data saved in the original executable UDD is ever transferred.</span>",
