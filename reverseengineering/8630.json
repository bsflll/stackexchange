    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I need to analyse a sample which creates a child process. I want to analyze the child process, too, but I have the following problem. Therefore, I take the command line plugin for my olldbg v1.10 and type the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>childdbg 1\n</code></pre>\n<p>(that is also described at <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21695192/can-ollydbg-trace-a-launched-exe\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21695192/can-ollydbg-trace-a-launched-exe</a> by blabb )</p>\n<p>But the plugin says:</p>\n<pre><code> Unrecognized command: CHILDDBG\n</code></pre>\n<p>Why this appears? How can I fix it ?</p>\n<p>PS:\nBefore somebody recommend me to use ollydbg v2.01 (because it has a built-in option to debug a child process), I can say that I can not open the sample with ollydb v2.01 but this is a topic which I asked here: <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/8614/getting-a-debug-message-after-opening-a-sample-with-ollydbg-2-01?noredirect=1#comment12249_8614\">\"Debugged application has modified the debugging registers\" with ollydbg 2.01</a></p>\n<p>best regards, </p>\n</div>",
