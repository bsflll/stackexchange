    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So now we see that the Swedes are going large with their implantable chips which allow them to carry out certain kinds of transactions without using plastic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/2145896/thousands-people-sweden-get-microchip-implants-new-way-life\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Thousands of people in Sweden get microchip implants for a new way of life</a></p>\n<p>Excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s the size of a grain of rice but could hold the key to many\n  aspects of your life.</p>\n<p>A tiny microchip inserted under the skin can replace the need to carry\n  keys, credit cards and train tickets.</p>\n<p>That might sound like an Orwellian nightmare to some but in Sweden it\n  is a welcome reality for a growing number who favour convenience over\n  concerns of potential personal data violations.</p>\n<p>The small implants were first used in 2015 in Sweden – initially\n  confidentially – and several other countries.</p>\n<p>Swedes have gone on to be very active in microchipping, with scant\n  debate about issues surrounding its use, in a country keen on new\n  technology and where the sharing of personal information is held up as\n  a sign of a transparent society.</p>\n<p>Sweden’s SJ national railway company has won over some 130 users to\n  its microchip reservation service in a year.</p>\n<p>Conductors scan passengers’ hands after they book tickets online and\n  register them on their chip. Sweden has a track record on the sharing\n  of personal information, which may have helped ease the microchip’s\n  acceptance among the Nordic country’s 10 million-strong population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>My question is:</strong></p>\n<h2>How to read the information, then what information is stored in them?</h2>\n<p><strong>How do these microchips work?  Are they merely RFID units that store a single personal ID number?  Or is it something more complex, like a SIM card or Smartcard with some other kind of registration?</strong></p>\n</div>",

And with this small amount of memory they clearly are not storing full biometrics.  I wonder what information is stored in the microchips...?</span>",
