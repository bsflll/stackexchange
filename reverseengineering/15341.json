    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to hack a code in binary <code>.so</code> library. But, when I open <code>.so</code> library with IDA the library has only one function and no strings and there is <code>bad_offset</code> before every address. However, when I open the library in hex editor I can see the name of the functions. I think the program modify itself at runtime but I am not sure.</p>\n<p>Here is the code of the function that shows in IDA:</p>\n<pre><code>        ADR             R12, 0x1FE8\n        ADD             R12, R12, #0x12000\n        LDR             PC, [R12,#0xF68]! \n</code></pre>\n</div>",

Or step through the code in a simulator.</p>\n</div>",
