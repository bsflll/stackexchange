Appcall mechanism highly depends on the type information\n  of the function to be called. For that reason it is necessary to have\n  a correct function prototype before doing an Appcall, otherwise\n  different or incorrect results may be returned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If it's an elf and you don't have Ida, <a href=\"https://lief.quarkslab.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">LIEF</a> is a good option. You can see a tutorial to export an internal function and call it <a href=\"https://lief.quarkslab.com/doc/latest/tutorials/08_elf_bin2lib.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n</div>",
