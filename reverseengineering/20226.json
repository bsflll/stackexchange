If you have a supported (purchased or renewed within the last year) version of IDA Pro, then you can purchase one of the ARM decompiler plugins.</p>\n<p>I have not tried the following, but have heard of them (so add a comment about how well it works if you do try one!)...</p>\n<p>There's the opensource <a href=\"https://github.com/yegord/snowman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">snowman decompiler</a>.  It has been around for a few years now.  Its website says it supports ARM and is available for radare2, x64dbg, multiple versions of IDA Pro, and as a standalone application.</p>\n<p>Another opensource one is <a href=\"https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">RetDec</a>.  Looks like it was just released late last year, but is from a well regarded AV company (Avast) and supposedly has been in development and use privately for several years.</p>\n<p>I've also heard of the commercial <a href=\"https://www.hopperapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hopper</a> product, which specializes in macOS executables, but not sure how good the built-in decompiler is.</p>\n</div>",
