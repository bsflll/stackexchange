    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>While RE an embedded device I ran into a problem - I need to patch a check in the kernel which has no sources available. Unpacking the kernel and binary-patching went smoothly. However I cannot get over <strong>repacking the vmlinux into zImage/bzImage</strong>.</p>\n<p>I extracted the kernel using <code>extract-vmlinux</code> (modified to show offset here):</p>\n<pre><code>$ ../../extract-vmlinux zImage &gt; vmlinux\nFound valid magic - decompressed using unlzma (tail -c+15967 \"zImage\" | unlzma)\nHeader at: head -c15966\nCompressed at: tail -c+15967\n\n$ binwalk zImage\n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n15966         0x3E5E          LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 67108864 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, without any modifications, I wanted to recompress it back and keep the header, as to my knowledge it has the decompression code:</p>\n<pre><code>$ cat &lt;(head -c15966 zImage) &lt;(lzma -z &lt; vmlinux) &gt; zImage-repacked\n$ ls -l\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 3032080 Jun  5 22:32 zImage\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 3024065 Jun  6 00:04 zImage-repacked\n\n$ binwalk zImage-repacked\n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n15966         0x3E5E          LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n</code></pre>\n<p>The image came ~8k short, which didn't worry me (as my compression might have been more aggressive). However the image is now broken:</p>\n<pre><code>$ ../../extract-vmlinux zImage-repacked &gt; /dev/null\nextract-vmlinux: Cannot find vmlinux.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I also found that the <code>extract-linux</code> script pipes everything after the offset to <code>unlzma</code> but there's 9441 bytes of <em>something</em> which <code>unlzma</code> ignores. When removed I'm getting a pure archive which matches the size saved just after it:</p>\n<pre><code>$ tail -c+15967 zImage | head -c-9441 | unlzma &gt; /dev/null ; echo $?\n0\n$ tail -c+15967 zImage | head -c-9441 | unlzma | wc --bytes\n13871216\n$ tail -c+15967 zImage | head -c-9437 | tail -c4 | od -i --endian=little\n0000000    13871216\n0000004\n</code></pre>\n<p>I know the classical wisdom is \"you have to recompile\" but we're on RE - this is not possible ;)<br/>\nHow can I approach <strong>re-packing of the modified vmlinux back to LZMA-zImage</strong>?</p>\n</div>",
