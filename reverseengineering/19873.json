Does anyone know which api script language can implement such a function? I used FindUnexplored to find Unexplored data.</p>\n</div>",

Obviously, it can not be disassembled as is.</li>\n<li>It may be obfuscated code with garbage bytes inside (something like <code>jmp $+6;garbage byte;code to jump to</code> ). In general IDA should handle it, but if you starting your conversion from incorrect byte it will be garbage. This problem can be found in architectures with non-constant instruction length, such as x86 or x64.</li>\n<li>It may be just data.  Not all unexplored bytes are the code.</li>\n<li>It may be some exotic variant of instruction that IDA disassembler can not handle.While theoretically possible, it is highly unlikely.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
