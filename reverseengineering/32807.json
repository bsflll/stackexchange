    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>i have been doin ctf challenge and came across a problem when i have to push the address of a function into eip{instruction pointer} by overflowing the buffer but the main problem here is that the address of the function is 0x401199 and in other to push the address i have to push it in reverse order like \\x99\\x11\\x40\\x00 and i have been using python to do so , but the main problem here is that some the these value like \\x99 and \\x11 are associated with non printable character and i cannot guess any other method to do so please some one with time can clear my request</p>\n<p>i hope i explained my query briefly</p>\n</div>",
