    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a malware sample that wraps <code>LoadLibrary</code> &amp; <code>GetProcAddress</code> duo to dynamically resolve functions. After this wrapper is called the value stored in <code>eax</code>(which is the function name)immediately gets called. The strings are encrypted and it's too difficult for me to reverse the encryption algorithm. Instead I wrote a python script which sets breakpoints where a <code>call eax</code> instruction is mentioned. Everyting's fine, I get the addresses of the functions from <code>eax</code> that are dynamically imported. The problem is I need them to be readable. I know how to resolve the address to a function name in widbg by calling <code>ln address</code>. But I don't want to sit all day and copy all of the 649 imports one by one to the <code>windbg</code> console. I looked up the <code>windbg</code>'s scripting capabilities but I could not write anything that would do the job.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n</div>",
