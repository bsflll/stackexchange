The thermostat due to some technical and electrical challenges sometimes got placed at weird positions, so I thought, I am giving this a try, and see how far I can get.</p>\n<p>In their official app, i was playing around to generat some log, so I managed to sniff the bluetooth packages, then using <em>wireshark</em>, noticated some patterns, but having hard times actually understanding them:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8bCYM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8bCYM.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>The first <code>01</code> or <code>00</code> definitely indicates whether we are increasing or decreasing, but what the rest could be?</p>\n<p>Any tips, ideas, and suggestions are welcome!</p>\n<p>I am a fullstack engineer, and pretty new all these iot and smarthome things, but trying my best.</p>\n<pre><code>\nACTION  PAYLOAD\nINCREASE_BY_5_IN_ONE_HOUR   Value: 01f401143c003c00\nDECREASE_BY_5_IN_ONE_HOUR   Value: 00f401143c003c00\n    \nINCREASE_BY_3_IN_ONE_HOUR   Value: 012c010a3c003c00\nDECREASE_BY_3_IN_ONE_HOUR   Value: 002c010a3c003c00\n    \nINCREASE_BY_1_IN_3_HOURS    Value: 01640014b400b400\nDECREASE_BY_1_IN_3_HOURS    Value: 00640014b400b400\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n</div>",

First, European product, so maybe we can assume the units are in Celsius (at least for this dataset). <code>Extremely accurate (+/-0.1°C) and completely silent intelligent thermostat</code> tells us the precision. <code>The new Beta heaters are equipped with smart electronic thermostats (for 5–30 °C) that can be controlled manually or with Ensto’s Heat Control application (for Android and iOS)</code> tells us the range. In terms of units this is 50 to 300... which is 250 discrete values, which means we probably have a single byte for temperature. If the OP could tell us the temperatures when these samples were taken, we can see if the temperature is in the message.</p>\n</div>",
