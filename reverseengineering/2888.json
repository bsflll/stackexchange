    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>My question is about Java exploits, for example this one: <a href=\"https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-010A\">https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-010A</a> (exploit avaiable here <a href=\"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/57246/\">http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/57246/</a>)</p>\n<p>The victimn should visit the site and accept to run the applet in your computer. Then if the JVM is vulnerable the cracker can execute arbitrary commands.</p>\n<p>So my question is: How did the security researcher find this vulnerability? I mean, not specific this one, but how (what tools, method, etc) did he/she use to find these vulnerabilities? Does he/she reverse engineer javaw.exe? What's the methods?</p>\n</div>",

It's a little bit outdated, but still relevant.</p>\n</div>",
