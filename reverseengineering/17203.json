Can I do this in x64Dbg and if so, how? I do see a Struct tab in the hex dump area, but if I right-click, there is no option to define a struct.<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vb4zy.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vb4zy.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

It is however possible to define structs and visit them in memory (similar to 010 editor). The main sources of information about this are <a href=\"https://x64dbg.com/blog/2016/12/04/type-system.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://x64dbg.com/blog/2016/11/27/weekly-digest-14.html#types\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>As an example if you have the following code:</p>\n<pre><code>#pragma pack(1)\nstruct MyStruct\n{\n    int a;\n    bool b;\n    const char* c;\n};\n\nvoid test(MyStruct* p)\n{\n    MyStruct* s = p;\n    s-&gt;a = 0x1234;\n    s-&gt;b = true;\n    s-&gt;c = \"Hello world\";\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    MyStruct s;\n    test(&amp;s);\n    return s.a;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You use the <code>Parse header</code> option in the <code>Struct</code> tab to parse the following header:</p>\n<pre><code>struct MyStruct\n{\n    int a;\n    bool b;\n    const char* c;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will load the structure (use the command <code>EnumTypes</code> to see a list of types). Now when you're paused at the disassembly of the <code>test</code> function you can use the <code>Visit type</code> option from the <code>Struct</code> tab to show the contents of the memory at <code>ecx</code> in a structural way:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7m0js.png\"/></p>\n<p>The addresses of the structure members will also be added as temporary labels so you can see what an instruction refers to in the info box:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mtHFg.png\"/></p>\n<p>This feature has not been further developed because there was a lack of interest from the community.</p>\n</div>",
