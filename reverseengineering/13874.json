Properties windows says:</p>\n<pre><code>Type: Section\nDescription: A memory mapped file or paging-file...\nAddress: 0xFFFFF8A002D8A080\n</code></pre>\n<p>But when I look into x64dbg Memory Map tab, there is no such addresses. I see only range <code>0000000000010000-000007FFFFFE0000</code>. How I can find memory mapped file? I want to place memory breakpoint on it.</p>\n</div>",
