    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am attempting to reverse-engineer a 16-Bit DOS MZ executable.</p>\n<p>The file contains many different strings, most of which are printed out to the console at various points.</p>\n<p>IDA seems to be able to pick up the locations from which the strings are utilised, for example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/sMBVr.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"IDA String Information\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/sMBVr.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Clicking on this reference shows the code that utilises the string, which I assume passes it into the function (sub 1462) which prints it out to the screen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/49bhe.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Code that utilises the above string\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/49bhe.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>When I attempt to analyse the same code in Ghidra, it is unable to pickup the same strings. I have manually gone to the location shown in IDA, and setup the \"print\" (sub 1462) function in this way:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7MPDq.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"PrintString Function Definition\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7MPDq.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>So I would expect the decompiler to show the string, however it doesn't seem to pick it up:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/J2UPA.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Print String Function in Ghidra Decompiler\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/J2UPA.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/i5m40.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Print String Function in Ghidra Decompiler\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/i5m40.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I'm assuming that this has something to do with the stack pointer being set (or assumed to be) an incorrect value? However, Ghidra seems to locate this string at a different location to IDA:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WXiy0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"IDA String Location\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WXiy0.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Thanks,\nJames.</p>\n</div>",

This, therefore, offset all of the other strings as they were pushed down into their own memory segment, causing the incorrect offsets.</p>\n<p>To solve this, I used Ghidra's Memory Manager to remove the two memory segments, and then create a new one with all the strings combined.</p>\n<p>Before:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/z51td.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Ghidra Memory Map before changes\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/z51td.png\"/></a>\nAfter:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/V5mgX.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Ghidra Memory Map after changes\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/V5mgX.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>As a result of these changes, and with the DS register set to the correct offset, the string now shows in the decompiler window.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/heyE8.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Strings showing in the Ghidra decompilation window\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/heyE8.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
