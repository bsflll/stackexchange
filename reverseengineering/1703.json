Your link error is likely due to an incorrect edit which changed some offsets within the file. If you don't adjust the offsets, you have to replace a string with a string that is no longer than the original, and you cannot add new fields unless you have a known amount of slack space available.</p>\n<p>Use <code>readelf -a</code> to check the ELF file headers, and compare old with new.</p>\n</div>",
