The page is translated to English. Googling doesn't give me any fruitful pointer on the technique itself. Is <code>stack migration</code> a standard attack technique? If so, pointers would be appreciated.</p>\n</div>",

It is a technique used in cases where you can't control the contents of the actual stack used by the target but can change the stack pointer to point into some other memory area you control (e.g. heap). For example, <a href=\"http://hypervsir.blogspot.com/2015/01/a-software-solution-to-defend-against.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this blog post</a> explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With stack pivoting, attacks can pivot from the real stack to a fake\nstack which could be an attacker-controlled buffer, such as the heap,\nthen attackers can control the program execution. For example, this is\nachieved by controlling data pointed to by RSP(stack pointer\nregister), such that each ret instruction results in incrementing RSP\nand transferring execution to the next address chosen by attackers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So yes, it's a real and common technique, you just used not the best translation :)</p>\n</div>",
