    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to reverse engineer an online game (Dota 2) to get some more info and build a personal assistant with friendlier/ advanced info about my character. First I'm trying to find out the player location on the map. I thought of trying to read and profile the client.exe to find where in the memory it stores the character location, but I truly don't know where to start.</p>\n<p>I can run it with OllyDbg and start looking for changing values as the character moves, but since many other values in the game also change, it would take me days to find out which is it. So I figured maybe there is a better way. How to get started with this?</p>\n</div>",

Everytime you are going up or down, search for in- or decreased float value. This will give you the y-coordinate in the end. That offset taken, add 4 bytes to get z- and substract 4 bytes to get x-coordinate. Using ReClass you can even try to find the base object for your and other players.</p>\n</div>",
