IDA Free does not support NE file format, you need  to use the full version (at least Starter) or another disassembler .You can find the details of the VBX API in the VB Control Development Kit (CDK) shipped with <a href=\"https://winworldpc.com/download/4DA81FE7-57D8-11E4-A90F-7054D21A8599\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Visual Basic Pro 3.0</a> or by searching for \"vbapi.h\".
