Once an ink cartridge is installed, printer will mark it as protected. </p>\n<p>What is embedded in the chip? </p>\n<p>How can we make sure that it is original and not duplicated with a 3rd party? </p>\n<p>Is this a safe and well-known offline security protocol? (it will be great if some one can point me to a reference about it)</p>\n</div>",

It’s hard to know what type of chips are being used by the printer and cartridges but I bet it’s something like the Microchip’s ATSHA204A or ATTECC508. Google those chips and they can give you some info on how host - client authentication can be done with hardware.</span>",
