    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to reverse engineer a firmware for a vape mod. I've downloaded it from their official website. First I tried dissassemble it in IDA but it couldn't identify any architecture in it. Then I tried to examine it with binvis.io and it looked like this <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uhO3G.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uhO3G.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>So judging from this image I made a conclusion that this file is compressed. After that I opened it in HxD. And I've got there some repeating bytes but I couldn't figure out what they mean yet.<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WepZZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WepZZ.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I would be very pleased if you could give me the direction for my next steps.\nAnd if you want to study that file for yourself, you can download it here. <a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0008/7484/0129/files/MiniKinV1.5BoostMod.firmware?8078543727848484856\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Firmware for asmodus minikin boost</a></p>\n<p>And also you can check out their official firmware updater tool if this helps. <a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0008/7484/0129/files/UpgradeV1.1.zip?15970523724909510905\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Upgrade tool</a></p>\n</div>",

Maybe there is a chance to read the unscrambled image out of the hardware using JTAG (if not disabled)\nThe Eleaf Controller is labled \"M091\" and is a 48 PIN but did not find any routed JTAG connection onboard.\nA first step to find out what chip it is could be a check to which pins the crystal is connected to.</p>\n</div>",
