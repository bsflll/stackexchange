    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have reversed a number of functions and added definitions for some structs in an Intel x64 PE  executable. A program got an update. I moved old executable with the old database into another folder and I opened new executable and IDA created new database.</p>\n<p>Now I'd like to move information I gathered in the old executable into the new database: function names, comments for specific assembly lines, defined structures, renamed offsets(in the assembly instruction ) to represent offets of structs, etc.</p>\n<p>I googled it and found BinDiff plugin for IDA, and successfully ported function names and comments to the same executable(in a small VC++ test solution) opened in another folder with debugging symbols stripped.</p>\n<p>But it didn't touch the defined structures. The reason I used a small test project is because when I tried it on a real IDB, it was taking IDA too long to BinDiff the databases: the IDBs are 1.4GB in size with 180k functions recognized by IDA. I left it for half an hour and then decided to try it on a small project.</p>\n<p>So how to move all relevant information to the new database for the new version of the executable?</p>\n</div>",
