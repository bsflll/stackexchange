Thanks to this <a href=\"https://tuts4you.com/download.php?list.9\" rel=\"nofollow\">site</a>, I have an idea of the capabilities of the plugins for OllyDbg. </p>\n<p>As I have only a very basic idea of how plugins work, I was wondering, do plugins interfere with each other? For example, if I use multiple plugins that deals with the same anti-debugging techniques, is it possible that they may conflict with each other and mess with what I would ideally want, which is to hide my debugger? Thanks!</p>\n</div>",

Generally you should only keep plugins that you use. </p>\n<p>The best anti-debugging plugins for Ollydbg as of now are <em><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/NtQuery/scyllahide\" rel=\"nofollow\">ScyllaHide</a></em> for user-mode and <em><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/mrexodia/titanhide\" rel=\"nofollow\">TitanHide</a></em> for kernel mode. Both of them are open source and well maintained.</p>\n</div>",
