It is always recommended to use the latest version from git.</p>\n<p>Install or update radare2 with the following steps:</p>\n<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/radare/radare2.git # clone radare2 if you didn't do it yet for some reason.\n$ cd radare2\n$ ./sys/install.sh\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now after radare2 is installed and updated let's move to write the C program to list all the functions of the binary. As you've mentioned in your question, it should be the equivalent for opening the binary with radare2, executing <code>aaa</code> to analyze the binary (which is actually <code>r2 -A binary_name</code>) and then execute <code>afl</code> to list all the functions.</p>\n<p>First we should define a function that accepts r2 instance and command. This function will execute the command, print the results and free the resulting string.</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;r_socket.h&gt;                           \n\nstatic void r2cmd(R2Pipe *r2, const char *cmd) {\n        char *msg = r2p_cmd (r2, cmd);          \n        if (msg) {                              \n                printf (\"%s\\n\", msg);           \n                free (msg);                     \n        }                                       \n}  \n</code></pre>\n<p>After that, writing the <code>main()</code> function should be intuitive:</p>\n<pre><code>int main() {                                           \n        R2Pipe *r2 = r2p_open (\"r2 -q0 /bin/echo\");\n        if (r2) {                                  \n                r2cmd (r2, \"aaa\");                 \n                r2cmd (r2, \"afl\");                 \n                r2p_close (r2);                    \n                return 0;                          \n        }                                          \n        return 1;                                  \n}   \n</code></pre>\n<p>We define an instance of r2 with the program we want to examine, and then use the function we just created to execute commands through radare2's interface. First we analyze the program using <code>aaa</code> and then we print the functions using <code>afl</code>.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Compiling</h2>\n<p>To compile the program using <code>gcc</code> we should execute the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>gcc list_functions.c -o list_functions $(pkg-config --cflags r_socket --libs r_socket)\n</code></pre>\n<hr/>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/radare/radare2-r2pipe\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">r2pipe project page</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/radare/radare2-r2pipe/tree/master/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">r2pipe C bindings</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
