What are our options? We just want to point it at an .EXE, possibly set the source code path, if not in the .EXE, visually set breakpoints, step through code, examine variables, etc.</p>\n</div>",

Also, \"security\" concerns would prohibit running our proprietary code in the browser (yes, I do understand that it runs a local server and never leaves my PC, but I doubt that we could explain that to the Pointy Headed Bosses :-(   I have updated the question to say \"no browser, please\"</span>",
