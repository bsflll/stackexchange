    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Twitter has an option to right-click on a video and \"copy video address\" but this button seems to be broken as it doesn't copy anything to the clipboard, even after I disable Ghostery/adblock. I wanted to find the link directly in the html source but I can't seem to do so. Does anyone know how to do this? A previous post from a while ago suggested looking for \"video_url\" but that keyword doesn't seem to be anywhere in the source</p>\n</div>",
