I am attaching the link to binary along with some of the screenshots which can bring more context to my current problem, in case I missed something, my apologies.</p>\n<p>Link to binary : <a href=\"https://easyupload.io/xcqeod\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://easyupload.io/xcqeod</a></p>\n<p>Screenshots :</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FKHOY.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Garble obfuscated malware\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FKHOY.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pr6UE.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"functions\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pr6UE.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/imLaA.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"functions\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/imLaA.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
