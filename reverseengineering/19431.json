    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm, using OllyDbg 1.1 to debug some malware and it's been quite a while since I've dealt with <code>wininet</code> calls. When I set a software or hardware breakpoint directly after the call to <code>wininet.HttpSendRequestW</code> the breakpoint never hits and it seems like the malware hangs.</p>\n<p>I've also verified that I can reach the internet and the resource that is involved in the <code>HttpSendRequestW</code> call. What's the trick to allowing a step-over on these wininet functions?</p>\n</div>",
