I find <a href=\"https://github.com/quarkslab/quokka\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">quokka</a> to be fairly decent (performance-wise) in terms of exporting, but <a href=\"https://github.com/google/binexport\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BinExport</a> might suffice if you're limited by not having IDA.</p>\n<p>Once you have the databases exported, you can diff with <a href=\"https://github.com/quarkslab/qbindiff\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">qbindiff</a> to get your results, and then render your results to something that is easy to process.</p>\n<p>Something like the following, with <code>$format</code> set to \"bindiff\" or \"csv\" should work for diffing. There are also options (listed in the help) to allow you to pick and choose the <a href=\"https://diffing.quarkslab.com/qbindiff/doc/source/features.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">features</a> you wish to use for matching.</p>\n<pre><code>$ python -m qbindiff -ff $format -o /path/to/results.$format -e1 /path/to/binary/1 -e2 /path/to/binary/2 /path/to/export/1 /path/to/export/2\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
