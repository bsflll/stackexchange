    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>There is this program I'd like to debug of which I already have the source code.</p>\n<p>When I run the program, it sends a post request to a specific URL with JSON data, but it doesn't show up in http debuggers. I have tried Fiddler 4 and HTTP Debugger Pro so far. It also doesn't connect to any proxies. Also, the debuggers capture everything else, so they probably work.</p>\n<p>Here is the C# code responsible for the request (the code itself works, but I may have modified some parts to post it here):</p>\n<pre><code>WebRequest webRequest = WebRequest.Create(\"url\");\nwebRequest.Method = \"POST\";\nwebRequest.ContentType = \"application/json\";\nbyte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes((\"JSON DATA\"));\nusing (Stream requestStream = webRequest.GetRequestStream())\n{\n  requestStream.Write(bytes, 0, bytes.Length);\n  requestStream.Close();\n}\nWebResponse response = webRequest.GetResponse();\nwebRequest.GetRequestStream();\nStream responseStream;\nusing (responseStream = response.GetResponseStream())\n{\n  string end = new StreamReader(responseStream).ReadToEnd();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Why are none of the http debuggers capturing the request? Any help is appreciated!</p>\n</div>",

            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">Sorry but I am a bit confused because you call a proxy like Fiddler a debugger which is very unusual. Fiddler is an Man-in-the-Middle proxy or you can call it an HTTPS intercepting proxy but it is never a debugger. Debuggers connect directly to the process and allow to set break points on certain code points. So are you also using a real debugger to check the program or are you just talking about proxies?</span>",

I am not using debuggers that connect to the process, but rather these requests/network debuggers that check where applications make requests to.</span>",
