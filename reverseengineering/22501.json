    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am working on modifying my Intel Pin based tool. As before I am using VS2015 on Windows 10. Previously, I have been testing a tool on the same system where I build it and it worked just fine. The real use of a tool was on the Win7 virtual machine. Recently, I started getting incorrect behavior of a tool. It doesn't crash, however, it stops recording traces before it should and writes the following in the log file:</p>\n<pre><code>A:  source\\pin\\pin\\image.cpp: LEVEL_PINCLIENT::RTN_Name: 2012: assertion failed: RTN_Valid(x)\n</code></pre>\n<p>I thought that it was caused by recent updates of a Windows or new antivirus that was introduced by our IT department. However, I tested it on the Win7 VM and it worked there as fine as before. Then I have created Win10 VM without antivirus and switched off all possible security features but got the same <em>assertion failed</em> problem. I have been using Intel Pin 3.6, so I decided to build my tool under 3.11 but got the same problems.</p>\n<p>Finally, a question: what causes such behavior? </p>\n<p>I know, that Pin's FAQ doesn't explicitly say (<a href=\"https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-binary-instrumentation-tool-faq\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-binary-instrumentation-tool-faq</a>) that Intel Pin should work on Win10, however it worked for me before. </p>\n</div>",
