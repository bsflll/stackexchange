As far as I know Immunity just displays the <code>CPU</code> window initially. All the other windows are normally closed. So I would recommend to just close all windows and open <code>View</code>&gt;<code>CPU</code>.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>To \"reset\" the tiling within the <code>CPU</code> window. Just close all windows expect the <code>CPU</code> window. Minimize the <code>CPU</code> window manually and click <code>Tile horizontal</code> afterwards. Normally the tiling within the <code>CPU</code> window should be centered now.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>In the case you want to display multiple windows and re-arrange them:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>close all windows</li>\n<li>open the windows of interest with <code>View</code>&gt;<code>CPU</code> / <code>Memory</code> / <code>Log</code>/ <code>...</code></li>\n<li>Tile windows with: <code>Window</code> &gt; <code>Tile horizontal / vertical</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Until now, I didn't find a better solution.</p>\n</div>",
