    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to RE the chrome cast protocol.\nI saw Koushik Dutta did RE the <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/110558071969009568835/posts/G3jF2JynLc2\" rel=\"nofollow\">protocol</a>, but didn't find any post online analyze the protocol. Moreover Google changed it a little bit since then.</p>\n<p>currently I figured out some of the http packets the sender and receiver transmit but I would like to figure out what is the http request I need to send the cast device in order it will render an .html file and/or javascript code on it.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I want to mimic <a href=\"https://github.com/pjjanak/chromecast-hello-world\" rel=\"nofollow\">this snippet</a> without using google API nor <code>APP ID</code> nor <code>NAMESPACE</code>:</p>\n<pre><code> $(function() {\n        var receiver = new cast.receiver.Receiver('*** YOUR APP ID ****', ['*** YOUR NAMESPACE ***']),\n            channelHandler = new cast.receiver.ChannelHandler('*** YOUR NAMESPACE ***'),\n            $messages = $('.messages');\n\n        channelHandler.addChannelFactory(\n            receiver.createChannelFactory('*** YOUR NAMESPACE ***'));\n\n        receiver.start();\n\n        channelHandler.addEventListener(cast.receiver.Channel.EventType.MESSAGE, onMessage.bind(this));\n\n        function onMessage(event) {\n            $messages.html(event.message.type);\n        }\n</code></pre>\n<p>I want to find the right <code>curl</code> / <code>http</code> request in order to run my <code>.js</code> on the cast without using google API. for example the following <a href=\"http://fiquett.com/2013/07/chromecast-traffic-sniffing/\" rel=\"nofollow\">curl</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>curl -H “Content-Type: application/json” http://10.0.1.2:8008/apps/YouTube -X DELETE\n</code></pre>\n<p>kills the running app on the cast. How can I make it run my app without being bounded to google's whitelist and demo API.</p>\n<p>The google <a href=\"https://www.gstatic.com/cast/js/receiver/1.0/cast_receiver.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">cast_reciver.js</a> is obfuscated:</p>\n<pre><code>cr$rb = function (a) {\n    cr$k(a, \"Listener can not be null.\");\n    if (\"function\" == cr$b(a)) return a;\n    cr$k(a.handleEvent, \"An object listener must have handleEvent method.\");\n    return a[cr$Ab] || (a[cr$Ab] = function (b) {\n        return a.handleEvent(b)\n    })\n};\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
