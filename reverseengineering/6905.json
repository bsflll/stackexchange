Also, all the samples I analysed - and all the examples I remember seeing on the 'net - used <code>ExitProcess()</code> even though a simple return from the entry point seems to have exactly the same effect.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know of any documentation - official or otherwise - regarding the game rules for PE32(+) entry points?</p>\n</div>",

It seems that much of what we know about things going on under the hood (post-Pietrek/Schulman) we know only because of his excellent work... The reminder regarding TLS callbacks will be useful for people dealing with unknown packers and similar stuff.</span>",
