    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm a beginner at this and I'm following tutorials but I am kind of stuck.</p>\n<p>I found a function that accesses all characters X position in game. I found this using Cheat Engine and here's how it looks:<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/h5xio.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/h5xio.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>All these addresses are X positions of characters in game.</p>\n<p>I looked up this function in IDA and the functions looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>double __thiscall sub_427380(int this)\n{\n  return *(float *)(this + 80);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So I managed to hook this function and read the values in C++.</p>\n<p>Here's the code: </p>\n<pre><code>double hookedFunction(int i)\n{\n    float f = *(float *)(i + 80);\n    return originalFunction(i);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This works but when I try to read values from other offsets that I found using the \"Dissect Data/Structures\" function in Cheat Engine I'm stuck.</p>\n<p>Here's the structure from one of the addresses I found in Cheat Engine:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QyPt7.png\"/></p>\n<p>When I subtract 80 from the address and I create a new data structure in Cheat Engine it looks like this: <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7mcuZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7mcuZ.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>So here's where I need help. How do I read the string at offset 0040 and the 4 bytes at offset 003C in my hooked function.</p>\n<p>I tried doing stuff like:</p>\n<pre><code>DWORD d = *(DWORD *)(i + 0x3C);\n</code></pre>\n<p>But whatever I try I can't get the right values. </p>\n</div>",
