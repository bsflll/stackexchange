A lot of other things (such as hardware, door locks) can be reverse engineered but not decompiled, because their software/firmware is written in low level languages without a higher-level representation, or, more radically, they don't <em>have</em> any firmware in the first place.</p>\n</div>",

E.g. this could lead to a description of what it does, maybe with a simulation of what (part of it) does. Decompile is to produce source code that (when compiled) gives you back the \"same\" binary, which is a much harder task in general.  </p>\n</div>",

Decompilation is a form of static analysis which is investigating a program by not running it.  Don't forget that reverse engineering can also mean taking apart the device that's running a program.  <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3482\" rel=\"nofollow\">Some of my favorite exploits have dealt with using the property of some kinds of memories to continue holding values after the machine has been shut off.</a> </p>\n<p>A small, non-exhaustive list of techniques for reverse engineering:</p>\n<p><strong>Static Analysis Techniques</strong></p>\n<p>String analysis --&gt;  Using a program like \"strings\" to discover any readable text in the binary.  On non-packed files, this can often tip you off as to what platform the binary was compiled in.  If the binary was compiled with symbols, you can even get access to variable names that the author had used, which can help in subsequent analysis.  </p>\n<p>Decompilation  --&gt;  Cruder techniques might include unix tools like objdump, cracking open the binary in a hex editor, etc.  </p>\n<p><strong>Dynamic Analysis</strong></p>\n<p>Fuzz Testing --&gt;  Throwing multiple kinds of (possibly) invalid data to see how the application responds</p>\n<p>Debugging  --&gt;  Coupled with Fuzz testing above will let you see how the application is actually working on the level of registers &amp;&amp; assembly.  (If using GDB or ollydbg.)  </p>\n<p>\"Eavesdropping\" on circuits or radiation emitted by a device--&gt;  It's exotic, but <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Eck_phreaking\" rel=\"nofollow\">it's real.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>\nSo decompilation is just one tool in the much broader kit of \"reverse engineering.\"  </p>\n</div>",
