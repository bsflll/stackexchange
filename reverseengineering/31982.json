As the ZIP payload is encrypted you should more or less only get strings from the installer section.</span>",

Static analysis is a good place to start. You may find the password stored as a string in the installer or the logic of the password through static analysis. Otherwise, you will need to perform dynamic analysis and try to capture the password by debugging specific regions of memory as the installer operates as the installer passes the password to the encrypted file.</p>\n<p>This is a very general answer because you provided no context to the type of installer you are working with.</p>\n</div>",
