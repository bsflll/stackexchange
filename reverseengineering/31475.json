    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<br/>\nI have a shellcode and want to inject my shellcode into a PE file (a simple compiled c program that prints Hello World on the screen) . My shellcode size is 0x2a1 and the .text section of my PE file has enough space to hold it . So i opened my PE file in PE-Bear and find the .text section RawOffset in file : \n<br/><br/>\n<p><img alt=\"RawOffset of .text section\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2n9tD.png\"/></p>\n<p><br/><br/>\nthen i patch .text section bytes using HxD . I set AddressOfEntryPoint in OptionalHeader to start of .text section where my shellcode is : <br/><br/>\n<img alt=\"AddressOfEntryPoint in PE-Bear\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EcZOV.png\"/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>So now execution must be started from my shellcode bytes . but i ran PE file and got error :<br/><br/>\n<img alt=\"ERROR\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MBoKB.png\"/> <br/><br/>\nI opened PE file using OllyDbg and execution wasn't at position that i expected :<br/><br/>\n<img alt=\"OllyDbg\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FGrM7.png\"/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>AddressOfEntryPoint was 1000 . it's RVA so the execution must be started at 0x00401000 since the ImageBase is 0x00401000 (PE file is not dynamic base) but it isn't that and we got Access Violation .</p>\n<p>i use Windows XP . what is going on ? why does this happen ?</p>\n</div>",
