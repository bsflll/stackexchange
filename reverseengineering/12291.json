This returns the length of the disassembled instruction. If this equals 15 you have found the previous instruction. If it is less than 15, then pass 1 byte less (i.e 14 bytes) and so on until the length of the buffer passed to BeaEngine equals the length of the disassembled instruction.</p>\n<p>This can be represented in pseudo code</p>\n<pre><code>eip = 0xDEADCODE\n\nlength = 15\nwhile(length &gt; 0)\n{\n    buffer = ReadProcessMemory(start=eip-length, length)\n    lenDisasm = Disasm(buffer)\n\n    if (lenDisasm == length) \n    {\n        prevIns = eip-length\n        break;\n    }\n    else length--;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the above algorithm is not generic in nature i.e. you cannot use it to find the previously executed instruction given the current <code>eip</code>. This only works when the execution sequence is linear without any jumps in between. In case of hardware breakpoints on access the execution sequence is <strike>guaranteed to be</strike> linear and the above algorithm is applicable.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n<p>Even in case of hardware breakpoints on access the execution sequence may not be linear as in the following case</p>\n<pre><code>format PE\n\nentry start\n\nsection '.text' code readable executable\n\nstart:\n    nop\n    nop\n    jmp dword [here]\n    mov eax, 1\n    push eax\n    pop eax\n\naddress:\n    xor eax, eax\n    ret     \n\nsection '.data' readable writable\n\nhere:   ; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HWBP on read\n dd address\n</code></pre>\n<p>A hardware breakpoint on read is set on <code>here</code>. In this case the hwbp would hit when <code>EIP</code> is at <code>address</code>. If you use the above algorithm, the previously executed instruction turns out to be <code>pop eax</code> which is incorrect. \nFor such cases you can use instruction tracing or memory breakpoints (<strong><em><a href=\"http://www.codereversing.com/blog/archives/79\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href=\"http://waleedassar.blogspot.in/2012/11/defeating-memory-breakpoints.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3771785/whats-the-principle-of-ollydbgs-memory-breakpoint\">3</a></em></strong>).</p>\n</div>",
