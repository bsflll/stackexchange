You can then double-click on any of those calls to go to that particular call's location and start having a field day researching from there.</p>\n<p>I'm sure there is either in-built functionality or plug-ins you can use to essentially achieve the same sort of code analysis to find all calls to  thing statically via x64dbg, IDA, etc.</p>\n</div>",
