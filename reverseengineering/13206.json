That's probably the direction I'll be taking.</p>\n<p>the full response is this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We don't, because the disadvantages would far surpass the benefit.\n  That is, we would have to ship many more libraries (no reason to stop\n  to QtNetwork), that probably &lt; 1% our users need, and adding that much\n  bloat for such little benefit, doesn't really make sense to us.</p>\n<p>That being said we provide instructions + patch to re-build it yourself\n  from the original Qt 5.4.1 sources:\n   - <a href=\"http://www.hexblog.com/?p=969\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hexblog.com/?p=969</a></p>\n<p>With those you should obtain a new Qt build, that corresponds to\n  the one we're shipping, ... plus those libraries we don't ship\n  (and PDBs, of course.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They also went on and explained why Python/PyQt/QtWidgets.pyd are indeed shipped rather surprisingly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A valid question would be: why ship python/PyQt5/QtWidgets.pyd then?\n  ..well, there really is no reason. This is a mistake.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And finished by tipping off about an upcoming new minor release:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>PS: We are a few days away from a new release (IDA 6.95), that will ship\n  with Qt 5.6.0, which is a long-term release (i.e., 3 years support +\n  bugfixes.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Noting the complexities of bundling additional IDA-QT libraries with plugins:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unless you really have to build specifically for IDA 6.9 (and thus\n  Qt 5.4.1), perhaps it's best to wait for the new release, in order to\n  not have to do it twice? (I'll write a similar blog post with configure\n  options + patch for IDA 6.95)</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
