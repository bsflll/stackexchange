    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to track a certain value in a game to analyze the cause of a crash (basically, it goes to null at one point and I would like to know what exactly puts that to null as it causes issues later on). I am relatively a beginner in C# reversing as well as using DnSpy, but I couldn't find an exact way to do so leading me to believe either the feature isn't possible or if it is, I am unaware of it.</p>\n<p>My goal is to be informed of where exactly it puts it to null with preferably a stacktrace. The best I was able to do was to breakpoint a bunch and hope for the best, but I quickly realised this is very inefficient and there has to be a better way to do this.</p>\n<p>If it isn't possible in DnSpy itself, can I use other tools to accomplish the same thing? </p>\n<p>If it helps, it's a Unity game which I replaced its mono dll so the DnSpy debugger works, but it can only put breakpoints in the code, not break whenever something changes at all. I can see the value in the watcher, but that's not enough.</p>\n</div>",

As for using a regular debugger, unfortunately this would require complete decompilation of the code dll which has many intricacies that makes this difficult so the best way to track it would some a breakpoint triggered on change with the dnspy debugger.  I also forgot to mention this set to null happens in one frame making it difficult to spot what is causing it.</span>",
