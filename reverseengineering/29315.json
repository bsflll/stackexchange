    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I would like to learn more about RE.</p>\n<p>I wrote a simple program on a STM32F107 which does nothing else than encrypting and decrypting a text once using AES128-ECB.</p>\n<p>Here is the C code (I intentionally left out the key so far):</p>\n<pre><code>    struct AES_ctx TestAes;\nuint8_t key[16] =\n        { MY_KEY_IS_HERE };\nuint8_t InputText[16] =\n        { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0xa, 0xb, 0xc, 0xd, 0xe, 0xf, 0 };\nAES_init_ctx(&amp;TestAes, key);\nAES_ECB_encrypt(&amp;TestAes, InputText);\nAES_ECB_decrypt(&amp;TestAes, InputText);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now I want to find the 16 byte private key in my binary.</p>\n<p>When I open the binary in a hex editor and search for my key I find all 16 bytes in a row.</p>\n<p>I loaded the binary in Ghidra, installed <a href=\"https://github.com/TorgoTorgo/ghidra-findcrypt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">FindCrypt</a> before and now run the analysis.</p>\n<p>FindCrypt now finds AES_Decrytion_SBox_Inverse and AES_Ecryption_SBox.</p>\n<p>But both are not my AES key but the SBox. How does it go on after that? In all tutorials I find it looks quite simple, because the Functions Finder finds the AES functions - but since the project is Bare Metal this will probably not work.</p>\n<p>I thought FindCrypt looks for some kind of hex pattern which could result in a key...</p>\n<p>I have <a href=\"https://easyupload.io/pbvoyu\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">attached</a> the binary. endian is little, architecture is ARM Cortex (I think?!)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/inNrx.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Ghidra FindCrypt Analysis\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/inNrx.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

You can see the byte patterns it's looking for in its <a href=\"https://github.com/TorgoTorgo/ghidra-findcrypt/blob/master/FindCrypt/data/database.json\" rel=\"noreferrer\">database.json</a>. It has done exactly what it was supposed to do. Your job as a reverse engineer is to look at the cross-references to the tables that it found and see if you can determine the key being passed as argument to the encryption or decryption routines.</p>\n</div>",
