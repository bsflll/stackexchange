Different ARMs have different instruction sets and use overlapping byte encodings for them. <code>objdump</code> from the Android NDK is a perfect match for CPUs used in Android products, and it's free.</p>\n</div>",

You are either going to produce the same file or something that won't work because disassembler does not make task of making changes to compiled code sufficiently easier. I haven't estimated dump completely, but from what I see, it was not supposed to compile as is. Human readable annotation like \"Disassembly of section .plt:\" are not commented as they should be in real assembler sources.</span>",
