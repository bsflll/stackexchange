This can contain code or data and is governed by <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/mm-bad-pointer#paged_code\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the PAGED_CODE macro</a>, among others, at source code level.</p>\n<p>That is, whatever gets stored in that section cannot be accessed at arbitrary IRQLs. Quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the IRQL &gt; APC_LEVEL, the PAGED_CODE macro causes the system to ASSERT.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also see <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/overview-of-windows-memory-space\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> for an entry point into the overall topic.
