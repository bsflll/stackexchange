    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a Ubuntu 18.04 memory dump (entire RAM), and while I was acquiring it with LiME, I had a Python program running. Using Volatility, I want to recover its data structure values which are located in Python program process heap. The <code>linux_proc_map</code> plugin gave me the virtual addresses I should be looking through.</p>\n<p>For now, I am trying to find out how CPython PyObjects appear in memory, but I'm not sure what values to look for, so scanning for specific values will be difficult. I only know the name of the data structure...</p>\n<p>Has anyone else on here tried to recover program data structures from process memory?</p>\n</div>",
