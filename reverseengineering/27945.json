    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>My apologies if this question is very basic. I have found this string in my Android application Binary that was built using the flutter framework. This is a 32 bit ARM library. I found the location of a url string at \"00c88fa0\" located below. I want to find the assembly code that loads and uses this string. I used Ghidra's \"show call trees\" and \"Show references to address\" functionality, but they have been unable to help me. I assume the string is being referenced by a base address + offset calculation. Is there an easy way for me to find this section of the code? Or is it not easily possible because there are too many base + offset calculations that could arrive at my String?</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Mj8ez.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"M\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Mj8ez.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Updated image:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SyyXj.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SyyXj.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

As part of a pen test I am conducting I wanted to intercept the traffic and needed to downgrade the connection to http instead of https. In the past I achieved this by removing the \"s\" in the url and padding the end of the string with a null byte thinking that it would terminate 1 byte early. This time the null byte gets added to the url. So long story short I do believe that this is a counted string. I wanted to find the counting code so that I could fix it and learn.</span>",
