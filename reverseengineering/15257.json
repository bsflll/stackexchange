    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a program written in c++, it's compiled with Visual Studio.</p>\n<p>I have a mini dump file of a running process (process generates it using winapi MiniDumpWriteDump function).</p>\n<p>I also have several memory addresses - they should correspond to addresses of my c++ functions/methods.</p>\n<p>I also have *.pdb file - debug information generated by Visual Studio during compilation of my program.</p>\n<p>Now I need to find out which functions correspond to the addresses.</p>\n<p>Question 1: Do I have enough data? Is minidump, *.pdb file and address is enough to find out function name (and it's location in source code)?</p>\n<p>Question 2: I need to automate this process. I will have to write a script (hope it will be a python script) which will do the job. Can anyone suggest appropriate python tools?</p>\n<p>(Originally I posted this question on stackoverflow, but looks like it's better suited here)</p>\n</div>",

If you only need to automate it but no particular requirements for programming it on your own, I would suggest just using windbg with some scripts (maybe PyKd framework).</p>\n</div>",
