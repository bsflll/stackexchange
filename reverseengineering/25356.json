    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am exploring MacOS Deckset app.\nIt has a trial version available on the official website.\nBut there's a cracked version available on torrent trackers.</p>\n<p>I want to know what was changed by the people who cracked that app: strings? symbols? few assembly instructions?</p>\n<p>Both (genuine and cracked) versions are available as .DMG installers.\nI've extracted Deckset.app containers from both of them.</p>\n<p>Now, I'm able to explore <code>Deckset.app/Contents/MacOS/Deckset</code> binary in <code>Hopper</code> tool.\nBut as the cracked version is patched, I want to understand what actually was patched.\nFor this, I used <code>radiff2</code> tool from <code>Radare2</code> toolset:</p>\n<pre><code>radiff2 genuine.app/Contents/MacOS/Deckset cracked.app/Contents/MacOS/Deckset  &gt; bin_diff.txt\n</code></pre>\n<p>It gave me output like this:</p>\n<pre><code>0x00000e98 901e =&gt; 101c 0x00000e98\n0x0000201c 109a =&gt; 9097 0x0000201c\n0x0027d486 770c =&gt; 585e 0x0027d486\n0x0027d48b 04 =&gt; 03 0x0027d48b\n0x0027d493 2c =&gt; 24 0x0027d493\n0x0027d49a 511a =&gt; 5097 0x0027d49a\n0x0027d49d 00 =&gt; 01 0x0027d49d\n0x0027d49f 05 =&gt; 00 0x0027d49f\n0x0027d4a3 fe00010000 =&gt; 07fade0c02 0x0027d4a3\n0x0027d4aa 53bcfade0c02 =&gt; 507300020100 0x0027d4aa\n0x0027d4b2 50ee =&gt; 0000 0x0027d4b2\n0x0027d4b5 020500 =&gt; 0000b3 0x0027d4b5\n0x0027d4b9 01 =&gt; 00 0x0027d4b9\n0x0027d4bb 00 =&gt; 30 0x0027d4bb\n0x0027d4be 012e =&gt; 0003 0x0027d4be\n0x0027d4c2 0060 =&gt; 027e 0x0027d4c2\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, when I open \"genuine\" app in Hopper, and search for either <code>0x00000e98</code>, or <code>901e</code>, or <code>101c</code>, it gives nothing useful.</p>\n<p>E.g. when I do <code>Menu &gt; Navigate &gt; Go to Address or Symbol</code> and enter <code>0x00000e98</code>, it gives me such segment:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/D9Bb2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/D9Bb2.png\"/></a>\nI don't see nor <code>901e</code>, neither <code>101c</code> in this segment.</p>\n<p>What am I doing wrong?\nDo you know better tools for doing this (except IDA Pro, because it's expensive)?</p>\n</div>",
