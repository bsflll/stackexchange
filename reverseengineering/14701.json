    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Novice Android security researcher here. Recently I was tasked with the task/challenge of exposing a certain app's hardcoded local keystore password.</p>\n<p>I've decompiled it with JEB2 and obviously within huge mess of code I can see various references to the cryptographic algorithms, hashing and encoding routines (OCRA1, HMAC, SHA1, AES, base64 etc.) utilized in the classes and methods of the prototypes, related calls etc.</p>\n<p>Now, from the experienced pentester's viewpoint would it be possible to reveal the hardcoded pass through app's heap dumps or maybe traffic interception with the BurpSuite's mitm attack via fake certificate between the client/server point? If so, how would I then discern it from the ocean of other strings?!</p>\n<p>If that's not possible what is the proper way to proceed from then on taking into account lack of experience in reading java or reverse engineering crypto stuff?</p>\n<p>Regards</p>\n</div>",
