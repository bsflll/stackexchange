IDC files are generally cross-compatible across versions of IDA (though sometimes needing minor changes). IDB files are designed to only work with the current and more recent versions of IDA, which I suspect is the issue you are having.</span>",

However, it should work by having your colleague generate the IDC and both of you working on the subset of IDC functions available on IDA 5.x. Also, I have used IDA inside WINE and CrossOver Office. Since at least IDA 5.x. So you should be fine running any of those versions, albeit not natively.</span>",
