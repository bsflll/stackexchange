    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I recently bought a Sharp EL-9950 graphing calculator (which is considerably rare compared to the other brands). I have a copy of its OS upgrade file, which is essentially ROM dump for the new version (or at least I think it is).</p>\n<p>I searched everywhere, but I couldn't find any info about the hardware of this calculator, and it was too expensive for me to try opening its case.</p>\n<p>How do I go about reverse engineering the ROM dump (exactly 1MB) to determine at least which instruction set it uses (so I can format it with my own ROM someday, I guess?)</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div>",
