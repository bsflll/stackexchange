You can't download it form anywhere, only generate if from an Android app you have the source code. 2. .aab files only make sense for uploading into Play Store. Therefore the use cases for modifying an .aab file are very limited. May be you should elaborate a bit more what you want to achieve and there is an easier way you have not noticed.</span>",
