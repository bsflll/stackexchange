    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've been reversing an asm checksum code for the last days, and I've managed to understand how it completly works, except for one instruction; <strong>ldrh</strong></p>\n<p>The info I've been able to found says that it's basically a ldr instruction which loads a half word (2 bytes). But the problem is that the ldr() instruction has a lot of variants and there's no info about how this one would be wrote in pseudo C.</p>\n<p>Specifically my instruction is:<br/>\n<strong>ldrh  r3,[r12,r3]</strong><br/>\nIf it were a normal ldr, the pseudo code will be<br/>\n<strong>r3 = r12[r3];</strong><br/>\n(r12 is an addres to a memory place so I don't understand what it really does..Does it loads the value at r12+r3 into r3?</p>\n</div>",
