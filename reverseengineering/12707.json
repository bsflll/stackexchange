It says \"Unknown Obfuscator\".\nAlso tried iMPROVE and it says that there is a 97% chance that it is a DotWall obfuscated assembly, but deobfuscation doesn't work!</p>\n<p>Here is the DLL:\n<a href=\"http://uploadboy.me/87n60oy2ifiw/Assembly-CSharp.zip.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://uploadboy.me/87n60oy2ifiw/Assembly-CSharp.zip.html</a></p>\n<p>Can someone say how can I deobfuscate it? or at least which obfuscator has produced this DLL?</p>\n</div>",
