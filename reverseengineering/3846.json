No OS-level drivers beyond basic serial, so all the decoding is done in the app.</p>\n<p>I have the ability to capture bidirectional wire traffic and generally snoop on the serial port (good ol' Sysinternals <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/bb896644.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Portmon</a> to logfile, with some perl post-processing (parsing out <code>IRP_MJ_(READ|WRITE)</code> events) to get raw byte dumps).</p>\n<p>From this I've gotten the basic wire protocol details (baud rate, settings, etc)</p>\n<p>Messages appear to be in the format <code>{ $body }\\n</code>, where sent commands are usually a single byte or 2 in the body, responses are much more complex.</p>\n<p>They span several messages, and appear to have additional structure, something like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Header (<code>{IDCOMPLIANCE ...}</code>)</li>\n<li>Metadata?

I found USBpcap (hxxp://desowin.org/usbpcap/) which can generate wireshark traces, but digging though it for the actual serial data was tedious, and capture isn't realtime.</p></li>\n<li><p>What would people suggest my next moves be (keep hacking at black-box csv/wire-data, decompile, or debug?)</p></li>\n<li><p>If debug, is ollydbg capable of breakpointing on serial port read (and where might I find n00b-level docs on how to do so?)</p></li>\n<li><p>If decompile, what approach should I take (forward from port read, or back from csv/strings? Again, pointers to how to do that would be great.)</p></li>\n<li><p>If black-box, any inspiration as to the structure of the <code>{DL20...}</code> messages in particular?</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I suspect it breaks down something like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>DL20</code> - not sure what the 20 indicates. Length of some kind?</p></li>\n<li><p><code>I000020</code> - clearly some sort of index/address</p></li>\n<li><p><code>V</code> - Marker for 'vector'/array data to follow?</p></li>\n<li><p><code>FF140200DE070900010001000D000100</code> Entry #1</p></li>\n<li><p><code>FF0C0200DE076E006E000300A5075904</code> Entry #2</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each entry contains a date (dd/mm/yy, probably in a weird format like 'fractional number of fortnights since first summer solstice following the Fall of Rome'), and a bunch of integer and fractional (fixed point rather than float, probably)</p>\n<p>Some fields are I think 16 bit, and little-endian (Entry#2 last 4 bytes is 0x0459 which matches observed data)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>C953</code> - Not sure, maybe checksum or CRC? Tried a few obvious standards taht don't match it though, and might be over the whole packet or just the data.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr/>\n<p>[Apologies for the broken links, need more rep to add &gt;2 apparently]</p>\n</div>",
