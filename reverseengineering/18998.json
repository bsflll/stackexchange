The general term for this is IPC (Interprocess Communications). On Windows, the following <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/ipc/interprocess-communications\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">forms of IPC</a> are commonly used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>COM </li>\n<li>Window messages (simple messages for small data amounts, <code>WM_COPYDATA</code> for bigger amounts)</li>\n<li>File mapping, or named shared memory  </li>\n<li>Shared memory</li>\n<li>Pipes (named or anonymous)</li>\n<li>Sockets (e.g. TCP/IP)</li>\n<li>passing info via command-line arguments (though this is not really IPC)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Less common but still possible:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clipboard</li>\n<li>Mailslots</li>\n<li>RPC (remote procedure call)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Which one is actually used is difficult to say with limited information you provided. Using an API monitor, as suggested by @dsasmblr may give you some hints. You can also just debug or RE the executable which processes user input and see what is being done with the entered information.</p>\n</div>",
