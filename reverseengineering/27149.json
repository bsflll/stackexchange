    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So I run radare2 from the command line with <code>r2 -</code> and attempt to display the help with the <code>?</code> command. I read this line which says:</p>\n<p><code> ?[??][expr]             Help or evaluate math expression</code></p>\n<p>I am not sure how to read this. I assume the first <code>?</code> is <code>Help</code> command. And the rest <code>[??][expr]</code> is evaluate math expression. However, something like this <code>?? 0xa</code> does not return anything. So, my question is how to correctly interpret this output from the help.</p>\n</div>",
