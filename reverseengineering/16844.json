The specific way that you're searching for is called Stack Telescoping and you can print it like this:</p>\n<pre><code>pxr @ esp\n</code></pre>\n<p>Use <code>sp</code>, <code>esp</code>, and <code>rsp</code> according to your system.  </p>\n<p><code>pxr</code> stands for <strong>P</strong>rint he<strong>X</strong>adecimal <strong>R</strong>eferences, you can see its description by using <code>px?</code>: </p>\n<pre><code>[0x7f8a672ee4]&gt; px?\n&lt;...truncated...&gt;\npxr[j]            show words with references to flags and code\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here are some other options to print the stack using radare2:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>pxa @ rsp</code> - to show annotated hexdump</li>\n<li><code>pxw @ rsp</code> - to show hexadecimal words dump (32bit)</li>\n<li><code>pxq @ rsp</code> - to show hexadecimal quad-words dump (64bit)</li>\n<li><code>ad@r:SP</code> - to analyze the stack data  </li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

If you want a view similar to PEDA's you can use <code>e dbg.slow = true</code> and then use <code>Vpp</code>. That's way you'll see a Visual Mode as well as Stack Telescoping.</span>",
