I managed to install <code>tinycc</code> with the small modification of the <code>Makefile</code> and the installation script did not complain.</p>\n<p>But, once I tried to use the script <code>miasm/example/disas_and_graph.py</code>, the CFG stop suddenly shortly after the entrypoint.</p>\n<p>Strangely, I installed Miasm on a 32bits virtual machine and it worked fine and displayed the whole CFG properly.

What is really misleading, is that the elf-64 is handled but the disassembler fail to recognize the amd64 opcodes.</p>\n<p>So, this behavior is \"normal\" even if no error message is issued.</p>\n<p>The good news, is that the main contributor of miasm is working on a second version of the software (<code>miasm2</code>) which is handling amd64 (and with a lot of new features).</p>\n</div>",
