That's not possible with any debugger. If you mean you want to set a breakpoint <strong>at a particular address</strong> that only fires when <code>eax</code> is <code>1</code>, that's doable.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Set a breakpoint on some instruction with <code>F2</code>.</li>\n<li>Right-click on the instruction and choose <code>Edit breakpoint...</code>.</li>\n<li>Write <code>EAX == 1</code> in the <code>Condition</code> field on the dialog box.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <code>Edit breakpoint</code> dialog is described in great detail in the IDA manual. Search for \"Edit breakpoint\"; there are several pages describing it.</p>\n</div>",
