Instead, it emits an OBJ file with IL in it. It bears\nrepeating: this IL is not the same IL that the .NET runtime uses.\nWhile .NET IL is standardized and documented, the IL used with LTCG is\nundocumented and subject to change from version to version of the\ncompiler.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>... and concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>OBJ files produced when using LTCG aren't standard COFF format OBJs.\nAgain, this isn't a problem for most people, but if you examine OBJ\nfiles with tools like dumpbin, you're simply out of luckâ€”it won't\nwork.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Are there - by now - any tools that let me disassemble the code inside these \"IL .obj\" files and let me access things like symbols, relocation tables, etc.? Even IDA Pro seems to have problems with these kind of files. It identifies them as \"COFF (Microsoft CIL bytecode)\" and doesn't show any meaningful disasembly...</p>\n</div>",
