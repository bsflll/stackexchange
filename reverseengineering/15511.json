Only a handful of the class members are initialized in the provided  function. The function might be called by other initialization code, where other members are initialized.</p>\n<p>I often define a struct big enough to hold all members I encounter of a single class, where unknown portions are either undefined or a single array labelled <code>unknown_X</code>. As I recognise more members the class structures become more complete and clear, as well as additional meanings are given to most members.</p>\n<p>While doing that, you should keep in mind classes might inherit one another, so class structures might be contained as other class structures and be used independently at the same time. I often combine and merge class structures as I go and when I'm confident enough structures are indeed shared. I find that reversing initialization code is very helpful in mapping classes and their structures.</p>\n</div>",
