If you find a way to alter your \"copy\" of the code segment, this alteration would affect the other process as well; you could use this to cause the other process (which might have higher privileges) to execute your code. However, i wouldn't know how to turn this into an exploit; once you have the rights to modify segment descriptors, there's not much left that the other process can do but you can't.</span>",
