    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I downloaded radare 2.5 for windows. I am trying to debug a binary on windows with radare and have tried the following:</p>\n<pre><code>radare2 -d a.exe\nfork_and_ptraceme/CreateProcess: The request is not supported.\nw32_dbg_maps/w32_OpenProcess: The parameter is incorrect.\n[w] Cannot open 'dbg://a.exe' for writing.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I also tried to use gdbserver and use radare to connect remotely. It connects but it gets stuck and I am not able to give it any commands or see anything.</p>\n<p>I am going to try windbg remote as well, however, I am starting to wonder, do I need to install another set of libraries or another type of debugger, or do some additional configuration to make debugging work with radare2. Any suggestions?</p>\n</div>",

The link is to the 32-bit application, but you need to open <a href=\"http://radare.mikelloc.com/get/2.5.0/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the directory</a> and download the 64-bit radare2 version.\nJust encountered this issue myself.</p>\n</div>",
