It was too large of a binary to do during the challenge so I am doing it now.</p>\n<p>I am having trouble finding the <em>main function</em> because the entry function is not the same as if this was written in C and compiled with GCC. I was wondering how I could go about finding the main function and if there were any resources that could assist me in my endeavors. </p>\n</div>",
