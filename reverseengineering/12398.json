If you try to decode it like a regular base64 string, you end up with :</p>\n<pre><code>37 7a bc af 27 1c 00 03 d8 a0 33 34 30 78 00 00       7z..............\n</code></pre>\n<p>You recognize the '<strong>7z</strong>' magic of a 7zip file, and it's indeed a 30Ko archive containing a single file of 363Ko named 'default'. The file is password-protected though, so you could try to either brute-force it or reverse the application generating this file to find the password.</p>\n</div>",
