AFAIK it can even try to build a Visual Studio Solution (<code>.sln</code>) file from your input which should be what you look for.</p>\n<p><strong>But</strong> under certain circumstances some information is lost during the compilation process.<br/>\nYou would have to manually fix those errors. For example anonymous functions can confuse a decompiler easily. And of course - if the developer tries to protect his application there are various techniques like obfuscation which would make your life harder.</p>\n<p><strong>So to answer your questions directly:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>In most cases there isn't a 100% <code>Plug and Play</code> solution. You will have to fix a few things yourself if you want to have a recompilable project.</li>\n<li>Since <code>best ..</code> is very subjective here are a few suggestions (in no particular order):\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy</a> (free, open source)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/reflector/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/reflector/</a> (paid)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/</a> (free?)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ilspy.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://ilspy.net/</a> (free, open source)</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
