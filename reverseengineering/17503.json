    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>In C a static function is scoped to a source file so you can have multiple static functions with the same name as long as they are in different files.</p>\n<p>Does IDA have a way to express this or do I have to add a prefix to names myself? I know I can mark functions as being static and associate a sourcefile with a range (using <code>add_sourcefile</code>) but this doesn't seem to resolve naming conflicts.</p>\n</div>",
