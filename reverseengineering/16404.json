It includes an ability to inject the recompiled code, and has the same interface as ILSpy. Use \"Edit Method\" option on the method you're editing, then \"Build\" and save the assembly. You won't need Reflexil then.</p>\n</div>",

I would suggest, instead of doing != null and !cracked, just do if(false).</p>\n</div>",
