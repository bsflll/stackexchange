    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Long time ago I noticed that using</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>set follow-fork-mode child</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>in GDB on FreeBSD doesn't really work.\nThis problem occurs very often with some challenges on various Capture The Flag contests.\nFor example, a server will spawn a child which would handle the connection.\nThe child code has a vulnerability which I would like to debug, but gdb just never follows\nthe childs execution and I can't really observe the vulnerability being triggered.</p>\n<p>So far, I've solved this problem in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Making a connection, waiting for a child to spawn and than attaching GDB to it.</p>\n<p>This works since the spawned child has it's own PID to which I can attach, but is rather painful since first I have to make a connection from one session, attach with GDB in another, and then send the payload/continue the connection in the first.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Patching the binary after the fork call to continue the execution in the parent process instead of the child.</p>\n<p>This is also painful since then I have to restart the whole parent process to create another debugging session.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are some other tricks that can be employed, but these are enough to illustrate my point.</p>\n<p>Now I know there have been some limitations on FreeBSD in the past regarding this but has anything improved?</p>\n<p>Is there any way to patch GDB to add this functionality? Any suggestions for an easier way of overcoming this?</p>\n</div>",
