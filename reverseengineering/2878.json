    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>The code that I'm analyzing calls fork and I was wondering if there was a way to trace the child process that is created. I've looked in <em>The IDAPro Book</em> and there's nothing on the topic (if there is I can't find it). Perhaps it's not possible with IDAPro. Also if it's helpful I'm debugging an elf executable remotely from a windows machine. Thanks in advance.</p>\n<p>some basic documentation\n<a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/index.shtml\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/index.shtml</a></p>\n</div>",

I assume you're using remote GDB through IDA. The debugger will attach itself to a specific process, and that process only. Fortunately, GDB has an option to follow child processes, using the debugging option:</p>\n<p><code>set follow-fork-mode child</code> </p>\n<p>Type that in the GDB prompt at the bottom of the Output Window in IDA, and the debugger should follow the path of execution of the forked child process. </p>\n<p>See <a href=\"http://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Forks.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a> for more info on debugging forks.</p>\n</div>",
