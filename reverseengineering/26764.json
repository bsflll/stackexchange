    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I wanted to ask your assistance: Where can I find advanced ctfs (that hopefully contain solutions) regarding binary/kernel exploitation? I am interested on finding x86_64 linux/windows/arm64 that consist of userland or kernel(lkm or drivers) exploitation (overcoming modern mitigations such as \"shadow stacks\" or different control flow guards(cfg/acg/others..) and grooming tricks and similar are huge pluses).\nWhat I am mostly looking for is ctfs that imitate mundane situations or applications, including but not limited to: common errors, uaf (even double free), bad custom memory layouts(for instance custom mmap implementations), different leaks, finding primitives, disclosures and similar -- all of it either in userland or appropriate kernel level.</p>\n<p>Sadly I could not find anything that consists of what I call \"modern world\", with modern mitigations that is not aimed at basic corrupting the stack/heap, basic usage of tools or concepts, or anything that basically teaches the basics (corrupting/polluting, got/plt overwrites, simple ropper and similar basics - but something that goes beyond that, that can teach \"real skills\"). I am looking to expand my knowledge and I am pretty sure your answers would help a lot of people that are wondering about the same too, and couldn't find what they were looking for.</p>\n<p>Note: I mentioned solutions because the amount of knowledge and tricks that can be taught just by reading a write up is huge, especially way of thinking, grooming, way of reversing and approaching the situation and similar. I learn a lot from reading write ups but I couldn't find ones that are above the \"beginner\" level.</p>\n<p>I am looking to expand my knowledge and I am pretty sure your answers would help a lot of people that are wondering about the same too, and couldn't find what they were looking for.</p>\n<p>Just to be clear again: I am not referring to dep/aslr/canaries and similar(those were awesome a decade ago). What I am looking for is the step after that.</p>\n<p>Doesn't have to be binary, can be firmware, lkm, drivers, handles/pipes and similar.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much and have a great week.</p>\n</div>",
