    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p><strong>Context</strong></p>\n<p>I am trying to decrypt a game for its assets for learning purposes. I have extracted out said assets from the game package, they are in formats of <code>.json</code>, <code>.png</code> and <code>.lua</code>. However, they are encrypted. Inspecting the files in hex view, I noticed something particularly interesting: all of their bytes start with <code>4448 4741 4d45 53</code>, which in ascii corresponds to the publisher of the game.</p>\n<p><strong>What I have done</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Ran a <code>strings</code> command on the game binary to extract all the strings out, one of which should be the decryption key</p></li>\n<li><p>Wrote a python script to try each of the possible keys on these encrypted assets using AES, XXTEA and XOR. The key is validated if the decryption result is a valid json/lua text file. </p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Usually these two steps alone would find me the key for many other games, but this time to no avail. </p>\n<p>What other steps can I do to try to decrypt these assets statically without having to gdb into runtime? </p>\n<p>** The link to assets can be found here <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7pqhvpsa0ems0q9/AAA8lHrudeix3hJ0Rz2tXPSxa?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7pqhvpsa0ems0q9/AAA8lHrudeix3hJ0Rz2tXPSxa?dl=0</a></p>\n</div>",

Remember the encryption key might be any binary byte sequence as well, or even generated on runtime, so you can't really assume to find it using <code>strings</code>.</p>\n</div>",
