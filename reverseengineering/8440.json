    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've got a procedure in IDA Pro with a few local stack variables, but part of them belong to an array. I would like to define the array, but pressing <code>*</code> (Create Array) fails, and pressing <code>Y</code> (Set Type) just brings up the type for the procedure, not the variable.</p>\n<p>The same happens if I hover over an instance of its usage rather than its definition in the function prologue.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough I seem to be able to rename them just fine.</p>\n<p>How do I define a range of local variables to be an array; or, why is it not working for me?</p>\n</div>",
