    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm new to reverse engineering. So I decided to start with some game files in my computer. The main goal was to understand how hex editor used to identify files and extract needed data.</p>\n<p>In my case I have 2 <code>.ebx</code> files and Chunk ID file. The goal is to use the <code>ebx</code> to extract the data in the chunk file but I am confused. I used 010 editor template to see whether it will find any wav/mp3 data, and it did. I appreciate if someone can explain some of the stuff here and give me some good tuts where I can learn this kind reversal?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mega.nz/file/rkJWhTpB#c0v5bJfcsriYhK18TcAJZd9Uj4KQiae8u_R2y5ziyUs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chunk ID file</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mega.nz/file/LspmCKjJ#iTHgpTS0TDteXZGwKVjEeDiFPdvj0HlEKTa2oXARznU\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ebx File audio</a></p>\n</div>",
