I'm really so dumb in the Linux</p>\n</div>",

If you really want to study this, you'll probably need to look at the smali code and not try to turn it back into Java, at least not until you can find meaningful patterns.   Typically what is most accessible to analysis is interaction with the system libraries, which can't distorted too much without measured more extreme than usually taken.  What goal are you trying to accomplish, anyway?</span>",
