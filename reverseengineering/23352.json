Also, since you mentioned pseudo-code (which IDA does <i>not</i> generate), I replaced <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ida\">ida</a> by <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hexrays\">hexrays</a>. The latter is the plugin <i>for IDA</i> providing decompilation (and generating pseudo-code).</span>",

The pseudocode will then change to reflect the changes you have done (or simply the optimizations done by the Hex-Rays decompiler). Typical changes you will see are the number of function arguments that will be adjusted to be more correct.</p>\n<p>Usually what I do if I encounter pseudocode that seems incorrect in terms of function arguments, I will click around and \"peek\" into the different problematic functions before I go back to the initial function I started with and re-analyze it. The pseudocode will then look way better and be easier to work with.</p>\n<p>And if you would like to re-analyze the whole binary you coud always do that by going to <code>Options -&gt; General -&gt; Analysis -&gt; Reanalyze program</code>, and <code>Ctrl+F5</code> to decompile all functions.</p>\n</div>",
