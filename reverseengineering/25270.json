I am doing this via an arduino uno.</p>\n<p>The problem i am having is that when i connect to it via serial (baud 115200) i get the correct output from the device but any key i press seems to come up as a random character. Is there a setting that i need to change in putty? What am i missing?</p>\n<p>The following screenshot is just holding down the \"h\" key.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9xzUL.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9xzUL.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
