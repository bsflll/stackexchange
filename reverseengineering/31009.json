    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a 32 bits exe that works only when there is a specific usb flash disk inserted. On my new laptop, I only have a single USB port, so I want to make it works without the original key, or from a \"subst\" directory, or from a virtual CD ROM / Hard drive . Of course, I can use a USB Hub to plug the key and my mouse, but it will be less funnier.</p>\n<p>I load the EXE with x32dbg, I activated the ScyllaHide to prevent debugging detection and I disabled ASLR . A few set of instruction after the OEP, I can trace a loop that modify the code : the EDI point to code after the loop, and when stepping into the loop, I can see the asm code is modified (there is a few of xor and shr ops in the loop). This process is repeated several times. It is not a code unpacking routine, it looks more than decrypting.</p>\n<p>With Scylla I can dump the executable after theses first decryption routine, with a OEP setted just after the execution of the decrypt routines, so there is no need to run them each time I debug the exe.</p>\n<p>But the exe seems to do more dynamic code loading / decrypting during its early execution, and at some time I trace some unusuall call like : <code>call dword ptr ds:[4356A0]</code> . And the address is different from a run to an other. If I set the EOP after this routines, the program crash.</p>\n<p>So i'm unable to set accurate breakpoints on the code, because the address is changing on each execution.\nFor example, at first run, I set a bp on</p>\n<p><code>022C5DA2 | E8 E393FFFF                   | call &lt;JMP.&amp;GetDiskFreeSpaceExA&gt;                   |</code></p>\n<p>And when reloading the exe, the address of this instruction has changed :</p>\n<p><code>022B5DA2 | E8 E393FFFF                   | call &lt;JMP.&amp;GetDiskFreeSpaceExA&gt;                   |</code></p>\n<p>From a debugging session to an other, all my breakpoints and labels are lost (they are marked as \"Inactive\" with no assembly code). So it makes the analysis task quite difficult.</p>\n<p>Is there a way with x32dbg, or eventually IDA Free, to fix this behavior ? The exe itself is quite small (300Kb)</p>\n</div>",

I am not going to go through the full reversing process, but if you can point me to exactly where you're looking, I can tell you why the addresses are different per execution. I am going to make an educated guess that the call is being made to an address in memory that was allocated during the execution, and therefore has a different address each time. I can't help you unless you're more specific, however.</span>",
