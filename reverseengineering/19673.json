    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Below code is from the IDA.</p>\n<p>This is the code before the parsing function:</p>\n<pre><code>movzx   eax, byte ptr [rbp+nineth_char+3]\nmovsx   eax, al\nmov     edi, eax\ncall    sub_898\n</code></pre>\n<p>And this is the code of the parsing function:</p>\n<pre><code>push    rbp\nmov     rbp, rsp\nmov     eax, edi\nmov     [rbp+var_14], al\nmovsx   eax, [rbp+var_14]\nmov     [rbp+var_1], al\nmov     [rbp+var_2], 250\nmovzx   edx, [rbp+var_1]\nmovzx   eax, [rbp+var_2]\nadd     eax, edx\nnop\npop     rbp\nretn\n</code></pre>\n<p>The argument of this function is the ascii value of the nineth char from the argument of the binary file. This value is added to the value from [rbp+var_2] which is 250. And this function returns the result of the adding.</p>\n<p>This is the code after the parsing function:</p>\n<pre><code>mov     edx, eax\nmovzx   eax, [rbp+var_35] ; 101\ncmp     dl, al\njz      short loc_F6\n</code></pre>\n<p>Result is compared with 101 value and when ZF flag is set the processor will jump to the next label.</p>\n<p>The equation is: ascii_value_of_char + 250 = 101, but the ascii value of character can't be a negative number. So is my understanding of this code is good or not? If not, could you tell me what am I doing wrong?</p>\n</div>",

This makes your equation a bit different:</p>\n<pre><code>(ascii_value_of_char + 250) &amp; 0xff = 101\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which is definitely solvable, and the ascii value of char in this case is 'k'.
