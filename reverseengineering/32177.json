The thing I've struggling a bit now it the <code>First Thunk</code> and <code>Original First Thunk</code> fields. To understand the difference between them I've read this post and that article. To test the problem \"live\" I've opened said <code>shell32.dll</code> or <code>notepad.exe</code> files in <code>PE-bear</code> and <code>IDA</code> BUT that appears the there is NO <code>import binding</code> in case of that files in contrast to what the articles say. Here are my question now:</p>\n<p>Why there is NO <code>import binding</code> in these files?</p>\n<p>Here are the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42413937/why-pe-need-original-first-thunkoft\">first</a> and the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180103163005/https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100318-00/?p=14563\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">second</a> article.</p>\n<p>Please don't down-vote the question if it appears to lame because I'm just newbie in the topic.</p>\n</div>",
