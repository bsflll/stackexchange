If you disassemble your shellcode, you get:</p>\n<pre><code>0000000000004028 &lt;shellcode&gt;:\n    4028:   bb 00 00 00 00          mov    $0x0,%ebx\n    402d:   b8 01 00 00 00          mov    $0x1,%eax\n    4032:   cd 80                   int    $0x80\n</code></pre>\n<p>A first <code>mov</code> to set <code>ebx</code> to zero (the return code), then a second <code>mov</code> to set <code>eax</code> to the id of the <code>exit</code> syscall, and finally it trigger the system call.</p>\n<p>Second, this shellcode is obviously designed for a 32-bit architecture. And, you have to know that the syscall numbers are different between i386 and amd64.</p>\n<p>So, my recommendation would be that you compile your program with the option <code>-m32</code> to ensure that you have a full 32-bit program (and not a mix between 64-bit and 32-bit).</p>\n<p>Third, you need to be sure that you compile with <code>-zexecstack</code> in order to be able to execute the code in case it is stored on the stack.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is no evidence that getting <code>ret + 2</code> will set your pointer in front of the saved <code>eip</code>. You'd better write:</p>\n<pre><code>int main()\n{\n    char shellcode[] = \"\\xbb\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\xb8\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\xcd\\x80\";\n\n    (*(void(*)()) shellcode)();\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
