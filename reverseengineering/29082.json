    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I tried Javascript scripting on WinDbg (TTD specifically); but even in simple example I get error\n<code>Unable to get property 'Debugger' of undefined or null reference</code>.\nLine was simply <code>var ctl = host.namespace.Debugger.Utility.Control;</code> but it does not work.\nDoes TTD have Debugger property? I cannot find any specific document about scripting for TTD; so I assume they have the same interface with regular session. How can we send commands to debugger from a script in TTD sessions?</p>\n</div>",

So if that line is in your initializeScript function or one that is called from initializeScript namespace doesn't exist yet.</p>\n</div>",
