Where is documentation about the specific structure of this header and data?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XLTGR.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"One Dotnet Resource\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XLTGR.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>For reference, here is the hash of the file in the screenshots above:\n40cd96e25835eeba956645398ed73a0f0e14563375530fa5f2db3bcf44dd88d7</p>\n</div>",

As dotnet's runtime is open-source (dotnet/corert) you can use the constant you provided to find the details within its repository. This constant resides in RuntimeResourceSet.cs and is linked at <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/blob/master/src/System.Private.CoreLib/shared/System/Resources/RuntimeResourceSet.cs#L98\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">github.com/dotnet/corert/blob/master/src/System.Private.CoreLib/…</a>.</span>",
