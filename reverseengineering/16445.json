I'm trying to figure out this for a while but just can't find a good reason. IDA seems very complete to me, but there is still people that seem to hate ida.</span>",

IDA is GUI-oriented and Radare2 is CLI-oriented. Both have advantages and drawbacks, but the fact you prefer one or the other is more a matter of taste.</span>",

I mean, I see the taste point of view but I can't see where exactly IDA and r2 fail from each other. Thank you very much for the patience though, I know these kind of question may sound a bit cheesy for some, very appreciate your help!</span>",
