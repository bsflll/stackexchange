I would like to build a malware detection system based on the assembly language used by these files, by using machine learning. The language that I would like to choose for extracting the assembly language is C++. I used objdump from Linux, but sometimes as a mnemonic, it is returned the word bad because it could not have been found.</p>\n<p>Could you please suggest me packages in C++ that could help me to extract the assembly language of multiple files at the same time?</p>\n</div>",
