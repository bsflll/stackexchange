Maybe some tool can say exactly is this vulnerability or just a bug and distinguish the vulns from each other?</p>\n<p>This tools are now known to me:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://msecdbg.codeplex.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">!exploitable</a>     - it's ok, but maybe standalone tool for such purpose exists?</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AddressSanitizer</a> - unfortunately no blackbox testing support(as far as I understood app must be linked with AddressSanitizer and specific routines should be invoked)</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

Though I haven't used it myself and can't say whether or not it's any better than <a href=\"http://msecdbg.codeplex.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">!exploitable</a>.</p>\n<p>If neither Peach Fuzzer nor !exploitable meets your needs and you can't find anything else, you're best off grouping crashes by exception code and exception address (RVA if the program uses ASLR). Then if you have ten variants that share the same exception code and exception address, you only need to manually analyze one of them instead of all ten.</p>\n</div>",
