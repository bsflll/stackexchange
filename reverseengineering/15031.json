Then I can attach a debugger to the .exe that called LoadLibrary and see the unpacked dll dissasembly in my debugger.</p>\n<p>I know IDA has a \"universal unpacker\" plugin, as well as a \"reconstruct\" option. But I have the .dll open in IDA. A .dll can't be executed, so I can't seemingly use these tools.</p>\n<p>I have a memdump of the unpacked .dll, but I had trouble importing it manually in IDA.

I presume there are memory addresses that are given to the .dll user - and that's how the calling works. I've working on figuring out those addresses.</p>\n<p>Any help appreciated!</p>\n</div>",

If you have any problems here, consider asking another question about it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Maybe I can create a custom console application that will load the .dll using LoadLibrary and then somehow call IDA PRO on that running instance?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes. You should be able to use a program which only consists of a LoadLibrary call. LoadLibrary should map the library to your process space and execute its WinMain Function (which I presume is in charge of unpacking). If the unpacking functionality is not included in the .dll itself, you should really reconsider using a memory dump.</p>\n</div>",
