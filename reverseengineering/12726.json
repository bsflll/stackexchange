    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have made a plugin (using IDA Python) that requires the Hex-Rays plugin. </p>\n<p>As per the instructions in the <code>hexrays_sdk</code> folder, I've named my plugin starting with <code>hexrays_</code> to make sure it loads after Hex-Rays is done loading. However, IDA decides to load my plugin earlier, and hence, it never is able to get <code>True</code> for <code>idaapi.init_hexrays_plugin()</code>. </p>\n<p>I've tried renaming my plugin in multiple ways, but still cannot seem to get the plugin to load after Hex-Rays.</p>\n<p>BTW, I think the issue might be related to the fact that I am storing my plugin in <code>%IDAUSR%/plugins</code> rather than <code>%IDADIR%/plugins</code> since I do not want to modify <code>%IDADIR%</code>.</p>\n<p>Is there any kind of workaround to make the plugin load later? Or can I force IDA to load Hex-Rays earlier?</p>\n</div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>When loading plugins, IDA goes through them alphabetically, and tries to load all the plugins.\nWhen loading a plugin, the loader check the plugin flags (<code>idaapi.PLUGIN_PROC</code>, <code>idaapi.PLUGIN_FIX</code>, and so on) to determine if the plugin should be loaded at the current time.\nIf it is to be loaded, the <code>init</code> method is called. A plugin can return <code>PLUGIN_KEEP</code> to remain loaded, or <code>PLUGIN_SKIP</code> to avoid loading.\nAs long as a plugin is not in memory (not yet loaded, or already unloaded,) IDA will try and load it again and again. This is how my <a href=\"https://github.com/tmr232/Sark/blob/master/plugins/plugin_loader.py\" rel=\"nofollow\">plugin loader</a> works.</p>\n<p>So the first thing you need to be sure of, is that you flag your plugin <code>idaapi.PLUGIN_PROC</code>, as this is when Hex-Rays loads (only when a processor module is active.)\nHopefully, this will solve it. If not - you can use <code>idaapi.load_plugin('hexrays')</code> to explicitly load the Hex-Rays plugin. Again, this can only be done when a processor module is active, so be sure to use <code>PLUGIN_PROC</code>.</p>\n</div>",
