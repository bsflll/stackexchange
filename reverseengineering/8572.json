For example</p>\n<pre><code>extern bpcount;\nbpcount++;\nMessage(form(\"%d. hit\\n\"), bpcount);\nreturn (bpcount&gt;500);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will increment the count each time the breakpoint is it, but only break the program after more than 500 hits. Replace the return instruction with <code>return 0</code> if you never want to break, or <code>return 1</code> if you always want to break.</p>\n</div>",
