    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a new client who wants to move their GIS platform support to a new vendor.  The only problem is the outgoing vendor of 15 years does not want to release the source code.  My client made a mistake by outsourcing all their knowledge on their own platform.</p>\n<p>I believe this platform is developed in Java.  I have ability to access the production systems.  I will have all permissions to read and copy files.</p>\n<p>What options do I have to leverage my access to reconstruct the source code?  Do I need to reconstruct it?</p>\n<p>When I take this platform over, I need to be sure that I am able to deliver CRs and ongoing support to my clients' end customers so its very important I also have full understanding of the data flows.  What tools and methodologies can I use?</p>\n</div>",
