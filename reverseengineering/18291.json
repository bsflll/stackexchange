    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've a binary (openend in IDA v7) that uses GUID variables to manipulate something. Whenever I see any variable with GUID data type there always be a <code>_mm_store_si128()</code> or <code>_mm_storeu_si128()</code> functions. I've seen the definitions in <a href=\"https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#text=_mm_store_si128&amp;expand=5186\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Intel Intrinsics Guide</a>. But the article shows that those functions only stores 128-bits of integer data from a variable into memory. The full subroutine is lengthy so I add a small section. Here is an example: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4SzCE.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"_mm_store_si128\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4SzCE.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>In pseudocode:</p>\n<pre><code>if ( RtlGUIDFromString(&amp;GuidString, Guid) &gt;= 0 )\n    {\n      _mm_store_si128(&amp;v18, v10);\n      v18.m128i_i64[1] -= v11;\n      v18.m128i_i64[0] = v10.m128i_i64[0] + 2 * v11;\n      _mm_store_si128((__m128i *)&amp;GuidString, v18);\n      sub_140010DC0(&amp;v18, (__m128i *)&amp;GuidString);\n      v10 = v18;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>So my questions are: Does those functions only copy 128bit data? Is it same as <code>memcpy()</code> or <code>memmove()</code>? If yes then why not IDA shows those functions (later ones)? Are there any hidden deep relation between <code>_mm_store_si128</code> and CPU instructions? </p>\n</div>",

See the function prototypes -</p>\n<pre><code>void _mm_store_si128 (__m128i* mem_addr, __m128i a);\nvoid * memcpy ( void * destination, const void * source, size_t num );\n</code></pre>\n<p>3) It's not really a hidden deep relationship.  In most cases the intrinsics have a 1-1 relationship with CPU instructions.  These are documented in Volume 2 of the <a href=\"https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-sdm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer Manuals</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>_mm_store_si128  &lt;=&gt; MOVDQA with a memory destination\n_mm_storeu_si128 &lt;=&gt; MOVDQU with a memory destination\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
