Stepping through assembly, I get to the following instructions:</p>\n<p>'''76B7CC12 | 8B4C24 54                | mov ecx,dword ptr ss:[esp+54]           |'''</p>\n<p>If I continue to step through the assembly, the program continues to open and start up, but for some reason x32dbg stays on this line. What's going on here? There is not a breakpoint here.</p>\n</div>",
