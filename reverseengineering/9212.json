    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am attempting to disassemble some ARM machine code.\nThe ARM Instruction Set defines the Block Data Transfer instructions (LDM and STM) as below, used for loading and storing to multiple registers at once.</p>\n<p><b>There are two types of addressing modes</b>: for stacks or for other purposes. Maybe I'm not understanding something correctly, but I dont see a way to determine which type an instruction is using from looking at the machine code.</p>\n<p>Does it even matter on the CPU level, and is just a feature to make the assembly programmer's life easier? Since for example LDMFD and LDMIA are equivalent operations (I think?).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/m0ttK.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/blkgF.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RiN8J.jpg\"/></p>\n</div>",

Both are the same, just different points of view.</span>",
