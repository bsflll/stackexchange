I want to understand the code and how it works to hack it and maybe load other ROMs. It has a chip covered in black epoxy resin that may be the microcontroller, and right next to it there's a flash memory, specifically the Winbond branded W25Q64 64Mbit (8 Mbyte) memory. Since I have an EEPROM/Flash reader I extracted the data from it. This is the complete .bin file: <a href=\"https://www.4shared.com/s/fYlAk9898gm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.4shared.com/s/fYlAk9898gm</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/drneW.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"dinax.bin file in HxD\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/drneW.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I dont know what kind of processing I need to do to make readable-like code. The binary contains recognizable data like the index of the games, but is not much more</p>\n</div>",

Can you identify serial output on PCB itself? Maybe there are some other ports/sockets that looks familiar and may be used to solder in/connect the debug/usb/serial to observe SoC on chip under epoxy?</span>",
