    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to reverse engineer a game made with the Unity engine, and usually all of the games's scripts are in the files <code>\\&lt;Game&gt;_Data\\Managed\\Assembly-CSharp.dll</code> and <code>\\&lt;Game&gt;_Data\\Managed\\Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll</code>. However this game doesn't have the assembly dll in the managed directory.</p>\n<p>I tried decompiling the exe with dnSpy but it doesn't  look like there is any .NET assembly inside:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mbWfW.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mbWfW.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I also used Process Monitor to check if the game loads any other .dll but it doesn't.\nHowever, using Cheat Engine's mono dissector function I can see the two assembly dll's and all the classes and methods inside:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/eo3Q2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/eo3Q2.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>So my hypothesis is that the dll is embedded inside the exe somehow and loaded to the memory when the game starts.</p>\n<p>I debugged the game's executable with x64dbg, searched for string references for \"Assembly-Csharp\" and put a breakpoint where I think the dll is loaded, and found this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QOmXt.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QOmXt.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I decompiled this part of the program with ghidra and got this:\n(I also decompiled it with x64dbg and got a similar result minus the variables names)</p>\n<pre><code>undefined * FUN_1401a0070(undefined *puParm1,void **ppvParm2,undefined8 uParm3,undefined8 uParm4)\n\n{\n  char cVar1;\n  char cVar2;\n  char *pcVar3;\n  longlong lVar4;\n  void **ppvVar5;\n  undefined **ppuVar6;\n  int iVar7;\n  bool bVar8\n;  int iVar9;\n  undefined in_stack_ffffffffffffffb8;\n  undefined uVar10;\n  undefined7 in_stack_ffffffffffffffb9;\n  int in_stack_ffffffffffffffc0;\n  undefined8 local_38;\n  ulonglong local_30;\n\n  iVar7 = 0;\n  ppuVar6 = &amp;PTR_s_Managed/Assembly-CSharp.dll_140f42ad8;\n  do {\n    pcVar3 = (char *)FUN_140007820();\n    iVar9 = (int)uParm4;\n    bVar8 = SUB81(uParm3,0);\n    lVar4 = -(longlong)pcVar3;\n    do {\n      cVar2 = *pcVar3;\n      cVar1 = pcVar3[(longlong)(*ppuVar6 + lVar4)];\n      if (cVar2 != cVar1) break;\n      pcVar3 = pcVar3 + 1;\n    } while (cVar1 != '\\0');\n    if (cVar2 == cVar1) {\n      lVar4 = -1;\n      local_30 = 0xf;\n      local_38 = 0;\n      uVar10 = 0;\n      pcVar3 = (&amp;PTR_s_StreamingAssets/OtherAssets/Back_140f42ae8)[(longlong)iVar7];\n      goto code_r0x0001401a012d;\n    }\n    ppuVar6 = ppuVar6 + 1;\n    iVar7 = iVar7 + 1;\n  } while ((longlong)ppuVar6 &lt; 0x140f42ae8);\n  *(undefined8 *)(puParm1 + 0x18) = 0xf;\n  *(undefined8 *)(puParm1 + 0x10) = 0;\n  *puParm1 = 0;\n  FUN_14000b310(puParm1,ppvParm2);\n  goto LAB_1401a01a0;\n  while( true ) {\n    lVar4 = lVar4 + -1;\n    cVar2 = *pcVar3;\n    pcVar3 = pcVar3 + 1;\n    if (cVar2 == '\\0') break;\n    code_r0x0001401a012d:\n    if (lVar4 == 0) break;\n  }\n  FUN_14000a8f0(&amp;stack0xffffffffffffffb8);\n  cVar2 = FUN_1402d8ab0(&amp;stack0xffffffffffffffb8);\n  *(undefined8 *)(puParm1 + 0x18) = 0xf;\n  *(undefined8 *)(puParm1 + 0x10) = 0;\n  ppvVar5 = (void **)&amp;stack0xffffffffffffffb8;\n  if (cVar2 == '\\0') {\n    ppvVar5 = ppvParm2;\n  }\n  iVar9 = -1;\n  bVar8 = false;\n  *puParm1 = 0;\n  FUN_140009870(puParm1,ppvVar5);\n  if (0xf &lt; local_30) {\n    operator_delete((void *)CONCAT71(in_stack_ffffffffffffffb9,uVar10),(MemLabelId)0x3b,bVar8,iVar9,\n      (char *)CONCAT71(in_stack_ffffffffffffffb9,uVar10),in_stack_ffffffffffffffc0);\n  }\n  local_30 = 0xf;\n  local_38 = 0;\n  in_stack_ffffffffffffffb8 = 0;\n  LAB_1401a01a0:\n  if (&amp;DAT_0000000f &lt; ppvParm2[3]) {\n    operator_delete(*ppvParm2,(MemLabelId)0x3b,bVar8,iVar9,\n      (char *)CONCAT71(in_stack_ffffffffffffffb9,in_stack_ffffffffffffffb8),\n      in_stack_ffffffffffffffc0);\n  }\n  *(undefined **)(ppvParm2 + 3) = &amp;DAT_0000000f;\n  ppvParm2[2] = (void *)0x0;\n  *(undefined *)ppvParm2 = 0;\n  return puParm1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And now I'm stuck, I'm looking for a way to extract this dll from the exe (if it's inside at all) and then decompile to C#.\nAlternatively I would like to know if there is a way to decompile the IL code that cheat engine provides with the mono dissector tool, and translate it to readable C#.</p>\n<p>I'm pretty much a novice in reverse engineering so I'm sure I missed a lot of stuff, any help is welcome.</p>\n</div>",
