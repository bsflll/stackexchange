    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>While disassembling a malware binary, I came across several arrays of shorts. The size of each array is 1024 members. I would like to export them to C style arrays, as:</p>\n<pre><code>short array1[1024] = { 2, 5, 8, ... , 4};  /* This is just an example */\n</code></pre>\n<p>I could definitely do <em>Copy/Paste</em> and edit the whole thing by hand. However, it seems to be pretty tedious. I wonder, is there a better approach to achieve it? Could it be done with script/plugin? </p>\n</div>",
