Originally, this operation must have been linked to some arithmetic operation which might have been missed by the decompiler (or optimized out). But, the manipulation of the carry bit on the <code>eflags</code> is still here, so to keep the semantic equivalence of the decompiled program, Hexrays' decompiler is sometimes forced to use such tricks (which appears to come from outer space even if they probably have a perfectly natural cause).</p>\n</div>",

It simply computes if the carry bit of the <code>%eflags</code> must be touched if an operation <code>x &lt;&lt; y</code> would have been performed (but without performing it). Sorry, I should have been clearer... I wrote my answer a bit too quickly. Shame on me. :-/</span>",
