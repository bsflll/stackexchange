    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I just started learning about reconstructing C code from assembler instructions.</p>\n<p>I have the following piece of assembler code:</p>\n<pre><code>mov eax dword ptr [ebp+8]\nadd eax, dword ptr[ebp-4]\nmovsx ecx, byte ptr [eax]\ntest ecx, ecx\njne XXXXX\ncomp dword ptr [ebp-4], ffh\njle XXXX\n</code></pre>\n<p>I want to reconstruct the condition of these lines but I have some problems or things I am not sure about:\nI re-constructed the following:</p>\n<p>Let,<code>ebp+8= param1</code> and <code>ebp-4 = i</code></p>\n<pre><code>if(param1[i]!=’\\0’ || i&lt;=0xff){\n…\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>But I am wondering about this line:</p>\n<pre><code>movsx ecx, byte ptr [eax]\n</code></pre>\n<p>As I understand <code>movsx</code> it moves a signed value into a register and sign-extends it with 1. Thus, <code>ecx</code> shouble look something like <code>0xFFFFFF&lt;eax&gt;</code>. Because only the lower bytes (<code>byte ptr eax</code>) of eax are moved and ecx is 1 extended. Where am I wrong?</p>\n</div>",

It will only extend the sign bit (msb) into the larger register. So, the msb will be extended into all the additional bits -- sxxxxxxx -&gt; sssssssssssssssssssssssssxxxxxxx</p>\n<p>For example, if the byte value pointed to by <code>eax</code> was 1 (0b00000001), <code>ecx</code> would be 1 (0b00000000000000000000000000000001). Similarly, if it was the most positive number possible in a two's complement byte, 127 (0b01111111), <code>ecx</code> would be 127 as well (0b00000000000000000000000001111111). </p>\n<p>Where the sign extension is needed is to maintain the value for negative numbers. If the value were -1 (0b11111111), then if you just simply zero-extended into a 32-bit value you would get 255 (0b00000000000000000000000011111111) in <code>ecx</code> instead of -1 (0b11111111111111111111111111111111).</p>\n</div>",
