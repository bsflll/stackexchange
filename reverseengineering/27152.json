    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am currently learning RE and I came upon this piece of code which made me question whether  stack frames grow upward:</p>\n<pre><code>0x080483f4 &lt;main+0&gt;:    push   ebp\n0x080483f5 &lt;main+1&gt;:    mov    ebp,esp\n0x080483f7 &lt;main+3&gt;:    and    esp,0xfffffff0\n0x080483fa &lt;main+6&gt;:    sub    esp,0x60\n0x080483fd &lt;main+9&gt;:    mov    DWORD PTR [esp+0x5c],0x0\n</code></pre>\n<p>So I understand that from <code>&lt;main+0&gt;</code> until <code>&lt;main+6&gt;</code>, we're setting up the stack frame. Being that the stack grows downwards, it makes sense that we <code>sub esp,0x60</code> thereby allocating 96 bytes for the main function's stack frame.</p>\n<p>My confusion/doubts, however start on <code>&lt;main+9&gt;</code> <code>mov    DWORD PTR [esp+0x5c],0x0</code> which from what I understood stores the value <code>0</code> in a location 4 bytes above the stack pointer and we know that the stack grows downwards, but this operation seems to indicate that the data in the stack frame is stored bottom up.</p>\n<p>So my question is, does that mean that while the stack as a whole grows downwards individual stack frames actually grow upwards?</p>\n</div>",

Say two variables 'a' and 'b' are created which one will be closer to the stack pointer the first or the second variable?</span>",
