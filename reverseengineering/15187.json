    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>IDA has the following function <a href=\"https://github.com/idapython/src/blob/master/python/idc.py#L631\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>idc.MakeNameEx</code></a> which accepts multiple <code>flags</code> values that set properties about the given name (such as whether it's public, auto-generated, etc).</p>\n<p>So far all is good and well, but I would like to do the opposite - <em>get</em> those flag values of a name. I'd like to test if a name is public, weak, auto, etc. but I cant seem to find a <code>idc.NameFlags</code> method anywhere.</p>\n<p>Am I missing something or is this functionality unavailable?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n</div>",
