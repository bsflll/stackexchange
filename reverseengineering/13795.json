I have faked and tested successfully these two apis:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>FusedLocationApi</code> from <code>GoogleApiClient</code></li>\n<li><code>LocationManager</code> including two methods: <code>requestLocationUpdates</code> and <code>getLastKnownLocation</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>But when I test it on some other apps such as Grab, Uber or Google Map, they still display my location correctly. Are they using different APIs? How can I find that out?</p>\n</div>",
