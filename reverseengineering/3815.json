There are several ways to do it (depending on the tools you have or the tools you like the best):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Using <code>readelf</code></p>\n<pre><code>$&gt; readelf -h /bin/ls\nELF Header:\nMagic:   7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \nClass:                             ELF64\nData:                              2's complement, little endian\nVersion:                           1 (current)\nOS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V\nABI Version:                       0\nType:                              EXEC (Executable file)\nMachine:                           Advanced Micro Devices X86-64\nVersion:                           0x1\nEntry point address:               0x40489c\nStart of program headers:          64 (bytes into file)\nStart of section headers:          108264 (bytes into file)\nFlags:                             0x0\nSize of this header:               64 (bytes)\nSize of program headers:           56 (bytes)\nNumber of program headers:         9\nSize of section headers:           64 (bytes)\nNumber of section headers:         27\nSection header string table index: 26\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, the entrypoint address is <code>0x40489c</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Using <code>objdump</code></p>\n<pre><code>$&gt; objdump -f /bin/ls\n\n/bin/ls:     file format elf64-x86-64\narchitecture: i386:x86-64, flags 0x00000112:\nEXEC_P, HAS_SYMS, D_PAGED\nstart address 0x000000000040489c\n</code></pre>\n<p>Again, the entrypoint is <code>0x000000000040489c</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Using <code>gdb</code></p>\n<pre><code>$&gt; gdb /bin/ls\nGNU gdb (GDB) 7.6.2 (Debian 7.6.2-1)\n...\nReading symbols from /bin/ls...(no debugging symbols found)...done.\n(gdb) info files\nSymbols from \"/bin/ls\".\nLocal exec file:\n    `/bin/ls', file type elf64-x86-64.\n    Entry point: 0x40489c\n    0x0000000000400238 - 0x0000000000400254 is .interp\n    0x0000000000400254 - 0x0000000000400274 is .note.ABI-tag\n    0x0000000000400274 - 0x0000000000400298 is .note.gnu.build-id\n    0x0000000000400298 - 0x0000000000400300 is .gnu.hash\n    0x0000000000400300 - 0x0000000000400f18 is .dynsym\n    0x0000000000400f18 - 0x00000000004014ab is .dynstr\n    0x00000000004014ac - 0x00000000004015ae is .gnu.version\n    0x00000000004015b0 - 0x0000000000401640 is .gnu.version_r\n    0x0000000000401640 - 0x00000000004016e8 is .rela.dyn\n    0x00000000004016e8 - 0x0000000000402168 is .rela.plt\n    0x0000000000402168 - 0x0000000000402182 is .init\n    0x0000000000402190 - 0x00000000004028a0 is .plt\n    0x00000000004028a0 - 0x0000000000411f0a is .text\n    0x0000000000411f0c - 0x0000000000411f15 is .fini\n    0x0000000000411f20 - 0x000000000041701c is .rodata\n    0x000000000041701c - 0x0000000000417748 is .eh_frame_hdr\n    ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Entrypoint is still <code>0x40489c</code>.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Locating the <code>main</code> procedure</h2>\n<p>Once the entrypoint is known, you can set a breakpoint on it and start looking for the <code>main</code> procedure. Because, you have to know that all the programs will start by a <code>_start()</code> procedure in charge of initializing the memory for the process and loading the dynamic libraries. In fact, this first procedure is a convention in the Unix World.</p>\n<p>What exactly does this initialization procedure is quite tedious to follow and, most of the time, of no interest at all to understand your program. The <code>main()</code> procedure will only start after all the memory is set-up and ready to go. </p>\n<p>Lets see how to do that (I assume that the executable has been compile with <code>gcc</code>):</p>\n<pre><code>(gdb) break *0x40489c\nBreakpoint 1 at 0x40489c\n(gdb) run\nStarting program: /bin/ls \nwarning: Could not load shared library symbols for linux-vdso.so.1.\n\nBreakpoint 1, 0x000000000040489c in ?? ()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Okay, so we stopped at the very beginning of the executable. At this time, nothing is ready, everything need to be set-up. Let see what are the first steps of the executable:</p>\n<pre><code>(gdb) disas 0x40489c,+50\nDump of assembler code from 0x40489c to 0x4048ce:\n=&gt; 0x000000000040489c:  xor    %ebp,%ebp\n   0x000000000040489e:  mov    %rdx,%r9\n   0x00000000004048a1:  pop    %rsi\n   0x00000000004048a2:  mov    %rsp,%rdx\n   0x00000000004048a5:  and    $0xfffffffffffffff0,%rsp\n   0x00000000004048a9:  push   %rax\n   0x00000000004048aa:  push   %rsp\n   0x00000000004048ab:  mov    $0x411ee0,%r8\n   0x00000000004048b2:  mov    $0x411e50,%rcx\n   0x00000000004048b9:  mov    $0x4028c0,%rdi\n   0x00000000004048c0:  callq  0x4024f0 &lt;__libc_start_main@plt&gt;\n   0x00000000004048c5:  hlt    \n   0x00000000004048c6:  nopw   %cs:0x0(%rax,%rax,1)\nEnd of assembler dump.\n</code></pre>\n<p>What follow the <code>hlt</code> is just rubbish obtained because of the linear sweep performed by <code>gdb</code>. So, just ignore it. What is relevant is the fact that we are calling <code>__libc_start_main()</code> (I won't comment on the <code>@plt</code> because it would drag us out of the scope of the question). </p>\n<p>In fact, the procedure <code>__libc_start_main()</code> initialize the memory for a process running with the <code>libc</code> dynamic library. And, once done, jump to the procedure located in <code>%rdi</code> (which usually is the <code>main()</code> procedure). See the following picture to have a global view of what does the <code>__libc_start_main()</code> procedure [<a href=\"http://dbp-consulting.com/tutorials/debugging/linuxProgramStartup.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1</a>]</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4S3MC.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"ELF complete callgraph\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4S3MC.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>So, indeed, the address of the <code>main()</code> procedure is at <code>0x4028c0</code>. Let disassemble a few instructions at this address:</p>\n<pre><code>(gdb) x /10i 0x4028c0\n   0x4028c0:    push   %r15\n   0x4028c2:    push   %r14\n   0x4028c4:    push   %r13\n   0x4028c6:    push   %r12\n   0x4028c8:    push   %rbp\n   0x4028c9:    mov    %rsi,%rbp\n   0x4028cc:    push   %rbx\n   0x4028cd:    mov    %edi,%ebx\n   0x4028cf:    sub    $0x388,%rsp\n   0x4028d6:    mov    (%rsi),%rdi\n   ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>And, if you look at it, this is indeed the <code>main()</code> procedure. So, this where to really start the analysis.</p>\n<h2>Words of warning</h2>\n<p>Even if this way of looking for the <code>main()</code> procedure will work in most the cases. You have to know that we strongly rely on the following hypothesis:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Programs written in pure assembly language and compiled with <code>gcc -nostdlib</code> (or directly with <code>gas</code> or <code>nasm</code>) won't have a first call to <code>__libc_start_main()</code> and will start straight from the entrypoint. Therefore, for these programs, the <code>_start()</code> procedure is the <code>main()</code> procedure. In fact, it is important to understand that the <code>main()</code> procedure is just a convention introduced by the C language as the first function (written by the programmer) to be run in the program. Of course, you can find this convention replicated in many other languages such as Java, C++, and others. But, all these languages derive from C.</p></li>\n<li><p>We also strongly rely on a knowledge on the way <code>__libc_start_main()</code> works. And, how this procedure has been designed by the <code>gcc</code> team. So, if the program you are analyzing has been compiled with another compiler, you may have to investigate a bit further about this compiler and how it perform the set-up of the memory before running the <code>main()</code> procedure.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Anyway, you should now be able to track down a program with no symbol at all if you read this answer carefully.</p>\n<p>Finally, you can find an excellent summary about the starting of an executable by reading \"<a href=\"http://dbp-consulting.com/tutorials/debugging/linuxProgramStartup.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Linux x86 Program Start Up or - How the heck do we get to <code>main()</code>?</a>\" by Patrick Horgan.</p>\n</div>",
