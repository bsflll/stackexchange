    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to learn reverse engeneering, so I wrote a little hackme (Very basic console application, asks for a password, and outputs 'right' or 'wrong'). The first thing I wanted to do was finding the address of the '_' function, which basically outputs the given string in the console. After some searching, I found my function, but when placing a breakpoint and debugging or restarting the application, sometimes the function address changes. </p>\n<p>My questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why is the address changing</li>\n<li>How could I dynamically find the function if I can't prevent it from changing?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FF91l.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Ida screenshot\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FF91l.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
