However, for what it's worth, there is also a really good answer (the ticked one) that is related to my question here : <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/3288/how-can-i-set-a-breakpoint-for-a-button-click\" title=\"how can i set a breakpoint for a button click\">reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/3288/â€¦</a>.</span>",

            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">Much of the functionality for GDI32 and User32 has some implementation in the NT Native API. So there's a chance some function from there gets called and does the equivalent of GetMessage. Also, no need to call <code>GetProcAddress()</code> ... either use the NT Native API as well or better yet, walk the export table and find your desired function by hash. <a href=\"http://www.hick.org/code/skape/papers/win32-shellcode.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The technique</a> is <b>ancient</b> in terms of \"internet time\".</span>",
