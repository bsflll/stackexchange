    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I was trying to debug a crackme with radare2. I found an interesting function which radare2 flagged as <code>sym.xxx</code>. The following listing is trimmed version of disassembled output of the function <code>sym.xxx</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>[0x7ff299821090]&gt; pdf @sym.xxx\n/ (fcn) sym.xxx 179\n|   sym.xxx ();\n|           ; CALL XREF from main @ 0x55a340b531a8\n|           0x55a340b53297      55             push rbp\n|           0x55a340b53298      4889e5         mov rbp, rsp\n|           0x55a340b5329b      488d35b92d00.  lea rsi, obj.key3       ; 0x55a340b5605b ; \"is\"\n|           0x55a340b532a2      488d3d373000.  lea rdi, [0x55a340b562e0]\n|           0x55a340b532a9      e8c2fdffff     call sym.imp.strcat     ; char *strcat(char *s1, const char *s2)\n|           0x55a340b532ae      488d052b3000.  lea rax, [0x55a340b562e0]\n|           0x55a340b532b5      48c7c1ffffff.  mov rcx, 0xffffffffffffffff\n|           0x55a340b532bc      4889c2         mov rdx, rax\n|           0x55a340b532bf      b800000000     mov eax, 0\n|           0x55a340b532c4      4889d7         mov rdi, rdx\n|           0x55a340b532c7      f2ae           repne scasb al, byte [rdi]\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>While stepping in through each instruction in this function, I have noticed that after executing the fourth instructon (<code>lea rdi, [0x55a340b562e0]</code>) the 2nd operand of <code>lea</code> instruction automatically substituted to a random register like <code>rdx</code>, <code>r9</code>, <code>rdi</code> in the disassembly of debugger window. In the screenshot below the fourth instruction got substituted to <code>lea rdi, [rdi]</code> by radare2. And I think it is worth mentioning that I have loaded the crackme executable 5 times in radare2, at first two times radare2 replaced the memory address operand with <code>rdx</code> and <code>r9</code> and last 3 times with <code>rdi</code>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SV8Un.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SV8Un.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I am quite unsure of what causing this behavior.Although <code>lea rdi, [rdi]</code> looks self-explanatory but I don't know about <code>rdx</code> or <code>r9</code>. Why radare2 is changing memory operands in <code>lea</code> instruction ?</p>\n<p><strong>Radare2 version</strong> : radare2 3.7.0 22507 @ linux-x86-64 git.3.7.0-38-g9ce44c7cc</p>\n<p><strong>Crackme binary</strong>: <a href=\"https://crackmes.one/crackme/5c95646333c5d46ecd37c960\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://crackmes.one/crackme/5c95646333c5d46ecd37c960</a></p>\n</div>",

After executing this line, you see <code>lea rdi, [rdi]</code> and the reason behind it, <strong>I guess</strong>, is that radare2 prefers to show registers instead of raw values when possible. After executing this instruction, it realises that <code>rdi</code> has in fact value <code>0x55e3a3b802e0</code> so it can display it instead, which usually would be more readable, but in your case it unfortunately leads to confusion.</p>\n<p>To make sure that it is just radare2 issue, not the executable itself, you may check the opcode just before executing that instruction and just after it - it doesn't change.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You mentioned that you see different registers in <code>lea</code> - they aren't put there randomly; depending on the current register values when you look at the mnemonics (using <code>pdf</code> or Visual Mode), they will change; i.e. if <code>r9= 0x55a340b562e0</code> at some moment, it can be displayed there (so you will see <code>lea rdi, [r9]</code> when it happens that <code>r9</code> or any other register has that value).</p>\n</div>",
