In other words, can I tell radare that <code>dx</code> is an offset using a segment that starts at <code>0000:0100 - 0x10</code>?</p>\n</div>",

As you can see, 0x01d1 is hard coded so r2 won't add <code>message +</code> to it.</p>\n<p>You can create a flag using <code>f str.message 13 @ 0x10d</code> but it would probably not  be helpful in your case.</p>\n</div>",

Not a solution since code offsets are wrong but it feels so close. :)</span>",
