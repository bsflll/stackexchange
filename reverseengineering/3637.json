The clicker costs about $50, so I thought, why not buy a receiver and write some code to interface with it and do cool things if I've already got half the hardware?</p>\n<p>Research turned up <a href=\"http://www.turningtechnologies.com/receivers/rf-receiver\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the receiver unit</a> with no price listed, but some quick amazon and ebay checks revealed the going rate to be about $400 which is well outside the range that I as a student am willing to spend to hack on some hardware, no matter how cool.</p>\n<p>Is there an alternate generic receiver module I could look into, something in the $10-$30 range? Is the signal employed by this particular clicker encrypted so I cannot access it anyway? $50 on the clicker is a fortune to spend as a student on a piece of technology that will essentially turn into a brick once I graduate.</p>\n<p>Are there any resources out there that can provide any information on the signal and how I could extract meaningful data? I'm looking to be able to read clicker ID and responses, and hack together a controller for my laptop or a simple voting system I can use with my friends to mediate movie choices and meal debates.</p>\n</div>",
