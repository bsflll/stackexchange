    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm pretty much new to the Reverse Engineering and assembly language. I've watched some videos about OllyDbg and cracking serial numbers in programs and I got interested in them and I want to learn more about assembly. Therefore I created a little console program myself in C# to practice:</p>\n<pre><code>using System;\nnamespace ConsoleApp3\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Console.Write(\"Please enter the code: \");\n            string code = \"af2152ats7u35e\";\n            string input = Console.ReadLine();\n            if (input == code)\n                Console.WriteLine(\"The code is correct!\");\n            else\n                Console.WriteLine(\"You failed, try again...\");\n            Console.ReadLine();\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Of course I can find the string in a text document, but the point was to actually use OllyDbg to jump over the checking part and right away give the \"code is correct\", just to practice the reverse engineering.\nAt first I thought it's gonna be easy and I'm gonna manipulate the program in different ways, but it turns out the strings are not shown as ASCII in the CPU view:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ldtic.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ldtic.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Because I thought it's gonna be shown as in this video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/uydMlQlEiyc?t=39\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/uydMlQlEiyc?t=39</a></p>\n<p>So instead I can only find them in the dump view:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/t2OO8.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/t2OO8.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>It makes it harder to actually find it in the CPU view and I can't find how to work with this on the internet or how to change it so it will be like in the video?</p>\n<p>How do I continue from here and how can I find the dump text reference in the code?</p>\n</div>",
