And in my experience it’s correct (while retdec’s C code is sometimes just plain wrong).</p>\n<p>The JEB guys have entered the decompiler business with a MIPS decompiler (which HexRays doesn’t offer at the moment). Supposedly it’s quite good. And they have a ARM decompiler in open beta now. I have not tried it yet, but it’s good to see competition.</p>\n</div>",
