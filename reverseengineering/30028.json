    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>For reverse calculation of CRC checksums, there is a pretty nice tool – <a href=\"https://reveng.sourceforge.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CRC reveng</a>.</p>\n<p>I was looking for, and have not found, a similar tool that can do the same for <strong>non CRC</strong> checksums. For example, using Xor, Sum, bit-shift action for the single bits or nibbles to get the given checksum.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know about such a tool that can do this job?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/29991/finding-method-for-checksum-calculation-crc-or-xor-or-other\">In my case</a> I have just 5 nibbles of data that are calculated into 1 nibble of checksum, but there is an algorithm behind which I was not able to reverse by myself. And I have a large set of data that can be used to accept or refuse proposed algorithms.</p>\n</div>",
