    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm attempting to figure out the structure of a \"God object\".</p>\n<p>I found where it's being initialized, but I've never seen <code>calloc</code> used like this before:</p>\n<pre><code>god = (God *)calloc(1,(size_t)&amp;god_size_marker?);\n__aeabi_memclr8(god,&amp;god_size_marker?);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where <code>God</code> is the structure that I'm currently attempting to figure out, and <code>god_size_marker?</code> is the name I gave to the pointer location.</p>\n<p>The bizarre thing is, it's passing a <em>pointer</em> to the second argument of <code>calloc</code>. If I have Ghidra follow <code>god_size_marker?</code>, I see:</p>\n<pre><code>                     god_size_marker?                                XREF[2]:     create_instance:0005b0ac(*), \n                                                                                  create_instance:0005b0c8(*)  \n00700438 7d              db         7Dh\n</code></pre>\n<p>So the address is 0x700438. If I manually set the structure to have a size of <code>0x700438</code>, that appears to fix the issue in <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/27932/improving-ghidras-auto-structure-creator\">my last question</a>, but that's ridiculous. What significance could a pointer into the <code>.rodata</code> section possibly have? This also apparently has the bizarre consequence of some field offsets in the struct coinciding with global variable addresses:</p>\n<pre><code>puVar4 = (uint *)&amp;DAT_007003e8;  // These lines are right beside each other. Note the names.\nbVar20 = first_counter &lt;= *(uint *)&amp;god-&gt;field_0x7003e8;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is it actually reasonable that they've initialized a struct's size using a pointer? To me, that suggests that Ghidra is misinterpreting something, and that there's something that I need to fix. I wouldn't even know where to start though from this behavior alone.</p>\n<p>For reference, here is the relevant disassembly of the calls to <code>calloc</code> and <code>__aebi_memclr8</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>    0005b0ac 05 f1 70 01     add.w      r1=&gt;god_size_marker?,r5,#0x70                    = 7Dh\n    0005b0b0 93 46           mov        r11,r2\n    0005b0b2 00 68           ldr        r0,[r0,#0x0]=&gt;-&gt;__stack_chk_guard                = 01dbe014\n    0005b0b4 4f f0 01 0a     mov.w      r10,#0x1\n    0005b0b8 00 68           ldr        r0,[r0,#0x0]=&gt;__stack_chk_guard                  = ??\n    0005b0ba 19 90           str        r0,[sp,#local_3c]\n    0005b0bc 01 20           movs       r0,#0x1\n    0005b0be f8 f7 2c ec     blx        &lt;EXTERNAL&gt;::calloc                               void * calloc(size_t __nmemb, si...\n    0005b0c2 40 f2 38 41     movw       r1,#0x438\n    0005b0c6 04 46           mov        r4,god\n    0005b0c8 c0 f2 70 01     movt       r1=&gt;god_size_marker?,#0x70                       = 7Dh\n    0005b0cc f8 f7 ee eb     blx        &lt;EXTERNAL&gt;::__aeabi_memclr8                      undefined __aeabi_memclr8()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Unfortunately, while I can read x86 assembly, my knowledge of ARM is fairly limited.

It seems that Ghidra  replaces it by the address expression just because there happens to be a variable at that address. You'll probably have to contact Ghidra support to figure out if there's a way to treat it as a number instead of address.</p>\n</div>",
