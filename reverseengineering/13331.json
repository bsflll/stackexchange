    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>This is a korean MMORPG released back in 2001. The game and the company no longer exists. I've been analyzing the file formats as a personal project for awhile now. </p>\n<p>I have already decoded the textures and script files. I only have 2 more files left to decode: <code>.ani</code> and <code>.obj</code>. With the extensions, I would guess that the <code>.ani</code> contains the animation and <code>.obj</code> contains the 3d models. As the title of my question would suggest. I'm currently working on the <code>.obj</code> file. </p>\n<h2>What I Know</h2>\n<p><code>.obj</code> files are actually archives that contains one or more models. But exclusively 3D models (biped) because the textures are found on another archive with the extension <code>.t16</code> or <code>.tex</code>.</p>\n<p>I'll take the 22nd model inside the file <code>def.obj</code> as an example. I have also taken it out of the archive and saved it as a file called `def_022.obj.</p>\n<p>From here on, I'll call the 22nd model <code>Armor of Eagle</code>. The next image is the texture for the <code>Armor of Eagle</code> found on <code>def.t16</code>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OXODV.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OXODV.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>The Armor of Eagle in-game:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8ttpa.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8ttpa.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>A <code>def_inf.txt</code> file has this related line:</p>\n<pre><code>filename    LODstep polycnt\narmor_eagle 0       313     // eagle = index 22\n</code></pre>\n<p>In general, the structure of <code>.obj</code> is:</p>\n<pre><code>06 00 00 00 03 00     // don't know what\n3C 00                 // total number of models in this list\n01 00 9E 00 00 00 9E 00 00 00 78 00 00 00 78 00 00 00 // the first model on the list with 0x9E polygons and 0x78 verticies\n01 00 64 00 00 00 64 00 00 00 61 00 00 00 61 00 00 00 // the 2nd model\n....... // continues until you reach the end of the headers\n....... // then the bodies start, actual 3d data\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is how the headers looks:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/duJ5J.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/duJ5J.png\"/></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cyan: \n\n<ul>\n<li>39 01 00 00 = 313 polygon count</li>\n<li>18 01 00 00 = 280 vertex count</li>\n<li>AD 00 6B 00 = unknown</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>About def_022.obj</h2>\n<p>The face indices start at <code>0x4C [00 00 01 00...]</code><br/>\nand by the looks of it ends at <code>0x7A2 [...A2 00 A3 00]</code></p>\n<p>I was using the tool called <code>hex2obj 0.24c</code> but didn't have any luck in guessing the starting points of the vertices and uv list.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xiRGV.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xiRGV.png\"/></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yellow: seems to me that it is the chunk marker. (because all files start with it)</li>\n<li>Light Blue: is a uint16 seq no., +1 for every model inside the <code>def.obj</code>. And it also corresponds to the index of its texture (on the texture archive).</li>\n<li>Dark Green: is the face indices.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Question</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>How do I go forward?  </li>\n<li>How do I find the address where the UV starts? (<em>books? articles? resources?</em>)</li>\n<li>Lastly, how do I know where the vertices start?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is all considering that I just analyze the binary and not debug the client itself to see how the client is taking the data.</p>\n<h2>UPDATE</h2>\n<p>I noticed a few new things on the file I'm analyzing <code>def_022.obj</code>. A bytearray gets repeated a lot of times. Although, I'm still not sure of the significance YET. <code>00 00 80 3F</code> is also the bytes that each model start with, which I thought was the chunk marker:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7JIx3.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7JIx3.png\"/></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yellow: is the repeated bytes. You'll also notice that it is usually preceded by the byte <code>0x3F</code> or <code>0x3E</code> and followed by <code>0x0C</code> and <code>0x0D</code> and then 3 bytes of <code>0x00</code>. This pattern gets repeated 185 times.</li>\n<li>Cyan: is the area containing the face indices.</li>\n<li>Upon further research I found out that <code>3f80 0000 = 1</code> or <code>0000 803f = 1</code> for little endian. But still don't know the significance, I'm going to dig deeper.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on the notes Mr @RadLexus has kindly provided. I was also able to plot the vertices and imported into blender:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mzEjq.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mzEjq.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Added the normals and UV:</p>\n<pre><code>v -13.531700 37.445000 2.338600\nvn -0.687800 0.725000 -0.036200\nvt 0.583800 0.086300\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then I tried adding the faces:</p>\n<pre><code>f 1 2 3\nf 1 3 4\nf 5 6 7\nf 5 7 8\nf 9 10 11\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rvS6x.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rvS6x.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>But still can't figure out how to apply the textures.</p>\n<h2>UPDATE</h2>\n<p>So I tried changing my <code>.obj</code> file to include a few more info about the face values like (just duplicated the value as x/x/x):</p>\n<pre><code>f 1/1/1 2/2/2 3/3/3\nf 1/1/1 3/3/3 4/4/4\nf 5/5/5 6/6/6 7/7/7\n</code></pre>\n<p>I finally got this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/44PDX.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/44PDX.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Although it's still wrong, I guess I'm a bit closer.</p>\n<h2>FINAL UPDATE</h2>\n<p>Have figured it out.

Clearly, the numbers at the end are floating point numbers. Also, they are not <em>all</em> floating point; the sequence <code>0C 00 00 00</code> a few bytes in is <em>not</em> a reasonable floating point number. Counting off to the next \"unreasonable\" value (which happened to be <code>0C 00 00 00</code> again, but there are other values as well) told me the <em>stride</em> of this data was <code>28</code> bytes. (Which is 40 in decimal, but for documentation I strongly prefer hex.) If you have a capable hex viewer of which you can adjust the view width, you can see that this is correct if you set its view width to 40 characters.</p>\n<p>Counting back from the end in 40-byte steps gave me the most likely starting point of this sequence.</p>\n<p>The digits right before it are clearly at least 2-byte (unsigned short), and sort of increase from the start to the end. As this is a 3D model, I had a strong hunch they form <em>triangle data</em>, so at least they should contain <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> vertex indices, and possibly additional triangle attributes. This turned out, by trial and error, to be not the case. (The \"trial and error\" consisted of dumping them into a display program. As that worked straight away, further numerical investigations were unnecessary.)</p>\n<p>Since this information is (1) enough to display an object, and (2) covers all of the data in the file apart from the few bytes at the start â€“ which can be anything â€“ I went on writing a full display program.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The first <code>004A</code> bytes are unknown. They contain some floating point numbers (<code>00 00 80 3F</code> is <code>1.0</code>, as a little endian 4 byte floating point number), and they could be anything. (A scale is likely.)</p>\n<p>The next 2 bytes form the number <code>0016</code>, which is in decimals <code>22</code>. This could be the internal 'object number'.</p>\n<p>Then, starting at <code>004C</code>, <code>113h</code> (313, in decimal) <em>triangle definitions</em> follow. A single triangle definition consists of 3 unsigned short indices <code>a</code>,<code>b</code>,<code>c</code>, which point to 3 <em>coordinates</em>. The largest index in this list is <code>0117</code>, a significant number!</p>\n<p>Right after this, <code>0118</code> <em>3D points</em> follow. Each 3D point has the following structure:</p>\n<pre><code>float x\nfloat y\nfloat z\nfloat unknown (usually 1.0?)\nunsigned int unknown\nfloat normal_x\nfloat normal_y\nfloat normal_z\nfloat u   \\\nfloat v   / correct; see bottom update\n</code></pre>\n<p>Affirming that the 3 <code>normal_*</code> variables indeed form a normal can be done by adding their squares together; they should hover around a value of <code>1.0</code>. That is correct for the first hundred or so of these coordinates, up to 3 decimals of accuracy:</p>\n<pre><code>1.000004\n1.000080\n0.999935\n1.000076\n0.999936\n(and so on)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Adding up the sizes of all coordinate elements leads to a total size of <code>28</code> bytes (40, in decimal), and:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the remaining part of the file is a multiple of this;</li>\n<li>dividing the size of the remaining part by <code>28</code> results in <code>118</code> (280, in decimal).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The significance of the 'highest index' in the triangle list is therefore proven :) They are indeed coordinate indices.</p>\n<p>Where do these numbers <code>139h</code> and <code>118h</code> come from? They appear in the header part of the entire file!</p>\n<p>Here is the proof that the first 3 elements are indeed <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em>. I plotted <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> only, with <em>y</em> inverted (negative towards the bottom of the screen). You can clearly recognize the 'body' part of your in-game image.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kJQgG.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"a wireframe body\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kJQgG.png\"/></a></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Not <em>all</em> coordinates are quite the same. The <code>unknown_1</code> float value is <code>1.000</code> for the first 173 coordinates, then jumps to other values for the remainders. Similarly, the integer <code>unknown_2</code> hovers between values from <code>4</code> to <code>43</code> for these, and then jumps to a much higher value. This needs some further investigation.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The <code>u</code>,<code>v</code> values can be mapped onto the source image directly. They are expressed in a floating point range from <code>0..1</code> so you need to multiply them by the source image's width and height. Here is an image of that:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pVv4j.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"texture coordinates\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pVv4j.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>The unused parts of the image are presumably used by other 3D models.</p>\n</div>",
