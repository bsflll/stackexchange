    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>While trying to decompile an application with Hex-Ray 7.0, I stumbled upon the problem that in nearly all cases, what seems to be a certain inline function will not be recognised, which bloats the code base and makes it really hard to read.\nThe function seems to be strcpy or something similar. Is there a way to have the Decompiler change the mentioned parts to an inline function? Or can I do it manually somehow?\nHere's a screenshot to illustrate my issue:<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/D1Hiw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/D1Hiw.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Thanks a lot in advance!</p>\n</div>",
