    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have created a DLL for DLL inject injection to add a force feedback to a GOG game. The DLL Work perfectly. I have tried to see how work the Debug in CE with this script:</p>\n<pre><code>debugProcess()  -- Attach Debugger to the process.\nfunction debugger_onBreakpoint()\n\n   print(\"hello hacking\")\n\n\n    return 0 --Break\n\nend\n\n\ndebug_setBreakpoint(0x542E51)\n</code></pre>\n<p>that work fine like I espected.</p>\n<p>Now I have used my dll as \"template\" with another GOG game (DRM free) but this time after tried to hook more then 20 functions that in theory should be call but none of them trigger my code.</p>\n<p>I have tried with CE using the previous script with the some result, the game never break.</p>\n<p>At this point I suspect that the game could use a anti-cheating system.</p>\n<p>For the moment I see that IDA detect the real name of many functions:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NJumW.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NJumW.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>here what Cheat Engine see:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/o3Ez2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/o3Ez2.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>There is a way to verify if the game include a sort of anti-cheatting system or similar ?</p>\n<p>Thank you !</p>\n</div>",
