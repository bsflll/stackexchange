On the site of flash ROM I did not find any information whether flash ROM is capable of downloading the binary contents of the flash memory. Basically I was unsure as it is not a pure flash chip but like a microcontroller.</p>\n<p>Would appreciate any help on this.</p>\n<p>cobz</p>\n</div>",

I would like to do the read somehow to my computer. My initial idea would be to use UART or SPI (for example by wiring up to a pi or another device I can use as a serial bridge).   As the support for the ATWINC is not mentioned in flashrom I was wondering about how I can do the firmware download.</span>",

The guide shows some example code with commands being called in C like <code>m2m_wifi_download_mode();</code> to set the chip to download mode. I suppose it is mostly referring wiring up a certain debug type of the WINC to this Xplainer debug board by Atmel and interacting over the Atmel studio then right?  I am wondering now, how can I send these commands to the bare metal chip without the debug hardware? For example with an ESP or Arduino as a SPI bridge, or the SPI hooked to a pi which I would normally use with the flashrom util.</span>",

You can search for example projects if you already use any of their libraries or IDEs or you can install them. I think you can find libraries which include WINC-1510 support here: <a href=\"https://www.microchip.com/mplab/microchip-libraries-for-applications/mla-legacy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">microchip.com/mplab/microchip-libraries-for-applications/…</a> but I am not sure as I didnt test it. If it isnt here you will have to search their webpage for other libraries.</span>",

                    "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">Thanks for the links. The second one looks promising but for me it is still not clear how to use these driver files. For example again the <code>m2m_wifi_download_mode</code> function, which is now included in the driver C files.  When I for example wire up SPI between an ESP8266 and the WINC1510, will calling the functions on the ESP8266 directly interact over SPI? Probably not right? So how does these driver files know how to reach the chip. I am also a little bit confused as this MPLAB Harmony is again a referencing to these debug boards. I cannot find an example to interact directly with it.</span>",

To read flash memory on this module you need to communicate with the asic chip on module (via SPI) to fetch flash content for you. I dont know if there is any documentation for this communication, but you can see implementation in <a href=\"https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/wireless/tree/master/driver/winc/winc1500_19.5.4/driver/source\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/wireless/tree/master/driver/…</a> (depending on your version of module).</span>",
