    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>The memorydumps I work with are from a Windows XP SP2 run inside a VirtualBox VM. I aquire the memorydumps with vboxmanage debugvm dumpguestcore --filename dump.vmem. The windows paging is disabled.</p>\n<p>My idea is to identify executable vads that were created after a process was created by for example LoadLibrary() calls. As these vads should not correspond to any dll imported. </p>\n<p>Therefor I recursively walk the processes / modules import directories (DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT and DIRECTORY_ENTRY_DELAY_IMPORT). Whenever I find a new dll, I mark the corresponding vad as imported and start scanning from there.</p>\n<p>I use the volatility plugin ProcExeDump to dump the module and peFile to read the import directories from the dumped module. </p>\n<p>Such a recusive walk looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>PID: 600, services.exe\n\nmsvcrt.dll - 0x77c10000\n    kernel32.dll - 0x7c800000\n        ntdll.dll - 0x7c900000\nadvapi32.dll - 0x77dd0000\n    secur32.dll - 0x77fe0000\n        netapi32.dll - 0x5b860000\n            ws2_32.dll - 0x71ab0000\n                ws2help.dll - 0x71aa0000\n                    user32.dll - 0x77d40000\n                        cant parse delay import directory\nrpcrt4.dll - 0x77e70000\nuserenv.dll - 0x769c0000\n    authz.dll - 0x776c0000\n        cant parse delay import directory\n    ole32.dll - 0x774e0000\n        gdi32.dll - 0x77f10000\n    oleaut32.dll - 0x77120000\nscesrv.dll - 0x758e0000\n    cant parse delay import directory\numpnpmgr.dll - 0x758c0000\n    winsta.dll - 0x76360000\nncobjapi.dll - 0x5f770000\n    msvcp60.dll - 0x76080000\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, sometimes the delay import directories can't be read although the module has the directory and the size of the directory is not 0.</p>\n<p>In the above example I was able to identify 20 executable vads that correspond to imported modules. (20 out of a total of 38 executable vads)</p>\n<p>Among the other 18 executable vads, there are many that belong to other dlls such as version.dll, uxtheme.dll or apphelp.dll</p>\n<p>example:</p>\n<pre><code>Start: 2008285184, 0x77b40000L\nFlags: CommitCharge: 1, ImageMap: 1, Protection: 7\nControlArea @8a3f4bf8 Segment e15392a0\nDereference list: Flink 00000000, Blink 00000000\nNumberOfSectionReferences:          1 NumberOfPfnReferences:          12\nNumberOfMappedViews:                4 NumberOfUserReferences:          5\nWaitingForDeletion Event:  00000000\nControl Flags: Accessed: 1, File: 1, HadUserReference: 1, Image: 1\nFileObject @8a4fc660, Name: \\WINDOWS\\system32\\apphelp.dll\nFirst prototype PTE: e15392d8 Last contiguous PTE: fffffffc\nFlags2: Inherit: 1\n</code></pre>\n<p>Any Ideas why the import directories can't be parsed? Or any other comments regarding my idea? Maybe a way to achive the same just another way...</p>\n<p>Any help is most appreciated, thank you!</p>\n</div>",

That is, do you have a confirmed example where the delay-load table is parsed correctly?  Perhaps it is failing on the Attributes field, whose use and allowed values are documented incorrectly by MS's PECOFF specification, at least where MSVC files are concerned.</span>",
