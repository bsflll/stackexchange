    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Sorry if this is a stupid question but couldnt find the answer by googling</p>\n<p>Right now I analyze a malware by using remote debugger of IDA, and i run the debugger on a isolated VM that has shared a folder to my IDA's VM, as of right now the way i analyze a sample is by putting it on that shared folder so i can run the remote debugger, because if i set the path to a location in my IDA's VM then it won't work (it says wrong parameters), so it looks like the sample has to be in a location where both my IDA's VM and the isolated VM can reach (i think) </p>\n<p>so to solve this i just put samples i want to analyze in the shared folder</p>\n<p>the problem is that the .idb file spawns there as well and if its a ransomware then my .idb file will get ruined  ( i have to say that IDA's VM is also in a isolated host only network)</p>\n<p>so two questions :</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>am i approaching this right? is there an easier way for me to use a remote debugger without using a shared folder?</p></li>\n<li><p>how to change the .idb's default path? so i can put the sample in the shared folder or somewhere else but the .idb gets generated somewhere else? </p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

You can now delete it from the analysis machine so you don't accidentally run it (or rename). Let's assume the sample is in <code>C:\\temp\\sample.exe</code> on the debugging VM. </p></li>\n<li><p>start the debug server</p></li>\n<li><p>In IDA, in Debugging-Process options, specify the remote host/port and change the path to the executable as it is <strong>on the remote machine</strong> (i.e. <code>C:\\tmp\\sample.exe</code>).</p></li>\n<li><p>debug away!</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
