    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>My company has received a command-line stand-alone (ELF) executable from a Korean company that provides a service for validating Korean users. It took them a few tries to get us a version that runs on the latest release of FreeBSD.</p>\n<p>They will not give us the algorithm for encrypting or decrypting the data sent to/received from their service. They probably have a secret key embedded in the compiled file.</p>\n<p>The example website code they provide indicates that this stand-alone executable only does encryption and decryption of the data sent over the wire.</p>\n<p>As part of our security review, we would like to find out does the compiled file only do the encryption/decryption or does it send information to another site/service.</p>\n<p>Are there any US precedents or laws governing reverse engineering of foreign company obtained code for security reviews?</p>\n</div>",
