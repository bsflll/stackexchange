However, my attempts to use it don't work:</p>\n<pre><code>$ r2 /bin/ls\nWarning: run r2 with -e bin.cache=true to fix relocations in disassembly\n[0x00006810]&gt; q\n$ cat /bin/ls | r2 =\n^D\n[0x00000000]&gt; q\n               $ \n</code></pre>\n<p>Note only does it not work, as shown above, but I need to <code>reset</code> my term afterwards!</p>\n</div>",
