The file has very distinct pattern in HEX editor but I am unable to recognise it:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aAASu.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aAASu.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>First 16 bytes are some sort of a header and then every 4th byte is 0x3C, and sometimes it is 0x3D instead. The file continues with the same pattern until the end and ends with 0x3C as well.\nIs this something very proprietary or do any of you guys recognise it?</p>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: The entire file is available <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jP8mGYxNcpvN0f1whTgiLwe7jatWe1PW/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>",

Having a full file and a picture of the image it is thought to contain would confirm specific details either way.</p>\n<p>The header appears to have the following format -</p>\n<pre><code>00000000: 00000800    // width of image (W) = 2048 pixels\n00000004: 00000600    // height of image (H) = 1536 pixels\n00000008: 0000000C    // number of bytes per pixel (B) = 12 bytes\n0000000C: 00006000    // number of bytes per row (T) = W * B, probably rounded up to multiple of 8 or 16 \n</code></pre>\n<p>The suggested size of 2048x1536 does appear consistent with specifications from several digitail/usb microscopes that are available online.</p>\n<p>The pixel data then follows for each row, with each pixel appearing to be stored as 3x 32-bit IEEE floating-point value (i.e. B = 12 bytes.) These three values being, presumably, R, G &amp; B components in some order.</p>\n<pre><code>// 1st row\n00000010: 3C8B50D4 3C8F6AF0 3C8974E5    // 1st pixel = 0.017006, 0.017507, 0.016779\n0000001C: ....\n</code></pre>\n<p>Subsequent rows will appear <code>T</code> bytes beyond the previous row.</p>\n<pre><code>// 2nd row (at 0x00000010 + 0x00006000)\n00006010: ....\n\n// 3rd row (at 0x00000010 + 0x00006000 x 2)\n0000C010: ....\n\n// 4th row (at 0x00000010 + 0x00006000 x 3)\n00012010: ....\n\netc...\n</code></pre>\n<p>If correct, this would suggest your original file is relatively large at around 36MB.</p>\n</div>",

I do have a viewer application to confirm that, but the application is not freely available unfortunately. I will try to write some code now to convert the file to some regular image format in order to figure out the order of R, G and B components. I will edit my question now and include the link to the whole file, in case someone else wants to play with it as well.</span>",
