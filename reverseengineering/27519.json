It does work on WinDbg, I made a mistake (I did <code>!db [uc] 00000000`fffffff0</code> which didn't work at that time because I was on bootmgr (so it couldnt read past 4GiB). I tried it again on WinDbg with <code>!db [uc] 00000000`ffffff00</code> and it worked). This however does not work on <code>kd -kl</code> no matter what, which is a shame because I'm more interested in my own hardware -- RwEverything is what I have to use</span>",
