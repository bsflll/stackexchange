    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>For fun I downloaded an installer from a \"driver downloads\" website.  I do NOT intend on installing it, but I was interested to check it out just to see what it looked like.  I tossed it into Ollydbg (without advancing the pointer) and just browsed the assembly.  </p>\n<p>There are multiple different calls/jumps/far jumps to various <code>ntdll.addr</code>. </p>\n<p>I know <code>ntdll</code> is a pretty low-level library, but I just don't have enough experience in windows x86 disassembly to know what's '<em>normal</em>'.  This is also ostensibly, a driver installer, so it seems reasonable that there would be calls into <code>ntdll</code>.  Are jumps like that considered normal behavior?  Usually I'm used to seeing calls that expressly name the function... not a specific address in <code>ntdll</code>.  </p>\n<h2>Extra detail/context</h2>\n<p>The file wasn't packed, but there were a few spots where the full printable ASCII <code>[A-Za-z]</code> appeared in the hex view, which I recall could be a sign that there's base64 encoding/decoding going on somewhere. Maybe shift-ciphers.  </p>\n<p>For reference, the precise binary I'm peering into is <a href=\"http://driverscollection.com/?H=GM-M7700&amp;By=Gigabyte\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.  Windows 7 64bits.  (The installer itself appears to be 32bits... Ollydbg loaded it fine, and IDA free too.)</p>\n<p>PEBrowse64 also showed me something possibly suspicious under <code>Resources-&gt;STRING-&gt;4085</code>.</p>\n<p>In this section there appears to be strings set aside for <kbd>Pageup</kbd>/<kbd>Down</kbd>/<kbd>Backspace</kbd>/<kbd>Esc</kbd>/<kbd>Enter</kbd> keys, which I know could be a sign of a keylogger... but again, I'm new, so I'm unsure.  </p>\n</div>",

That is, a DLL (such as kernel32.dll) might export a symbol, for which the implementation is held in another DLL (such as ntdll.dll).  A typical example of that is the heap allocation functions: HeapAlloc and HeapFree.  If you examine kernel32.dll, you will see that they are redirected to ntdll.RtlAllocateHeap and ntdll.RtlFreeHeap.  The reason for this is behavior is probably not particularly interesting (it's to do with maintaining compatibility).</p>\n<p>That is not to say that all such cases of direct calls into ntdll.dll are legitimate, but it might explain what you are seeing.</p>\n</div>",
