The aim of the work is to recover intermediate representations (IRs) that are similar to those that can be created for a program written in a high-level language. Our goal is to perform this task for programs such as viruses, worms, and mobile code. For such programs, symbol-table and debugging information is either entirely absent, or cannot be relied upon if present; hence, the analysis described in the paper makes no use of symbol-table/debugging information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The main analysis discussed in the paper, called <em>value-set analysis</em>, tracks address-valued and integer-valued quantities simultaneously. It is related to pointer-analysis algorithms that have been developed for programs written in high-level languages, which determine an over-approximation of the set of variables whose addresses each pointer variable can hold. At the same time, value-set analysis is similar to range analysis and other numeric static-analysis algorithms that over-approximate the integer values that each variable can hold.</p>\n<p>The techniques described in the paper have been implemented as part of CodeSurfer/x86, a prototype tool for browsing (``surfing''), inspecting, and analyzing x86 executables.</p>\n</div>",

It is doable to leverage VSA on analyzing the \"candidacy of indirect control flow transfer\", which is a extremely critical issue in reverse engineering based static analysis. However, IMHO, I can not figure the relation between VSA and what I proposed..</span>",

A simpler option, which is also quite successful, is simple recursive disassembly augmented with heuristics. This is the approach ida takes, to good practical effect. As for open source, I believe vine implements vsa and bap has at least a partial implementation per this blog post in 2012 <a href=\"http://edmcman.bitbucket.org/blog/2012/07/23/cfg-recovery-in-bap/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">edmcman.bitbucket.org/blog/2012/07/23/cfg-recovery-in-bap</a></span>",
