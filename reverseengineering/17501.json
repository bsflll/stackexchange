They will likely be connected directly to the chip, but SWDIO pins may or may not also double as some other function. Unlike JTAG, SWD will not be daisy-chained to several chips. Start out by looking for TPs connected <em>only</em> to that chip. There will be at least two TPs (SWDIO and SWCLK). They may or may not be located near TPs for GND, reset, SWO and VDDIO (used for detecting programming voltage).</p></li>\n<li><p>If the chip is not the main CPU, and it's possible to update the chip firmware, SWDIO pins may also be present in a board-to-board connector or on pins connected to the CPU (though it's also possible that the chip has a bootloader to be updated by other means than SWD). If this is the case, update the firmware while looking at various pins with a logic analyzer to find candidates for SWD.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
