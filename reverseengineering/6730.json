If that entry is missing, no one will ever start a login process on the serial console.</p>\n<p>(That's for classical systems that use classic <code>init</code> to start and respawn background processes. Desktop systems have moved to a new method named <code>upstart</code> that doesn't use <code>/etc/inittab</code> any more. But on a simple embedded system I'd rather expect inittab to be still in use.)</p>\n<p>So to answer your question: your manufacturer didn't do anything to stop your Linux from running a login on the serial console (that you can reverse). Instead, they probably didn't do anything to make it run a login at all. Possibly they didn't even provide the <code>getty</code> binary that initiates login.</p>\n</div>",
