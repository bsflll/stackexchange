Scanning the form and measuring the exact placement of those items would then allow the company to ascertain which of its other programs a user had installed, without requiring the company to have any sort of network or modem connectivity to the machine in question.</p>\n<p>Realistically speaking, the only way to ensure that an untrusted program won't share information inappropriately is to not allow any untrusted programs to have access to information that shouldn't be shared.  Once programs have access to information, there are so many ways they can hind it that it would be hard to ensure one found them all.</p>\n</div>",
