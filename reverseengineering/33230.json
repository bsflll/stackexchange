    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I’m a beginner in reverse engineering and thinking of building a tool to trace and visualize system calls on macOS. The idea is to make something simpler than DTrace or Instruments, with an intuitive interface showing the sequence of system calls, parameters, and a graph view of interactions.</p>\n<p>Before starting, I’d like to ask:</p>\n<pre><code>Would such a tool be useful for reverse engineering or malware analysis?\nAre there easier or existing alternatives I might have missed?\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thanks for any feedback!</p>\n</div>",
