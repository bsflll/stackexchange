    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am using an old piece of hardware which uses an RS485 serial interface. I'm trying to simulate slave node data but I don't have any documentation on the protocol and unfortunately the hardware is not supported any more.</p>\n<p>I've got numerous examples of master and slave data for which I've tried to reverse engineer the check sequence but I've not found a match for the algorithm.</p>\n<p>Master to Slave examples</p>\n<pre><code>00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 A5\n04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 A9\n06 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 AB\n08 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 AD\n</code></pre>\n<p>Slave to Master examples</p>\n<pre><code>80 00 24 F4 67 1E A3 00 00 00 00 3F 00 FB E6 F9 81 BB 17 D1\n84 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 D8 3D 62 FC 6C 7C 84\n86 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 39 7A 9A 05 77 77 6B\n88 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 00 00 00 00 29 9E EA 45 76 78 21\n</code></pre>\n<p>It's clear the first 15 bytes for Master to Slave and first 19 bytes for Slave to Master is the data and the last byte is used as the check sequence. You can see the protocol uses the first byte as an address with the associated reply setting the most significant bit, though the addressing doesn't determine the error check byte algorithm it is included as part of the calculation.</p>\n<p>My approach so far includes using the various online CRC and checksum calculators. I also tried to use reveng but have not managed to find a match. Any help would be much appreciated.</p>\n</div>",
