There was a pretty good paper by <a href=\"ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/paradyn/papers/Rosenblum10prov.pdf\">Nate Rosenblum on this topic</a>, it's been a while since I read this paper but you can use many techniques to establish this information. I think some use machine learning and others can use a big pile of heuristics or axioms about compiler behavior. </p>\n<p>Establishing this is of limited utility IMO. It could be useful in an adversarial situation where you're trying to get intelligence about a malware group or threat actor, but also keep in mind that this kind of information can be obfuscated or destroyed. One potential use of this information would be to establish that some binary software was compiled using some companies SDK that included a compiler with signature information unique to that company. Establishing the tool chain provenance can help you make a case that someone who bought your SDK is in violation of a license or contract, say by producing malware. </p>\n<p>An example of behavior differences is parameter writing. There are two ways to place a value onto the stack, one using 'push' and another using <code>mov</code> with an address based in <code>esp</code> as the destination operand. So one compiler can do this:</p>\n<pre>\npush eax\npush ebx\n</pre>\n<p>And another can do this:</p>\n<pre>\nmov [esp+foo], eax\nmov [esp+foo+4], ebx\n</pre>\n<p>And they do. Generally, MSVC does the first example and GCC does the second example, at least in some very limited testing/observation just now...</p>\n</div>",

Most modern compilers will produce similar output or the output won't be enough to see differences. One thing that may give indication is compiler optimization, which I am not experienced with and someone else should chime in. If you do have the entire ELF file though, and symbols are available, you may be able to draw conclusions based on what kinds of libraries are linked (for example, <code>libgcc</code> would be a giveaway) or the names of compiler specific functions. If the ELF contains debugging information you may even see things like \"GCC: (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5) 4.6.3\". If you are dealing with C++ code the symbol name mangling can give it away.</p>\n<p>However, as you asked yourself, I am curious why you need this information. I don't know how much help you will get by knowing the compiler that made it will do. I do more work with ARM and I know with that platform, there is a Application Binary Interface that compilers/assembly code must adhere to. This ABI gives information about how functions should be called, what registers should be used for what, and etc. I know for platforms without a strict ABI, operating systems often give information to developers about such topics. Regardless, compilers all should create compatible code so I don't know of any use for identifying the compiler that created the code.</p>\n</div>",
