This is the first time i am using lldb and i am familiar with gdb. while i am trying to disassemble the unix executable file its not working any commands i should use . Or i should try other , if so can you provide me a list of disassembler,decompiler and debugger for unix and windows 64bit processors which supports scripting too. I have searched for them but could't find. can you suggest me list of good disassemblers.</p>\n</div>",

Here are some disassemble commands for use within LLDB:</p>\n<p><code>disassemble --frame</code>: Disassemble the currently running function.</p>\n<p><code>disassemble -a 0x1234</code>: Disassemble the function containing the address <code>0x1234</code></p>\n<p><code>disassemble -n _foo</code>: Disassemble the function called \"<code>_foo</code>\"</p>\n<p>Try <code>help disassemble</code> to learn more.</p>\n<p>As for a list of good disassemblers on various platforms, it depends whether you have a lot of disposable income or not. IDA Pro is the best but it costs around $1000. If that's prohibitive, Google can help you find lists of free and cheap tools.</p>\n</div>",

It has a very good Python binding, so you can write your script as LLDB plugin or GDB plugin.</p>\n</div>",
