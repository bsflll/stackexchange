If i open this exe as archive (7zip) i can see only .rdata and others ( <a href=\"https://i.postimg.cc/FRXJc92D/image.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://i.postimg.cc/FRXJc92D/image.png</a> , in .rsrc only icons), tried to check with ida pro but i cant extract jar. I think there must be a jar file cuz it opens with java and in hex i saw MANIFEST, COM.CLIENT.LAUNCHER (java path). So can anyone help me with it? If requires i can upload file</p>\n</div>",

But the zip/jar file is usually not contained in the exe structure itself instead it is just appended. Use a different zip client that can not interpret exe/dll files and thus opens the attached zip/jar file.</p>\n</div>",
