But it looks somehow incomplete.</p>\n<p>After reading around in the files eg <code>init</code> I see, that there are multiple mtd \"partitions\" which would be nice to separate them from the dump. I hope that it will help me to understand the firmware and how update process works.</p>\n<p>Also I found in the hexdump some PRIVATE information about the device like device_pass, device_wpapass and so on, which I replaced all with a 1. But it is also niceto  know where this information's are stored on the device to see how they are queried. </p>\n<p>The problem for me is to separate all partitions/information from this dump. At least I want to see, if it is possible to disconnect the <a href=\"https://github.com/openv/openv/wiki/Vitoconnect-100\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">device</a> from the cloud and only use it locally - but it looks like the firmware builds only a connection between the interface (connected to the heater) and the cloud server - so all logic is on the cloud.</p>\n<p>Maybe it is possible to mod the firmware with a remote shell or make a MITM possible to investigate on runtime state.</p>\n</div>",
