In order to do the same, I reversed the code to disassembly:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Qr3nT.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Qr3nT.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qQLrj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"main_function\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qQLrj.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Now <code>esp</code> is being copied into <code>ebp</code> in the <code>add</code> function, then why add <code>8</code> and <code>12</code> to access the values <code>5</code> and <code>1</code> in the next lines - shouldn't it be <code>[ebp]</code> and <code>[ebp + 4h]</code>? I am really confused here.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n</div>",

It can store other things as well, for example the return address of the function or the registers which need to be saved temporarily, as well as for local variables. In your example, the <code>push ebp</code> adjusts <code>esp</code> by 4 bytes, so after <code>esp</code> is copied to <code>ebp</code> in the next instruction, the stack frame looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code> [ebp+0] old ebp value (pushed by \"push ebp\")\n [ebp+4] return address from the call (originally at [esp+0])\n [ebp+8] first argument (a)\n [ebp+C] second argument (b)\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
