In the sequences below, the last byte is supposed to be the checksum.</p>\n<pre><code>00 03 1A A1 00 00 00 30\n00 05 50 A1 CD A6 03 06\n00 05 1A A1 CD A4 03 06\n00 02 1A 8F 00 00 00 15\n00 02 1A 81 00 00 00 10\n</code></pre>\n<p>How do I identify the checksum method used?</p>\n</div>",

I'm not familiar with GAL, but from the site you linked, there are references to programming software [1] which should be writing the checksum or verifying it before programming the chip.</p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.armory.com/%7Erstevew/Public/Pgmrs/GAL/intro.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.armory.com/~rstevew/Public/Pgmrs/GAL/intro.htm</a></p>\n</div>",
