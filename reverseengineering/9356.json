I've set up <code>gbserver</code> on the host with:</p>\n<pre><code>gdbserver host:1234 /my/target/app\n</code></pre>\n<p>On my local host I've connected with:</p>\n<pre><code>$ gdb /same/target/app\ngdb$ target extended-remote 192.168.0.100:1234\n</code></pre>\n<p>I connect successfully and can proceed to set a breakpoint on a target instruction, ie:</p>\n<pre><code>$gdb disas vuln_function\n....\n   0x08048e6b &lt;+116&gt;:   ret\nEnd of assembler dump.\ngdb$ b *0x08048e6b\nBreakpoint 1 at 0x8048e6b\n</code></pre>\n<p>Looking at the disassembled function code and having tested this on the host itself, I'm 100% sure I'm breaking on the right address and in any case I'm triggering a buffer overflow which should make <code>gdb</code> break by itself.</p>\n<p>But instead of getting the usual breakpoint on my <code>gdb</code> client, nothing happens. <code>gdbserver</code> freezes on the BO (so I'm guessing it did break on the <code>ret</code>) without throwing the <code>segfault</code>. <code>gdb</code> doesn't seem to be crashing or behaving abnormally other than not giving me a prompt on the breakpoint.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there a special way to set breakpoints when debugging with <code>gdbserver</code>?</strong></p>\n</div>",
