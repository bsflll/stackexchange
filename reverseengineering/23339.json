    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Assume we’re on an x86-64 machine and that we have read-access to the state of a program at a given instant, but we don’t have debugging symbols; in particular, we can read the program’s address space and the registers.</p>\n<p>Is it possible to reliably determine the depth of the call stack? Under which assumptions (e.g., calling conventions)?</p>\n<p>By the <em>depth of the call stack</em> I mean the <em>number of call instructions</em> minus the <em>number of ret instructions</em> that have happened in total in the course of the execution of the program. In the following pseudo trace, the number in the bracket is the depth of the call stack after the instruction in the respective line:</p>\n<pre><code>add eax ebx [0]\n...\ncall 0x1234 [1]\ncall 0x2345 [2]\ncall 0x3456 [3]\nadd eax ebx [3]\njmp 0x4567  [3]\n...\nret         [2]\n...\nret         [1]\ncall 0x1234 [2]\n...\nret         [1]\nret         [0]\n</code></pre>\n<p>I’m not yet an expert in x86, calling convention and the stack layout. However, I vaguely suppose that one can “walk” the stack with the help of the <code>ebp</code> and <code>esp</code> registers.</p>\n</div>",
