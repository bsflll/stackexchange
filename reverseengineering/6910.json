    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have an application that pulls some JSON definition files from the internet. In former versions of the application, these files were genuine json files; now, in a later version, they seem to be encrypted/obfuscated. The files that get downloaded now seem to be base64-encoded; decoding them leads to binary files that have the String <code>Salted12</code> plus 8 more ascii characters in front of them.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<pre><code>Salted12OBWfTKpl&lt;B4&gt;{J&lt;E0&gt; &lt;D1&gt;...\nSalted12DPEPlodlks^Q^H]^Q&lt;88&gt;&lt;A6&gt;&lt;D5&gt;...\nSalted12WeuyYPkh&lt;D6&gt;\"&lt;F9&gt;^I^_6^Q&lt;AB&gt;&lt;ED&gt;^Y\nSalted12hJhPiiUX&lt;E7&gt;Yu&lt;D9&gt;&lt;DB&gt;&lt;9F&gt;&lt;D9&gt;&lt;BD&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I assume the 8 extra bytes are some kind of encryption key (or, maybe the 16 leading bytes are the key, and the devs chose fixed the first 8 bytes)</p>\n<p>Comparing the size of old versions of the json files with the new ones suggests the new ones are uncompressed, and have a 1:1 character encryption after the header bytes:</p>\n<pre><code>File       old size      new size\n1.93.json     10999         10864\nedit.json      2135          2160\nnext.json       252           976\n</code></pre>\n<p>(The change in number of bytes isn't the same for all files, but as the contents have probably changed with the new version, this is to be expected).</p>\n<p>Now my question is: Is there a standard, \"well-known\", library/framework that obfuscates JSON like this, or will i have to reverse the application to find out how the encryption works?</p>\n</div>",
