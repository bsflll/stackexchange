Is this character that is pulled by <em>_getch</em> placed in the stack and then essentially moved around to where it is able to get the file open - with <em>fopen</em> and then puts it back in. I am struggling to understand how this works with the additional instructions that are included within the overall segment of code.</p>\n<p>Any help is appreciated.\nThanks in advance.</p>\n</div>",
