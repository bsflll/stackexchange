    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have always been curious when I should use OllyDbg over Immunity Debugger.</p>\n<p>Immunity Debugger has inherited code from OllyDbg and can perform scripted debugging with Python.</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, most of the times I do a Google search for a reverse engineering task with Immunity Debugger, I end up with search results related to exploit development. When I search for the same task with OllyDbg, I regularly find information more relevant to the reverse engineering task I am trying to accomplish.</p>\n<p>If Immunity Debugger supports scripted debugging in Python (which simplifies the scripting process as opposed to making a plugin for OllyDbg), then why would I want to use OllyDbg over Immunity Debugger?</p>\n</div>",

Ollydbg is older, and has a lot of plugins that are not available in immunity. That being said they are both  great, I usually prefer Olly simply because I can setup keybindings/shortcuts the way I like it. Immunity is great because of the Python scripting feature.</span>",
