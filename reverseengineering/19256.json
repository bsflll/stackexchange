The actions explained:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Break: Suspend the debugged application (default action). You might want to turn it off if you peform some work in the condition script and do not actually need to suspend the app (but a better approach would be to return 0 from the condition expression), or if you only need one of the other actions.</li>\n<li>Trace: Adds a new entry to the <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/1444.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">trace log</a></li>\n<li><p>Refresh debugger memory:</p>\n<p>By default IDA does not refresh the memory config before evaluating\n    a breakpoint condition. This option enables the refresh.\n    To refresh it [manually] call <code>refresh_debugger_memory()</code></p></li>\n<li><p>Enable tracing:<br/>\nEnable <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/1629.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tracing</a> when the breakpoint hits. This is different from the trace action (where only a new entry is added to the trace log).</p></li>\n<li><p>Disable tracing:<br/>\nDisable <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/1629.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tracing</a> when the breakpoint fires.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tracing type:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/1446.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Instruction</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/1447.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Function</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/1628.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Basic block</a> level tracing types can be selected for breakpoints if enable or disable tracing action has been selected.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
