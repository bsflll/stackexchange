After iterating over the string, it actually patches the stack to make a proper return.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MsNWG.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MsNWG.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>My question, and I hope it's not too vague:</p>\n<p>Is or was passing constant arguments like this, sticking them right after the call, in any way a common technique for low-level (hand-written?) code such as this?</p>\n<p>Why would you even prefer to do it this way rather than using a table of strings elsewhere?</p>\n</div>",

Instead, the call instruction will push onto the stack whatever address was current at the time.  Depending on the assembler (if any) that was used to produce the code, this might simplify some things.  If the code was entirely hand-crafted by typing in hex values, then having position-independence allows other instructions to be inserted without having to recalculate addresses.</p>\n</div>",
