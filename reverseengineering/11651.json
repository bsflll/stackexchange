    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Using a forward proxy, I have logged two payloads that are POST requests to a site, and I was curious as to what the best way to determine how a particular attribute in the payloads was generated. Below are the two payloads:</p>\n<pre><code>dedup_counter=2&amp;leaderboard=2&amp;scores=3563736&amp;session=4FMzmwStjaRC&amp;verifier=7e9282dbce68fe787be15f6633246fcd8297eb18\n</code></pre>\n<p>Â </p>\n<pre><code>dedup_counter=3&amp;leaderboard=4&amp;scores=10448&amp;session=4FMzmwStjaRC&amp;verifier=07bdb58cb2147b4ef0ca01110a74e4fb4c8e99c1\n</code></pre>\n<p>I believe that the <code>verifier</code> attribute is an SHA-1 checksum since that's the most common 20-byte hashing method, though I cannot confirm this. The issue is, I don't know what it's a checksum of and I'd like to know how to go about determining the process that was used for generating it. Any advice? I'll be happy to provide more specific information upon request.</p>\n</div>",

            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">You really need to reverse engineer the software that generates these requests. Hashes like SHA-1 are designed to be trapdoor functions, i.e. you can't get the \"original\" from the hash, and if the software creates the hash from a moderately long string, to which the score and possibly leaderboard and dedup_counter are appended, there's just no way to \"crack\" the hash. How to reverse the software is probably too broad for a good answer, but we might be able to give you some pointers if you tell us what kind of software it is - browser game? android app? compiled game?</span>",

I'd assume you should be able to tell your proxy to save everything it downloads to a file, to get the app. But from the linked documents, if the file is encrypted, you need to run it on a jailbroken iOS device and dump the memory, so the laptop alone might not be sufficient.</span>",
