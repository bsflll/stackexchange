However, PE resources are often used to cary images and icons inside executable files. They are then loaded using APIs like <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms648046(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>LoadResource</code></a> and <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-loadimagea\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>LoadImage</code></a>. You can read about resources, their type and formats over on <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632583(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MSDN</a>.</p>\n<p>As a side note, images can also be stored as files in other formats, other extensions, other encodings and even compressed or encrypted. So the fact you don't see a <code>.bmp</code> file does not necessarily mean there are no image resource files alongside the executable. </p>\n</div>",
