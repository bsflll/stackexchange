It is important to note that code generation varies from compiler to compiler.<br/>\nFor this method you can use <a href=\"https://godbolt.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://godbolt.org/</a> which lets you compile straight to assembly code and explore it.<br/><br/>\nIf you need more information feel free to ask.</p>\n</div>",

Those two are objects with vtables and objects without vtables.</p>\n<p>In objects without vtables, identifying them is definitely more tricky, but on the plus side, these are usually either very big structures that are declared at compile time, or small structures that are constructed within the scope of the function. So you can either tell the object apart by it's constructor or it's address in the memory. Or at the very least, locally constructed objects without vtables aren't too many function calls behind.</p>\n</div>",
