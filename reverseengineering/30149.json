    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have an ELF64 binary that comes with <code>*.sym</code> and <code>.debug</code>. From my understanding this is something akin to PDB. While IDA loads it automatically, it fails to process it. I was wondering if Ghidra will fare better but I can't seems to find a way to do so. <a href=\"https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues/3513\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This issue</a> does say it should be in but I cant figure it out:</p>\n<pre><code>Skipping DWARF import because a precondition was not met:\nTheMainBinary has more DIE records (2018267) than limit of 2000000\nManually re-run the DWARF analyzer after adjusting the options or start it via Dwarf_ExtractorScript\n</code></pre>\n</div>",

It also gives you the two options to explicitly run the analysis nonetheless:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Running the Auto Analysis Step with custom configuration</li>\n<li>Running a separate script.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first option specifically means:\nIn the CodeBrowser view of the specific binary, click <code>Analysis</code> in the top bar, then <code>Auto Analyze '$binaryname'</code>. In the resulting list of analyzers scroll down to DWARF which should then look like this screenshot</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GogSI.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GogSI.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>change the <code>2000000</code> highlighted to anything higher than <code>2018267</code>, hit analyze, and Ghidra should now rerun the auto analysis but properly import the DWARF information and not skip it like before.</p>\n</div>",
