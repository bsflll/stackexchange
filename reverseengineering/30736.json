What am I missing here? <strong>This HAS to be a bug in Windows.</strong></p>\n</div>",

Thing is, you don't provide enough context, so I was asking a very pointed question. And I was also asking about what exact build you are looking at. In my version of <code>ntoskrnl.exe</code> <code>ExAllocatePool()</code> encompasses <b>5 instructions</b> including a <code>sub rsp, 28h</code> which clearly doesn't match whatever you have. The <code>ExAllocatePoolWithTag()</code> it calls takes merely one more argument, meaning everything fits into registers anyway and stack is used only for locals. But none of what I see matches what you got. So what exact version of ntoskrnl?</span>",
