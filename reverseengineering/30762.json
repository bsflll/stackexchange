    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>This seems like the best place listed to ask (apologies if it's not) but I'm extremely curious: <br/> Glicko and Glicko-2 are ratings algorithms designed for chess (as an improvement to the Elo rating system) to assess a player's strength at a game of skill. I've been reading about it the past couple of days and I noticed that the algorithms can only accept 3 outcomes: wins, losses, and draws. As such, the variable in the formulas that represent the match's outcome can only be a 1, 1/2, or 0. <strong>Would it be at all possible to reverse-engineer or modify the equations to accept outcomes beyond this range</strong> - like a \"crushing\" victory or loss? <br/> I'm hazarding towards \"no\" because even if it were possible to include a \"1.5\" result, in turn a \"-0.5\" result would also have to exist and I'm imagining negative numbers would break the <em>HELL</em> out of these algorithms.</p>\n</div>",

When you say the variable in the formulas that represent the match's outcome <em>have to be</em> a 1, 1/2, or 0, that depends on where you see the match outcome. The expected match outcome in Elo, for instance, is computed using the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">logistic curve function</a> which has a range between 0 and 1, so the expected outcome in that system can never be a 1.5 or a -0.5. This looks like it is also true in Glicko. Not the same formula exactly, but one which is based on the logistic curve with the output range between 0 and 1.</p>\n<p>The Wikipedia article on Elo also points out that there are multiple ways to interpret the expected outcome.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thus, an expected score of 0.75 could represent a 75% chance of winning, 25% chance of losing, and 0% chance of drawing. On the other extreme it could represent a 50% chance of winning, 0% chance of losing, and 50% chance of drawing. The probability of drawing, as opposed to having a decisive result, is not specified in the Elo system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Say there was a \"crushing loss\" with a value of 1.5. You would never be able to have the system predict that it would be a crushing loss with anything more than a 66% chance because that is the maximum output of the logistic curve formula.</p>\n<p>Hope that helps.</p>\n</div>",
