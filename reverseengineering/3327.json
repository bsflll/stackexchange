From here I want to use the bindiff functions to compare this database with another database and output any differences to a file.  Any recommendations? </p>\n</div>",

Those are binaries for batch diffing of IDBs and <code>.BinExport</code> files.</p>\n<p>The basic usage would be:</p>\n<pre><code>differ --primary=&lt;directory-with-IDBs&gt; --output-dir=&lt;output-directory&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Sadly, this does not work (at least on my machine) as <code>differ.exe</code> fails to find IDA's executable and tries to execute the directory instead.</p>\n<p>To solve this, we will export IDBs using the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>\"&lt;path-to-idaq.exe&gt;\" -A -OExporterModule:&lt;result-directory&gt; -S\"&lt;path-to-export-script&gt;\" \"&lt;path-to-idb&gt;\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>export-script</code> is an <code>.idc</code> with the following code:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;idc.idc&gt;\n\nstatic main()\n{\n    Batch(0);\n    Wait();\n    Exit(1 - RunPlugin(\"zynamics_binexport_8\", 2));\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once you have all your <code>.BinExport</code> files in one directory, run the original <code>differ.exe</code> command on that directory (give it the directory with the <code>.BinExport</code> files instead of the <code>.idb</code> files), and you'll get <code>.BinDiff</code> files for all possible diffs. Those can either be opened up in IDA, or manually parsed (they are SQLite databases).</p>\n</div>",
