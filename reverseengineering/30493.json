    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I currently don't have a pc. I have two rooted devices <code>Arm64</code> host device with Debian rootfs and the device to be debugged which contains the lldb-server binary <code>armv7</code>. I am trying to remote debug my android device using LLDB. I pulled the <code>lldb-server</code> binary from android ndk24 and put it in <code>/data/local/tmp</code>. Installed Debian sid on <code>another term</code> and <code>apt</code> installed <code>lldb</code>.</p>\n<p>I connected client device via wifi-hotspot (one with <code>lldb-server</code>) using the host with the linux rootfs.</p>\n<p>The commands I ran on server device</p>\n<pre><code>./data/local/tmp/lldb-server platform --listen \"*:2000\"Â  --server\n</code></pre>\n<p>Checked using <code>netstat</code> and the lldb-server had bound to all addresses(<code>0.0.0.0:2000</code>)</p>\n<p>On host(client <code>lldb</code>) device in <code>debian sid</code> terminal I ran:</p>\n<pre><code>apt install lldb\nlldb\nplatform select remote-android\nplatform connect connect://192.168.201.132:2000\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then I got <code>error failed connect port</code>.</p>\n<p>However, using <code>GDB</code> and <code>gdbserver</code> everything worked perfectly. I have tried installing <code>lldb</code> on <code>debian buster</code> but same result and even ran the <code>lldb-server</code> binary on the host(device with <code>debian sid</code>) but same result. Right now I'm stuck here. How do I solve this?</p>\n<p>Help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong> Here is output of <code>telnet</code></p>\n<pre><code>root@localhost:~# telnet 192.168.43.1 2000\nTrying 192.168.43.1...\nConnected to 192.168.43.1.\nEscape character is '^]'.\nConnection closed by foreign host.\nroot@localhost:~# telnet 192.168.43.1 5555\nTrying 192.168.43.1...\nConnected to 192.168.43.1.\nEscape character is '^]'.\nKilled\nroot@localhost:~#\n</code></pre>\n<p>And heres same network output from lldb.</p>\n<pre><code>lldb) platform select remote-android\n  Platform: remote-android\n Connected: no\n(lldb) platform connect connect;//192.168.43.1:2000\nerror: Invalid URL: connect;//192.168.43.1:2000\n(lldb) platform connect connect://192.168.43.1:2000\nerror: Failed to connect port\n(lldb)\n</code></pre>\n<p>And now I dont really know the problem. Should i try installing on a different rootfs? Let me do that.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit 2</strong></p>\n<p>Installed ubuntu focal and still got same results on lldb 10.0.0.</p>\n</div>",

Especially Android Studio is known to be \"greedy\" establishing connections automatically in background and thus blocking other programs. Have you checked on the Android device if there is already a network connection?</span>",

Just to be sure what happens if you try to connect to port 2000 using telnet instead of lldb? If that works then something is wrong in the communication between lldb and lldb-sever.</span>",

Although could it be a lldb-server problem maybe i should compile lldb-server myself maybe the android ndk provided one have been stripped off other features and cant be connected to using original lldb?</span>",
