    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>There's a 1999 PC/Mac game that I'm hoping to extract assets from. All game data appears to be stored in various files with the extension <code>.rsc</code>. I've been able to extract all the game's audio from the files, using tools such as Ravioli Explorer and Dragon Unpacker.</p>\n<p>Here's where things get weird: Despite the files all ending in <code>.rsc</code>, changing the extension to <code>.exe</code> and opening it with various executable disassemblers (such as IDA) reveals that the files are in fact Pascal DOS executables  that match the New Executable (NE) Windows file format.</p>\n<p>No idea why that's the case, and I have no idea what I can do with that information. I can't make heads or tails of the raw executable data, and I have no idea if it's even possible to extract working files from them. I know pretty much nothing about this topic, so help would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>I'll link a few of the files in question. If anyone wants to take a look at them and take a crack at it, I would be very grateful: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i51Bp3iPKF9xIdfsaZV4m2CRPE8p6RWs/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">RR2G.zip</a>.</p>\n</div>",
