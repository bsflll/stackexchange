    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I recently decided to embark on the adventure of reverse engineering game save files and I am trying to modify the Eternium game data, I have tried to see similarities between the different saves but the only thing I have found is that they start with \"kdata1004\". I have tried using HxD to find values and I have been asking ChatGPT. It's probably almost impossible but I leave the files in case someone can think of something.</p>\n<p>The structure i choose for the file names is as follows (the original was <code>player.player.dat</code>):</p>\n<p><code>player.player.bak&lt;number of save&gt;.&lt;gems&gt;.&lt;gold&gt;.dat</code></p>\n<p>there can be saves in the middle of these but let's say they are in chronological order from 0 to 4.</p>\n<p>As I said the files are probably encrypted or encoded with some technique so I would be interested to know if anyone knows how.</p>\n<p>Finally I would like to point out that although all the save files start with \"kdata1004.\" there are game files that start with \"kdata1002.\" so that must mean something.</p>\n<p>I leave here a link to the files and the game in stempor if you want to analyze the files on your own.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y_zfikuiujwlit5bR3etYCC2H3fYOIhP?usp=drive_link\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Save files</a><br/>\n<a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/981600/Eternium/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eternium on Steam</a></p>\n</div>",
