    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>New to decompiling, and code generally. Trying to decompile a windows 3.1 game (text adventure), so I can build it up again. Because at the moment it doesn't work (even on windows 3.1).</p>\n<p>I decompiled the exe with <a href=\"http://vbdis4.angelfire.com/VBDIS3.67e_Reloaded_Rev3_DoDi_s_VB3Decompiler.7z\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DoDi (7z File)</a> which was recommended in one of the answers to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3983709/vb3-decompiler\">this question</a> on SO.</p>\n<p>This threw an error when decompiling the exe 'an already known error occurred'. Probably not very helpful, but I mention it just in case.</p>\n<p>So, it decompiled fine to <code>.mak</code>, <code>.frm</code> and <code>.bas</code> files. I compiled the program again in Visual Basic 4, after correcting some syntax problems, but I get a totally non-interactive window in which none of the buttons work.</p>\n<p>This makes me think that it needs to talk to the code in the dll, but is not doing so. DoDi won't decompile dlls, and I have yet to find a decompiler which will handle 16-bit (NE/New Executable) dlls.</p>\n<p>So, I assume I need to decompile this dll too. How? The game files are in  <code>draquest.zip</code>, which is here <a href=\"http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXgamesXpc.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">archived here</a>.</p>\n</div>",

Everything that's going to be needed to interface with it will probably be in Cmdialog.vbx.</span>",

In other words, you always start with the decompiled output, look for errors, fix them, repeat until everything seems ok. What might help you is try various options from <a href=\"http://www.program-transformation.org/Transform/VisualBasicDecompilers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, and compare their outputs  to improve your source code.</span>",

If the event handler functions aren't firing, it's likely because the handlers aren't properly registered in <code>ONLYFORM.FRM</code>. However, you already have the code, so any future questions on how to fix the event handler registration should go to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">https://stackoverflow.com/</a>.</p>\n</div>",
