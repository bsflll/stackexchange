Every segment has a unique name that you can change. A segment with the name .text means that the content of this segment is read-only and not writable. So if a piece of code is accessing this segment and changing a variable value in it, the message in your question will appear and say that the target segment is <strong>considered</strong> read-only, which results in wrong decompiled code.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How can we fix this issue in IDA Pro?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Two workarounds:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Change the <code>segment name</code> to something else: <kbd>View</kbd>-&gt;<kbd>Open</kbd> <kbd>subviews</kbd>-&gt;<kbd>Segments</kbd> (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F7</kbd>), right click on the segment--&gt;Edit, Change the name.</li>\n<li>Change the <code>segment permission</code> to read and write: Follow the above path and check the <code>write</code> and <code>read</code> check boxes.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
