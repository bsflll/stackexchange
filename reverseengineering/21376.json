    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm relatively new to scripting environments in disassemblers. What I am looking for is a way to dump all of the vtable methods from a C++ disassembly in such a way that I can access them later for further programmatic analysis. My intention is to pass them to another framework in order to do symbolic execution. </p>\n<p>Based on my naive understanding of the available options I am going to assume the easiest way to do this is IDA python. </p>\n<p><strong>In IDA Python how can I gather the addresses and bodies of all methods contained in vtables?</strong></p>\n<p>Extra Credit: The same for Binary Ninja or any other disassembler platform. </p>\n</div>",
