    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Generally, it's a complex topic.  There seems to be very little in the way of example or linear progression in to non-trivial examples.  </p>\n<p>It's possible my google-fu is weak, but I can't seem to locate decent tutorials on using binary instrumentation frameworks (Pin, DynamoRIO, other).  </p>\n<p>What resources could someone who is interested use beyond stumbling around until they get it working?  </p>\n<p>After some of the answers, I thought I should tack on that dynamorio.org is sometimes non-responsive.  The project is on googlecode <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/dynamorio/downloads/list\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.  </p>\n</div>",
