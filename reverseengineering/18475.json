    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>While working on this <a href=\"https://transfer.sh/xKTok/rootkit\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kernel module</a>, I noticed IDA somehow resolves some ELF relocations statically. Consider the symbol <code>sys_renameat</code>, which, according to IDA, resides at <code>0x8000720</code> in <code>.bss</code> segment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9EHhS.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9EHhS.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>The raw hex bytes corresponding to the <code>mov</code> instruction at <code>0x800328</code> are <code>A3 20 07 00 08</code></p>\n<p>However, looking at bytes at that specific offset with a hex-editor reveals <code>A3 00 00 00 00</code>. Clearly, there is a relocation which IDA is resolving somehow. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vW1N8.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vW1N8.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><code>readelf -r rootkit</code> confirms this.</p>\n<pre><code>Relocation section '.rel.init.text' at offset 0x119c contains 26 entries:\n Offset     Info    Type            Sym.Value  Sym. Name\n.\n00000059  00001701 R_386_32          00000000   sys_renameat\n.\n</code></pre>\n<p>The symbol information as returned by <code>readelf -s rootkit</code></p>\n<pre><code>Symbol table '.symtab' contains 44 entries:\nNum:    Value  Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name\n.\n23: 00000000     4 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT   15 sys_renameat\n.\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, if I <code>strip</code> the binary, suddenly IDA fails to resolve (<code>mov</code> instruction at <code>0x800328</code>) the relocations any more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/K5Bx9.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/K5Bx9.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>My understanding is, resolving dynamic relocations never depends on symbol information which <code>strip</code> removes. I tried to compute how IDA was computing <code>R_386_32</code> type relocation for <code>sys_renameat</code> according to <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/819-0690/chapter6-79797.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ELF specification</a>, but couldn't figure out what's going on.</p>\n<p>Is IDA resolving relocation correctly in this case/ If so, can someone please explain this behavior?</p>\n</div>",

In 2.6, <code>insmod</code> pretty much just passes the verbatim contents of the LKM file (.ko file) to the kernel and <strong>the kernel does the relocation.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>About relocation resolution by IDA:</p>\n<p>Since the real address of the symbols is not known until runtime but the user expects to see nice names in the disassembly, IDA's ELF loader creates a fake segment (\"extern\") and fills it with placeholders for the external symbols. The relocatable bytes are then patched to point to those fake symbols.</p>\n</div>",
