    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>When I use WinDbg and there's some long operation, I can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Break</kbd> to <em>cancel</em> the current operation (for instance, but not limited to, cancel PDB loading). Or use this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/09sF1.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"WinDbg break\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/09sF1.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>However, whenever I use WinDbg as a backend to IDA, it simply hangs until the current operation has finished. Is there any shortcut for sending a <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Break</kbd> to the WinDbg backend or I just have to wait for it to complete?</p>\n</div>",
