Several files are extracted, but others end up as corrupt archives, or file that are are too small to be actual files. I am not certain that the LZMA compressed data isn't false positive. </p>\n<p>Disassembly with IDA fails, as I do not know the loader address. </p>\n<p>This Cisco help resource suggests that there is some form of compression going on:\n<a href=\"https://supportforums.cisco.com/t5/small-business-support-documents/how-to-recover-a-reboot-loop-on-sx300/ta-p/3134953\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://supportforums.cisco.com/t5/small-business-support-documents/how-to-recover-a-reboot-loop-on-sx300/ta-p/3134953</a></p>\n<p>This help support post confirms that the Firmware is ARM based, but I am not certain as to the exact make of the chip. </p>\n<p>I am aware that previous iterations of the VxWork's Firmware had the loader address in the header. Analysis of the header did not find a useable address at the suggested location (0x14)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WJRHY.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Very likely a VxWorks Header\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WJRHY.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I attempted to match up the strings in the firmware to string tables and was not able to find any string tables, despite a thorough search. This supports my notion that it is compressed, or otherwise packed. </p>\n<p>Lastly, I searched through the binary for probable addresses in order to deduce the loader address. I was not able to find any commonly referenced addresses or ranges. This was especially hard, as none of the binary was able to be correctly analyzed by IDA. </p>\n<p>Am I missing something easy and fundamental here? Is there a special technique for VxWorks firmware? </p>\n</div>",
