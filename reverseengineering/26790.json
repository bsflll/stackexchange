If addr is NULL\n, the segment will be attached at an address selected by the system.\nIf addr is specified, shmat will fail if the segment cannot be\nattached as specified because memory is already allocated near the\naddress specified</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>It seems the code expects 0x58800000 to be a valid address and it isnâ€™t under QEMU.</p>\n<p>You can try to either play with QEMU configuration to make it valid or patch the executable to use 0 instead so the address is determined by the system.</p>\n</div>",

As packages lag behind compiling qemu from source is probably needed.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of weird bugs with user space emulation in general. Sometimes it's a good idea to spin up some light distro with qemu-system (and chroot to your target binaries/libraries) for a sanity check.</p>\n</div>",
