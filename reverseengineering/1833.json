    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm currently trying to gain some practice in RE and I need some help for patching a DLL.\nHere are my steps:\nI first analyze the main program and the dll in IDA trying to understand the logic. I then switch to OllyDBG for patching. Well, the problem is, since Olly dynamically loads the dll (in contrast to the static standalone analysis in IDA), the offsets are different and I don't know how to find the offset that I've inspected in IDA.\nIs there some easy way to \"rediscover\" the offset in the dll?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n</div>",

You can do so by edit-&gt;segments-&gt;Rebase program ... menu. \nSpecifying the same starting base in IDA as is in Olly should help. Base may be different for numerous reasons, one of which might be ASLR.</p>\n</div>",
