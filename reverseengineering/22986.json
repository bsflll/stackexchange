    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to create UART cable for A520F phone with USB type-c. Seems, <a href=\"https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s8+/how-to/hardware-uart-cable-time-t3607499\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there is no UART debug modes S8+ either</a>.  On Samsung phones with micro USB one may access UART JIG mode with  619K resistor, connected to micro USB ID pin. </p>\n<p>How I test:</p>\n<p>I can dump MUIC registers. I have raw usb type c plug(mounted on board with solder pads), with cable soldered, which maps usb type c pins on breadboard. So I assemble test scheme and analyze MUIC registers and MUIC linux kernel module log output upon attachment.</p>\n<p>What I currently find:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The receptacle is managed by s2mu004 kernel module. Module is capable to manage non type-c receptacles (see CONFIG_MUIC_S2MU004_NON_USB_C_TYPE option)</li>\n<li>Receptacle has non standard pinout: B12 (considering, A row facing top, B row facing bottom side of the phone) pin is not connected to the ground.</li>\n<li>Device can detect water in usb receptacle, by measuring resistance between B12 pin.</li>\n<li>Device can detect plug attach, with ALL pins unconnected, including GND and VBUS pins. How?</li>\n<li>Attaching 619K resistor to B12 pin results in ADC_JIG_UART_ON value in ADC register, during water detection sequence.</li>\n<li>Attaching 619K resistor to one of CC pins result in no device connected.</li>\n<li>Enter UART mode by attaching resistors should be possible in NON type-c mode. (file s2mu004-muic.c ,<a href=\"https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_samsung_universal7880/blob/lineage-16.0/drivers/muic/s2mu004-muic.c#L2854\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">lines 2835,2797</a>)</li>\n<li>Device has no USB type-c debug accessory mode(tried both with rd/rd and rp/rp resistors on CC pins) - rd/rd results in OTG mode.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What else can I try?\nIf you were this device developer, how would you hide UART debug mode from users?</p>\n</div>",
