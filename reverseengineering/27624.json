You need to remove the breakpoint and then assign the trace.</p>\n<p>If you set a function to be traced, and it doesn't print anything, put the cursor on the desired function, on the menu press <code>Debugger -&gt; Tracing -&gt; Function tracing</code>.  Try again.</p>\n<p>You can view all the traces in the breakpoint window by pressing  <code>Ctrl+Alt+B</code>.</p>\n</div>",
