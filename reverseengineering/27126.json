    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am searching for a way to replace certain frames on a LIN bus network. My aim is to be able to intercept a frame in transmission, and change certain bits. Naturally, that involves recalculating the checksum.</p>\n<p>The problem I encounter is that after a bit is overwritten on the bus, the transmitting device stops sending data, as it senses the discrepancy on the bus and assumes there's a collision. Is there a way to overcome that behavior?</p>\n</div>",
