    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>During the debugging process, I can use binary edit in order to add commands where I want, etc. However, I can't find any way to add an ASCII string at an address in which I can reference later. If I try to add something like: \"hello\", OllyDBG will just translate the bytes into commands and edit the assembly commands into the program.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to just add the ASCII string into the program?</p>\n</div>",

You can use the hex view to check the bytes.</p>\n<p>You can always use a hexeditor to modify data and code. If you want to 'add' the string, you may need to inflate the file and fix segment/section offsets of the file format you are using.</p>\n<p>Possibly related question:\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23202472/hexadecimal-editing-with-and-without-ollydbg-weird-issue\">Hexadecimal editing with and without ollydbg weird issue</a></p>\n</div>",
