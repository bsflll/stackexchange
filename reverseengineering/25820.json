    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I understand the assembly properly. I am just confused about variable 'b' and 'c'. It looks like b is stored at 12(%ebp). I conclude this from <code>cmp 12(%ebp), %eax</code>. If you look at func_8048516, it is adding -0x4(%ebp) which is 'i' and 12(%ebp) which is b. It should translate into <code>a=b+i</code> in the source code but it's <code>a=c+i</code>. Can anyone explain this?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8AwnV.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Assembly code\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8AwnV.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/czeVX.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Source code\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/czeVX.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
