    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am analyzing a dex file and to ease with reverse engineering, I converted it a jar so it could be decompiled. In the file <code>android/support/v17/leanback/media/MediaControllerGlue.class</code>, the following import appears: </p>\n<p><code>import android.support.v4.media.session.MediaControllerCompat;</code></p>\n<p>However, this class is not defined. In fact, there is no <code>android/support/v4/media</code> package in the file. </p>\n<p>To confirm, this, I listed the referenced type in the <code>type_ids</code> section of the dex file, and sure enough, the following type is present: <code>android/support/v4/media/MediaControllerCompat</code>. However, when I then iterate over all entries in the <code>class_defs</code> section, this class is nowhere to be found.</p>\n<p>I am new to Android (this is actually an Amazon Firestick APK) development/reverse engineering so I'm not sure how this is possible. Is there some way of defining classes in a separate library that would exist outside of the APK?</p>\n</div>",
