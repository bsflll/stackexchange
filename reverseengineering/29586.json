The only answer suggests to use graph-easy for Linux. I'm on Windows. How to convert the graph to an image on Windows 10?</p>\n<p>I googled how to convert gdl to image, too, and there's some ArchiCAD software for $3000 or something, and it looks like it's some big program for modeling or whatever. Then there's this online tool which doesn't work: <a href=\"https://fileproinfo.com/tools/viewer/gdl\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://fileproinfo.com/tools/viewer/gdl</a> . Says the preview doesn't work. There's also: Stanford Microarray Database GDL Data . Their site is dead.</p>\n<p>Please help.</p>\n</div>",
