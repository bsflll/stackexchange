    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>While reverse engineering an iPhone app remotely, I set up breakpoints to some function's adresses.</p>\n<p>These adresses comes from the disassembled binary analysed with Hopper, and it seems like they <strong>must</strong> be called by the app. Like <code>user_click_on_blue_buton</code>, or equivalent.</p>\n<p>I checked that the breakpoint are set up correctly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>none is in pending state,</li>\n<li>all have the flag resolved to true: <code>resolved = 1</code>,</li>\n<li>and the disassembled code at these addresses is the same as in the binary statically analysed with Hopper.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But then, when I click on the blue button, lldb does not stop at breakpoint. The process continues like there was no breakpoints. To be exact, some are working, but just a few, not all of them.</p>\n<p>Is it possible that lldb misses the breakpoint ? Or is it because the app is tricking me and these functions are not called ?</p>\n<p>Obviously the app is a released iOS app from the app store. So definitely not compiled to be debugged. Is it the reason ?</p>\n</div>",
