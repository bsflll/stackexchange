Something like 001B5355 from which i know that it is an address. \nHow would I represent it then? Maybe use something like a pointer which would point to 001B5355 ?</p>\n<pre><code>  UnknownType *immediatePointer = &amp;001B5355;\n\n  UnknownType *pointerEAX = *immediatePointer;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I need help because the whole assembly code of the .exe consists of that kind of lines and I do not know how to represent it to imagine how it could implement it. </p>\n</div>",
