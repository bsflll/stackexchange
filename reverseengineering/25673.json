    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm starting to learn about reverse engineering and I'm currently encountering a problem with a game I'm trying to patch. I needed more space to insert instructions in my program so I followed the method described here: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35685589/how-do-i-make-space-for-my-code-cave-in-a-windows-pe-32bit-executable\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35685589/how-do-i-make-space-for-my-code-cave-in-a-windows-pe-32bit-executable</a> and added a new section where I could put my new instructions. Then when I run the program, the instructions are properly executed, no crash happening.</p>\n<p>My issue is that when I'm launching the game, I get a popup asking if I want to \"allow this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your device\", which is annoying. If I display the \"Details\" tab in the properties of the file, most of the information (such as File Description, File version...) are missing when they were there before the patch. Is it an expected consequence of adding a new section at the end of the executable? It looks like those information are inside the .rsrc section.\nAnd is there something I can do to fix it so I don't get the popup?</p>\n</div>",

This hash is compared against the binaryâ€™s in-memory representation at load time, preventing malicious modifications.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Technically it prevents <em>all</em> modifications, not just malicious ones. Crucially, the Authenticode signature covers all data except (<em>also see Note 1</em>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The PE checksum.</li>\n<li>The certificate data directory entry.</li>\n<li>The certificate table (and signatures).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.reversinglabs.com/blog/breaking-the-windows-authenticode-security-model\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> discusses various ways of potentially breaking the Authenticode model (but none are likely to help what you are trying to do).</p>\n<p>Authenticode is designed to stop what you are attempting: modifying the executable without providing a warning.
