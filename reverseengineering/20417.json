These requests are made from JavaScript inside a WebView.</p>\n<p>I use Charles to intercept both HTTP and WebSocket requests, with it I'm able to see how the app successfully connects and speaks to the API with WebSockets.\nThe API uses cookies to authorize connections, the cookies responsible for it are \"ts.default\" and \"ts.default.sig\".</p>\n<p>This is how the request looks in Charles:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OOic6.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Successful request\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OOic6.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>My goal is to be able to speak with the API from a Python script. However, when making the same Upgrade request, making sure to keep all relevant headers, I get a 401 Unauthorized status code:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AlV1i.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AlV1i.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I've uploaded the relevant JavaScript code responsible for such requests <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/v1JwdYVF\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I'm not very proficient with WebSockets and seeing how I've been stuck here for the past few hours I thought maybe someone here could be able to spot what I'm missing.</p>\n</div>",
