But the way you describe it it sounds as if a file system filter driver is involved. All links on the above site were dead, but someone <a href=\"https://github.com/ph0sec/CaptureBAT-client\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">put it on GitHub</a>. A cursory look shows that this is an FS mini-filter, something that is supported to this day. So if you revive the project and overcome the hard code-signing requirements on modern Windows, you could arguably get it to work.</span>",
