Why Ida cannot recognize such famous function? How can I \"help\" Ida to recognize functions like that.</p>\n<p>That makes my reversing more easier.</p>\n</div>",

You can use them to identify common definitions from various libraries. You just need to download the flirt signatures, and let IDA do the work.</p>\n<p>A public flirtdb repo can be found on github <a href=\"https://github.com/Maktm/FLIRTDB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. You can search for others on google too.</p>\n<p>Edit: My bad, totally missed out the ARM linux part. Unfortunately, these signatures are not built into IDA, although I think IDA might have provided some default ones. For ARM linux, I can't seem to find any public ones online, so you may have to generate your own signatures. To do so, you basically generate signatures off precompiled library files. Check out <a href=\"https://www.boozallen.com/s/insight/blog/ida-flirt-signatures-for-linux-binaries.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this guide</a> I found and see if it works for you.</p>\n</div>",
