    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Apologies, if this has been asked before. I am reverse engineering a chinese app that connects to a BLE device, so I can inspect how it transmits the data. Using <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/apk-debugger\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this official guide</a> I decompiled my apk and made it debuggable. However, after importing it and trying to debug the app I'm presented with this message:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To debug the APK, native libraries (*.so files) must have debug symbols.\nThe following libraries are missing debug symbols:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>libBugly.so</li>\n<li>libecc256.so</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the app executes fine it does not stop at any breakpoints.</p>\n<p>The guide tells me I need to attach native debug symbols to those .so-files. How can I do that since I only extracted them from the apk?</p>\n</div>",

Frida does not need any debug symbols. Furthermore I would capture the Bluetooth traffic by enabling <code>Bluetooth HCI snoop log</code> in developer options. Also check the decompiled code (e.g. by Jadx) if you can identify the parts you are interested in.</span>",

Instead, the typical approach would be to use a dynamic instrumentation tool like <a href=\"https://frida.re/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Frida</a>, rather than a debugger, to assist in your reverse engineering attempts. Typically, you may use Frida along with a disassembler like Ghidra, to explore the workings of the app.</p>\n<p>This site is a good place to ask questions on the use of Frida, Ghidra, etc., if you decide to try using them.</p>\n</div>",
