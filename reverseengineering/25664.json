I have a little bit of experience in Gidhra. I have analyzed some C compiled binaries. the C compiled binaries aren't that easy to decompile, I have seen it myself. but how does java decompilation works? tools just extract all source code written in it. you can take this video as an example, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bvKLj0akMM\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Youtube IPPSEC</a>\nPlease tell me the difference between C and Java compiled files decompilation.</p>\n</div>",

Compilation into native code formats eliminates from resulting executable a lot of information that Java code keeps by design, including, but not limited to the following list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Class names</li>\n<li>Method names</li>\n<li>Properties names and types</li>\n<li>Methods borders</li>\n<li>Exact exception definitions</li>\n<li>Class structure</li>\n<li>So called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode_instruction_listings\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">bytecode</a> code of the methods in language which is very easy to understand and decompile because it is reference-based language and contains exact signatures of other called methods by design</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The more we know about the code, the easier it is for us to understand (and decompile) it.</p>\n<p>Java code is executed in Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Native code is executed on the processor directly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JVM</a> is executing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">.jar</a> files.\n.jar files are zip archives that contain <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">.class</a> files with definitions of classes.\nThis format is defined <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and we can find in the referenced document everything that class file contains.
