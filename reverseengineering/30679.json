    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have been attempting to intercept when an app performs a DNS lookup using Frida. I assumed that ultimately a DNS lookup will end up in a libc call to <code>gethostbyname</code> or  <code>getaddrinfo</code> but this does not seem to be the case. For example this Frida trace command does not hit either function</p>\n<pre><code>frida-trace -U -i \"gethostbyname\" -i \"getaddrinfo\" \"com.android.my_app\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>According the answer to <a href=\"https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/218015/how-does-android-do-dns-name-resolution\">this</a> question, the <code>netd</code> daemon might be responsible for DNS resolution on android</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"DNS lookups are centralized in the netd daemon to allow for\nsystem-wide caching, while apps call functions (such as getaddrinfo)\nin Bionic. The query is sent over a UNIX socket to\n/dev/socket/dnsproxyd to the netd daemon, which parses the request and\ncalls getaddrinfo again to issue DNS lookups, then caches the results\nso that other apps can use them.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However hooking this daemon doesn't result in any hits either:</p>\n<pre><code>frida-trace -U -i \"gethostbyname\" -i \"getaddrinfo\" \"netd\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am new to Frida so I am not sure if I am missing something here. I would appreciate some insight into how I can hook the DNS lookup call</p>\n</div>",
