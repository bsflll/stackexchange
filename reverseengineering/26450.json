    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Ive got a Nand image in bin format not encrypted armv4, cpu 80 MHz ARM 7TDMI processor it is a iPod nano 1st generation I want to see what calls the Nand makes because it is married to the motherboard. I have IDA Pro the cpu and version say they are supported by ida on their website but I do not see these options in the cpu selection. how would you go about disassembling a Nand dump to figure out how and why the chip is married to the motherboard. Like the iPhone I think you have to flash an identifier to the new Nand for security reasons.</p>\n</div>",
