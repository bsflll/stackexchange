I had a similar situation for an android game which killed it self the moment it detected debuggers. What I did was, catch syscall <code>kill()</code> and find the instruction which caused it and then changed the condition that caused the call to <code>kill()</code> function. You could do a similar approach but when doing that I used <code>gdb</code>.</p>\n</div>",
