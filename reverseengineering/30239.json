    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I want to enable telnet in my router (<strong>ZTE F670L V9.0.11P1N20D</strong>), So, I backup my router and i have a file <code>config.bin</code>, Size 23.5KB. I fired up kali and when i issue this command:</p>\n<pre><code>$ file config.bin\nconfig.bin: OpenPGP Public Key\n</code></pre>\n<p>I got this above output, I tried to extract this via binwalk, but no success.</p>\n<p>Even though, Telnet is enabled on my router by default but the port is filtered:</p>\n<pre><code>PORT    STATE    SERVICE\n21/tcp  open     ftp\n23/tcp  filtered telnet\n53/tcp  open     domain\n80/tcp  open     http\n139/tcp open     netbios-ssn\n443/tcp open     https\n</code></pre>\n<p>I tried resetting the router but still Port is filtered.\nSo, I hope there's a solution to extract that <code>config.bin</code>.</p>\n</div>",
