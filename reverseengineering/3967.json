I wanted to tap onto their microprocessor and read that code. First question I have, if I am to solder wires to the pins of the microprocessor, to which ones should I solder in order to be able to read anything back? </p>\n<p>Also, I read about <a href=\"https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/18435/what-are-lock-bits/18438#18438\">lock bits</a>, for my own future security, if I leave the lock bits off, is there a method to trigger lock bits on if someone does any hardware changes (as in trying to tap to the microcontroller)?</p>\n</div>",
