They key time to alter it is on the return from a function, when the saved instruction pointer is popped off the stack into <code>eip</code>. If you can overwrite the saved instruction pointer you can redirect program execution.</p>\n<p>Finding a <code>jmp esp</code> at a semi-predictable place in memory allows you to redirect execution to the top of the stack reliably.</p>\n<p>So the process would be something like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overwrite saved instruction pointer (ebp+4) on the stack with the address of <code>jmp esp</code> in the .dll.</li>\n<li>When the function returns, execution continues at the <code>jmp esp</code> instruction.</li>\n<li>The <code>jmp esp</code> then redirects execution to the top of the stack where your payload is waiting.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
