The first and second screenshot could easily be replaced by a code block, which would aid search engines trying to index our site. The reason I ask <i>you</i> to do it, is because you only have to copy &amp; paste. However, I or anyone else would have to sit down and type down what's seen on the screenshots.</span>",
