    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am using IDA Pro to debug an ELF binary remotely.</p>\n<p>While debugging, I want to search for a specific address in the hex dump. In Olly debugger, we have the option to follow any address or register in the hex dump. Is there a similar option in IDA Pro?</p>\n<p>I noticed that IDA Pro has an option to synchronize the hex dump with a specific register. However, I need to search for a specific address, how do I do that?</p>\n<p>I checked the Jump menu in IDA Pro and there was no option. The \"Jump to address\" or G option is to search in the code section. Is there a similar option for searching in hex dump as well?</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n</div>",
