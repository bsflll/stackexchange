It uses OllyDbg as the primary program. (I'd be more interested personally in using IDA, however). Is that so? I'm very interested in getting more intense into my learning of reverse engineering, and I don't want to go too deeply if it won't provide me with a solid base.</p>\n<p>What's the general consensus on these tutorials, or is there something better out there?</p>\n</div>",

But a lot of what you'll have to learn is assembler language, OS calls, stack usage, file formats etc., and that isn't really dependent on tools. However, a tutorial that uses a debugger will be more likely to teach that than a tutorial that's about using IDA - IDA takes a \"higher level\" approach, and a lot about reversing is a good understanding of the \"low levels\".</span>",
