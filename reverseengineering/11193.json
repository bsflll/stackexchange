Either this file is not\n  a zipfile, or it constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive.  In the\n  latter case the central directory and zipfile comment will be found on\n  the last disk(s) of this archive.\nnote:  nospaces.zip may be a plain executable, not an archive\nunzip:  cannot find zipfile directory in one of nospaces.zip or\n        nospaces.zip.zip, and cannot find nospaces.zip.ZIP, period.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I found that I could use <code>zip -FF --out</code> to 'fix' the zip file and extract the embedded contents but would like to understand what I might be doing wrong when saving the contents of the original file between 0x504B0304 and 0x506B0506</p>\n<p>I got the same results in WinHex (32bit Windows 10 VM) and HexFiend (OSX 10.10.5 - 64bit.)</p>\n<p>Can anyone suggest what I might have done wrong when editing the file? </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7ZhTE.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7ZhTE.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/E2vqi.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/E2vqi.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
