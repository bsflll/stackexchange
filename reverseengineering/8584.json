    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to unpack a DLL and fix the import tables with ImpRec. However, I am stuck with this error.  Following is what I have tried. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Modified the flag in its PE header so that windows loads the file as an exe, not a dll. </li>\n<li>Loaded to Immunity Debugger and found the real entry point(Entry point of unpacked binary)</li>\n<li>Dumped the the binary at this entry point.</li>\n<li>Now I opened ImpREC to fix the import table of the of the dumped DLL. However, in ImpREC the base memory displayed is 7100000. When I give \"068BA2A0\" as entry point, ImpRec complaints invalid OEP!. I dont understand how the base address of the debugged process is \"7100000\". I suspect this could be the problem.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/X3C6W.png\"/></p>\n<p>Why is this error? Any pointers to fix it? </p>\n</div>",

Which means it will NOT use the relocated DLL imagebase. 2 options :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 - Untick it in options and reselect your target</li>\n<li>2 - Use a custom PE header with Advanced commands / Load PE Header</li>\n</ul>\n<p>-&gt; First choice is the best for your case.</p>\n<p>Explaination : the reason \"Use PE Header From Disk\" is enabled by default, comes from protector which destroys the header in memory so it's best to rely on disk but it's bad for DLL.</p>\n</div>",
