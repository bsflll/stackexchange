Try to get rid of constructs specific for the assembler version and convert it into a more \"C\" natural form. This is what @rce did in his answer.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Try to understand the logic behind the constructs. Change the \"register-like\" variable names to \"speaking\" names connected to the logical meaning of the code. This is not possible from your example as you only provide two(!) lines of assembly code.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Re-write the whole thing step-by-step in logical terms only.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Always compare whether the output is correct. Even if steps 1 to 4 could be realized differently, this step is indispensible.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As this seems tedious, for more complex algorithms (which cannot be recognized by other means like the use of known \"magic numbers\"), this can be a successful strategy for a proper reverse engineering of non-trivial assembler code. It can become difficult, e.g. if you have \"<a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2221/what-is-a-control-flow-flattening-obfuscation-technique\">flattened</a>\" code or algorithms which contain vectorized code realized with intrinsics.</p>\n</div>",
