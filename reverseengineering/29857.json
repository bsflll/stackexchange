You'd have to undo the section alignment and return to file alignment, that part is trivial. Then you'd have to record the base address and use that to undo relocations (if any). But since you state it's a rootkit, are you sure you are even getting to see everything there is to see from user mode? Have you considered setting Windows to create a full dump (<code>pagefile.sys</code> must be set to system-managed before and rebooted once after the change) and analyze that? The kernel view of memory should be more complete.</span>",

So right now i am mostly looking to see if there is any tool available that can help me with this or not. Obviously i can write a very complex script that creates a PE from this dump, but if someone has already written it, there is no point, since it is very common for malwares to remove many parts of their PE headers and only keep those that are needed.</span>",

I think most emphasize the reconstruction of the import table, though, because this (along with relocations) is the tougher nut to crack, compared to fixing section vs. file alignment.</span>",
