    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I recently downloaded Ghidra (<a href=\"https://ghidra-sre.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a>) ver 9 on windows.</p>\n<p>The decompiler feature is presumable found at </p>\n<pre><code>&lt;GHIDRA_HOME&gt;\\Ghidra\\Features\\Decompiler\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is a lib folder containing the Java code. Then there is an os folder containing binaries for 3 different platforms (win, mac and linux) around 2.4 - 2.9 MB each per platform.</p>\n<p>My questions</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>This makes Ghidra not truly portable. If there is a reason to do this, then why not use JNI/JNA instead? Why take the dirty route of launching an executable?</p></li>\n<li><p>Is the decompiler open source but written in native code? Can you point out the source codes location for such? If its not provided then can we say its truly open source (read backdoors!) If the decompiler's job is just to spit out pseudo-c code from the dissembly, then 2+ MB is an overkill for such a component, assuming a low-level language like C/C++ is used to write it.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
