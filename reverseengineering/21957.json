According to that article <code>FltSendMessage</code> sends message to <code>FilterGetMessage</code>, still don't have clue if user-mode sends the driver filtering conditions. If it does it should happen in <code>FilterConnectCommunicationPort </code> or <code>FilterSendMessage</code> no?</span>",

I concur with your hypothesis, but only actual reverse engineering will tell. It makes sense for user mode to do the filtering for two reasons: 1. user mode doesn't have the memory limitations (NonPagedPool in particular) kernel mode code has and 2. the way the filtering works, most driver developers in their right mind would opt to run that in user mode rather than risk doing these operations in kernel mode. Obviously it can be done, but not everything possible is a good idea.</span>",

This approach is used in Microsoft  driver samples.\nIf I remember correctly - that it is:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/blob/master/filesys/miniFilter/scanner\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/blob/master/filesys/miniFilter/scanner</a></p>\n<p>I think it is good example to understand mini-filter driver and user mode app communication.</p>\n</div>",
