Its not always there but when it is its the best choice. </li>\n<li>Since you are already debugging and reversing it, you can always hook it's fullscreen request API (usually <code>ChangeDisplaySettings</code> or <code>ChangeDisplaySettingsEx</code> on Windows).</li>\n<li>If you can't hook or find the fullscreen API (if the software has anti-debugging it might be kind of a chicken and egg problem), you can always call <code>ChangeDisplaySettings</code> yourself and disable fullscreen mode after getting a window handle for the program's fullscreen window. </li>\n<li>Or you could simply use one of many existing tools for exactly that, they're covered in this SO question: <a href=\"https://superuser.com/questions/318748/force-fullscreen-games-to-in-window-mode\">https://superuser.com/questions/318748/force-fullscreen-games-to-in-window-mode</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hope that helps :)</p>\n</div>",
