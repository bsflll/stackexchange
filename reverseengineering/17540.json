Most of the idioms you are citing are used by compilers to perform a precise task in a more efficient manner than what you can see in the manuals.</p>\n<p>The best way to learn about it is to read compiler generated assembly code and/or shellcodes. They are a great source of assembly idioms.</p>\n<p>Here is a list of good readings or links to investigate all these idioms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1502958082\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">xchg rax,rax</a> by xorpd;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.hackersdelight.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hacker's Delight (2nd Edition)</a> by Henry S.
