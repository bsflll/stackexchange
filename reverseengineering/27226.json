When I analyzed the decompiled version of a function, it resulted in this following  output.</p>\n<pre><code>{\n                    /* WARNING: Treating indirect jump as call */\n  (*(code *)0x1b8318)();\n  return;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I did some more digging and found that most functions lead back to the same thing with the same message. I did some research online and found a solution where I should change the value stored at the address (0x1b8318) to a function pointer. Would this work?</p>\n</div>",

For example the call could be from application to firmware for example.</p>\n</div>",
