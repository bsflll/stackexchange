    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I would like to automate calling the DeepScanVariable function from the HexRaysPyTools right-click menu (that serves to reconstruct structures).</p>\n<p>I have changed the arguments types for a list of functions, based on data gathered at run-time. Now, I would like to go over that list of functions, and for each argument of a given type, select that argument, right-click, and select Deep Scan Variable.</p>\n<p>What that HexRaysPyTools function does is roughly:</p>\n<pre><code>def activate(self, ctx):\n    hx_view = idaapi.get_widget_vdui(ctx.widget)\n    obj = api.ScanObject.create(hx_view.cfunc, hx_view.item)\n    (...)\n</code></pre>\n<p>I already found the action name by calling <code>idaapi.get_registered_actions()</code>.\nThen I give focus to the decompilation view, to make <code>get_widget_vdui</code> happy and fire the action:</p>\n<pre><code>widget = idaapi.find_widget('Pseudocode-A')\nidaapi.activate_widget(widget, 1)\nidaapi.process_ui_action('HexRaysPyTools:DeepScanVariable')\n</code></pre>\n<p>What's missing is that I'm supposed to select the item, so that <code>hx_view.item</code> has the correct value and I cannot find any way to do that. I can iterate over arguments of a decompiled function just fine, I just cannot find a way to actually mark an item as selected.</p>\n</div>",

            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>If you <a href=\"https://github.com/igogo-x86/HexRaysPyTools/blob/master/HexRaysPyTools/api.py#L21\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">look closer at that code in HexRaysPyTools</a>, you'll see the following:</p>\n<pre><code>    def create(cfunc, arg):\n        # Creates object suitable for scaning either from cexpr_t or ctree_item_t\n        if isinstance(arg, idaapi.ctree_item_t):\n            # ... code for ctree_item_t ...\n        else:\n            cexpr = arg\n\n        if cexpr.op == idaapi.cot_var:\n            lvar = cfunc.get_lvars()[cexpr.v.idx]\n            result = VariableObject(lvar, cexpr.v.idx)\n            result.ea = ScanObject.get_expression_address(cfunc, cexpr)\n            return result\n</code></pre>\n<p>So if you can get your hands on a <code>cexpr_t</code> containing the <code>lvar_t</code> that you want, you're good to go. For example, you could write a small visitor class whose <code>visit_expr</code> method looks for <code>cexpr_t</code> objects of type <code>cot_var</code>, whose <code>.var</code> field refers to the <code>lvar_t</code> object that you want. Alternatively, you could perhaps edit the code to accept a raw <code>lvar_t</code> (though pay close attention to the call to <code>ScanObject.get_expression_address</code>).</p>\n<p>What I would do would be to edit the code so that it reads as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>def create(cfunc, arg):\n    # Creates object suitable for scaning either from cexpr_t or ctree_item_t OR lvar_t\n    if isinstance(arg, idaapi.lvar_t):\n        index = list(cfunc.get_lvars()).index(arg)\n        return VariableObject(arg, index)\n    # ... rest of function as before ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then you can simply call the function above with an <code>lvar_t</code> object you get from <code>mba_t::vars</code>. You can use <code>mba_t::argidx</code> to look up arguments by their index, and if you need to look up a variable by location, note that <code>lvar_t</code> derives from <code>lvar_locator_t</code>, which in turn contains a <code>vdloc_t</code> (which derives from <code>argloc_t</code>). I.e., you can use <code>lvar_t::location</code> to inspect the physical location of a given <code>lvar_t</code> if you need to look up arguments by location instead of by numeric index.</p>\n<p>In general, it seems like you've made a lot of progress getting to this point. Don't let the Hex-Rays SDK scare you; if <code>HexRaysPyTools</code> doesn't do what you want, try modifying it. If that still doesn't work, read the code deeper to figure out why not, and reimplement the logic if you have to.</p>\n</div>",
