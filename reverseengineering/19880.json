    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Note: I am only doing this for educational purposes with no intent to redistribute</p>\n<p>I have decompiled an APK built with Unity successfully (Somewhat).\nUsing an array of programs, I managed to extract all the games assets and the scripts, though I am trying to re-construct it in unity to debug. I imported all the original scenes, and how they were set up (including all the attached scripts required) though I am receiving anywhere from 200-999+ errors in the console before I even run.</p>\n<p>Some of these issues are from invalid characters (Decompiler-Generated fields) within scripts, which can easily be resolved by renaming them to a friendlier format, however, I sat here for a good hour resolving these errors, when I completed the last shown error, i hit play, and it generated another few hundred errors. </p>\n<p>Why would it be that, if I was able to extract the scripts successfully (seemingly zero obfuscation), that, when imported into unity, I am thrown so many errors? Why is this not a 1:1 translatable process? Or is this problem based upon too many variables to be determined based off my question?</p>\n<p>Programs used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dnSPY</li>\n<li>UtinyRipper</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
