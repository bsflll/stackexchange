    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Shortly, there is cheap chinese bluetooth lamp that can change colors by app on Android. </p>\n<p>I am basically reading communication logs on my phone and retrieving communication protocols of the app. Then, I am writing my own app to connect to that lamp. I am not even using any reverse engineering tools. It is basic Android developer's tool set, which can be enabled on any phone.</p>\n<p>I am writing my thesis based on this app. And as I see, it is uncommercial, interoperability aimed, use of reverse engineering. \"Soft reverse engineering\", if it is a thing :)</p>\n<p>But my thesis supervisor has got super paranoid concerning the law, so now I have to dig into it... </p>\n<p>Could you, please, drop me some sources with legal acts or similar court cases... I would really appreciate if you will write short explanation for me, because english is not even my second language, and I am getting dizzy from lawyers' vocabulary :^j</p>\n<p>P.s.: the country is Finland, though Europe and even US laws and cases would also fit.</p>\n</div>",

That said, in my opinion this is likely to be covered by the interoperability exception. Nobody can say for sure, but unless you actively set out to make financial harm to the company it's unlikely they will take any action, at least outside of their home country.</span>",
