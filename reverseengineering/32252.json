Reader B is from a Canon printer. The card numbers read by reader B are 1.52 times larger than those read by reader A for the same card.</p>\n<p>Is there a genius who can help me figure out the encryption algorithm of the NFC reader B?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Here are some card data for reference.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>card1:\nreader A：0565932061\nreader B：0863528701</p>\n<p>card2:\nreaderA：0100347102\nreaderB：0153111486</p>\n<p>card3:\nreaderA：1816830668\nreaderB：2772241676</p>\n<p>card4:\nreaderA：1530064599\nreaderB：2363059447</p>\n<p>card5:\nreaderA：3783796822\nreaderB：5773610326</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>my card is standard mifare m1 card.\nreader B is from cannon c5560i printer.\nAccording to the ISO14443-a standard：The first four bytes of my card is 1D 70 BB 21, reversing the orde gives 21 BB 70 1D which is the value 565932061 in decimal.</p>\n<p>so:\nreader A：0565932061 ：ISO standard</p>\n<p>reader B：0863528701 ：unknown</p>\n<p>As you can see the value B shows is approximately 1.52 times more，So I think it's possible to find an algorithm compared to those with irregular encryption.</p>\n<p>Who can help me figure out the encryption algorithm of the NFC reader B?</p>\n</div>",

Probably this is a way to hide a card no from you :-)</span>",
