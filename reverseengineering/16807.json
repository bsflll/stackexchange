I could not find the info I need from these fields but when I investigate the token address a little bit I am beginning to see strings like <code>uid</code>. What is the type of structure windbg uses to get all of this information? (Both debugger and debuggee have 32 bit architecture).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/i2p5s.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"uid_from_address\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/i2p5s.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
