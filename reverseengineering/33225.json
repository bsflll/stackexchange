At all. (Minipro under linux does the same garbage as the Windows utility, XGecu support hasn't responded, and their forum has a broken account setup process. Tried updating both the program and device too. No change.)</p>\n<p>Is there a quick Arduino sketch out there that supports the old \"CMOS\" chips? Or some sort of parallel port project that supports the same chip? (NOPPP is.... Eh? That homebrew DOS program doesn't inspire confidence.)</p>\n</div>",

If you know that the code is not protected against readout, and the tools know the device, what is the error you see? (Please clarify by <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/posts/33225/edit\">edit</a>ing your question, this is not a forum.) -- It is a simple task to write your own readout tool for an Arduino, for example. I did so for a PIC10 some months ago.</span>",

Interestingly, the \"NOPPP\" parallel programmer I built does the same thing (Although the software only supports microcontrollers mostly similar to the 16c71).</span>",
