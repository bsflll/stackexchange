But now all I can see is a bunch of rubbish. No structure, nearlly a maximum of entropy, no periods nothing. I have no more information except:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the size of 5120 KByte</li>\n<li>there is more than one file inside of this</li>\n<li>they are all of the same type</li>\n<li>the used encryption or compression or whatever algorithm is used is some \"standard\" one</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I tested so many things ... Does anyone of you has a clue on how to go forward? I am running out of ideas.</p>\n<p>Edit: The histogram which has been now deleted was not correct. Anyway I have no idea how to go on further. Trying to open it with truecrypt to be sure it is not a container didn't work. Do you have any more tips on how to find the files in this?</p>\n</div>",

In addition, calculate its MD5 value and look it in the Net, VirusTotal.
