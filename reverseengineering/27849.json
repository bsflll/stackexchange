You just have to identify the <code>if</code> statement that branches on the result of the equals comparison. Usually this should be an <code>if-nez</code> or <code>if-eqz</code> . Depending on if you want to keep the if or the else part just comment out that line or replace it with an <code>goto</code> and delete the parameter from the if (only leave the jump target). That disables the SHA-checking of the whitelist.</span>",

Sadly I have used text search to find it and was not able to find out how <code>2131689879</code> leads to resource.arsc/res/values/strings.xml. But I get the Idea of it. @Robert I did try to remove every <code>if</code> in the smali <code>j()</code> method one after another, but it did not work. Would be cool to remove the checksumming, but replace the string also works.</span>",

            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">Do not just remove all if commands, only remove the one you want to skip. Jadx provides both Java and Smali view, switch between them and map Java code to Smali code do identify which if statement to modify (remove or replace with permanent branch). The <code>BigInteger</code> usage should be a good place to start as it is close to the conditional branch and it is only used right before that point.</span>",
