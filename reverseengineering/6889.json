Once the disassembly pane is active (black disassembly text instead of gray disassembly text), you can then right click and find <kbd>Remove analysis from module</kbd> in the context menu:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"OllyDbg v1.10 screenshot\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Sa6oX.png\"/></p>\n</div>",

Given that OllyDbg didn't do a code analysis on that region, there's no analysis that needs to be removed. So if you're following a tutorial, you can skip the \"Remove analysis from module\" step.</span>",

For example if the value is larger than the code section size OllyDbg won't show the <strong>Analyze Code</strong> option. Like what Jason Geffner said if the option <strong>Remove analysis from module</strong> is missing then the Analyze wasn't made. You can also try to use <strong>AnalyzeThis!</strong> plugin.</p>\n</div>",
