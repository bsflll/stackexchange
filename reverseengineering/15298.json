If I am correct, the hex base address for the firmware running on that specific device ( a specific GPS device with a nice sunlight visible screen) is 0x80200000 , and indeed it is a little indian 32 bits arm code. There is a primary boot code also loaded at 0x80100000, and from the web surfing I made, that is to initialize among others the RAM. The entry point is not 100% easy to locate in the firmware bin file, and I am at that stage. I will now start to lo</span>",
