    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Note: Not sure if this kind of question belongs here but as long as this won't fit anywhere else this site is the closest.</p>\n<p>Back to the topic, I have a python file which I obfuscated it and anytime I want to turn this into executable using <code>pyinstaller</code> there's a <code>0x90</code> byte at the beginning of file which it can't be decoded using <code>UTF-8</code>. When I run the program it shows me this error:</p>\n<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"test.py\", line 500, in &lt;module&gt;\n  File \"test.py\", line 481, in djxvCOWAMQFNXLmkmwHopqHMWeJWqRRfaTYhtVQhEjhYQByjCUhjZmlyRVkSKqsEcxYRXketUHcQvObBfTQifGMfTOEsxpDzumWrevMKrXWYeXWOqinkNlbvZDoeaQMo\n  File \"test.py\", line 236, in CjpiLgqGSPHXaLfOKvPztQfChQlzklDoKWuieQOqmnPEnVxqRophKppuTPUSrlAdiWNiSOwcKqyDZoQSJsvmVPUVLFIQvRZbwSFHZQdLkwgXSoPoFJbjsZnrLKWkjKnZ\n  File \"codecs.py\", line 322, in decode\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x90 in position 2: invalid start byte\n</code></pre>\n<p>Not sure how do I deal with this, I have tried different naming of variable and still the same thing. Can someone help me a bit with this? Thanks in advance!</p>\n</div>",

My specific problem was related that <code>0x90</code> byte on my file was a <code>latin</code> character which <code>UTF-8</code> couldn't recognize. On top of my file I wrote <code># -- coding: latin-1 --</code> and it was fixed. For anyone curios the little pest was this character <code>Ãˆ</code> at byte <code>0x90</code>.</p>\n</div>",
