    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I just started playing around with reverse engineering and Ghidra, so please bear with me.</p>\n<p>I wanted to run an old game. One <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lz-2_20220119\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">version</a> available on archive.org does not work even when I have mounted the ISO, the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/Loewe2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">other one</a> does. As a learning exercise, I wanted to try patching the latter anyway: <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/Loewe2/Loewe2.iso/Setup%2FWinRoot%2FTerzio%2FLoewenzahn%202%2FLoewenzahn%202.exe\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://archive.org/download/Loewe2/Loewe2.iso/Setup%2FWinRoot%2FTerzio%2FLoewenzahn%202%2FLoewenzahn%202.exe</a></p>\n<p>When I run the exe without the ISO mounted I get the error message <strong>Bitte die CD-ROM \"Löwenzahn 2\" einlegen!</strong>, which means <strong>Please insert CD-ROM \"Löwenzahn 2\"!</strong>.</p>\n<p>So I ran <code>strings -t x Loewenzahn\\ 2.exe | grep einlegen</code> and got the output <code>17020  einlegen!</code>. I found the same address using the hex-editor Okteta.</p>\n<p><code>file Loewenzahn\\ 2.exe</code> gives the following output:</p>\n<pre><code>Loewenzahn 2.exe: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now when I import Loewenzahn 2.exe into Ghidra and run all analyzers, there's a discrepancy between the addresses and I can't find the string \"einlegen\" via Search &gt; For Strings....</p>\n<p>Ghidra:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LQE4w.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LQE4w.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Okteta:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/V2B1w.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/V2B1w.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Why is there an offset and can I configure Ghidra to start at 0? Can I configure Ghidra to show the raw strings, like \"Th is program canno t be run in DOS mode\"? And how can I find it using the String search?</p>\n</div>",

But on a strict perspective this data does not belong to the executable as it was just appended. A common example for such executables are self-extracting archives and installers. May be Ghidra only shows you the actual executable content? As the executable seems to be an installer I would check if a program like 7Zip can extract it.</span>",
