    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am learning by doing some cracking in files that i made in C. One of this files is this:</p>\n<p>file.c:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n\nint main() {\n        char s[15] = \"disassemba\";\n        int x;\n        x=555;\n        printf(\"%d\",x);\n\n        if (x == 2000) {\n                printf(\"You win\");\n        } else {\n                printf(\"You lose\");\n        }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So i compile with: gcc file.c -o file</p>\n<p>open the file with radare: r2 -w file</p>\n<p>The commands i use is the following, in radare2, in order:</p>\n<pre><code>aaa\ns main\nV\n</code></pre>\n<p>in visual mode, i need modify the line of code where sets x=555 to x=2000. So i navigate in visual mode to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vYZ0N.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vYZ0N.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>And i hit shift+a, but when i try insert</p>\n<pre><code>mov dword [var_4h], 0x7D0\n</code></pre>\n<p>the file is not patched (no changes in asm code).</p>\n<p>any hint?</p>\n<p>note:Preferably in some easy way where i can write the code in asm and not in machine code.</p>\n</div>",

So you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <code>r2 -w</code></li>\n<li>Reopen the file in read-write inside the r2 shell with the <code>oo+</code> command</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Actually, if you do what you said, it shows an error message saying exactly what i said above to do (-w or oo+). Hope that helps</p>\n</div>",
