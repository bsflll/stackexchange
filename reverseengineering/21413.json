In Immunity I notice a call to EAX which points to <code>004019c0</code>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZvjkY.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"immunity eax\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZvjkY.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Looking in IDA I notice this call is identified as <code>___dyn_tls_init_callback</code>. I want to better understand how IDA gets this name and applies to this address. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uwuWL.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"ida eax named\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uwuWL.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>If I follow the function in IDA via xrefs I see a reference to the code with a label provided by IDA but I'm unsure where this name comes from. How can I figure out how IDA got this name? I'd like to understand further so I can do the work myself in Immunity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5556T.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"ida xref followed\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5556T.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
