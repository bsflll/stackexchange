I'm considering two 5 hour sessions.</p>\n<p>The objective is for the students to be able to use linux tools and and reverse engineering tools (specifically radare2/GDB) to start doing CTFs and crackmes to practice. The target audience is software engineers, developers and students. Having said that and after a few conversations with potential participants, quality here is mediocre at best so I rather prepare for the worse and assume some participants won't even know the behind the scenes of a compilation process.</p>\n<p>What I have so far is the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Linux usage</li>\n<li>Memory map</li>\n<li>Binary sections</li>\n<li>Passing function arguments</li>\n<li>Radare installation</li>\n<li>Quick intro to x86 assembler</li>\n<li>Gdb</li>\n<li>Stacks - return address</li>\n<li>stack canaries</li>\n<li>Buffer overflows</li>\n<li>Shellcode</li>\n<li>Nop slides</li>\n<li>CTFâ€™s challenges</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
