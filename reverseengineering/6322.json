    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I bought a used iPhone from someone, but I accidentally got a lock screen on the phone and can't figure out what the passcode is. Long story short, how does iOS hash the passcodes for entry, what kind of salt/etc. does it use, where would it store it, and is it possible to mount the internal drive (I'm guessing SSD?) where it stores the passcode? </p>\n<p>Anyone familiar with iOS reverse engineering? Coding/development? Can one mount the whole filesystem and copy the files/decrypt/reverse engineer/view them/hex edit them/etc. (the files of the hashed/encrypted passcode)? I am all up for this 100%; just need some people more familiar with iOS to set me in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Why other alternatives aren't good enough:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Can't factory restore; all <strong><em>very important</em></strong> data will be lost that was not backed up.</p></li>\n<li><p>There's no way to bypass the lock-screen on this iOS version. Only way would be to determine where it stores the hashed/cryptographic passcode on the disk and figure out what it is to re-gain entry.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>To be blunt, I'm striving to password crack my own device. On Android this is easy, but I have heard of absolutely no one getting this done with iDevices/iOS.</p>\n</div>",
