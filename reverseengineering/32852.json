Pulling the binary and running <code>otool -L</code> on it reveals, unsurprisingly, that it's linked against <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreMedia.framework/CoreMedia</code>.  However, that directory on the phone doesn't have any file called <code>CoreMedia</code>.  In fact, all it has are two <code>.plist</code> files and some text file called <code>CodeResources</code>.</p>\n<p>Where is the actual Mach-O file for the CoreMedia framework?</p>\n</div>",

You can find this cache on the phone at <code>/System//Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld/dyld_shared_cache_arm64</code>.
