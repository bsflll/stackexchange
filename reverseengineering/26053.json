I have obtained the password, but now I need use the program to read &amp; print a restricted file to which the executable has access.</p>\n<p>I can see from the executable's main function through radare2 that there is a \"login\" section that asks for a password and this then proceeds to execute a system command that prints the restricted file.</p>\n<p>However, it seems the program flow skips past this section and terminates the program.</p>\n<p>Given an address or a string reference, how can I use radare2 to execute the program from a certain point so that I can avoid skipping it?</p>\n<p>From this:</p>\n<pre><code>entry point 0x00000\n|\n|  desired section 0x000c8 \"enter password: \"\nv\ntermination 0x000f9 \"no entry\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>To this:</p>\n<pre><code>entry point\n|\n|_-&gt; desired section 0x000c8 \"enter password: \" -&gt; 0x000ca \"cat /root/file.txt\" -\n                                                                                 |\ntermination 0x000f9 &lt;-___________________________________________________________|\n\n\n\n \n</code></pre>\n</div>",
