    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've been reverse-engineering Windows PE files and I've discovered this pattern used quite often, making it a little more difficult to follow API calls. First, I'll go to the file's imports and then I will locate a specific import, such as <strong>WSAStartup</strong>, inside of the .idata section of the PE file pictured here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZaHCs.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"idata section\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZaHCs.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Upon hitting the <code>x</code> or <code>Ctrl-x</code> keys to cross-reference where this function is called, it is only \"called\" in one spot recognized by IDA, which looks like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3FhEt.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Jumps to functions\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3FhEt.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>The question here is, <em>what is the above-pictured structure/technique?</em> It directly contrasts the \"typical\" setup that I come across which is simply going to .idata, cross-referencing a function, and having it show me areas <em>directly called in code</em>. There are also no direct references to the memory addresses in which each of these jumps reside, such as 14658844h.</p>\n<p>I'm going to add one more figure here of a different file but similar sighting, in which case, this instance appears on the control-flow graph and is very obvious by the \"orphaned\" jmps you can see just above the red arrow:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SrwIC.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SrwIC.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>My hypothesis here is that somehow these memory addresses (function ptrs) pictured in Figure 2 where the jumps reside, are somehow indirectly referenced in the code using some offsets to help mask the usage of these API functions. Is this a compiler feature or is this a manual doing?</p>\n</div>",

Also, is there a specific area of study which covers this... For example would something like this be in an x86 assembly text or is this specific to the compiler completely?</span>",
