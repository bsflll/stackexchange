    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>My goal is stated in the title. However, I think there is a fundamental issue with gdbserver. In particular, I create an aarch64 alpine docker container on a x86_64 Ubuntu 16.04 host using</p>\n<p><code>sudo docker run --rm -it -p 12345:12345 -v /host_dir:/container_dir --privileged arm64v8/alpine /bin/ash</code></p>\n<p>I then proceed to install <code>gdb</code> in the container using <code>apk add gdb</code>. Subsequently I run <code>ps aux</code> just to get a list of the processes running in the container in order to test <code>gdbserver --attach COMM...PID</code> command in the container. Interestingly absolutely no output no matter how much time goes on. As a result, I switch to the host and simply do the same exercise on the Ubuntu machine, i.e., I attach to a random process with <code>pid</code> 23056. The output to <code>gdbserver --attach :12344 23056</code> is <code>Attached; pid = 23056 Listening on port 12344</code>, which is what I expected to happen with gdbserver in the container. Any help as to why <code>gdbserver</code> in the container doesn't behave properly is appreciated!</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong></p>\n<p>I tried again and first ran <code>sudo docker run --rm -it --privileged -p 7777:7777 -v home_dir:container_dir arm64v8/alpine</code> and then ran <code>gdbserver localhost:7777 ./binary</code> and then as suggested in the comments I used <code>netstat -l</code> in the container and got <code>tcp 0      0 0.0.0.0:7777            0.0.0.0:*   LISTEN</code>. So it seems that clearly <code>gdbserver</code> is listening for a <code>tcp</code> connection. Then I use <code>gdb-multiarch binary</code> on the host machine and then <code>(gdb) target remote localhost:7777</code> to get:</p>\n<p><code>Remote debugging using localhost:7777</code></p>\n<p><code>Ignoring packet error, continuing...</code></p>\n<p><code>warning: unrecognized item \"timeout\" in \"qSupported\" response</code></p>\n<p><code>Ignoring packet error, continuing...</code></p>\n<p><code>Remote replied unexpectedly to 'vMustReplyEmpty': timeout</code></p>\n<p>Any idea?!</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></p>\n<p>I ran the docker container without the <code>--publish</code> or <code>-p</code> attribute and clearly no matter what <code>IP:PORT</code> I use, <code>gdb-multiarch</code> says the <code>Connection timed out</code>.</p>\n</div>",

As my name says, I'm a newbie and I haven't yet made sure that in fact it is listening or not. I'm thinking maybe I set the docker wrong or I'm just not passing the correct <code>IP:PORT</code> to the <code>target remote</code> command of <code>gdb-multiarch</code> to connect to <code>gdbserver</code>. Basically, I don't feel sure about the connection between the container and the host. Can you comment on that. Also, do you see anything wrong with the docker command?</span>",

            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">So this is what I just did inside the docker: <code>gdbserver :7778 binary</code> and in another terminal (still in container) I did <code>netstat -l</code> and I got <code>Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State</code>: <code>tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:7778            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN</code>. So I guess gdbserver is actually listening! On the host I have <code>gdb-multiarch binary</code> and then <code>(gdb) target remote localhost:7778</code> and after a few seconds I get <code>localhost:7778: Connection timed out.</code> It seems that I have the connection between the host and the docker messed up!
