While I agree that own research should have been done up front, I don't think this was a very welcoming tone. For example the comparison table <a href=\"https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> makes no mention of plugins and it's also not listed as a limitation.</span>",

I <i>know</i> that they don't officially provide support for the freeware version, but I suppose if you ask them nicely you could find out by sending an email to <code>support@</code> Hex-Rays ... and once you have the authoritative answer, you could answer your own question here for the benefit of others?!</span>",
