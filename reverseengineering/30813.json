I've tried for a few month now to figure out how he managed to do things like this but their is no clear method on how Todo so. I figured the best place to ask would be here.</p>\n<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>\n<pre><code>- How did Manfred do it?\n - What can I do to get started in this field of game hacking?\n - What was the method Manfred had used?\n - Is their any resources on this?\nAny help is appreciated. TL;DR - How did Manfred hack so many online games\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n</div>",

If not, fix it</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This should give you plenty of learning without having to jump straight into the deep end with a real game. I find that attempting something without the prerequisite knowledge can result in you being sidetracked reading/learning and/or giving up.</p>\n</div>",
