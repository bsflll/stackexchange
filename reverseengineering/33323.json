There is very little information on the Internet on how to solve such problems.That's why I decided to study obfuscation to understand how it works, if I can understand how it works then I will be able to find signatures in the code.\nWhere can I read more about obfuscation? What are the good resources to understand the techniques and required programming?</p>\n<p>I'm solving this <a href=\"https://crackmes.one/crackme/6701d1419b533b4c22bd0d8f\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">crackme</a>.</p>\n</div>",
