I can verify it and understand purely the code but I can't get why the creators put this code and how it can be an anti-debug technique. These are the interesting blocks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0D7w4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Fork and Waitpid calls\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0D7w4.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

To notify the parent process, the developer relies on the exit code. It's 1 if a debugger is attached, 0 otherwise.</p>\n<p>On the parent side, it retrieves the exit code with the macro <code>WEXITSTATUS</code>. In C this is defined as:</p>\n<pre><code>#define WEXITSTATUS(x)  (_W_INT(x) &gt;&gt; 8)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which gives in assembly:</p>\n<pre><code>sar     eax, 8\nmovzx   eax, al\ntest    eax, eax\njz      short no_debugger\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is another way to do a <code>PTRACE_TRACEME</code>. :)</p>\n</div>",

After the fork(), if the JNZ instruction is false I would be into the child process, and the getpid() call would return the PID of the child, why the PID of the parent process?
