How can I copy and paste the old code to new version. Any help is so much appreciated. Basically I need to do it like what <strong>Fill with NOP</strong> does(which is noping N number of lines) I need to copy and paste a code like N number of times.</p>\n</div>",

The answer above works , but your life will become much ,much harder this way.</p>\n<p>Use this tool <a href=\"http://rammichael.com/multimate-assembler\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MLA from Ramm michael</a>\nIn Olly , you can just right click and open a part or section if highlighted in this notepad like plugin. You can just simply copy paste and click to insert assembly. </p>\n<p>I like this tool  because as you go along you can simply just edit your code and click the assemble button and that is it! Its like coding assembly without needing to compile!</p>\n<p>As a warning, make sure your code fits. Usually , I will code cave or something and then jump back to the origional code.</p>\n<p>Let me know.of you have questions. The tool is pretty simple to use and Ramm is a pretty cool guy. </p>\n<p>Here is a video that uses this a bit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=z7V2Y0YBxb0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Assembly tutorials</a></p>\n</div>",
