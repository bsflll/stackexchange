    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to reverse engineer a hash algorithm used by SharePoint 2016 in MSSCrawlUrl database table. I would like to avoid discussions about the idea itself (which I agree goes against SharePoint best practices), the answer is one word: legacy.</p>\n<p>In short, that database table contains some URLs and their hashes. SharePoint somehow calculates a hash from values in AccessUrl column (which contains URLs), and puts the result into AccessHash column. The calculation is done by unmanaged (i.e. non-.Net) code.</p>\n<p>So far I was able to figure out the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>AccessHash column definitely contains a CRC-32. In particular, the function is affine, i.e.\nhash(a ^ b ^ c) = hash(a) ^ hash(b) ^ hash(c)\nwhere ^ means XOR</li>\n<li>I could find a generating polynomial for the hash function (or I believe I could): 0x82608EDB. I used a technique outlined in this article: <a href=\"http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/essays/CRC-Reverse-Engineering.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/essays/CRC-Reverse-Engineering.html</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>After that I applied some brute force but couldn't figure out other algorithm parameters. The problem is a little bit more complicated because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I donâ€™t know the actual encoding that SharePoint uses when it computes hashes. I tried several in my brute force code, but I'm not sure if I'm missing something.</li>\n<li>I don't have full control over the sample data, because a source string must be a valid URL (otherwise, SharePoint won't calculate a hash from it).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here are some examples of URLs and their hashes:</p>\n<pre><code>AccessURL       AccessHash\nhttp://a0       2141537348\nhttp://a1      -1380154216\nhttp://a2       -547891125\nhttp://a4        981557741\nhttp://a8       -169013482\nhttp://aq       -319117100\nhttp://aa        -55893049\n</code></pre>\n<p>More examples can be found in this file: <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/johnnyjob/spreveng/src/master/CrcHack/Program.cs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://bitbucket.org/johnnyjob/spreveng/src/master/CrcHack/Program.cs</a></p>\n<p>The code which performs a brute force can be found here: <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/johnnyjob/spreveng/src/master/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://bitbucket.org/johnnyjob/spreveng/src/master/</a></p>\n<p>I'm open to any ideas, thanks in advance.</p>\n</div>",
