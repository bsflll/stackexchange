Loading the boot loader at address 0, Architecture ARM, results in the first few lines</p>\n<pre><code>ROM:00000000 dword_0         DCD 0x20002DE0\nROM:00000004                 DCD 0x20016AAD\nROM:00000008                 DCD 0x2000E241\nROM:0000000C                 DCD 0x2000E245\nROM:00000010                 DCD 0x2000E2B5\nROM:00000014                 DCD 0x2000E32D\nROM:00000018                 DCD 0x2000E3A5\nROM:0000001C                 DCD 0\nROM:00000020                 DCD 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, 0x20002DE0 is the initial stack pointer, and <code>0x20016AAD</code> is the entry point. </p>\n<p>That entry point does not seem to be contained in the boot loader itself (which has 64 K + 256 bytes), but in the on-Chip ROM. From the answer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that in the modern complex chips such as OMAP3 or Apple's A4 the\n  first piece of code which is executed is usually not user code but the\n  on-chip Boot ROM. It might check various conditions to determine where\n  to load the user code from and whether to load it at all (e.g. it\n  could require a valid digital signature). In such cases, the user code\n  might have to conform to different start-up conventions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So unless you can somehow dump the memory at <code>0x20016AAD</code>, you won't be able to find out what the ROM does, and where within the ROM it jumps.</p>\n<p>From a brief glance at the code, i'd assume the entry point to be a <code>0xBA40</code>, or maybe <code>0xBAC0</code> which calls <code>0xBA40</code>, because this calls <code>0x0960</code>. The first few instructions there (especially at <code>0x097a</code>)</p>\n<pre><code>ROM:00000960                 PUSH.W          {R4-R11,LR}\nROM:00000964                 SUB             SP, SP, #0x6C\nROM:00000966                 ADD             R0, SP, #0x90+var_88\nROM:00000968                 MOVS            R1, #0x34 ; '4'\nROM:0000096A                 BL              sub_1A58\nROM:0000096E                 BL              sub_8A8\nROM:00000972                 BL              sub_266\nROM:00000976                 BL              sub_1D8\nROM:0000097A                 ADR.W           R0, aStartBootloade ; \"\\n\\n\\nstart bootloader\\n\"\nROM:0000097E                 BL              sub_1E94\nROM:00000982                 MOVS            R1, #1\nROM:00000984                 LDR.W           R0, =0x40020000\nROM:00000988                 BL              sub_193E\n</code></pre>\n<p>seem to be an indication that the bootloader starts there, and <code>sub_1E94</code> is a generic string output function (it gets called lots of times, every time with a string address in <code>R0</code>).</p>\n</div>",
