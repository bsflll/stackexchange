Im using <strong>Vmware Workstation 10.0.3</strong> btw..</p>\n<p>I know i did setup my XP vm correctly because i can debug it from the host easily - configuring <code>The other end is an application</code> and connecting it with Windbg from my host computer (Win7 x64) and its working properly. So i know there is no problem with my Win-XP setup</p>\n<p>But doing the same thing from the other vm, nothing happens. I looked through the internet and i even followed tutorials that explained exactly what i already did.\nI have no idea what i'm missing and i feel pretty helpless so i came asking here.</p>\n<p>Anyone got any ideas what is the problem with my setup?</p>\n</div>",

            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">@JasonGeffner, It does look a little different than my setup, yet its still not working. The difference is (Between what i thought is correct): They put on the Debugged vm <code>The other end is an application</code> when the other side is a VM that is supposed to debug it.   Also on the windbg, the pipe name they use is <code>\\\\.\\com1</code> instead of <code>\\\\.\\pipe\\com_1</code> which is what i did. Nonetheless its still not working even with their setup</span>",
