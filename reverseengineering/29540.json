How can I do that?</p>\n<p>I know that, as per <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50709406/ltrace-and-gdb-attach-to-same-process\">ltrace and gdb attach to same process</a> , you can't actually attach ltrace and gdb to the same process.  But, once a process is under gdb, it should be fairly straightforward to catch each lib call and print out its args and return vals, just like ltrace does.</p>\n<p>In fact, it would be possible, and valuable, to go a step further: run gdb or gdb-peda, and print out <em>every</em> call (not just lib calls, with params and return val.  How can I do this?</p>\n</div>",
