    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>All the answers I see on Google are about how to load PDB files from online servers. But I have an exe I'm debugging. It's my own exe. Only reason I want to debug it, is so that I can step through what happens when it makes some calls to user32.dll and beyond.</p>\n<p>My EXE was made with c#, in Visual Studio, it's and x64 and \"debug\" build, with \"full\" pdb output. So the PDB is right there in the same folder, same name as the exe, and right next to the exe.</p>\n<p>But when I load the EXE into IDA, it doesn't load the PDB. Instead, it tries to load a different PDB:</p>\n<pre><code>[autohidden] The input file was linked with debug information\n and the symbol filename is:\n\"D:\\workspace\\_work\\1\\s\\artifacts\\obj\\win-x64.Release\\corehost\\cli\\apphost\\standalone\\Release\\apphost.pdb\"\nDo you want to look for this file at the specified path\nand the Microsoft Symbol Server?\n -&gt; No\n</code></pre>\n<p>I don't know what this \"apphost.pdb\" is, and that folder name of \"D:\\workspace...etc\" is definitely not on my computer, there is no such folders or anything similar. I don't even have a drive D. My exe is named Resolution_dev.exe, and the correct pdb is Resolution_dev.pdb. So I don't know why it's trying to find apphost.pdb.</p>\n<p>But furthermore, as you can see in the debug output, it is [autohidden] and automatically answers the question with \"-&gt; No\" at the end. So it doesn't even ask me the question, and automatically skips the PDB load.</p>\n<p>And I can't find anywhere in the toolbar along the top of IDA, where it will let me manually load the PDB from a file. And as I said, all the info I found on Google is about loading pdb's from online servers. I can't find anything about how to simply load one from the drive.</p>\n</div>",

Good answer!</span>",
