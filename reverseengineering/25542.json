These sections lie at the end of the binary, separate from the code. Removing this information has no bearing on the code itself, so the locations of functions in the file (their file offsets) will be the same after stripping the binary. Function addresses (their location in virtual memory), on the other hand, may either be hardcoded or position independent; it depends on how the binary was compiled (this is also unaffected by stripping symbol info).</p>\n<p>Finding the boundaries of functions in stripped binaries is an undecidable problem, but workarounds and heuristics exist, such as a signature-based approach to function detection.
