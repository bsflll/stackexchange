I set up debugger, installed APK and run application, it starts, writes \"waiting for debugger\", and debugger writes that \"connection has been gracefully closed\", and I see following message in IDA log: <code>ADB error: listener 'tcp:23915' not found</code></p>\n<p>The application is for sure debuggable; I have sources and debug the same APK with Android Studio. I can also debug C++ code with IDA remove ARM on the same emulator and the same APK.</p>\n<p>So why does Dalvik debugger not work?</p>\n</div>",

I found that when IDA tries to connect to Dalvik debugger, I see following message in log:</p>\n<p><code>Ignoring second debugger -- accepting and dropping</code></p>\n<p>In not doubts no second debugger existed. Next, I found that this AVD doesn't work even with Android Studio and gives the same error.</p>\n<p>I found that other people have similar issue: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3735450/ignoring-second-debugger-and-service-hang-in-android\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3735450/ignoring-second-debugger-and-service-hang-in-android</a></p>\n<p>The problem disappeared when I rebooted Windows.</p>\n</div>",
