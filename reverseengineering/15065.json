    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've been playing around with a cheapish ($15 on sale @ Wal-Mart) WiFi camera. It has a UART port which drops me into a shell from which I can launch telnetd and login easily. However, even though the filesystem is mounted readwrite, when I edit anything (i.e. init.d) and then reboot, the filesystem goes back to its previous state and telnetd doesn't run. :(</p>\n<p>My long term goal is to figure out how to replace or edit the camera's streaming binary files so that it's not dependent upon a hosted cloud server to store and stream videos. (<em>Currently to stream from outside my house, the video bounces off their cloud server; and I must use their proprietary app!</em>) My short term (current) goal is to figure out how to repack the firmware and rewrite to the camera. </p>\n<p>I was able to sniff a firmware update, and the firmware file is found at:</p>\n<pre><code>https://app.isecurityplus.com/seedonk/firmware/minions/A356_upgrade_00.10.008_20161107.img\n</code></pre>\n<p>and</p>\n<pre><code>$ file A356_upgrade_00.10.008_20161107.img \nA356_upgrade_00.10.008_20161107.img: u-boot legacy uImage, Imogen-X860-I, Linux/ARM, OS Kernel Image (Not compressed), 6709304 bytes, Mon Nov  7 02:33:58 2016, Load Address: 0x80008000, Entry Point: 0x80008000, Header CRC: 0x37467C4E, Data CRC: 0x93CBB08E\n</code></pre>\n<p>binwalk shows:</p>\n<pre><code>$ binwalk -Me A356_upgrade_00.10.008_20161107.img \n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0             0x0             uImage header, header size: 64 bytes, header CRC: 0x37467C4E, created: 2016-11-07 02:33:58, image size: 6709304 bytes, Data Address: 0x80008000, Entry Point: 0x80008000, data CRC: 0x93CBB08E, OS: Linux, CPU: ARM, image type: OS Kernel Image, compression type: none, image name: \"Imogen-X860-I\"\n10063         0x274F          xz compressed data\n10284         0x282C          xz compressed data\n\n&lt;etc..snip.. eventually it creates a 0.cpio file&gt;\n\n$ cpio -idv &lt; 0.cpio \n$ ls\n0.cpio      dev     init        lib32       media       package     run  system     var\nbin     etc     ko      libexec     mnt     proc        sbin        tmp\ncpio-root   home        lib     linuxrc     opt     root        sys     usr\n</code></pre>\n<p>This community has been amazing and I've learned so much about RE. I've found a few posts on here about repackaging this sort of thing but I still have enough knowledge gap to fall short on knowing where my next step would be. Any guidance?</p>\n<p>Many thanks!</p>\n</div>",

Here is the general workflow according to the <a href=\"https://code.google.com/archive/p/firmware-mod-kit/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">firmware mod kit archive page at Google Code</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Extract a firmware image into its component parts User makes desired</li>\n<li>modification to the firmware's file system or web UI (webif) </li>\n<li>Rebuild firmware </li>\n<li>Flash modified firmware onto device and brick it (ha)</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since extraction does not seem to be a problem and since the file system format is <code>cpio</code> and not something <a href=\"http://elinux.org/File_Systems#Embedded_Filesystems\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">more exotic</a>, you may be able to use the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/cpio/manual/cpio.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">GNU <code>cpio</code> utility</a> and not need any special tools to modify the file system and then re-compress it.  </p>\n<p>The modified file system will likely need to be located at the offset in the rebuilt firmware image the bootloader expects it to be.
