    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to play around with an app for Android and every time I try to call a function (<code>lua_gettop()</code> from the Lua 5.1 library) from the app's address space, it hits me with ILL_ILLOPC.</p>\n<p>I made sure to rebase the address and the function is correct as I read the opcodes from the location to make sure I wasn't calling the wrong thing. I tried to call <code>gettop()</code> by using another function that is only designed to call that, and it worked, so I remade <code>gettop()</code> and built it with my current tools and put both libraries in IDA to compare the instructions.</p>\n<p>To my surprise they were completely different (which makes me think that is why my trying to call that crashes, it doesn't recognise the instructions??)</p>\n<p>Here are the instructions</p>\n<pre><code>.text:0172D8F8                 LDRD.W          R1, R0, [R0,#0xC]\n.text:0172D8FC                 SUBS            R0, R1, R0\n.text:0172D8FE                 ASRS            R0, R0, #4\n.text:0172D900                 BX              LR\n</code></pre>\n<p>And my library's version of the function:</p>\n<pre><code>.text:000BF614                 LDR             R1, [R0,#0xC]\n.text:000BF618                 LDR             R0, [R0,#0x10]\n.text:000BF61C                 SUB             R0, R1, R0\n.text:000BF620                 MOV             R0, R0,LSR#4\n.text:000BF624                 BX              LR\n</code></pre>\n<p>I tried to find out how to make it compile to the same instruction set to no luck, I assume this to be the problem, but I'm ready to be corrected.</p>\n</div>",
