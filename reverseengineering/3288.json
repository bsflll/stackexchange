            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>It very much depends on what framework they use in order to do their windowing. It could be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Foundation_Class_Library\">MFC</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation\">WPF</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinForms\">WinForms</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTL\">WTL</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_%28software%29\">QT</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wxwidget\">wxWidgets</a>, pure <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API\">Windows API</a>. There's a lot of frameworks and they all handle the final routing of messages differently.</p>\n<p>I'll answer the question for the cases that are either directly built on top of Windows API or where they're using the Windows API directly. WPF does not use the Windows API windowing system other than for the outermost windows.</p>\n<p>Initially the program registers a function that handles messages intended for a particular window. This can be done using the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633586(v=vs.85).aspx\">RegisterClass</a> or <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633587(v=vs.85).aspx\">RegisterClassEx</a> functions. The function which will be responsible for handling the messages sent to the window is the lpfnWndProc member of the structures passed to these functions. This is called the window procedure. </p>\n<p>What happens when a button is pressed is that a message, in this case <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms647591(v=vs.85).aspx\">WM_COMMAND</a>, is pushed into the thread message queue by Windows. This message is then fetched using  <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644936(v=vs.85).aspx\">GetMessage</a> or <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644943(v=vs.85).aspx\">PeekMessage</a>. Some messages use short cuts and can result in a call to the window procedure directly when you call GetMessage, some messages only result in a call to the window procedure when the application calls <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644934(v=vs.85).aspx\">DispatchMessage</a>. If you're dealing with a dialog, the message will be handled by a call to <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms645498(v=vs.85).aspx\">IsDialogMessage</a>.</p>\n<p>Now that we have some background on how this works behind the scenes, OllyDbg actually has a helper for dealing with this sort of thing. You can simply open the View-&gt;Windows dialog item. Right click the window you want to catch button presses in, select message breakpoint on classproc, select command and notifications from the message dropdown or select the WM_COMMAND message. Now whenever you click the button you will break in the window procedure the application registered for that window. You still need to trace the code so that you can find the code that examines the message type and then handles the message. From now on it will be different depending on what type of framework is being used.</p>\n</div>",

You can trace it back from there to see what you could look for in a real sample. Depends on how you learn but it might help.</span>",
