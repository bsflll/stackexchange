Why it's impossible to reassemble Silverlight5 runtime  with <code>ildasm</code>/<code>ilasm</code>?</p>\n<pre><code>ildasm.exe /out=System.Windows.Browser.il System.Windows.Browser.dll\nilasm.exe /dll System.Windows.Browser.il\n</code></pre>\n<p>It works perfectly with .NET runtime and with Silverlight applications but not with Silverlight runtime.</p>\n</div>",
