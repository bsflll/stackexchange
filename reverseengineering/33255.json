I know it was connected to a 10 pin connector on the board, and when I tried to use the onboard micro-usb port, the board did not receive power. There are test points on the board that I might be able to power it from, but there's also this jtag-ish looking connector. Here's the <a href=\"https://fcc.report/FCC-ID/THO1141623\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">fcc page</a> on the product, where you might be able to get some better pictures. How can I power this device and what interface should I use to access the software? Thanks!\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nZMbHBPN.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"File system/sd card points broken out\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nZMbHBPN.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9YvuXbKN.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"JTAG port and some broken out communication pins\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9YvuXbKN.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/J6ftaL2C.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Back of JTAG port\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/J6ftaL2C.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
