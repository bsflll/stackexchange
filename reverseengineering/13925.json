It's been most probably linked statically to MSVCRT, some very old version. Also it uses heavily WinAPI (like ODCBC drivers, crypto libs, multi-threading and network stuff).\nSo far I found one very weird class:</p>\n<pre><code>DNameNode \n</code></pre>\n<p>What can I see from reversed code, it's a base class for some other structures, and it uses some synchronization constructions. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I couldn't find any info about those <strong>DNameNode</strong>s. Do you have any ideas, what's are they used for?</p>\n<p>Guessed c.tor of some of (guessed) derived class:</p>\n<pre><code>DNameNode *__thiscall sub_4182BD(DNameNode *this)\n{\n  DNameNode *v1; // ST00_4@1\n\n  v1 = this;\n  DNameNode::DNameNode(this);\n  *(_DWORD *)v1 = &amp;off_45F538;\n  *((_DWORD *)v1 + 3) = -1;\n  *((_DWORD *)v1 + 2) = 0;\n  return v1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
