As long as the heap that the string exists in is executable, it will be executed as if it were machine code. The other four parameters passed to <code>CallWindowProc</code> are also passed to the function pointer, and can be used by the machine code however it's designed. In this case, it looks like the machine code your script is loading is a decryption subroutine. Try looking at the machine code in a disassembler.</p>\n</div>",
