    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to <code>ptrace_attach</code> the main process and its threads (<code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/task</code>) of an android unity app to avoid malicious users debugging the app(which is a game). </p>\n<p>I developed a ndk library that forks from main process and <code>ptrace_attach</code> the parent process(being the main process) inside the <code>JNI_OnLoad()</code> function. After that periodically checks the <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/task</code> folder to attach newly created threads. </p>\n<p>The problem is, \nthis works well in normal apps but when I try to run this inside an app made with unity, the main process stops and screen becomes black or white not responding. But if you delay attaching a few seconds just enough to see the animation working on the screen, attaching works fine.</p>\n<p>Code is roughly something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>if(!fork())\n{\n     parentPid = getppid();\n\n     // attach parent process\n     if(ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH,parentPid,0,0)&lt;0)\n          exit(-1);\n     ptrace(PTRACE_SETOPTIONS, parentPid, 0, PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC| PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORKDONE|PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD |PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK |PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORK |PTRACE_O_TRACECLONE );\n\n     while(true)\n     {\n          // get signal from processes\n          stoppedPid = waitpid(-1,&amp;stat_loc, 0);\n\n          ...\n\n          // check if stoppedPid need to be attached\n          // if so, attach\n          ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH,stoppedPid,0,0);\n\n          ...\n\n          // else, just continue the stopped process\n          ptrace(PTRACE_CONT,stoppedPid,0,0);\n     }\n }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Maybe I should adjust the <code>ptrace_setoptions</code> ?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance :)</p>\n</div>",

In the java code, it seems SIGSEGV occurs while calling View related functions. </p>\n<p>I guess UnityPlayer or Android app loader handles SIGSEGV smoothly while app loading time. Therefore, if you get a SIGSEGV, simply detaching it and attaching again does not hang the app. </p>\n</div>",
