I just remembered that there is an open-source Microsoft project called <a href=\"http://ccimetadata.codeplex.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"CCI Metadata\"</a> which does provide some C# code for reading and writing PDB files. Not sure about the legality of using it to make your own PDB parser, but it does provide information which is probably as the close to official docs as you can get.</p>\n</div>",

It only extracts type information using Microsoft’s DebugInterface Access (DIA) COM.  If you are interested in just parsing/dumping raw PDB information, there are a few alternatives out there to DIA, including Volatility’s open source pdbparse (<a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pdbparse/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://code.google.com/p/pdbparse/</a>) or the PDB utility that comes with the Undocumented Windows 2000 Secrets book.  However, most of the practical tools I have seen that operate on PDB’s use DIA, including Microsoft’s own Dia2dump, this one <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/37456/How-To-Inspect-the-Content-of-a-Program-Database-P\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/37456/How-To-Inspect-the-Content-of-a-Program-Database-P</a> and this one <a href=\"http://www.ishani.org/web/articles/obsolete/pdb-cracking-tool/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.ishani.org/web/articles/obsolete/pdb-cracking-tool/</a>, to name a few.  To reiterate, PdbXtract does not parse or capture the wealth of other information available in a PDB, including:  functions, debug streams, modules, publics, globals, files, section information, injected sources, source files, OEM specific types, compilands, and others.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2040132/help-me-to-read-pdb-file\">Help me to read .pdb file</a> - from stackoverflow</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
