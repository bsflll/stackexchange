Even with the older devices when a dedicated controller had to be used, its datasheet would describe only the controller and not the panel.</p>\n<p>Apollo controller datasheet (first generation, used in Sony PRS-500), made by Philips (later PVI):<br/>\n<a href=\"http://openinkpot.org/raw-attachment/wiki/Device/V3/Screen/Apollo_eInk_screen_controller_datasheet.pdf\">http://openinkpot.org/raw-attachment/wiki/Device/V3/Screen/Apollo_eInk_screen_controller_datasheet.pdf</a></p>\n<p>The second generation controller (Metronome) <a href=\"http://wayback.archive.org/web/20080515150100/http://www.e-ink.com/products/matrix/metronome.html\">was made by E-Ink</a> but they in fact used an Actel ProASIC3 FPGA as can be seen on my photos of PRS-505 innards:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/21729510@N03/2111017270/in/set-72157603454047408\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/21729510@N03/2111017270/in/set-72157603454047408</a></p>\n<p>So in theory you <em>might</em> be able to extract the bitstream and RE it or just reuse in your own FPGA. However, it would work only with the first-gen Vizplex panels and probably not with the current ones.</p>\n<p>Third generation controller was a dedicated chip made by Epson (S1D13521B, codename Broadsheet). Baidu has a copy of internal training from E-Ink which describes some low-level details on how develop with it (but again, not much on the panel itself):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wenku.baidu.com/view/187d53956bec0975f465e245.html\">http://wenku.baidu.com/view/187d53956bec0975f465e245.html</a></p>\n<p>In the end, driving EPD panel is even trickier business than driving a generic LCD. So, unless you know this area very well, I would recommend to stick to a proven solution such as Freescale's chips or a dedicated controller.</p>\n<p>If you're not dead set on the hi-res screen, you may be interested in this collection of kits with small resolution and segmented E-Ink screens:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.the-digital-reader.com/2013/05/23/e-ink-dives-into-the-diy-market/\">http://www.the-digital-reader.com/2013/05/23/e-ink-dives-into-the-diy-market/</a></p>\n</div>",
