In the current version (6) that file is an <code>sqlite3</code> database. You can find some of the information you're looking for in the tables in that database-- specifically, the <code>functions</code> table contains the number of basic blocks and edges.</p>\n<p>Since you're using IDA, I also recommend you check out <a href=\"https://github.com/TakahiroHaruyama/ida_haru/blob/master/bindiff/bindiff.py\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ida_haru</a>, it may also export some of the information you're looking for.</p>\n</div>",
