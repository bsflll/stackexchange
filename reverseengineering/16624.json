    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I was given two DLL files <a href=\"https://mega.nz/#!w0RnhJTQ!_j3sImHX2Heo0Zb35rZw6uKYLFz8FTqoSmnE-zZDrVs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(link)</a> . The task is to get the flag from them. First what I've done - opened the first file (called <code>original</code>) in IDA and found the function called <code>_GetFlag</code>.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nur45.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nur45.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>As I understood, I need to call that function from the DLL library somehow (that's the first question - I don't have any info about the function except its name, so I'd like to know how exactly I can call it).\nHowever, as wee see, even if I knew how to call it, we can't get the flag from <code>original</code> DLL, it says <code>Sry, flag is in the patched version</code>.</p>\n<p>Ok, I opened <code>patched</code> DLL in IDA. First what we see that the file can be opened only as a binary:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yCFF3.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yCFF3.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>As always, I opened the Strings window and we see the string <code>\"0day is bring your own header day! Flag is: %s\"</code> . It looks like a key for solution.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/izwnv.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/izwnv.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>However, I don't exactly know what to do after that. I'd really appreciate if somebody would explain me how to solve this.</p>\n</div>",
