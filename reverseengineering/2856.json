Here I take the assumption that the self-debugging is implemented based on Windows Debug APIs. So, here are my findings:</p>\n<p><strong>In \"debugger\" process:</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attach/run with your debugger the process you want to study</li>\n<li>Look for a call to CreateProcess API with the flags <strong>DEBUG_ONLY_THIS_PROCESS</strong> or <strong>DEBUG_PROCESS</strong></li>\n<li>Follow to the closest call to <strong>WaitForDebugEvent</strong>. Usually this will be a loop for processing of all the debug event that will come from the debug-gee.</li>\n<li>Once the event processing region was found, all is needed is to check what event exactly is being processed. Check your event according to <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms679308%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSDN</a></li>\n<li>In several cases there will be pair call to Get/SetThreadContext. So analyzing the structure before the SetThreadContext is called, one can actually see what region of the debug-gee was altered (if you did not know it already). </li>\n<li>After all the alternations, there will be finally call to ContinueDebugEvent/ZwContinue. Until it was called the debug-gee is in freeze for the inspection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>In \"debug-gee\" process:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attach WinDbg to it in non-invasive mode to inspect what was changed.</li>\n<li>Make your notes before continue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hope this will help.\nYour comments are more than welcome.  </p>\n</div>",
