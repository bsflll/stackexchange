    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I was reversing an <code>apk</code>. the <code>code</code> detects whether the <code>apk</code> is running on a rooted device or not. if it is rooted or an emulator it will stop and close out. so this is the snippet code which I think it was obfuscated with DexGuard not really sure if it is.</p>\n<pre><code>v0_4 = (int)(((Integer)((Class)withOrigin.read(((char)(-1 - Long.compare(ExpandableListView.getPackedPositionForChild(0, 0), 0L))), 476 - View.combineMeasuredStates(0, 0), 18 - Long.compare(Process.getElapsedCpuTime(), 0L))).getMethod(\"RemoteActionCompatParcelizer\", Context.class, Integer.TYPE).invoke(null, v0_3, ((int)1))));\n</code></pre>\n<p>so the method <code>RemoteActionCompatParcelizer</code> is the method determining whether rooted or not I believe. as such the <code>withOrigin.read</code> intercepted with <code>frida</code> returns <code>o.a</code> so tried to with jadx-gui find the package <code>o.a</code> as the method <code>RemoteActionCompatParcelizer</code> is apparently defined in this package but not found in the tree o and there are a bunch of other classes in it.</p>\n<p>so what next steps can I take to solve these obfuscations?</p>\n</div>",
