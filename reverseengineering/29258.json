    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am using Ida Pro 7.0 and working with a binary (firmware) written in C++ .Fortunately there are  symbols in the firmware and I know function names but Ida didn't manage to demangle all function names. I saw in the firmware ASCII string <strong>gcc2</strong>. Likely the binary was compiled using gcc2 compiler. There are a lot of important funcitons in the mangled form.</p>\n<p>Help me out please. How Can I resolve this problem???</p>\n<p>I tried to use idc.Demangle() func but unfortunately It can't demangle correctly.</p>\n<p>P.S.\nI found that <em><strong>c++filt</strong></em> utility works correctly</p>\n</div>",

Maybe I need to play with Compiler submenu (Options-&gt;Compiler) or Demangled names. The only thing I remember that my device works under vxworks os.</span>",
