    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to understand how to reverse golang programs with radare2. In order to practice, i create a minimal program in Go:</p>\n<pre><code>package main\nimport \"fmt\"\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(\"Hello World!\")\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the resulting assembly code below, i found the main function (main.main) but i can't figure how to display the string passed in argument to Println.</p>\n<pre><code>;-- sym.go.main.main:\nmov rcx, qword fs:[0xfffffffffffffff8]\ncmp rsp, qword [rcx + 0x10]\njbe 0x485097\nsub rsp, 0x48\nmov qword [var_40h], rbp\nlea rbp, [var_40h]\nxorps xmm0, xmm0\nmovups xmmword [var_30h], xmm0\nlea rax, [0x004958e0]\nmov qword [var_30h], rax\nlea rax, obj.main.statictmp_0 ; 0x4c8490\nmov qword [var_38h], rax\nlea rax, [var_30h]\nmov qword [rsp], rax\nmov qword [var_8h], 1\nmov qword [var_10h], 1\ncall sym.fmt.Println\nmov rbp, qword [var_40h]\nadd rsp, 0x48\nret\ncall sym.runtime.morestack_noctxt\njmp sym.main.main\n</code></pre>\n<p>Any tips ? Im new in reverse.</p>\n</div>",
