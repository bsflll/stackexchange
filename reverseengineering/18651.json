E.g. the following regex,</p>\n<p><code>mov.*(eax|edx|ecx|esi|edi), \\[(eax|edx|ecx|esi|edi)\\+30h\\]</code></p>\n<p>Now, I'm also looking for references to this in which the register written to is called, since this represents an offset for a particular function pointer.</p>\n<p>The problem is that I'm seeing thousands of matches with the binary I'm looking at. For all I know, the function pointer could also be passed to some other function down X layers and then called there. This obviously creates a significant layer of complexity.</p>\n<p>Are there any tools that make it possible to search for matches using the above regex, but also look (up to a specific call depth and/or instruction count from the instruction matched) for calls to the actual register?</p>\n</div>",

I’m afraid it can’t be covered by just a single post. </p>\n</div>",
