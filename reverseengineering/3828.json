    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to debug an application that uses QT GUI library. The problem is that I can't even start debugging as ollydbg seems to be processing ~1k events per second where in stack trace I see all of them running inside QT. The application has very fancy GUI (blending, custom window and buttons etc) and perhaps that is what hangs the debugger as it tries to process all this. Eventually it bluescreens. Can I somehow force olly to skip or ignore these events? </p>\n</div>",

Anyway, I tried with different QT application and result is the same (yet, perhaps it's not QT fault but coincidence). 100-400 events per second and I can't use the application since it's \"stuck\" (I can't even maximize it or open popup menu -- when right clicking the icon on task bar).</span>",
