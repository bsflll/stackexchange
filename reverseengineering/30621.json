Get the configured base address here: menu <code>Window</code> -&gt; <code>Memory map</code> -&gt; <code>house icon</code> (Set Image Base). That is the base address you need to substract from the address shown in Ghidra. Afterwards add the base address you got by Frida at run-time e.g. <code>Module.findBaseAddress(\"main.exe\");</code></span>",
