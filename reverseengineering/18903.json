    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm wondering if anyone has had any luck with Radare2's configuration variables, <code>esil.exectrap</code>, <code>esil.iotrap</code>, and <code>esil.nonull</code> while <em>emulating</em>?</p>\n<pre><code>xor eax, eax\nmov eax, dword [eax] &lt;-\n</code></pre>\n<p>From what I can tell, if I set all of the variables to <code>true</code> (specifically <code>esil.nonull</code>), I should expect an exception in the above code and for it to stop executing, or see the eflags change right? Well that's not what happens and execution continues.</p>\n<p>There is also the <code>cmd.esil.trap</code> variable, amongst a few similar ones, that allow me to execute a command when a trap happens. I've tried commands such as <code>echo trap</code> but again nothing happens. Am I doing something wrong or missing something here? Do I need to configure another variable to make this work? Is this only available in debug mode?</p>\n</div>",
