It has never meant to be undetectable. The pin engine inject your pintool (where you code your instrumentation and analysis routines) into the process address space and either JIT the assembly code on the fly or puts hooks / trampolines into the code, so it's easily detectable.\nThe simplest way to detect PIN being just checking in the process module list if the pin engine is loaded.</p>\n<p>If you want to detect PIN, just check this presentation from Recon: <a href=\"https://recon.cx/2012/schedule/attachments/42_FalconRiva_2012.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dynamic Binary Instrumentation Frameworks: I know you're there spying on me</a>.</p>\n</div>",
