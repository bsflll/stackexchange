(CGI files in www folder)<br/>\nWhen I connect to the web page of my router, I can see links include CGI file names. <br/>\nBut after unpacking, I can see only html files, I can't see CGI files.<br/>\nI think only some files are unpacked with binwalk tools. <br/>\nHow do you think what's the problem? <br/>\nThank you\n    </div>",
