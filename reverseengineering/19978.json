What does<br/>\n<code>sub esp, 8</code> mean? as well as <code>push [ebp+_a]</code> ? I am able to get the esp 8 sometimes while changing the print statement. Why is this the case?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SJwYT.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"fig1\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SJwYT.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>What I have so far.</p>\n<pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\n    int main(int argc, char *argv[])\n\n{\n    int a = 9;\n\n    while (a) {\n\n        printf(\"%d, \");\n        --a;\n    }\n        puts(\"FIRE!\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>",

In x86, According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#cdecl\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">cdecl</a> arguments are pushed in reverse order. So, first the integer value a is pushed on to the top of the stack (<code>push [ebp+_a]</code>) and then the string <code>\"%d ,\"</code> is pushed on to the stack (<code>push offset aD</code>). While printf pops the arguments out, first it takes out the \"%d, \" and then it gets the value of a i.e., <code>[ebp+_a]</code>. The stack pointer should also be changed accordingly so that the printf function will get the right arguments. Hence the instruction <code>sub esp, 8</code> which changes the stack pointer(esp). </p>\n</div>",
