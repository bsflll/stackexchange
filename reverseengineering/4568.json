It relies on DynamoRIO. Compared to minset which uses pin tool, there isn't much of a difference. Tho I think actual set minimization part works faster than minset. </p>\n<p>Minblox tool is comprised of two parts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A DynamoRIO instrumentation part (libbbcoverage) tasked with recording all basic block executed during application execution.</li>\n<li>minblox.py - Python script that runs the DynamoRIO instrumentation and analyzes the log files to minimize the sample set.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Though, do bear in mind that I've only tested this for a specific case I needed it, so your mileage might vary. </p>\n</div>",

However, you can use <a href=\"http://dynamorio.org/docs/page_drcov.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">DrCov</a> and do yourself the same thing as Minset does and even more powerful things. Indeed, I commonly use this DynamoRIO's tool, DrCov, for doing this exact same thing and others.</p>\n</div>",
