    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've dug into files of a game that was made in Unity (which uses C# language)... and i was interested in extracting 3D models and textures etc. I understand that <strong>data</strong> and <strong>obb</strong> are separate, BUT! In my case, both of these have the same contents. Half textures are in <strong>data</strong> and half in <strong>obb</strong>.. i've been able to extract from data, but i came to a stop when i looked inside <strong>obb</strong>.</p>\n<p>What i saw was a file named <strong>res.bytes</strong>, and i've been looking for ways to open/extract from a byte format but in the end it led me to scripting. Yes i've tried reverse engineering tools and other simple methods such as renaming it to <strong>.zip</strong>... no luck.</p>\n<p>If there's anyone who knows how to open this byte file with a script i'd appreciate it.</p>\n</div>",

I think that way we could find the used compression method.</span>",
