    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm developing a python script for angr that has to find all the basic blocks present in each function in a binary. I have noticed that angr splits the basic blocks when it finds a <code>REP</code> instruction, I'm wondering if I can tell angr to not split basic blocks when it encounters <code>REP</code> instructions with the API or if I have to do it manually.</p>\n<p>This is a snippet of my code:</p>\n<pre><code>p = angr.Project(sys.argv[1], auto_load_libs=False, main_opts={'base_addr': 0} )\ncfg = p.analyses.CFGFast()\ncfg.normalize()\n\nfor func_node in cfg.functions.values():\n    for block in func_node.blocks:\n        c = block.capstone\n        for i in c.insns:\n            * operations *\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is an example of a basic block that ends with a <code>REP</code> instruction:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pi8Xv.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pi8Xv.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Thank you in advance.</p>\n</div>",
