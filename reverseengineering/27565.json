    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to make a bot on a specific website, so I have to reverse a lot of JS scripts. The reversing it self is not that hard but the de-obfuscation is. Lots of the scripts are obfuscated with things like JScrambler. I see people able to de-obfuscate JScrambler but for me it is very difficult. So I wanted to know if there was any place I could learn about JS de-obfuscation.</p>\n</div>",
