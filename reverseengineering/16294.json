I recommend you figure out what it software does encryption/decryption and what algorithm it uses for the crypto task. Then look into that software (\"reverse-engineer\" it) and then you will be able to decrypt the card. And I agree that dumping the contents of the encrypted bitstream into a reasonably common format is a good first step on this long journey.</p>\n<p>Reverse engineering is not a game - there is no magic solution, just sweat blood and tears.</p>\n</div>",

I'm not sure how old the Nokia E52 is, but AES-128-CBC and AES-256-CBC are pretty common. If you have the know-how, you can write a shell script to automate the process and then dump the first kilobyte of each \"decrypted\" image. You will probably see some identifying text in the image that is decrypted with the proper algorithm.</span>",
