Now, IF they had had only the .class files, they would have had to use a java decompiler, possibly fix decompiler errors, annotate the sources, do some optimizations, whatever. But there's no serious way to guesstimate timeframe and cost - running something like <code>jd-gui</code> over the java classes cost an hour. Cleaning the source code and assigning meaningful comments costs months.</span>",
