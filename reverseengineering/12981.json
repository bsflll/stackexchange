Note that this will only work if the exact same libraries were used in the binary's compilation (e.g. compilation options must match) since FLIRT relies on byte matching.

This allows us to use the power of IDA/r2 in recognizing functions (analysis, FLIRT signatures, manual creation, renaming, etc), but not be limited to the exclusive use of this tools.\nSupports 32 and 64-bits file format.<br/>\nEXAMPLE<br/>\nBased on a full-stripped ELF:<br/>\n<code>$ file test1_x86_stripped \ntest1_x86_stripped: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, stripped</code><br/>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7aBKn.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7aBKn.png\"/></a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/danigargu/ida-syms2elf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/danigargu/ida-syms2elf</a></p>\n<p>edit<br/>\nanother plugin <code>wsym</code> Adds symbols to an ELF file. Sort of the opposite of strip. This is in a very early stage of development and should be considered PoC/beta software.<br/>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/wapiflapi/wsym\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/wapiflapi/wsym</a></p>\n</div>",
