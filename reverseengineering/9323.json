Get malware, reverse engineer it yourself and publish your results in your blog. This is, certainly, going to help more than any certification on earth. Indeed, some people may take a bad impression of your resume if it makes emphasis in certifications and I know tech-people, not recruiters, that will not even bother to read your resume if you put certifications on it.</p>\n</div>",
