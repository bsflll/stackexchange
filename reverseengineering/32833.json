Decompiling using Ghidra/Radare first will get you into the executable part which is not application-specific, but the DotNet runtime.</p>\n<p>Therefore I recommend using a DotNet decompiler like <a href=\"https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/releases\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ILSpy</a>. It is capable of loading the assembly DLL files included in the executable and decompile e.g. the Main method of the DotNet application (see assembly <code>dotnetproject</code>).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately ILSpy is a Windows program and not available for MacOS. Homebrew has an <a href=\"https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/ilspy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ilspy cask</a>, but that only installs an old  Avalonia, an old and discontinued port of ILSpy. I am not sure if that port is already able to open and decompile the packed DotNet executable.</p>\n</div>",
