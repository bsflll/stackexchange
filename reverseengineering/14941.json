The .dat file is supposed to have entries, each with identifier (tag name/id/key), value (decimal/float) for different times (timestamp) along with their confidence rating (int/percentage).\nThe application is windows-based. Each .dat file would represent entries of few days.</p>\n<p>I've managed to identify timestamps at specific byte offsets. It also looks like the \"records\" are of 2049 byte chunks. The timestamp (and additional timestamps) repeat within each 2049 chunk (which is a bit strange), but perhaps it's also keeping a reference to the last recorded time, or maybe there's a nesting (parent/child) of records.</p>\n<p>I'm a stuck as to how I should proceed.</p>\n<p>Sample dat file (truncated):\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8ACIyH1qALnLUY2cEdzVWp6T1U\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8ACIyH1qALnLUY2cEdzVWp6T1U</a></p>\n<p>Full dat file:\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8ACIyH1qALnNU5wYkotMktVWVk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8ACIyH1qALnNU5wYkotMktVWVk</a></p>\n<p>One of the first time values: 80CAFEBB168DD201 at offset 2061 <em>decimal</em> []  (131322467930000000 -&gt; 2017-02-27 7:19:53 AM)</p>\n<p>Sample idx file:\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8ACIyH1qALnQzVueEJuRWNfUk0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8ACIyH1qALnQzVueEJuRWNfUk0</a></p>\n<p>Appreciate the help.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n<p>As requested, some further information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The files are generated by Honeywell PHD Uniformance Server. I don't\nhave access to the software itself - but working on it. I don't know\nwhat language it was written in. </p></li>\n<li><p>Some <a href=\"https://www.honeywellprocess.com/library/marketing/tech-specs/Uniformance-PHD-R321-Tech-and-Spec.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">online guide</a> for the server suggest the\npresence of MAX_ARCRECSIZE configuration parameter &lt;quote&gt;\"which defaults to 2048.\nThis controls the record size within the archive files\" &lt;/endquote&gt;. The dat files are of 2049 byte chunks (2048 bytes + 1 byte \"0A\")</p></li>\n<li><p>The historian, as far as I know, doesn't provide SQL-like interface. The\nonly protocols understood are OPC variants (OPC-DA, OPC-HDA and\npossibly OPC-UA), however those are slow when it comes to extracting\nhistorical records.</p></li>\n<li><p>The offset given for one of the dates (but not the first one), is at 2061 decimal</p>\n<pre><code>=&gt;hexdump -C -s 2061 -n 64 SCAN00356-sample.dat\n0000080d  80 ca fe bb 16 8d d2 01  02 00 00 00 12 00 00 00  |................|\n0000081d  96 07 46 04 00 00 00 00  20 5f a0 02 c2 00 00 80  |..F..... _......|\n0000082d  bf 00 3c 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 04 00 00 00 96 07  |..&lt;.............|\n0000083d  8e 07 80 ca fe bb 16 8d  d2 01 0a 00 00 86 07 00  |................|\n0000084d\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>I've found 4 different timestamps (ftime) in each 2049 'chunks' so far. They are at consistent offsets (at bytes 12, 62, 75, 94 from the beginning of each 2049 byte chunk). Possible sequence value at byte 8. Possible 'color' value at byte 38.</p></li>\n<li><p>One more thing; OPC Servers leverage COM and DCOM architectures. I came across the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_File_Binary_Format\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Compound Binary File Format</a>, but the corresponding readers aren't able to read the files.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
