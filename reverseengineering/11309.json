If you look at the exports from <code>user32.dll</code>, you'll see <code>DefWindowProcA</code> is alphabetically between exports <code>DeleteMenu</code> and <code>DefMDIChildProcA</code>. 2. The function name <code>NtdllDefWindowProc_A</code> sounds like it might be a hook or forwarded-function for <code>DefWindowProcA</code>.</span>",
