Not sure what unit the original poster had except it was QNX based but sort of assumed that the keys would be the same. Supplementary question on \"Just modify the parts of the file you need to modify, recalculate the SHA1 and update MetafileChecksum.\". Is there a process that I can do to re signature the file after I have changed it with the same \"public keys\". Thanks.</span>",
