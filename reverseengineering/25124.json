To do this you need to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pause the program, either via <code>Pause</code> option (F12) or using breakpoints</li>\n<li>Select <code>Trace</code> menu and then <code>Trace into...</code> (Ctrl+Alt+F7) or <code>Trace over...</code> (Ctrl+Alt+F8). If you want to log every instruction you probably want to use <code>Trace into...</code></li>\n<li>Now in the newly created window\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/p1vEI.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Trace dialog\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/p1vEI.png\"/></a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>you can select the <code>Log Text</code> format, you can use the proposed <code>0x{p:cip} {i:cip}</code> which will log the data to file like <code>0x006E8749 mov ebp, esp</code>. It is also good idea to set the <code>Maximum trace count</code> and the <code>Log File...</code> where the data will be stored. After you are done just press <code>OK</code> and the x64dbg will start executing your program and log all the instructions. Keep in mind that the program won't work really fast during the trace procedure.</p>\n</div>",
