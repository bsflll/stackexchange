And I am thinking to use <code>dynamic analysis</code> (say, <code>PIN</code>) to obtain an execution trace of each malware sample.</p>\n<p>However, I am afraid such activity would crash my computer. So am I asking, how to dynamically analysis malware samples <strong>safely</strong>?</p>\n<p>I know somehow I need to run it in a <code>VM</code>, but isn't it possible that the VM can be crashed as well? Should I reinstall the <code>VM</code> at that time? basically What's the best practice to do so? </p>\n<p>Thank you a lot. </p>\n</div>",

The guest OS or the environment inside the VM can be crashed though. In the event that it happens, you don't have to reinstall VM. Just follow SnakeByte instructions.</p>\n</div>",
