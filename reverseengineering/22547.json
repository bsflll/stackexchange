But when I run my app, it throw this exception:</p>\n<p>Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so: version `LIBC' not found (required by /tmp/jna-1195364489/jna8496397495292865633.tmp)</p>\n<p>So look like the libc.so version on my machine is not compatible with such elf file. I understand that Android app use bionic instead of glibc. How can I install these bionic *.so file into my Ubuntu linux so it can be used with such jar app?</p>\n</div>",
