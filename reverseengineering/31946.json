    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a USB device from a vendor (TRENDnet) that has the exact same chipset as a QNAP device with an available firmware patching tool.</p>\n<p>It's my belief that this firmware patching tool should work perfectly fine with my TRENDnet device.</p>\n<p>However, when I run the firmware patching tool, it reports that it cannot find a suitable device and exits.</p>\n<p>I believe the firmware patching tool is looking for specific USB <code>VIDs</code> and <code>PIDs</code> to detect\n<strong>valid</strong> USB devices. I've extracted from the drivers that these are the valid <code>VID/PID</code> combinations.</p>\n<pre><code>VID_2ECA - PID_C101\nVID_2ECA - PID_C102\nVID_0B95 - PID_2790\nVID_0B95 - PID_2791\nVID_1C04 - PID_0015\nVID_1C04 - PID_0016\n</code></pre>\n<p>I would like to see if it's possible to inject additional <code>PID/VID</code> values into the tool to allow my device to be detected and have the firmware upgraded.</p>\n<p>I've tried searching for the various <code>VID/PID</code> combos in a hex editor to no avail, and have also tried to decompile the app using IDA Free with no success (mainly because I have no idea what I am doing).</p>\n<p>Can someone either look at the file or offer some advice of what to do look for/try next?</p>\n<p>The firmware patching tool can be downloaded from this <a href=\"https://www.qnap.com/en-us/download?model=qna-uc5g1t&amp;category=firmware\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a>.</p>\n<p>The tool is named <code>aqusbupdate.exe</code> and it reads in <code>QNAP_QNA-UC5G1T_FW_3.1.6.bin</code> when passed in as an argument.</p>\n</div>",
