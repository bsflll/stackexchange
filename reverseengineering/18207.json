    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am learning to analyze binaries using radare2 and have been confused about what occurs within imported functions. In the binary below, titled Lab2B, I statically disassembled the binary and then disassembled one of the imported library functions, sym.imp.printf. As you can see below it merely lists one instruction: <code>jmp dword [reloc.printf]</code>. When I seek to the location <code>[reloc.printf]</code> and I print the disassembled functions contained at it, the command line prints \"Cannot find function at 0x0804a00c\". I have noticed the same behavior with all of the other imported functions. They often have a single instruction that points to an address that doesn't contain any instructions. </p>\n<p>Why are there no instructions contained at the address that the instruction tells the compiler to jump to?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LDuoZ.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LDuoZ.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

To understand that better you need to get familiar with two terms, PLT and GOT. Anyway, even if you are debugging the file, these are not functiona but a table with pointers. So <code>pdf</code> isn't what you should try. Give a shot to <code>pd</code>.</p>\n<h2>Dynamic Linking</h2>\n<p>The Procedure Linkage Table is a memory structure that contains a code stub for external functions that their addresses are unknown at the time of linking.  </p>\n<p>Whenever we see a <code>CALL</code> instruction to a function in the <code>.text</code> segment it doesnâ€™t call the function directly. Instead, it calls the stub code at the <code>PLT</code>, say <code>func_name@plt</code>. The stub then jumps to the address listed for this function in the Global Offset Table (<code>GOT</code>). If it is the first <code>CALL</code> to this function, the <code>GOT</code> entry will point back to the <code>PLT</code> which in turn would call a dynamic linker that will resolve the real address of the desired function. The next time that <code>func_name@plt</code> is called, the stub directly obtains the function address from the <code>GOT</code>. </p>\n<p>To read more about the linking process, I highly recommend <a href=\"https://www.airs.com/blog/archives/38\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this series of articles</a> about linkers by <em>Ian Lance Taylor</em>.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Radare2 is detecting the addresses of the PLT and GOT. Where you see <code>sym.imp.printf</code> it is actually the reserved address for <code>printf()</code> int the PLT. When you see <code>reloc.printf</code> is the address reserved for it in the GOT.</p>\n<p>By using <code>iS</code> you can list the sections of <code>PLT</code> and <code>GOT</code>.</p>\n</div>",
