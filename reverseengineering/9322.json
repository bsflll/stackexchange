    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to use YARA to sort out a variety of files into families. Some malware drops other malware from images within their resource images. What I'd like to do is write a signature that ignores string hits that exist within the resource section. This would allow my signatures to correctly identify droppers from the malware that is dropped. I tried doing something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>        (pe.sections[0].characteristics &amp; pe.SECTION_CNT_CODE) and $handshake \n</code></pre>\n<p>to limit my condition to the .text section, but this is definitely not write. That is going to trigger only if the .text section is the first section and the $handshake string exists anywhere within the binary. what I'd like is a way to limit the $handshake to the .text section (or in any section that is not the resource section).</p>\n<p>Is this even possible with YARA or is that getting a bit too complicated for YARA?</p>\n</div>",
