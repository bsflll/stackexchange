    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to remove a nag screen. Its window style is 16C80000, which should translate to <code>WS_VISIBLE | WS_CLIPCHILDREN | WS_CLIPSIBLINGS | WS_CAPTION | WS_SYSMENU</code>. So, in the call to CreateWindowExW() I set a conditional breakpoint at <code>PUSH EAX</code>, which determines the style. <br/>\nThe conditions I tried were <code>[EAX] == 16C80000</code> and <code>[EAX] == WS_VISIBLE | WS_CLIPCHILDREN | WS_CLIPSIBLINGS | WS_CAPTION | WS_SYSMENU</code>. Both give the same results. <br/>\nWhat happens is that the conditional breakpoint pretty much acts as a normal breakpoint I think. I get breakpoints at <code>Style = WS_POPUP</code>, and many other styles which I didn't specify. What I'd like is to find out what I'm doing wrong so that I can find the call to that goddamn nag :)<br/>\n<img alt=\"Screenshot\" src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/e04bae3cdaecec0531553e372c5be442.png\"/></p>\n</div>",

In the screenshot you can see that I've set a conditional breakpoint at <code>PUSH EAX</code>. It made a breakpoint when EAX was 80000000, even though the condition was equal to <code>[EAX] == 16C80000</code>. Why?</span>",
