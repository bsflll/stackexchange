IMO one solution for this scenario is stack scanning or crawling, which involves recursively traversing the stack by following pointers between stack frames. it may help identify specific values stored at memory addresses on the stack and pinpoint anomalies in the data. (but i am not sure about it, please correct me, I am still researching.)</span>",
