(I'm using x32dbg but can use Olly as well), i know there might be many ways, but what is the most common way? i just want some lead to go after</p>\n<p>sorry if this is a newbee question, tried googling and came up with some windows APIs but don't know how to patch it to change the title, tried changing some of them but didnt work </p>\n</div>",
