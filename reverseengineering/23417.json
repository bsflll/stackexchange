This simply gives a message advising that the extension has to be compiled first.    I then followed the instruction to compile the extension (inside the full Ghidra source tree and using a fork of binutils that supports ARC CPUs). The compile completed successfully, but as far as I can tell, it only created a single executable named 'gdis'. No extension ZIP archive was created that could then be installed from the 'File &gt; Install extension' menu item.</span>",
