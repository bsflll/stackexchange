    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have come across the following x86 (Built with some version of Visual Studio AFAIK) switch statement:</p>\n<pre><code>0x1009E476  cmp edx, 0x3B\n0x1009E479  jnz switch_statement\n\nswitch_statement:\n0x1009E591  movzx ecx, byte [indirect_table+edx]\n0x1009E598  jmp dword [table1+ecx*4]\n\nindirect_table:\n0x1009E7AB  db 0x07, 0x07, 0x07, 0x07, 0x07, 0x07, 0x07, 0x07\n            db 0x07, 0x07, 0x06, 0x8B, 0xFF\n\ntable1:\n0x1009E7B8  dd ptr code1\n            dd ptr code2\n            dd ptr code3\n            dd ptr code4\n            dd ptr code5\n            dd ptr code6\n            dd 0x00000000 \n0x1009E7D4  dd 0x01060600, 0x06020606, 0x06060306, 0x06060606 ; Note: nothing directly references this data.\n            dd 0x06040606, 0x06060606, 0x06060606, 0x06060606\n            dd 0x06060606, 0x06060606, 0x06060606, 0x06060606\n            dd 0x06060606, 0x06060606, 0x06060606, 0x06060606\n            dd 0x06060606\n</code></pre>\n<p>No index in the <code>indirect_table</code> will end up referencing any of the 6 pointers in <code>table1</code>. Index 6 will dereference a null pointer, index 7 will dereference <code>0x01060600</code> and indexes <code>0x8B</code> and <code>0xFF</code> will end up dereferencing garbage. So everything will end up access violating.</p>\n<p>So perhaps this is a compiler optimization, the data at table1 following the 6 code pointers and 1 null pointer looks like an indirect table, and coincidentally all indexes are suitable for this switch statement (0-6). While the binary has no references to this data, if <code>EBX</code> was known to be <code>0x29</code> or upwards, it would reference into this. The compiler may have decided <code>EBX</code> will not be <code>0</code>-<code>0x29</code> so moved the indirect table location backwards to line things up correctly. What then is the role of <code>cmp edx, 0x3B</code> in this?</p>\n<p><strong>Is this a compiler code gen issue, a compiler optimization, or have I grossly misunderstood the code?</strong> </p>\n<p>If an optimization, any supporting reading material would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n</div>",

And <code>8B FF</code> is <code>mov edi, edi</code>, used here for alignment.</p>\n<p>This specific optimization (no subtraction for zero-indexing) seems to be pretty rare; I think I've only seen it in Windows DLLs which often use PGO and other tricks to achieve the last few percents of performance.</p>\n</div>",
