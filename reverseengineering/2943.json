    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Is it possible to paste a series of bytes into hex view of IDA? Say I have a large buffer I need to fill with a specific value, and I have it in the form most hex editors output... 0A AB EF FF 00 01... is there some quick way to write this value to a segment of the hex view? Or do this through IDAPython?</p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n<p>Solved using PatchByte as suggested below:</p>\n<pre><code>def PatchArr(dest, str):\n  for i, c in enumerate(str):\n    idc.PatchByte(dest+i, ord(c));\n\n# usage: patchArr(start address, string of bytes to write)\npatchArr(0xCAFEBABE, \"\\x01\\x02\\x03\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that I am not a fan of edits to volatile debug memory causing IDA to complain about the IDB being patched post-debug...</p>\n</div>",

If you need to patch more bytes than that you can use IDAPython's <strong>idc.PatchByte</strong> / <strong>idc.PatchWord</strong> / <strong>idc.PatchDword</strong> to change bytes in the IDA database.</p>\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n<p>Just a quick note, if you want your patches applied to the original file that you loaded into IDA, you need to go to <strong>Edit-&gt;Patch Program-&gt;Apply patches to input file</strong> after you patch the bytes in the idb.</p>\n</div>",

Not as a patching tool, this has to do a lot with how IDA stores works. IDA creates a database file that allows you to remove the exe after loading it first. This can be really useful when you work with intellectual property / malware. I would recommend to use ImmDBG for your patching needs.</p>\n</div>",

IDA not being able to understand a memory segment is unimportant/patching should not be stored in the IDB is a legitimate bug. ImmDBG is a completely seperate use case, and the platforms it supports are very limited in comparison.</span>",
