I also know about Radare's bindiffer and the feature in <code>mona.py</code> (but this is more with memory regions).</p>\n<p>Now I use a HexEditor and diff using this. Then I'll lookup the offset + base address using Immunity.

And you should too :)) </p>\n</div>",

As how hard can it be to diff? =)  And I want make my diffing patches more productive, for vulnerability research sake.  Now I diff using the hex editor, Find the offset in ImmDbg and find what opcodes have changed. If I can combine the tools into one I'll give it a go.  About the PatchDiff being open source. I might try to write some Imm Plugin myself to get PatchDiffing to the level I want. (but I rather reverse than write code)</span>",

            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">It lacks features, it's for sure: Do you have the prototype of all functions in the binary? How does it find functions in the binary? Does it consider that a function can be partitioned in various small chunks? How are the basic blocks managed? Does a non conditional jump break the code? How good is it finding switch structures? Really, it lacks many information. As for \"how hard can it be to diff\", may be Rolf Rolles is interested in asking that question.</span>",

            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">Stolas, you seem to be unclear on what binary diffing is or how it works.  When we say \"binary diffing\" in the context of BinDiff, DarunGrim, PatchDiff, etc., we are specifically NOT talking about a diff involving the raw bytes of the executable, or using 'diff' on the raw disassembly.  These tools create a graphical disassembled representation of the two binaries, and then compare that.  As such, the quality of the diff tool depends upon the disassembler.  This is why the commentors keep mentioning IDA, and why I keep furrowing my brow at your suggestion of using a hex editor, Meld, or diff.</span>",
