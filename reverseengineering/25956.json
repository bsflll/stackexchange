    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>We have 32bit &amp; 64bit binaries, and in ROP (Return Oriented Programming), we sometimes target <code>RSP</code>/<code>ESP</code>, sometimes <code>RIP</code>/<code>EIP</code>, (maybe) sometimes <code>RBP</code>/<code>EBP</code> (I'm new to this, haven't seen <code>RBP</code> used yet). In ROP Emporium's <a href=\"https://ropemporium.com/challenge/ret2win.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ret2win</a> challenge, I hit (with the target address) <code>EIP</code> on the 32bit binary, but <code>RSP</code> on the 64bit since I couldn't get my payload to hit <code>RIP</code>.</p>\n<p>How do we choose which of the 3 registers to target when making a ROP chain/gadget?</p>\n</div>",
