Most surprising for many people is that the .NET framework itself is native.</p>\n<p>You can identify .NET DLLs in WinDbg using the <code>lm v</code> command. In case of a managed DLL it says:</p>\n<pre><code>0:008&gt; lmv m MyApp\nstart    end        module name\n10310000 10574000   MyApp(deferred)             \n    Image path: C:\\...\\MyApp.exe\n    Image name: MyApp.exe\n    Has CLR image header, track-debug-data flag not set\n    Timestamp:        Wed May 21 16:34:02 2014 (537CB95A)\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note the line <code>Has CLR image header</code> in the output. The .NET framework is also loaded in that process, but it is native and does not have such a line:</p>\n<pre><code>0:008&gt; lmv m mscorwks\nstart    end        module name\n79470000 79a1e000   mscorwks   (pdb symbols)          d:\\...\\mscorwks.pdb\n    Loaded symbol image file: C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\mscorwks.dll\n    Image path: C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\mscorwks.dll\n    Image name: mscorwks.dll\n    Timestamp:        Tue Oct 22 03:06:42 2013 (5265CFA2)\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are good reasons to use native DLLs by a managed application:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>because it's already implemented and stable</li>\n<li>for performance reasons: maybe C++ was just faster (maybe not in your case, since you don't seem to be happy with the performance)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>PhotoViewer.dll</code> is a native DLL, even if dotPeek says \"Platform: .Net Framework 4.5\". This seems to be a bug, because it also reports .NET for <code>kernel32.dll</code>.</p>\n<p>The properties <code>Assembly platform</code> and <code>Module Runtime</code> seem to be a bit inconsistent anyway. Here are some combinations I tried that caused results which at least would need some explanation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>kernel32: Platform 4.5, Runtime: none</li>\n<li>Jigfdt.fdt100: Platform 2.0, Runtime: 1.1.4322</li>\n<li>Fdt.ProfibusTransformers: Platform 4.0, Runtime 2.0.50727</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another way of detecting .NET is <a href=\"http://dependencywalker.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dependency Walker</a>. A pure .NET assembly typically has only one dependency on <code>mscoree.dll</code> while native DLLs depend on different things.</p>\n</div>",
