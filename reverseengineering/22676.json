It's hard for me to tell which one supports more, and I am not sure how meaningful that kind of comparison is. </p>\n<p>For more information, see this presentation and associated materials:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/0xAlexei/INFILTRATE2019\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/0xAlexei/INFILTRATE2019</a></p>\n<p>It should be noted that adding support for a new processor in Ghidra can be done via Sleigh. Here is an example: <a href=\"https://guedou.github.io/talks/2019_BeeRump/slides.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Implementing a New CPU Architecture\nfor Ghidra</a></p>\n</div>",

IDA does seem to have the upper hand but that gap is quickly closing in as Ghidra being an open-source tool has the community support. IDA though closed source has been around for a longer time so you would also find plenty of user developed processor modules.</p>\n</div>",
