In Windows 10 the flashing task bar buttons appear in all desktops, and it's just maddening when focusing on a work on another virtual desktop. Not a feature I want. The above messages are sent to Task switcher in explorer.exe, if I can prevent them being handled I can beat this.</p>\n<p>I've wealth of knowledge about the WndProc which I want to see, and modify from Spy++, following windows are Property Inspector of Spy++ (64 bit version):</p>\n<p>(Note: the 32bit version of Spy++ does not show Window Proc at all, just <code>(Unavailable)(Unicode)</code></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/k5L8n.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Window Proc address?\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/k5L8n.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OiDsN.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Thread ID\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OiDsN.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>And in x64dbg I have the thread open:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DZN8w.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"x64dbg open on the same thread\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DZN8w.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>But I just can't figure out how can I find the Window Proc in x64dbg?</p>\n</div>",
