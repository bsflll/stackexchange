    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to learn actually how to get to the PEB inside of TEB. I have tried this with <code>windbg</code> but could not manage to dump the PEB with stuff like:</p>\n<pre><code>!peb\n</code></pre>\n<p>or </p>\n<pre><code>dt nt!_PEB_LDR_DATA\n</code></pre>\n<p>And others. But, I could not manage to get the PEB dumped. So also my favorite debugger is still <code>immunitydbg</code>. So, I was trying to get to the information using <code>immunitydbg</code> CLI. But the nearest thing I have managed to get to PEB is dumping the TEB.</p>\n<pre><code>d fs:[0]\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, I there anyhow someway inside of immunity do get the contents of TEB/PEB? I also tried to use the <code>Ollysdbg</code> PE Dump plugin but that only gave me another exe file with different contents. And also i am not sure if the PE Plugin does the right thing for me. </p>\n</div>",
