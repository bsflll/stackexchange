    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>For the target processor TMS320C3x, IDA does not display all data in HEX-VIEW as ASCII,\nonly every 4th byte.\nThe minimum addressable data block for this target processor is a 32-bit word.\nIt seems that IDA takes the low byte from the word and prints it as ASCII, and does not use the remaining ones.\nHow can I fix IDA settings to resolve this issue? Maybe there is some plugin to fix this?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Xl68H.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"data types\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Xl68H.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XdDkF.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Hex_View in IDA\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XdDkF.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
