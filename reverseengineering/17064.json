            "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>As your initial instincts told you, it is quite a simple challenge and you are close. Let's understand together the logic of the program. As you did, I used radare2.</p>\n<p>Let's open the program in radare2:</p>\n<pre><code>$ r2 reverse2\n</code></pre>\n<p>Analyze the binary and print the main function:</p>\n<pre><code>[0x08048350]&gt; aa\n[0x08048350]&gt; pdf @ main\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to, you can use radare's great Visual Graph Mode to easily detect the function's flow:</p>\n<pre><code>[0x08048350]&gt; VV @ main\n</code></pre>\n<p>First the program checks whether you pass at least one argument to the program, i.e <code>num_of_arguments &gt; 1</code>. Remember that the filename counts as 1 argument so you'll need another one.</p>\n<pre><code>0x08048456      837d0801       cmp dword [arg_8h], 1\n0x0804845a      7f16           jg 0x804847\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then it checks if the file name is more than 15 characters long:</p>\n<pre><code>0x08048472      8b450c         mov eax, dword [arg_ch]     ; [0xc:4]=-1 ; 12\n0x08048475      8b00           mov eax, dword [eax]\n0x08048477      89442418       mov dword [local_18h], eax\n0x0804847b      8b442418       mov eax, dword [local_18h]  ; [0x18:4]=-1 ; 24\n0x0804847f      890424         mov dword [esp], eax\n0x08048482      e8a9feffff     call sym.imp.strlen         ; size_t strlen(const char *s)\n0x08048487      8944241c       mov dword [local_1ch], eax\n0x0804848b      837c241c15     cmp dword [local_1ch], 0x15 ; [0x15:4]=-1 ; 21\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, you need to change the file name to be more than 15 characters long and pass it at least one argument.</p>\n<p>Now for the interesting part. In the following conditions, the program is checking whether <code>filename[some_offset] == chr(0x??)</code> and if yes, it goes to another offset in the file name and checks the value there.<br/>\nSo, for example, in the first check you can see:</p>\n<pre><code>0x080484a7      8b442418       mov eax, dword [local_18h]\n0x080484ab      83c014         add eax, 0x14\n0x080484ae      0fb600         movzx eax, byte [eax]\n0x080484b1      3c73           cmp al, 0x73                ; 's' ; 115\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this block it checks whether <code>filename[0x14] == chr(0x73)</code> which radare hints you that 0x73 equals the letter 's'.</p>\n<p>If yes, it jumps to another block:</p>\n<pre><code>0x080484b9      8b442418       mov eax, dword [local_18h]\n0x080484bd      83c008         add eax, 8\n0x080484c0      0fb600         movzx eax, byte [eax]\n0x080484c3      3c67           cmp al, 0x67                ; 'g' ; 103\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this block the program checks whether <code>filename[8]=='g'</code>.<br/>\nAnd so on until it checks all the offsets.</p>\n<p>I'll leave it to you to solve it and figure out what should be the name of the program.<br/>\nGood luck!</p>\n</div>",

Maybe later there will be something that will steer to one of those solutions (i.e. checking the name) but for now it's looks like you can pick any.</p>\n</div>",
