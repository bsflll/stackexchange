    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've been working on figuring out the stack from a minidump [1]; but have put that on hold as I had other things to figure out.  Coming back to this problem, I figured I'd go back and use Windbg to help me with this.  I think I am on the right track.</p>\n<p>Using Windbg and showing the call stack, I don't understand a few lines that do not have addresses not associated to any known modules in the <code>lm</code> list.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre><code>...\n2a 0017ce64 61500ad3 cxt+0x3280ad3\n2b 0017ce98 61500ad3 cxt+0x32c0d8e\n2c 0017d500 0f026cf0 0x168d6f12\n2d 0017d56c 168d094f 0xf026cf0\n2e 0017d5a8 6154b791 cxt+0x32cb781\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>From <code>lm</code> it shows a list of available modules, amongst which <code>cxt</code> is there with base image.  But the address listed in frame <code>2c</code> and <code>2d</code> don't belong to any particular module.  There are similar lines further down in the call stack.</p>\n<p>I don't have the symbols available. I doubt this is the issue since a module has a base image and a size (and thusly an ending address).  If the two strange addresses don't belong to the range within the module in memory, it isn't part\nof the module.  (I would think).</p>\n<p>There's a lot of knowledge I'm missing, so I appreciate if someone can enlighten me as to what I'm missing.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>Ed</p>\n</div>",

I had thought I had loaded a different platform minidump; but when I loaded it in windbg, it stated that it couldn't load the timestamp for a particular dll file.  (so it is at least Windows)</span>",
