    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I've download recaf jar file and install JDK 8. When I execute it/start it, it all works fine with <code>java -jar recaf-2.12.0-J8-jar-with-dependencies.jar</code>. I open a class file also no problem. The issue is when I try to edit it is disabled saying:</p>\n<pre><code>// =============================================== //\n// Recompile disabled. Please run Recaf with a JDK //\n// =============================================== //\n\n// Decompiled with: CFR 0.150\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Any idea why and how to solve this issue? This is my first time using recaf as well so it might be a newbie question.</p>\n</div>",

Most of Recaf is based on the assembler, which you can find documentation on here: <a href=\"https://www.coley.software/Recaf/doc-edit-modes.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Class editing modes\"</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>This problem may still persist after a basic installation of Java 8 because the required platform tools are not added to the classpath. There is documentation on what files are required, where they are, and where you need to place them here: <a href=\"https://www.coley.software/Recaf/doc-setup-8.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Java 8 setup\"</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Alternatively you can update to Java 11 or higher where none of this configuration is necessary.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
