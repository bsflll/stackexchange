I opened the elf with HxD and I saw entry point is 0x1E9 (and no results on file for 01E8)...</p>\n<p>If I run on Kali terminal:</p>\n<pre><code>readelf --symbols CrackMe\n</code></pre>\n<p>I don't get any result. If I run:</p>\n<pre><code>readelf --sections Crackme\n</code></pre>\n<p>I get over 20 sections.</p>\n<p>If I try to execute the binary on Kali terminal:</p>\n<pre><code>./CrackMe\n</code></pre>\n<p>I get</p>\n<pre><code>zsh: exec format error.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I changed manually the byte of entry point that is different with HxD, E9 --&gt; E8, but I don't get any different results when I execute all again using the edited file.</p>\n<p>Any ideas? Thank you.</p>\n</div>",
