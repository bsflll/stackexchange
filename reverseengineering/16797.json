Yes, but this should be done during the compilation phase with tools like llvm. It must be done during the compilation, in order to have the full context of what is done by each instruction, and in order to make a really good metamorphing, not some stupid instruction replacement.</p>\n</div>",

Unfortunately I haven't found a ready metamorphing for ARM and llvm is useless for me because I don't access the source codes. I am searching for a generator but it seems there is not generator for my case or I haven't found anything yet!!! What is your idea? Should I do it myself since I need just code replacement?</span>",
