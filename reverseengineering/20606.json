    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have seen the JEB decompiler by <a href=\"https://www.pnfsoftware.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PNF Software</a> morph from a specialised decompiler to a full fledged reverse engineering platform like Capstone or IDA Pro.</p>\n<p>While examining the earlier versions of JEB, specifically the 1.x ones (some have been cracked and shared online, I noticed that it was created in pure Java, without any native code (JNI) and at most with the Jython library for access via Python API.</p>\n<p>In fact, this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JEB_decompiler\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> article states that JEB's base language is Java.</p>\n<p>However, if you look at the current features of JEB (currently at ver 3.X),\nis it possible that the entire software is written in pure Java? From what I know about Java's Write Once Read Anywhere, there seems to be no separate downloads for Windows, Mac or Linux.</p>\n<p>So is it technically possible to implement an IDA-Pro version in pure Java without any native code?</p>\n<p>Even <a href=\"https://github.com/aquynh/capstone\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Capstone</a> have new language (<a href=\"https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/tree/master/bindings/python\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Python</a>, Ruby and <a href=\"https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/tree/master/bindings/java\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Java</a>) bindings, but the decompiler engine is written in C/C++. Is this the case for JEB?</p>\n<p>I note there have been attempts <a href=\"https://github.com/jnr/jnr-x86asm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/ianopolous/JayD\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> plus a research <a href=\"http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ftp/pub/apt/theses/JohnBurcham_MSc.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a> to write a machine code dissembler/interpreter in pure Java, but doubt it can be stable enough to run a RE platform. Those repos I mentioned are experimental and outdated.</p>\n<p>As I do not currently have enough money to get myself a JEB licence, can anyone using or have dug in care to comment, so that we can maintain factual information online and on Wikipedia?</p>\n<p>EDIT: Ok. So when I finally do have the money to get myself a licence, I would like to know if its possible to hook <code>LoadLibraryA</code> or <code>LoadLibraryW</code> on Windows to determine. JEB uses an Eclipse RCP executable. So do I hook that executable or the JVM executable? Because the JVM on Windows uses many Windows API calls which will probably utilise the LoadLibraryX calls.</p>\n</div>",

The only major advantage is execution speed. Moreover, as JEB is directed towards Java programs (android APKs) writing it in Java makes sense.</p>\n<p>However, this question is not really about reverse engineering.</p>\n</div>",

You can look at the jeb*.jar files inside your install folders. They're huge, but that will give you an indication: thousands of big javaclass files in there, very few native so files.</p>\n</div>",
