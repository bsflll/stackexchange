Since you have not provided any instruction snippets or disassembly, I will try to wrap up process in few points in abstract way, though it will be cumbersome but bear with me:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reach the entry point of your PE by setting a breakpoint, you may need to change some settings in debugging options if you initially reach system library breakpoint.</li>\n<li>Now, by this time you have reached bp on entry point, Press <kbd>F8</kbd>(step over) one or two time. On CPU register window set hardware breakpoint on <code>esp</code> register value.</li>\n<li>Now with hardware bp set in step 2, Press <kbd>F9</kbd>(run) and you will reach hardware breakpoint and will be shown in disassembly.</li>\n<li>Now you only have to use <kbd>F8</kbd> as will have to reach the <code>OEP</code>(Original Entry Point), therefore using <kbd>F8</kbd> execute instructions step by step, you will notice a <code>jmp</code> instruction which will take you to <code>OEP</code> of your PE.</li>\n<li>Use Scylla or similar program to dump the current process(your packed program) and fix the import table of the dumped process. Now you have a unpacked MPRESS Portable executable. (Please don't forget to delete invalid imports in Scylla else unpacked file will refuse to run.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I know we haven't discussed working of MPRESS and few other details but that would make answer very long and unnecessary given the fact you have not provided disassembly.</p>\n</div>",
