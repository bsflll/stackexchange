I can break many features to avoid debugging/reversing and packer/protector (even Themida, without vm option), but I'm not good at virtualized code.</p>\n<p>Though I made own code virtualizing obfuscation tool, It's too hard to break other virtualized code framework.(e.g: Themida, VMProtect, Code Virtualizer)</p>\n<p>So, I decided to break easy target to get an insight that makes me be good at virtual cpu framework. but I can't find any good target for newbie. Could you recommend easy target(crackme or protector) for newbie?</p>\n<p>If possible, I want target of which virtualized-code was translated from x86 assembly code. </p>\n</div>",
