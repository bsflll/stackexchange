At first, I tried to find the circuit on the internet using part numbers, but I did not get any result. The PCB is from a very old alarm installation.</p>\n<p>Are there any tools or techniques I can use to get to know the structure of the layers I can't see?</p>\n</div>",

Part of the software that comes with them allows you to place part numbers between pads and have the circuit diagram automatically generated for you. Unfortunately, they're likely to set you back a fair bit of cash.</p>\n<p>An alternative is to use corrosives and sharp implements to manually split the layers, but that's difficult and prone to mistakes. If you've got a number of boards you can destroy in the process, this is probably the cheapest option.</p>\n</div>",
