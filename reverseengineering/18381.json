The underlying mechanism, IOCTLs, are explained as part of <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/introduction-to-i-o-control-codes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the documentation</a> for device drivers. Even the native function underlying the Win32 function <code>DeviceIoControl</code> <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntifs/nf-ntifs-ntdeviceiocontrolfile\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">is documented</a>.</p>\n<p>To find out what a particular IOCTL code means (the <code>224CDCh</code> in your case), use one of the following methods:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.osronline.com/article.cfm?article=229\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OSR IOCTL decoder</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/-ioctldecode\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>!ioctldecode</code> in WinDbg</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ioctls.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">IOCTL reference list</a> (your particular code isn't here, so apparently it's not a standard one)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first one yields this:<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wJ9LD.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"OSR IOCTL decoder in action for code 0x224CDC\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wJ9LD.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Now, frankly, you provide waaaay too litte information to provide more help. But it stands to reason that in order to find out what valid inputs the underlying device driver expects, you should find out the driver to which the device object (the one you opened with <code>CreateFileA</code>) belongs and then reverse engineer that. To find out, you can use a tool such as <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/winobj\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">WinObj</a> or similar. Because that driver is the place where the IRP (I/O Request Packet), which will be built internally by <code>ZwDeviceIoControlFile</code>, ends up.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I just wanted to add the suggestion to have a look at the very latest WDK headers at all times. The tools mentioned above may not always be up-to-date. But in this particular case, from experience, I'd say it's a custom IOCTL.</p>\n</div>",

The WDK does usually carry all the relevant IOCTLs for Windows components you interact with from another driver or user mode. However, as any third-party can define their own IOCTLs, these will not be contained. You can <i>decode</i> them exactly as pointed out above (there's no difference), however you won't be able to give that IOCTL a meaningful name without deducing its meaning from analyzing the target disassembly, for example.</span>",
