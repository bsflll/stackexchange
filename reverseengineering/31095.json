They also sell the <a href=\"https://novationmusic.com/en/circuit/circuit-rhythm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Circuit Rhythm</a>, which has some of the features the Tracks is missing but lacks others. It has several MIDI outputs and would make a fantastic MIDI controller, but it's firmware only allows the intended use <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeXnGgzktKY\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(many users feel this way)</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>First steps:</strong></p>\n<p>The Circuit Track's firmware can be updated using the Components website (and a standalone version) via <a href=\"http://midi.teragonaudio.com/tech/midispec/sysex.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MIDI Sysex messages</a>. This led me to discover a bunch of their firmwares, all directly accessible with incrementing indices :)</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: This link won't work without the authetication from Components:</strong>\n<a href=\"https://circuit-librarian.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/firmware/file/89/circuittracks-firmware-3891.syx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://circuit-librarian.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/firmware/file/89/circuittracks-firmware-3891.syx</a></p>\n<p>I was able to download the firmware as a .syx file (416 KB) and first tried running binwalk. No results. As I'm pretty new to this kind of reverse engineering I'm not quite sure how to continue.\nAs I understand it, the file probably is compressed and/or encrypted. Looking at it with <a href=\"http://binvis.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">binvis.io</a> yields an interesting pattern, though I have no idea what to make of it or whether it holds any relevance:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VPOg0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VPOg0.png\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>So my question is: How/where should I continue?</strong> I'm thankful for any kind of pointer, even if it's related literature/resources so I'll have some clue :)</p>\n</div>",

I haven't opened my unit and there seems to be no teardown information on the web.. guess I'll have to be the first. In case I do manage to open it non-destructively, I'll document the whole thing.</span>",

I just want you to know that there are lots of people who use CT and agree that its deliberately limited, and would be grateful if someone did some work on it, if it's reasonable.

There are github projects e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/dvhdr/launchpad-pro\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/dvhdr/launchpad-pro</a></p>\n</div>",
