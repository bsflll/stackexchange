I've seen this done before using <code>gdb</code> but haven't had any luck doing this on windows. I've tried disassembling executable in free version of IDA but structures tab doesn't show any classes.</p>\n<h3>EDIT:</h3>\n<p>I found this tool, but it only works for <code>C</code> structs: <a href=\"https://github.com/wbenny/pdbex\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/wbenny/pdbex</a></p>\n</div>",
