    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I recently work on Tricore Processor, but I have some problems.\nWith reading memory value. I do not know if I am right or not, but I think a part of flash memory copied to RAM and now in my algorithm used of RAM cell.\nI have shown Code in below:</p>\n<pre><code>ld32.a          a15, [a0]-0x7BA4 ; a0 = 0xD00032E0\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you see, a15 is an address that point to a constant value(store in RAM or FLASH) and <code>a0</code> is the base address of RAM memory. To calculate <code>a15</code>, I subtract <code>a0</code> from <code>0x7BA4</code> but the result is 0xCFFFB73C. This Address is not a valid address of RAM.<br/>\n<strong>EDITED:</strong><br/>\nI saw a freaky sentence in Tricore document.(I have shown in below)\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/dKIMH.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/dKIMH.jpg\"/></a><br/>\nAs you see, <code>A[0]</code> can be protected by user application.<br/>\n<strong>Could it be protected in this case as well?</strong><br/>\n<strong>What is my wrong? What should I do? How can I get the correct value of <code>a15</code>?</strong></p>\n</div>",

Try to look for references to C4000000 or C8000000, or other occurrences of <code>-0x7BA4</code> - maybe you’ll find the place where the variable is written to.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pulFC.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Scratchpad RAM memory map\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pulFC.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
