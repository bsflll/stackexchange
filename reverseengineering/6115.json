For example, Armadillo and ASProtect are both packers. You may want to focus on that. I don't know what technique is used in FlexNet, so I can't tell for this one.</span>",

About packers, a starter document could be this <a href=\"https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-07/Yason/Whitepaper/bh-usa-07-yason-WP.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PDF document</a>. And, if it raises some questions, do not hesitate to ask for clarification here ! It is fully in the topic of this website.</span>",
