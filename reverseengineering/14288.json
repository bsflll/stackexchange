For that, different compression algorithms were employed on code and  data parts of executables, and a small decompression code stub was added to reverse the process during the executable's runtime.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is that you take a given executable and compress it's entire code and data sections (which are often most of the file). You would then include the compressed output as part of a new executable and include in that new executable a subroutine that does the opposite - decompresses the compressed data back into it's original (bigger) form, and then execute the original uncompressed entry point as if the code was never compressed.</p>\n<p>As the need for compact executables faded when storage memory became cheaper an interesting property of compressed executables was discovered: a compressed executable's code is harder to read without prior decompression.\nDevelopers and coders started using compression to hide code they wanted to hide from third parties. Packing became a way to avoid or complicate reverse engineering processes and packers shifted focus from compression to obfuscation, encryption and anti-reverse-enginerring tools.</p>\n</div>",
