    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm developing a python script for IDA Pro that analyzes 32 bit PE files containing an anti-disassembly technique, the problem is that the function that contains the technique isn't being listed in the list of functions using <code>idautils.Functions()</code>.</p>\n<p>To solve the problem I tried to add the function to the list with:</p>\n<pre><code>segm = idaapi.get_segm_by_name(\".text\")\n    start = segm.start_ea\n    end = segm.end_ea\n    while start &lt; end:\n        start = idaapi.find_not_func(start, 1)\n        ida_funcs.add_func(start)\n</code></pre>\n<p>When the <code>start</code> value is the address of the beginning of the function the <code>ida_funcs.add_func</code> method returns false, meaning that the address can't be added as a function, despite that in the GUI of IDA the function becomes listed.</p>\n<p>This is the screenshot of the function containing the technique in the IDA GUI:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/neXXA.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/neXXA.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Do you know what can I do in order to have the script working? Thank you in advance.</p>\n</div>",
