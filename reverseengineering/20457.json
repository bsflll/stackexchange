I would advise you the reading of this <a href=\"https://doar-e.github.io/blog/2014/10/11/taiming-a-wild-nanomite-protected-mips-binary-with-symbolic-execution-no-such-crackme/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a> as a full example of reverse of a nanomite crack-me.</p>\n<p>Never the less, the problem of multi-thread or multi-process reverse-engineering is that in place of one sequence of events (with only one program), you have to follow in parallel multiple programs that interact (possibly in a non-deterministic way) with each others. It raise up exponentially the complexity of the reverse-engineering process.</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://doar-e.github.io/blog/2014/10/11/taiming-a-wild-nanomite-protected-mips-binary-with-symbolic-execution-no-such-crackme/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taming a wild nanomite-protected MIPS binary with symbolic execution: No Such Crackme </a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.w4kfu.com/post/Unpackme_I_am_Famous\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Unpackme I am Famous</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
