    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>At <strong>line #3</strong> of a function, I have a QWORD at address 7FE875F3FE0 which resolves to a value of <strong>85857490416</strong> for which the function returns true. If not, the value is set to 0.</p>\n<p>I would like to know how can I modify this QWORD to the said sequence of digits so that the function returns true. I have tried assembling this LoC, but it kills the function due to the non-match of the byte padding.</p>\n<p><strong>Code Cave</strong> is an option? If so, can somebody help me?
