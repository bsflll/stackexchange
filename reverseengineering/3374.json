    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I need some help regarding calls in assembly with Ollydbg.\nI'm messing around with a simple application.\nSo far, so good, I created a codecave for myself to add some code.</p>\n<p>But whenever I try to create a call to a function outside my debugged executable module to, for example, a <code>kernel32</code> or <code>msvcrt</code> function, it messes everything up.</p>\n<p>Let's look at some random call in the application:</p>\n<pre><code>0041D654     FF15 DC714200  CALL DWORD PTR DS:[&lt;&amp;KERNEL32.GetCommandLineA&gt;]\n</code></pre>\n<p>When I double click it, it shows me <code>CALL DWORD PTR DS:[4271DC]</code>\nSo, <code>4271DC</code> seems to point to <code>76FB496D</code>, which is, indeed:</p>\n<pre><code>76FB496D &gt;-FF25 60070177    JMP DWORD PTR DS:[&lt;&amp;api-ms-win-core-processenvironment-l1-2-0.Get&gt; ;KERNELBA.GetCommandLineA\n</code></pre>\n<p>Well, I just stole that from the application itself.\nNow I want to create a call to <code>kernel32</code> myself.\nI assemble a line and enter <code>CALL DWORD PTR DS:[Kernel32.GetCommandLineA]</code>\nNow it's saying:</p>\n<pre><code>0041D654     FF15 6D49FB76  CALL DWORD PTR DS:[KERNEL32.GetCommandLineA]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Looking good!</p>\n<p>Assemble the line <code>CALL DWORD PTR DS:[76FB496D]</code>. Giving this a run works fine ofcourse, but whenever I run it like this on another pc, all hell breaks loose.</p>\n<p>My question is: How can I make such an pointer <code>CALL DWORD PTR DS:[4271DC]</code>, so the code runs on all pc's?</p>\n<p>I can of course use <code>CALL DWORD PTR DS:[4271DC]</code> in the application to call the function <code>getcomandlineA</code> whenever I want, but I don't know the (dynamic?) pointer to, let's say, <code>kernel32.lstrcpy</code>.</p>\n</div>",
