I could not find a way that I can route my network traffic to cuckoo.</p>\n</div>",

It redirects all traffic leaving a machine to the localhost (including hard-coded IP traffic and DNS traffic) and implements several protocols to ensure that malicious code continues to execute and can be observed by an analyst.</p>\n<p>The tool supports DNS, HTTP, and SSL protocols and provides a python extension interface for implementing new or custom protocols. It also the capability to listen for traffic to any port as well as create packet capture on the localhost.</p>\n<p>Right now the tool only supports WinXP Service Pack 3. The tool runs fine on Windows Vista/7 although certain features will be automatically disabled.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that FakeNet is not a sandbox but is employed when analyzing binaries on an isolated system.</p>\n<p>If neither of these tools are what you are looking for, here is a long list of online scanners and sandboxes: <a href=\"https://github.com/rshipp/awesome-malware-analysis#online-scanners-and-sandboxes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/rshipp/awesome-malware-analysis#online-scanners-and-sandboxes</a>\nand here is Lenny Zeltser's list of free automated malware analysis sandboxes and services: <a href=\"https://zeltser.com/automated-malware-analysis/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://zeltser.com/automated-malware-analysis/</a></p>\n<p>If there is no tool that meets your requirements you can always create your own analysis lab. Books that will provide guidance for such an endeavor include \"Practical Malware Analysis\" by Honig and Sikorski (creators of FakeNet) and \"Malware Analyst's Cookbook\" by Ligh and Adair.</p>\n</div>",
