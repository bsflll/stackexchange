However I can't promise that this is the best or most convenient way. At the very least, this method is OS dependent. </p>\n<p>First, create a named pipe:</p>\n<pre><code>root@kali:~# mkfifo my_pipe\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, open two shells. </p>\n<p>On one shell, redirect GDB's input as the pipe's output:</p>\n<pre><code>root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/stackoverflow/24610# gdb -nh test &lt; ~/my_pipe\n</code></pre>\n<p>On the other shell, open a Python REPL and connect to the named pipe:</p>\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; f = open(\"/root/my_pipe\", \"w\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>The moment you open the pipe, you should see GDB get unblocked on the first shell:</p>\n<pre><code>Reading symbols from test...\n(No debugging symbols found in test)\n(gdb)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, define the following function in the Python REPL:</p>\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def cmd(f, s): f.write(s); f.write(\"\\n\"); f.flush()\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should be able to enter input for GDB using the newly defined <code>cmd</code> command. For example, to run the program, enter:</p>\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cmd(f, \"r\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will run the program in the other shell:</p>\n<pre><code>(gdb) Starting program: /media/sf_CTFs/stackoverflow/24610/test\nPlease enter input\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can break GDB with CTRL+C, just remember that all commands need to be entered via <code>cmd</code>.</p>\n<p>When the time is right, you can send your Python command:</p>\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cmd(f, 'A' * 10)\n</code></pre>\n<p>It will be received in the other side:</p>\n<pre><code>(gdb) Continuing.\nAAAAAAAAAA\n[Inferior 1 (process 1187) exited normally]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Don't forget to close the named pipe when you're done:</p>\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; f.close()\n</code></pre>\n<p>If this works for you, you can go ahead and create a Python script that acts as an interactive shell, instead of using the REPL.</p>\n</div>",
