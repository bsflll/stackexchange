    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>This is my first question on this forum, so I hope that it would not be offensive or redundant.</p>\n<p>So recently I am attempting to developing some kernel extensions for Apple's macOS using the IOKit framework. However, in the debugging process, I encountered some confusions while looking at the assembly and pseudocode of my binaries generated by IDA.</p>\n<p>Currently, the greatest issue is how the normal switch case statement is interrupted by the decompiler — <code>_bittest64</code> commands would be yielded with huge numbers as arguments. I am somewhat sure that it has to do with the “lower-bound” of the cases, but I don't know how exactly should I comprehend it. Here is an example:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Actual code\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LOxqp.png\">\n<img alt=\"Hex-Rays decompiler pseudocde\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Qf0zs.png\"/></img></p>\n<p>I can't really see how they relate, particularly the <code>_bittest64</code> part. Just by the way, the enum <code>kBluetoothIntelHardwareVariantJfP = 0x11</code> and <code>kBluetoothIntelHardwareVariantSlrF = 0x19</code>.</p>\n<p>Happy thanksgiving!</p>\n</div>",

Note that the weird output is not Hex-Rays' doing, but rather, a more-or-less direct translation of what's in the assembly language. You didn't show the assembly for your snippet, but here's similar disassembly from a database I have open:</p>\n<pre><code>.text:0000000061FEA1C8     lea     eax, [rdi-33h]\n.text:0000000061FEA1CB     cmp     eax, 0Eh\n.text:0000000061FEA1CE     ja      short loc_61FEA1F8\n.text:0000000061FEA1CE\n.text:0000000061FEA1D0     mov     edx, 6381h\n.text:0000000061FEA1D5     bt      edx, eax ; &lt;- this becomes _bittest\n.text:0000000061FEA1D8     jnb     short loc_61FEA1F8\n</code></pre>\n<p>And here's its Hex-Rays decompilation:</p>\n<pre><code>  if ( (vChildOp - 51) &gt; 0xE )\n    return /* ... */;\n\n  v6 = 25473;\n  if ( !_bittest(&amp;v6, vChildOp - 51) )\n    return /* ... */;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's take a closer look at your snippet. You said that <code>kBluetoothIntelHardwareVariantJfP = 0x11</code> and <code>kBluetoothIntelHardwareVariantSlrF = 0x19</code>. Now look at the constant, <code>0x39E0000LL</code>. This is <code>11100111100000000000000000b</code> in binary:</p>\n<pre><code>11 1001 1110 0000 0000 0000 0000\n|| |  | |||- bits 0-16 clear   \n|| |  | ||-- bit 17 (i.e., 0x11): first bit set\n|| |  | |--- bit 0x12 set\n|| |  | ---- bit 0x13 set\n|| |  ------ bit 0x14 set\n|| --------- bit 0x17 set\n|----------- bit 0x18 set\n------------ bit 0x19: last bit set\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that the <code>switch</code> statement in your example has 7 cases leading to the same label, and that two of the cases correspond to bits <code>0x19</code> and <code>0x11</code>? It is not a coincidence that the constant in the snippet has 7 bits set, including bits <code>0x11</code> and <code>0x19</code>! The <code>bt</code> instruction, translated as the <code>_bittest</code> intrinsic, is just checking to see whether <code>hardwareVariant</code>, or <code>a2</code> in the decompilation, is one of the values <code>0x11</code>-<code>0x14</code> or <code>0x17-0x19</code>. It performs all 7 comparisons at the same time.</p>\n<p>The <code>if</code>-statement on the outside is the <code>default</code> check: it ensures that the value of <code>a2</code> is at most <code>0x19</code> -- if it's not, it jumps to the <code>default</code> location, i.e., does nothing.</p>\n</div>",

Hex-Rays erroneously thinks this function returns a value, so it tries to create an assignment expression for the <code>rax</code> register. In this case, the only such assignment takes place as part of the <code>bt</code> sequence, which is why we get garbage inside of an <code>if</code>-statement.</span>",

                    "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">@blabb I rely on clues like the one you identified. If some paths through a function don't return a value,  it probably returns <code>void</code>. If none of the calling functions use the return value, it may or may not be <code>void</code>, but there's no harm in marking it as such. If a function supposedly returns <code>void</code>, but calling functions show usage of uninitialized values allocated in the <code>rax</code> register after the call, it does not return <code>void</code>. There's a recursive effect; if you determine a called function returns <code>void</code>, that may give you evidence that a calling function does also.</span>",
