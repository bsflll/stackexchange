And it seems like <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/sippeyfunlabs/matlab-hacks/please-do-not-secure-your-password-in-matlab-p-code\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">someone has done this</a> and produced an online .p code decryptor. They won't share the code, but you can use the <a href=\"http://web-service.sippey.org/de_pcode.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">online decryptor</a>.</p>\n<p>So, to answer your question: Yes, there is an online decriptor for it.</p>\n</div>",
