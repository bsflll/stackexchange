    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>When reverse engineering a big application, it can be very useful to be able to see the network traffic it generates.</p>\n<p>Because of this, many applications use HTTPS to communicate with their servers. Bypassing this has become easy to do with tools like Charles (SSL Proxy).</p>\n<p>As a result, some applications have begun to use Certificate Pinning which does not allow a proxy to intercept traffic.</p>\n<p>What are some solutions around this problem, ideally, I'm looking for a methodology, tools and techniques to do this in Windows applications.</p>\n</div>",
