    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm new to IDAPython. Basically I want to iterate through all functions in an IDB file and their instructions using ida python script. The final goal is to export the functions &amp; their instructions from idapro. in certain format.</p>\n<pre><code>from idautils import *\nfrom idaapi import *\n\nea = BeginEA()\nfor funcea in Functions(SegStart(ea), SegEnd(ea)):\n    functionName = GetFunctionName(funcea)\n    print functionName\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using above script I'm retrieving function names, now I also want to print the assembly instructions of each function. I know may I have to use GetDisasm(ea), not sure how to use the API.</p>\n<p>TIA</p>\n</div>",
