All i got are ads traffics.</p>\n<p>I have ensure that I have enabled proxy on Android system, have certificate installed, filtered target process and check if https decryption is working. All fine. I have reseted cert and fiddler 2 but it doesn't help</p>\n<p>I have heard it uses socket system, i don't know excatly what he meant.\nThis online game requests a lot of data. I checked logcat and i see that the game retrieved some json data but there is not enough infomation.</p>\n<p>I'm missing something there?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/phWHj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/phWHj.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
