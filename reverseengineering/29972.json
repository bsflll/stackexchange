    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Reverse engineering the protocol of a remote-controlled wall socket (433MHz On-Off-Keying) revealed an embedded pattern which apparently uses three symbols (besides 0s).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Symbol A = 000001</li>\n<li>Symbol B = 00000101</li>\n<li>Symbol C = 0000010101</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The receiver identifies the remote via the sync word K = ABBBBCBACBACBBACBACABBCABC.</p>\n<p>The remote can control up to four individual sockets which learn one of those fixed four codes when a button is pressed to trigger learning mode.\nI <em>assume</em> that different remotes have individual sync words and thus won't interefe with one another. But I cannot confirm that, as I only possess one remote.</p>\n<p>To turn on the first socket, the remote sends DN[0], where</p>\n<ul>\n<li>D = KB (specifying that a <em>single device</em> shall be turned on)</li>\n<li>N = AB (specifying that the device shall be <em>turned on</em>)</li>\n<li>[0] = BBBB (specifying device with <em>index 0</em>, so the first device)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The remote features a global mode which is able to control all devices simultaniously.\nTo turn on all devices, the remote sends GBB[0], where</p>\n<ul>\n<li>G = KA (specifying that all devices shall be controlled)</li>\n<li>BB (specifying that the devices shall be <em>turned on</em>)</li>\n<li>[0] (specifying the index of the device and is left blank, so identical to index 0)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I assume that the <strong>underlying semantic code</strong> (to turn the device on) <strong>is the same</strong>, no matter if all devices are controlled simultaniously (via GBB) or via a single device instruction (DN).</p>\n<p>I have the gut feeling that BB is actually analog to the bits 00,\n<br/> that the device codes are analogous to the bits 00, 01, 10, and 11 respectively.</p>\n<p>Somehow, the analogy doesn't hold in any case. But the relationship between codes does:\n<br/> BBBB for device index 0, binary 00\n<br/> BBCA for device index 1, binary 01\n<br/> BCAB for device index 2, binary 10\n<br/> BCBA for device index 3, binary 11\n<br/> It definitively reminds me of an incrementing counter, but it has been passed through some encoding scheme that I was unable to figure out so far.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Question</h2>\n<p><strong>All codes I initially thought of (like Non-Return-To-Zero, etc.) encode data using two symbols.\n<br/> Does anybody of you have an idea which encoding results in something similar to the three-symbol-encoding I described here?</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>In summary:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>G=KA (global)</li>\n<li>D=KB (individual device)\n<br/><br/></li>\n<li>N=AB (on)</li>\n<li>F=BA (off)\n<br/><br/></li>\n<li>[0]=BBBB (device 00)</li>\n<li>[1]=BBCA (device 01)</li>\n<li>[2]=BCAB (device 10)</li>\n<li>[3]=BCBA (device 11)\n<br/><br/></li>\n<li>X_ON/OFF: D[N/F][X] (code to turn on/off a single device)</li>\n<li>ALL_ON:      GBB[0] (code to turn on     all devices)</li>\n<li>ALL_OFF:     GCA[0] (code to turn    off all devices)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While pressing a button on the receiver, it can be paired to one of the four constant sender codes.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Example:</h3>\n<p>To turn on the first device (ID 0) the sender has to send</p>\n<pre><code>Individual Device,              ON,             ID_0\n = D                            N               [0]\n = KB                           AB              BBBB\n = ABBBBCBACBACBBACBACABBCABC   AB              BBBB\n = 00000100000101000001010000\n   01010000010100000101010000\n   01010000010000010101000001\n   01000001000001010100000101\n   00000101000001000001010100\n   00010100000100000101010000\n   01000001010000010100000101\n   01000001000001010000010101   00000100000101  00000101000001010000010100000101\n</code></pre>\n<p>So inside a continuous stream of OOK data (at the right sample rate), it would look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>...000000000000000000000000000000010000010100000101000001010000010100000101010000010100000100000101010000010100000100000101010000010100000101000001000001010100000101000001000001010100000100000101000001010000010101000001000001010000010101000001000001010000010100000101000001010000010100000000000000000000...\n</code></pre>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Further Context</h3>\n<p>Label on the receiver says\n<code>00121949</code> / <code>hama F3400257</code> / <code>Hama GmbH &amp; Co KG</code> / <code>www.hama.com</code></p>\n</div>",
