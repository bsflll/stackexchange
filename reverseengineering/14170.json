I believe the 11 or so crackmes included in the challenges.zip file are similar to the IOLI crackme files, for which there are many tutorials available.</p>\n<p>One of the binaries in the bombs.zip file is called \"cmubomb\" which is Carnegie Mellon University's binary bomb, <strike>also available at their student lab site <a href=\"http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/2e/labs.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/2e/labs.html</a>,</strike> for which there are also many tutorials across the web. </p>\n<p>NYU also has some reverse engineering \"challenge applications\" to analyze at <a href=\"https://github.com/isislab/Hack-Night#workshop-materials-5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/isislab/Hack-Night#workshop-materials-5</a>.</p>\n<p>Note: The binaries from the aforementioned sources are Linux ELF 32-bit executables. Almost all are unstripped. If you would like to analyze Windows binaries, you can get Win32 versions of the IOLI crackmes from <a href=\"https://github.com/radare/radare2book/tree/master/crackmes/ioli\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/radare/radare2book/tree/master/crackmes/ioli</a>. The IOLI-crackme.tar.gz file available for download there contains 10 Windows PE32 executable files. </p>\n<p>Update: The CMU labs, including the binary bomb, now require an Instructor account to download.</p>\n</div>",
