You can look at the mona.py script for examples on how to do that. The script is very large but you should find what you are looking for in the class MnModule, for example the flag for ALSR is checked at line 1726. (Note: in this script dbglib is an abstraction class to support both Immunity Debugger and WinDBG, it maps directly to immlib).</p>\n<p>Script source : <a href=\"http://redmine.corelan.be/projects/mona/repository/entry/mona.py\">http://redmine.corelan.be/projects/mona/repository/entry/mona.py</a></p>\n</div>",
