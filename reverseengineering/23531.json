If you can't find it, then the text is probably obfuscated. Place a break point on <code>CreateFile</code> or other file opening functions and look for where the string is being passed from. You can also backtrack using the stack when the message box gets displayed to see from where it branched from, place a break point, restart the program and keep on doing that till you find from where it passes the string.</span>",

Here is the <a href=\"https://github.com/MontyLeGueux/Lutebot-2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a>. Path resolution is done at line 90 in <code>LuteBot/IO/Files/SaveManager.cs</code>. Change the name of the <code>ini</code> file there.</p>\n<p>If you just want to patch the string in the binary, make sure you search for unicode strings since C# will use unicode strings by default.</p>\n</div>",
