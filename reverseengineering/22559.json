To be completely honest this data is the hash value, so bytes could vary from 00 to FF.</p>\n<p>I have found out that I can abuse this function with zero bytes to make <code>strlen</code> outputting less value than it should (as an example the string is 10 bytes long, but <code>strlen</code> output is 6). </p>\n<p>Is there any way to abuse the function with any byte data inputted to <code>strlen</code> to output a bigger value(lets say 14)?</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n</div>",

If that's the case, <code>strlen</code> will happily continue counting bytes until it finds one, moving out of the input's bounds. It then depends on how clean the memory is where the input is allocated.</p>\n</div>",
