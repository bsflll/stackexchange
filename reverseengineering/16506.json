    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am currently trying to reverse an IoT machine running the 2.6 Linux Kernel on which I have root. On this machine, software writes to /dev/<em>some_device</em> to control what I believe to be are GPIO pins for a serial bus. In order to take control of these GPIO pins, I have been attempting to reverse the on-board software to grasp how the drivers are looking for input, but the decompilation has been messy/missing parts. </p>\n<p>Thus, my question: \n<strong>Am I able to redirect program output intended for /dev/<em>some_device</em> to a text file for analysis?</strong></p>\n<p>For example, the current mapping:</p>\n<pre>\nProgram -&gt; (char sequence) -&gt; /dev/*char_device*\n</pre>\n<p>I am looking for a way to redirect the program output from the device to a text file, or better, any writes to the device to a text file. Example:</p>\n<pre>\nProgram -&gt; (char sequence) --\\       /dev/*char_device*\n                              \\\n                               \\-----&gt; *my_text_file*\n</pre>\n<p>Again, my motivation to do so is to analyze how the driver is expecting input. I already know my logical input/output/return communications on the serial bus, I just need to be able to determine the specifics of the device driver. Any help is appreciated. Let me know if more information is required.</p>\n<p>-Update-\nHere is a method I tracked down in the source code decompliation. While I cannot verify that this is the exact handler for the devices I'm targeting, it used by devices with similar names. </p>\n<pre>\n// Address range: 0x1000c470 - 0x1000c6f7\nint32_t function_1000c470(int32_t * a1, int32_t a2, int32_t a3, char * path) {\n    int32_t v1 = (int32_t)a1;\n    int32_t v2; // bp-144\n    int32_t v3 = &amp;v2 // 0x1000c470_0\n    v2 = v3;\n    g602 = v3;\n    int32_t fd = open(path, O_RDWR);\n    int32_t * fd2 = (int32_t *)(v1 + 4); // 0x1000c4a8_0\n    *fd2 = fd;\n    if (*fd2  0x1000c6d8\n    } else {\n        // 0x1000c500\n        fprintf(g94, \"opening serial device %s with fd %d\\n\", path, *fd2);\n        int32_t termios_p;\n        tcgetattr(*fd2, (struct termios *)&amp;termios_p);\n        cfmakeraw((struct termios *)&amp;termios_p);\n        cfsetospeed((struct termios *)&amp;termios_p, 9);\n        cfsetispeed((struct termios *)&amp;termios_p, 9);\n        tcsetattr(*fd2, TCSANOW, (struct termios *)&amp;termios_p);\n        ioctl(*fd2, 0x5415);\n        g1 &amp;= -0x2000001;\n        ioctl(*fd2, 0x5418);\n        *(int32_t *)(v1 + 16) = 0;\n        *(int32_t *)(v1 + 20) = 0;\n        int32_t * v4 = (int32_t *)(4 * *fd2 / 32 + v1 + 1668); // 0x1000c630_0\n        *v4 = 1  0x1000c674\n        }\n        // 0x1000c674\n        *(int32_t *)(v1 + 8) = v7 + 1;\n        *(int32_t *)(v1 + 1624) = 0;\n        *(int32_t *)(v1 + 1620) = 0;\n        *(int32_t *)(v1 + 1628) = 0;\n        memset((char *)(v1 + 120), 0, 1500);\n        function_1000c6f8(*fd2, 0);\n        // branch -&gt; 0x1000c6d8\n    }\n    int32_t v8 = v2; // 0x1000c6dc\n    g602 = *(int32_t *)(v8 - 4);\n    return *(int32_t *)(v8 + 4);\n}\n</pre>\n</div>",
