What's the significance of <code>0x13AB</code>, how you got that value and what's it's relation with <code>lpName</code>?</span>",

                    "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">Totally agree with @NirIzr. This answer makes a whole lot of assumptions and should at the very least mention them explicitly. For example it's well possible to use <code>DialogBoxIndirect()</code> and <code>DialogBox()</code> and their variants without having to resort <code>FindResource()</code>. And while internally something like <code>FindResource()</code> will be employed to look up the resource, this call won't happen from that executable but somewhere in the opaque part of the call path. Also the internal version will likely not be <code>FindResource()</code> but something like <code>LdrFindResource_U()</code> ...</span>",
