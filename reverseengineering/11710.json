    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Even a minimal console Delphi program that has <code>IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_DYNAMIC_BASE</code> set in its PE image does not use ASLR.</p>\n<p><code>GetProcessMitigationPolicy()</code> returns a <code>PROCESS_MITIGATION_ASLR_POLICY</code> of 0.</p>\n<p>Consequently ProcessHacker (which uses this function) reports the process for this Delphi program to have ASLR disabled -- go into the process details window of ProcessHacker to see the ASLR status.</p>\n<p>I can provide a minimal compiled Delphi program if that helps. I haven't been able to find out why ASLR is not activated.</p>\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong>\nRelocation information is part of the executable. After even more debugging I found out that Delphi's delay loading code for functions imported from DLLs is the culprit. I'll precise the question when I have more information or a solution.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit2:</strong>\nI posted the executables as attachment in the following forum, since I found no way to attach anything here:\n<a href=\"http://wj32.org/processhacker/forums/viewtopic.php?p=6887#p6887\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://wj32.org/processhacker/forums/viewtopic.php?p=6887#p6887</a></p>\n</div>",

In older Delphi compilers this problem don't exist and as your mentioned it is due to some API's being converted to delayed load import functions.</p>\n<p>A while ago I reported this issue to Embarcadero and it seems they are working on it (<a href=\"https://blog.marcocantu.com/blog/rad111_pe_security.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://blog.marcocantu.com/blog/rad111_pe_security.html</a>). They provided a solution for now and willing to fix it in the near feature (I hope the next release).</p>\n</div>",
