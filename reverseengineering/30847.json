You can download the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/jvms8.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JVM spec for version 8</a> and place it in <code>\\ghidra_XX.X.X_PUBLIC\\Ghidra\\Processors\\JVM\\data\\manuals</code>. The JVM.idx file describes where in the processor manual to look for the specific instruction you're asking about. If you right-clicked on a <code>bipush</code> instruction and clicked \"Processor manual\" it would then pull up your jvms8.pdf file and flip to page 396 where it talks about the <code>bipush</code> instruction.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure if you can add it to the end of the line. The per-instruction view in Ghidra can be customized when you click on the button at the top of the Listing window (it should say \"Edit the Listing fields\") - that will allow you, for instance, to rearrange the order the address/instruction/bytes appear. By editing the listing, you for instance can turn on the Pcode viewer that lets you see the intermediate language.</p>\n<p>If you were going to turn on instruction descriptions, that is the place you would do it. However, I don't see an option to do it.</p>\n</div>",
