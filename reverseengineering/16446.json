Then you can use a debugger to run the command-line that will cause the DLL to be loaded, and the debugger will regain control.  At that point, you can restore the replaced byte with the original value, and single-step or run to breakpoints that you set.</p>\n</div>",

Anyway, I just made some assembly that loaded the dll and pulled the exports from.jt and jmped to it. The int 3 helps stop on secondary entry.</span>",
