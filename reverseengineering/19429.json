Instead, the piece of code seen in your ollydbg screen shot is the implementation of the following line from the poor quality source code image you attached:</p>\n<pre><code>if ((!key) || (key &gt; (0x1337 * 2000)))\n</code></pre>\n<p>First, in address <code>0x01051C09</code>, <code>key</code> is compared to <code>0</code>. If <code>key</code> equals <code>0</code> a jump to <code>0x01051C18</code> is taken. Otherwise, <code>key</code> is compared to <code>0x0961DB0</code>. If <code>key</code> is below or equal to <code>0x0961DB0</code> another jump is taken. If <code>key</code> is <em>greater</em> than <code>0x0961DB0</code> execution continues to <code>0x01051C18</code>.</p>\n<p>As you should've guessed by now, <code>0x0961DB0</code> is simply <code>0x1337</code> times 2000.</p>\n<p>Instructions <code>0x01051C18</code> to <code>0x01051C22</code> are the implementation of calling <code>wrong</code>, setting <code>eax</code> to the correct return value (<code>1</code>) and then jumping to where (I assume) the function prolog and <code>ret</code> are executed.</p>\n</div>",
