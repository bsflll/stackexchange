    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I would like IDA to remember my default load file settings instead of presenting the <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/242.shtml\" rel=\"noreferrer\">load file</a> dialog on every start. \n<a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/417.shtml\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The documentation says</a> there is a <strong>-T</strong> command line switch that should take a 'file type prefix' argument and then not display the load file dialog, but I don't know what a valid 'file type prefix' would be. I tried -TPE but a warning popped up saying 'PE' was not recognized. </p>\n<p>Any suggestions?</p>\n</div>",
