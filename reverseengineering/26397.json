    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'd like to get the inferred value of a register at a particular point in the disassembly listing in a Ghidra script.</p>\n<p>In my case the target instruction is a <code>rdmsr</code> or <code>wrmsr</code> instruction, which reads or writes the MSR at <code>ecx</code>. While I could walk back through the previous instructions and look for a simple <code>mov ecx, const</code> pattern, there are significantly more ways to set <code>ecx</code> to some known value that the decompiler is capable of inferring.</p>\n<p>I've tried calling <code>getRegisterValue</code> on the <code>rdmsr</code> instruction, passing in a <code>Register</code> type describing <code>ecx</code>, but this just returns <code>None</code>. Is there a way to infer register values at a particular instruction?</p>\n<p>Here's the disassembly:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mk8VS.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"disassembly\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mk8VS.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>And the decompiled result:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wvPUo.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"decompiled code\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wvPUo.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Here's the P-Code:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZwJKI.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"disassembly with p-code\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZwJKI.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

I don't have a binary to test how these instructions are handled exactly though. If they in any form contain the information that they depend on the value of <code>ecx</code> then I would expect that the decompiler will optimize the PCode instruction to directly use the constant as the PCode argument instead if possible, like in the attached image. A quick glance into <code>x86.sla</code> seems like <code>RDMSR</code> is indeed defined in a way that should allow this to happen.</p>\n<p>The general results of any kind of value analysis that happens inside the decompiler is not exposed in a way that I know of though.</p>\n<p>[0] This is not the PCode from the instruction but from the decompiler token. You can get this by clicking on a token (like <code>ioctl</code> in the decompiler and then accessing <code>currentLocation.token.pcodeOp</code> in the Jython shell</p>\n</div>",
