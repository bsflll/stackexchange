    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am debugging an apk app that I do not have the sources for. I want to debug it on a smali level, not decompiled.</p>\n<p>I used to do this with apktool, but looking at their website, smali-debugging is deprecated and they point to SmaliIdea - a plugin for android studio. So I installed that, and indeed - it works fine: I can step, set breakpoints, view smali registers (v7,v8,v9 etc) when I set a watchpoint on them.</p>\n<p>What I cant do is actually modify those registers / local variables. I can see them when I set a watchpoint on them, but cant assign a value.</p>\n<p>Looking at \"planned features\" of SmaliIdea:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Show all registers with a value in \"locals\" pane</li>\n<li>Ability to set the value of a register in \"watch\" pane</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It doesnt say I cant modify a register at all right now, but doesnt exactly confirm it either.</p>\n<p>This used to be possible with ancient apktool version though! A pretty hefty regression, I would say. (Going back is impractical, too much changed)</p>\n<p>Question: How can i modify those smali registers while debugging? is there a register view I am missing or something? How do other people debug APK on smali level?</p>\n</div>",
