But regarding your question, this is not going to help you with the variable's types, as Python does not works that way. Keep in mind that you will probably spend more time fighting with Python's types than implementing the algorithm.</p>\n<p>If you really want to re-write this, your best option is to do so in C, you'll be able to play with your pointers <code>*(byte *)</code> and  <code>*(code *)</code>, ...</p>\n<p>In my opinion, you'll gain some time by simply debugging the program and inspect the values that you are curious about.</p>\n<p>EDIT:\nYour last question can be answered using the same method.</p>\n<p>You have this block of code:</p>\n<pre><code>local_8 = 0;\nwhile (local_8 &lt; param_2) {\n     *(byte *)(param_1 + local_8) = *(byte *)(param_1 + local_8) ^ 0x50;\n     local_8 = local_8 + 1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>After cleaning up a bit, it look like:</p>\n<pre><code>i = 0;\nwhile (i &lt; param_2) {\n     param_1[i] = param_1[i] ^ 0x50;\n     i += 1\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Basically you are passing two arguments to your function (param_1 and param_2). The fist one is an array, the second one is the length of that array. This small routine will take every bytes of your array, and xor it with 0x50, before putting it back into the original array.</p>\n</div>",
