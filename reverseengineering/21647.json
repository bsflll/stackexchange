Obviously, they were sent using HTTPS and there is no reasonable way (that I can find) for me to get the Switch to trust my computer without hacking the Switch (ultimately banning me from the very services I’d like to examine, according to most hacking guides).</p>\n<p>I was ready to give up when I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://gbatemp.net/threads/389227/#post-5505845\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this post</a> on the GBATemp Forums about someone else attempting to read traffic (except from a 3DS), where one member brought up that there are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>various tools and methods created to force devices to stop using SSL without access to them at all</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Do such tools/methods actually exist that would force my Switch to send plaintext requests that I could read from my proxy? Otherwise, is there anything else I’m not seeing here?</p>\n</div>",
