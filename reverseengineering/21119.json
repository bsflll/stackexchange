This is likely at a point where you need to post a brief sample exhibiting the problem somewhere.  You can also rebuild objdump from source with custom logging to figure out how it is working.   Make sure you are running the exact same elf through objdump - a stripped elf would not have internal names, so even objdump wouldn't find them, and it would be too bad if you were wasting time chasing a mixup resulting from having run a different version of the file through the objdump test.</span>",

(<code>s</code> means seek)</p>\n<pre><code>:&gt; s 0x04\n0x00000004  02\n</code></pre>\n<p>e_ident = 0x02 means 64bit format.</p>\n<p>Now that we now the file format we need to know the offset of the section header(<code>e_shoff</code>), the size of each entry(<code>e_shentsize</code>), and the number of entries in the section header(<code>e_shnum</code>).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>e_shoff</strong> offset=0x28   size=8bytes<br/>\n<strong>e_shentsize</strong> offset=0x3A   size=2bytes<br/>\n<strong>e_shnum</strong> offset=0x3C   size=2bytes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>:&gt; s 0x28\n0x00000028  e03b 0000 0000 0000\n\n:&gt; s 0x3A\n0x0000003a  4000\n\n:&gt; s 0x3C\n0x0000003c  1d00\n</code></pre>\n<p>e_shoff = 0x3be0 This is the offset of the section header.<br/>\ne_shentsize = 0x40 (64 bytes)<br/>\ne_shnum = 0x1d (29 entries)<br/></p>\n<p>We also going to need the index of the section header that contains the names of each section header. This is store in <code>e_shstrndx</code></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>e_shstrndx</strong> offset=0x3E    size=2bytes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>:&gt; s 0x3e\n0x0000003e  1c00\n</code></pre>\n<p>e_shstrndx = 0x1c (entry 28)</p>\n<p>With the entry number you can get the address of shstrtab:</p>\n<pre><code>// e_shoff+(e_shentsize*e_shstrndx)+sh_offset\n:&gt; s 0x3be0+(0x40*0x1c)+0x18\n0x000042f8  df3a 0000 0000 0000\n</code></pre>\n<p>shstrtab = 0x3adf</p>\n<p>Now that you have that information you can run a loop that checks all the section entries:</p>\n<pre><code>//pseudocode\nfor (i=0; i&lt;e_shnum; i++)\n    entryN = e_shoff+(e_shentsize*i);\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>NOTE #03:I'll not print those values here because I have to explain more but that will give you something similar to the command <code>readelf -W -l [program]</code></em></p>\n<p>Each entry has a structure like the section header.
