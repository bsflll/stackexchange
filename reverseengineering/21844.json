But when multiple huge companies do the same thing, I'm starting to think: why?</p>\n<p>Does anyone have idea what information uninitialized data can supply to security team? Is it just repeated error made by accident, or they extract some useful information from uninitialized data that they send to their server on regular basis?</p>\n</div>",

Instead, Java has its own memory manager. So, Java code has a very little influence on what <code>malloc</code> return.</li>\n<li><code>malloc</code> prefers to use the same arena for the same thread if possible; so, in most cases other JNI calls made from other threads will not influence what does <code>malloc</code> returns.</li>\n<li>It means, that <code>malloc</code> will often return data allocated by the same thread. In JNI, we usually don't create long living C/C++ objects and prefer to use Java as memory manager, because it is problematic to free C++ memory in Java. <code>finalize</code> doesn't provide any guarantees! So, even if we will try to free C++ data associated with Java object in <code>finalize</code>, we can never know for sure that we'll not get memory leak, because OS will never call <code>finalize</code>.\nSo, we may expect that 99% of <code>malloc</code> made during JNI call will call <code>free</code> during the same call.</li>\n<li>So, we can use uninitialized data to detect (with some probability) that our shared library is loaded in some unusual environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lets imagine following code:</p>\n<pre><code>void MarkHeap()\n{\n    static const char *ones = \"11....1\"; // String that contains 1024 ones\n    auto some_data = malloc(1024);\n    memcpy(some_data, ones, 1024);\n    free(some_data);\n}\n\nsize_t CheckMarkHeap()\n{\n    auto some_data = malloc(100);\n    size_t ones_count = 0;\n    for(size_t i = 0; i &lt; 100; ++i)\n        if(some_data[i] == '1')\n            ++ones_count;\n    free(some_data);\n    return ones_count;\n}\n\nMarkHeap();\nauto ones_count = CheckMarkHeap()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we can expect that very often <code>ones_count</code> will equal to 100! We can now use this strategy to check (with some probability) if <code>CheckMarkHeap</code> is called soon after <code>MarkHeap</code>.</p>\n<p>In situation where <code>CheckMarkHeap</code> calculates any kind of security token, we can afraid that anyone will try to use our own shared library to bypass our protection; in case of Android, we can extract shared library from APK and try to interpret it with Android emulator or any embedded ARM emulation library like <code>unicorn</code>. If we implemented <code>MarkHeap</code> in another shared library that doesn't draw attacker attention and somehow call it before <code>CheckMarkHeap</code>, we have a good chance to detect that our security library is loaded from unusual context.</p>\n<p>Of course, we can not ban immediately for that, because any random events may affect <code>ones_count</code>. However, if <code>ones_count</code> is not 100 in more than 60% of calls, we can make any soft penalty to suspicious account (for example, ask for phone verification, SafetyNet verification, show CAPTCHA more often, send account to human moderation, etc).</p>\n</div>",

But it is a common case that memory managers would reuse memory blocks previously released with <code>free()</code>. If <code>malloc()</code> recycles a memory block which is not zeroed (for example using <code>memset()</code>) before being released, the block will generally contain buffer content remaining from previously executed functions inside the process.</p>\n<p>Given that the memory manager does not initialize blocks upon allocation and release, the implications of this pseudocode is that it will repeatedly take random memory samples (of 1k size) within the process' memory address space, which will occasionally catch some data remained from the workings of previously executed code.</p>\n</div>",

Let's also suppose the code sends the data <code>twice a day</code> and <code>one thousandth</code> of the users have an unreserved MD5 hash somewhere in memory.</p>\n<p>That gives us a total size of <code>1.5e9 / 1000 * 2 = 3e6</code> samples to evaluate each day.</p>\n<p>We will approximate the expected numbers of useful hashes with the normal distribution: </p>\n<p><code>sigma = sqrt(3e9*2.5225e-7*(1-2.5225e-7)) ~= 27.50909</code> (so the approx. should yield good results) </p>\n<p><code>my = 3e9*2.5525e-7 ~= 756.75</code></p>\n<p><strong>So the company will get with an certainty of 99.73% between 701 and 812 (<code>my-2*sigma, my+2*sigma</code>) usable hashes each day.</strong></p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I am not certain how java handles memory and how plausible (and effective) this scenario is.
