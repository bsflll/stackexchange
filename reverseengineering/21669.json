The default form as IDA recognizes it:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Tl1CW.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Tl1CW.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>From what I understand, the size of the <code>bin</code> file is <code>0x632c</code>, which includes both the RAM and ROM. Any ideas of how can I make the cut between the two sections? And when I do, what is the right way to fill it in the memory form?</p>\n</div>",
