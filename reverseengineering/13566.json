    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hex-Rays</a>, providers of IDA Disassembler, offers a companion product called <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/decompiler\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hex-Rays Decompiler</a> (not to be confused with <em>HexRaysCodeXplorer</em>, a plugin for the Decompiler plugin rather than for IDA itself).  I would like to evaluate Hex-Rays Decompiler, but have found no means of doing so without purchasing a license for IDA Disassembler.  And the lowest price I can find for that is $589 or $1129 for 64 bit support.</p>\n<p>Hex-Rays states that <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">IDA is also the solid foundation on which our second product, the Hex-Rays decompiler, is built</a>. But while Hex-Rays offers both <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_demo.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">a demo version of IDA</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">IDA 5.0 Freeware</a>, neither comes with the Decompiler, and I haven't found the Hex-Rays Decompiler available for sale or download separately.</p>\n<p>Much of what attracts me to Hex-Rays is its decompiler, but it's difficult to justify purchasing IDA Disassembler just to evaluate Hex-Rays Decompiler.  So, <em>how do I evaluate Hex-Rays Decompiler without purchasing IDA Disassembler for $589?</em>  Thanks.</p>\n</div>",

That should give you a good indication of the decompiler's capabilities.</p>\n<p>You can interactively decompile. Or also decompile in bulk. It decompiles a 22M binary containing 57k functions, totalling about 4.3M lines of code in about 1 hour. The decompilation can also be modified using pytbon scripts.</p>\n<p>With some tweaking of variable and function types you can get very readable code. Also of c++ or objective-c with lots of virtual function calls.</p>\n</div>",
