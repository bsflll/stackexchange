The most common approach is examining sender and receiver processes and their communications. Another thing is packet (or frame) doesn't matter if you don't mind about communication protocols. It is operating system's, hardware interface's and drivers' (or modules') business.Your interest is raw data communication that your game uses.</p>\n</div>",
