It looks for me like if the exe is packed or protected with some software like UPX bit I can't figure out which software is used. I also checked the exe with PEiD but it says not packed... Pic.: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/RmthSGd\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">imgur.com/RmthSGd</a>  After opening in IDA I get a warning msg. \"The imports segment seems to be destroyed...\" That tells me does something is really buggy.</span>",
