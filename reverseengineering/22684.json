Simplified version:</p>\n<pre><code>call $+5\nadd [esp], 5\nret\nxor eax, eax\nret\n</code></pre>\n<p>And with annotations:</p>\n<pre><code>_main:\n  call $+5     ; call address of next instruction, placing return address on stack (esp)\n  add [esp], 5 ; add 5 bytes to the return address\n  ret          ; return to the address from the stack ... which happens to be\n  xor eax, eax ; ... this instruction\n  ret          ; return for good from _main ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>So what this does is to return 0 as a 32-bit value from <code>_main</code>.</p>\n<p>Given the (decompiled) condition:</p>\n<pre><code>if ((cVar1 = func_0x8b4c55a0(), cVar1 == -0xe) || 1)\n</code></pre>\n<p>... this doesn't change a thing, however, as the <code>|| 1</code> will ensure that this condition is always true and <code>cVar1</code> doesn't subsequently get used.</p>\n<p>So as far as you provide context, this is pure distraction.</p>\n</div>",
