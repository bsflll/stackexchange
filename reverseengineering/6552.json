    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>i have found the following code sequence in a sample which I try to analyze:</p>\n<pre><code>....\npush offset LibFileName ;    \"KERNEL32.DLL\"\ncall LoadLibraryA\nmov esi, eax\ntest esi, esi\njz short loc_40EDF2\nlea edx, [ebp+var_108]\n...\n...\nmov eax, offset aUmehyJ ; \"UmehyJ{j\"\npush eax                ; lpProcName\npush esi                ; hModule\ncall GetProcAddress_0\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, I know what the combination of LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress does. But what I do not understand is the following line:</p>\n<pre><code>mov eax, offset aUmehyJ ; \"UmehyJ{j\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>I would say that the process name is somehow encrypted. I searched a little bit and read that XOR-encryption in combination with a loop is frequently used in malware. So, I let IDA PRO search all occurences of a XOR and try to locate of course those with a register-immediate combination, for example xor eax, 12h.\nBut I could not find something like this.</p>\n<p>After that, I have read that Base64 encoding is also used in malware. So, I type the string \"UmehyJ{j\" in a online Base64 decoder tool ( <a href=\"http://www.opinionatedgeek.com/dotnet/tools/base64decode/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.opinionatedgeek.com/dotnet/tools/base64decode/</a> ) but without success. </p>\n<p>So, now I am at a point where I do not know how I should make the next steps.\nBecause of that, I hope somebody can help me.</p>\n<p>best regards,  </p>\n</div>",

I marked \"offset UmehyJ{j\" and click Strg+X to get the cross-reference list of offset UmehyJ{j , but in the list the mentioned line with mov eax, offset UmehyJ{j is the only place where that string appears. There is no other reference to it.</span>",
