I did a couple of projects. now I was doing another project and faced kind of a problem.</p>\n<p>at the start of the program, there is a label that points to an address of memory but when going to that address there is only hex data instead of instruction.\nhow I can convert those to the instruction. I used \"C (convert to code)\" which was nonsense.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZAyw3.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZAyw3.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>thanks in advance</p>\n</div>",
