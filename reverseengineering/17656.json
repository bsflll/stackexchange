    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am new to disassembly, and I'm trying to understand how a 32 bit binary is operating. I have the evaluation (free) version, 32 bit (<code>Version 7.0.170920 macOS x86_64 (32-bit address size)</code>). </p>\n<p>I'm used to debugging by stepping through a program, reading variables as necessary. I don't see an ability to do this in IDA, but I assume it must be there, and I'm simply missing it. (Having seen <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/11601/how-can-i-step-through-instructions-in-ida-and-know-the-current-eip\">this question about python</a> and <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/13520/stepping-through-arm-firmware-image#13529\">this question about ARM</a>, surely this must be an option for 32 bit binaries...)</p>\n<p>I'm also totally open to suggestions for a different disassembler than IDA, but I'm looking for something that is free - at least for an evaluation period of several days.</p>\n</div>",
