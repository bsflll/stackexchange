    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I read in the IDA Pro Book that </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>you may use <code>till.exe</code> to parse header files and create standalone <code>.til</code>\n  files which can be made globally available by copying them into\n  <code>&lt;IDADIR&gt;/til</code>.\n  This is all well and good when you happen to have access to source code that you then allow IDA (or <code>till.exe</code>) to parse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now I was wondering what would happen if the header file is from a library version older than the one used by the target binary (or vice versa). The closest I could find was <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/6099885/4480139\">this</a> SO answer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the ABI in the exported functions don't change you should be able\n  to get away with using an older DLL with a program linked against a\n  newer .lib, as long as the program isn't using a new export that are\n  in the new .lib but not in the older DLL.</p>\n<p>Things which affect the ABI (I'm not claiming this is a comprehensive\n  list):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>calling convention</li>\n<li>export name</li>\n<li>parameter list (including types)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does anyone have experience with using <code>.til</code> files although the version does not exactly match? In the best case, I guess, the <code>.til</code> file should work fine. But what could happen in the worst case, i.e. if any of the above mentioned three things change?</p>\n<p>Is there any chance I can detect when the application of a slightly wrong <code>.til</code> file causes problems?</p>\n</div>",
