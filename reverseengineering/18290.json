Understand that it's taking the value of <code>eax</code> in hex then shifting it to the right by <code>6</code> and the same for the next operation by <code>0x1f</code>. See what the end result is, but still looking to better understand what's happening with these Shift Operations.\nSay eax was <code>0x3338e3e0</code>, how exactly does it get to <code>0x00cce38f</code> step by step?</p>\n</div>",
