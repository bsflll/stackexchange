    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm going through the book Practical Malware Analysis (specifically, Lab07-03) and I've been stuck on a rather simple problem. I've divided the code section of <code>main()</code> into three parts to ease my analysis. (Note: I'm assuming the stack is growing downwards here.)</p>\n<pre><code>Part 1) mov eax, [esp+argc]\nsub esp, 44h\ncmp eax, 2\n\nPart 2) push ebx\npush ebp\npush esi\npush edi\njnz ExitProgram\n\nPart 3) mov eax, [esp+54h+argv]\nmov esi, offset hardcodedString\nmov eax, [eax+4]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Part 1:</p>\n<p>This looks simple enough, the stack pointer (<code>esp</code>) is added with the memory location of <code>argc</code> and the value at that address is saved in the <code>eax</code> register. Then <em>44h</em> is subtracted from <code>esp</code> to make room for some local variables of the main function. Finally, <code>eax</code> is compared to 2 and the appropriate flags are set in the flag register (the value of <code>eax</code> is not modified).</p>\n<p>Part 2: Based on a <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12736437/why-does-gcc-push-rbx-at-the-beginning-of-main\">similar</a> question on StackOverFlow, it seems that the registers are pushed in Part 2 as they are callee save registers. This seems to be true as when main exits, it is popping these <em>exact</em> registers. Is my understanding of this correct?</p>\n<p>Part 3: I'm adding the variables below if that helps in correcting me.</p>\n<pre><code>.text:00401440 var_44          = dword ptr -44h\n.text:00401440 var_40          = dword ptr -40h\n.text:00401440 var_3C          = dword ptr -3Ch\n.text:00401440 var_38          = dword ptr -38h\n.text:00401440 var_34          = dword ptr -34h\n.text:00401440 var_30          = dword ptr -30h\n.text:00401440 var_2C          = dword ptr -2Ch\n.text:00401440 var_28          = dword ptr -28h\n.text:00401440 var_24          = dword ptr -24h\n.text:00401440 var_20          = dword ptr -20h\n.text:00401440 var_1C          = dword ptr -1Ch\n.text:00401440 var_18          = dword ptr -18h\n.text:00401440 var_14          = dword ptr -14h\n.text:00401440 var_10          = dword ptr -10h\n.text:00401440 var_C           = dword ptr -0Ch\n.text:00401440 hObject         = dword ptr -8\n.text:00401440 var_4           = dword ptr -4\n.text:00401440 argc            = dword ptr  4\n.text:00401440 argv            = dword ptr  8\n.text:00401440 envp            = dword ptr  0Ch\n</code></pre>\n<p>I also don't understand the instruction <code>mov eax, [esp+54h+argv]</code>. It looks like the first argument that is passed to the program is being saved in <code>eax</code>, so wouldn't <code>mov eax, [esp+44h+argv]</code> make more sense? I recognize the function of the instruction <code>mov eax, [eax+4]</code> is to fetch the actual input passed to the program (i.e. <code>argv[1]</code>), which is what makes the previous instruction's indexing so confusing.</p>\n<p>The <code>mov esi, offset hardcodedString</code> is just moving the address of the first character of the string into <code>esi</code>, so it looks good to me.</p>\n<p>I'd appreciate some help here!</p>\n</div>",
