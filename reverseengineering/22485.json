Or do you mean another ELF file? Because on a system for which GLIBC was built, you can execute it as a standalone binary and it will output version and copyright information and some other stuff. Could you perhaps give us the output of running <code>file</code> on both your specific <code>libc.so.6</code> <i>and</i> the ELF file you were given?</span>",
