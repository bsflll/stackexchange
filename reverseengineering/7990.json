A forerunner of this work, which in retrospect I'm not all that happy with, was published in ACM CCS 11 [<a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2046739\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a>].</p>\n<p>I don't know of source-code availability of any VM-based obfuscators.  There's a free system called Tigress, available (in binary form) from \n<a href=\"http://tigress.cs.arizona.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tigress.cs.arizona.edu/</a>, that performs virtualization at the C source-code level.  This system gives you a lot of control over a lot of the parameters of the obfuscator so you can experiment with different combinations of settings.  The FAQ explains the rationale for not distributing the source code.</p>\n</div>",
