    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I would like to ask if anyone knows how to solve the above mentioned problem I encounter. I was reverse engineering an apk, and met a part where static analysis with IDA Pro is not enough, so I thought that I could use the android_server provided by IDA Pro to debug the .so library during runtime. However, I kept getting an error from IDA Pro when trying to attach to any process within my emulator: 'The debugger could not attach to the selected process. This can perhaps indicate the process was just terminated, or that you don't have the necessary privileges.' I used adb to push the android_server to my emulator, and then used adb shell and executed the script as root, but I'm still having this error. Any ideas on what am I doing wrong? Thanks in advance!</p>\n</div>",

So I guess you may forget forward your data from your development machine to your emulator.</p>\n<p>As you executed the <em>android_server</em>, you can see <code>Listening on 0.0.0.0:23946...</code> in your emulator, which means <em>android_server</em> could kown what it should do by getting information from the <strong>emulator's</strong> port 23946.\nNow, you need transfer the information from IDA to your emulator.</p>\n<p>To do this, you need:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>In IDA, click <code>Debugger</code> -&gt; <code>Select Debugger</code>, choose a debugger accroding to your condition. For me, I choose <em>Remote Linux Debugger</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Click  <code>Debugger</code> -&gt; <code>Process Options</code>, and set <em><strong>hostname</strong></em> to <strong>127.0.0.1</strong>, then set  <em><strong>port</strong></em> to <strong>23946</strong> or some other port you want, which your IDA could use to send information.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In your development machine, as Windows, open cmd or powershell, enter <code>adb forward tcp:23946 tcp:23946</code>, so that your IDA can send data to your <em>android_server</em>. For more details for adb forward, please see <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#forwardports\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#forwardports</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If fortunately, now, in IDA, click <code>Debugger</code> -&gt; <code>Attach to process</code>, you may see the processes list, which means success.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
