The code stars with:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fzMTz.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fzMTz.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>So apparently it's generating an exception with</p>\n<pre><code>XOR DWORD PTR [ESP], 154h\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which ultimately terminates with a call to <code>ExitProcess()</code> without even running the program.</p>\n<p>I tried using <code>NOP</code>s to bypass this but since upon execution the EP is already pointing to this problematic piece of code it did not work. </p>\n<p>How can  I bypass this and what's really triggering the exception?</p>\n</div>",
