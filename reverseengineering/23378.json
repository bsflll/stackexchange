Either one is likely not used and your wording suggests just that. Obfuscation is merely the attempt to hide something from plain view. Encryption requires some sort of key as additional ingredient. And what's more, encryption in a scenario like the one you describe makes little to no sense. That software would have to carry the <i>private key</i> (or passphrase) in order to decrypt anything. So this makes the whole exercise pointless.</span>",
