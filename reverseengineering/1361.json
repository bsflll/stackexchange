JD-Core may be used to recover lost source code\n  and explore the source of Java runtime libraries. New features of Java\n  5, such as annotations, generics or type “enum”, are supported. JD-GUI\n  and JD-Eclipse include JD-Core library.</p>\n<p>JD-GUI is a standalone graphical utility that displays Java source\n  codes of “.class” files. You can browse the reconstructed source code\n  with the JD-GUI for instant access to methods and fields.</p>\n<p>JD-Eclipse is a plug-in for the Eclipse platform. It allows you to\n  display all the Java sources during your debugging process, even if\n  you do not have them all.</p>\n<p>JD-Core works with most current compilers including the following:</p>\n<pre><code>jdk1.1.8\njdk1.3.1\njdk1.4.2\njdk1.5.0\njdk1.6.0\njdk1.7.0\njikes-1.22\nharmony-jdk-r533500\nEclipse Java Compiler v_677_R32x, 3.2.1 release\njrockit90_150_06\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Another example is jumping a bit around; I made a function which jumps to an offset, does some stuff, jumps to another offset, does some more stuff, and return. And all JD-GUI would show is \"label_7:\" for the <i>entire</i> function. This might be interesting to document sometime.. Note that JAD appeared much better in my simple tests - it did in fact decompile these two functions correctly.</span>",
