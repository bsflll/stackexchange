    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I would like to automate a process of enabling buttons with <code>cond bp</code>.</p>\n<p>First, I found that function <code>user32.EnableWindow</code> is called from <code>mfc110u.dll</code>.</p>\n<p>So I went there and set <code>cond bp</code> on the second arg of the function. </p>\n<p>This <code>arg2==0</code> when you want the button to be disabled and <code>arg2==1</code> when enabled.</p>\n<p>So what I did ?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I set <code>cond bp</code> with condition <code>[EBP+8]==0</code> and now want to run something like this each time the bp is hit:\n<strong>A (EBP+8) DD 1</strong>. </li>\n<li>I downloaded the plugin <code>CLBPlus!</code> and for this plugin is identifier CLBP so final command become: <strong>CLBP A (EBP+8) DD 1</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But for some reason this does not work. Maybe the command A is not implemented. I downloaded the two another plugins \"Command Line v1.10\" and \"Command Bar v3.20.110\" but unfortunately I do not know the identifiers for these plugings.</p>\n<p>So any ideas ?</p>\n</div>",

In olly command line when I wrote <strong>A (EBP+8) DD 1</strong> I saw it worked. The syntax for script is <strong>asm eip, \"mov eax, ecx\"</strong>, so I tried to write <strong>asm (ebp+8), \"dd 1\"</strong>, but did not work. So I tried <strong>asm ebp+8, \"dd 1\"</strong> and it seems working. I put conditional breakpoints manualy and constructed this nice dirty code:</p>\n<p>START:\nasm ebp+8, \"dd 1\"\nrun\njmp START</p>\n<p>it works nicely. Thanx for the tip again\"!</p>\n</div>",
