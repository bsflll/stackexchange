If you disable aslr, or your target is always loading in the same place you can do a couple of things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Ps saving@e:cfg.debug=false</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>or just save the comments into a file:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>CC* &gt; comments.r2</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>you can reload the script with the <code>. comments.r2</code> or starting the session with <code>r2 -i comments.r2 ...</code> to get the comment lines loaded into the session.</p>\n<p>Same goes for all the analysis information. if you append <code>*</code> to any command you get the output in r2 commands script.</p>\n</div>",
