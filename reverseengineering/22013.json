My understanding is that you do this to an image (on file) to make it start faster.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How does the windows loader know that the image has already been bound (and that it does not need to compute virtual addresses)?</li>\n<li>In the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#dll-characteristics\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DllCharacteristics</a> in a PE file (in the optional header), there is a flag called <code>NO_BIND</code>. Does <code>BindImageEx</code> fail if this is set?</li>\n<li>What is the difference between <code>BIND_NO_BOUND_IMPORTS</code> and <code>BIND_NO_UPDATE</code> if the only updating it does is to the IAT?</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
