    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I got a malicious kernel mode driver from VirusTotal. Now, I am trying to debug it using Windbg.</p>\n<p>Below are the details of the setup:</p>\n<p>Host OS: Win 7 Ultimate 64-bit, Windbg version 6.11.x, VMWare Workstation and Guest OS: Win XP SP3</p>\n<p>I placed the kernel mode driver in Guest OS in the path: C:\\drivers\\test</p>\n<p>Added .sys extension to the kernel mode driver.</p>\n<p>In Windbg on Host OS, I attached to the guest OS through Named Pipe. Set the breakpoint to break at DriverEntry of the driver as shown below:</p>\n<pre><code>bu malicious_driver!DriverEntry\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then press g.</p>\n<p>In Guest OS, used OSR Driver Loader from osronline.com to load the driver.</p>\n<p>Browsed for the Driver, Registered the Service and started the Service.</p>\n<p>I break in Windbg however I receive the following error message:</p>\n<pre><code>kd&gt; bu malicious_driver!DriverEntry\nkd&gt; g\n*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for malicious_driver.sys\nBreakpoint 0's offset expression evaluation failed.\nCheck for invalid symbols or bad syntax.\nWaitForEvent failed\nnt!DebugService2+0x11:\n8052e4c5 5d              pop     ebp\nkd&gt; !drvobj malicious_driver\nDriver object (b25eb000) is for:\nb25eb000: is not a driver object\n</code></pre>\n<p>Please note that I am able to successfully break at the DriverEntry of known legitimate Microsoft Windows OS drivers like ndis.sys, http.sys</p>\n<p>However, how do I break at the entry point of malicious drivers as in this case? I don't have the symbols for them either.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n</div>",
