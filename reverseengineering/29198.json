Can we find a non blacklisted packers ?</p>\n<p>Any ideas ?</p>\n</div>",

There are some commercial products which have a higher cost which should bypass antivirus.

But if you are expecting something eternal to suffice to never be cracked or something, then it will never happen.</p>\n</div>",

This might slow down the performance of your code by quite a bit though - so it is often only used to protect key portions of the code.</p>\n<p>Some packers that provide this feature are VMProtect, Themida. Might have a few more but I can't quite recall.</p>\n<p>If you use an outdated packer (cracked versions are usually outdated), it would often have scripts available in public that helps someone to restore the original, unprotected PE file. So be prepared to pay a bomb to buy the official product, and keep it up to date.</p>\n</div>",
