By default, IDA 7.4 will install IDAPython for Python 2.7, but users will\nhave the opportunity to pick an alternative build that runs against\ntheir Python 3.x installation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have found <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/ida74_idapython_python3_porting_guide.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this porting guide</a> very useful. Using Python 3 with IDA 7.4 is great, and the new API is cleaner in many ways.</p>\n</div>",
