    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to prettify a representation of Pascal-string \"Could not access file \"\" in Hex-Rays decompiler's output. As you can see below,\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XUIBC.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"\n\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XUIBC.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>now its type is <strong>char[25]</strong> due to inclusion of hexademical string length. How can I force IDA to perceive Pascal-strings properly during their depiction in Hex-Rays pane? I want to see for all Pascal-string in corresponding window something like</p>\n<pre><code>LODWORD(v90) = ConcatenateStrings_R8_R9_to_RCX(v140, 255i64, \"Could not access file \\\"\", v158);\n</code></pre>\n<p>I tried to change types via \"Set item type...\" as showed below.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SPXGe.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SPXGe.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, these options didn't help.</p>\n</div>",
