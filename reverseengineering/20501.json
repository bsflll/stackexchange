The dylib is highly obfuscated, but <strong>I suspect it's from some well-known technique</strong> that I'm not aware of.</p>\n<p>I'd like to describe it in the hope that someone here could identify it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>There are junk instructions inserted everywhere, and every basic block is split by a lot of unconditional jump (but <em>no</em> opaque predicate is used).</p></li>\n<li><p>At its core, it looks like a obfuscated VM. It behaves like this:</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>At entry, it push a starting value on the stack, then <code>call</code> an entry point:</p>\n<pre><code>000000010013E070 68 5C 98 42 11                          push    1142985Ch\n000000010013E075 E8 B5 B4 0E 00                          call    sub_10022952F\n</code></pre>\n<p>The entry (e.g. <code>sub_10022952F</code>) isn't a usual function. It will save all registers and point <code>rsi</code> to an embedded data location that is determined by the <code>push</code> (i.e. the <code>push 1142985Ch</code> above), then starts reading <code>rsi</code> array and jumping accordingly:</p>\n<pre><code>000000010013EED7 8B 06                                   mov     eax, [rsi]\n000000010013EED9 F5                                      ;; cmc\n000000010013EEDA 45 84 FD                                ;; test    r13b, r15b\n000000010013EEDD 48 81 C6 04 00 00 00                    add     rsi, 4\n000000010013EEE4 66 41 81 FA 1C 3B                       ;; cmp     r10w, 3B1Ch\n000000010013EEEA 33 C3                                   xor     eax, ebx\n000000010013EEEC D1 C0                                   rol     eax, 1\n000000010013EEEE E9 FD 8E 15 00                          jmp     loc_100297DF0\n\n0000000100297DF0 FF C0                                   inc     eax\n0000000100297DF2 0F C8                                   bswap   eax\n0000000100297DF4 F8                                      ;; clc\n0000000100297DF5 E9 F2 D6 E4 FF                          jmp     loc_1000E54EC\n\n00000001000E54EC C1 C0 03                                rol     eax, 3\n00000001000E54EF 0F C8                                   bswap   eax\n00000001000E54F1 53                                      push    rbx\n00000001000E54F2 31 04 24                                xor     [rsp], eax\n00000001000E54F5 0F B7 D8                                ;; movzx   ebx, ax\n00000001000E54F8 0F BA F3 82                             ;; btr     ebx, 82h\n00000001000E54FC 5B                                      pop     rbx\n00000001000E54FD F5                                      ;; cmc\n00000001000E54FE 49 F7 C7 E5 0F 9B 74                    ;; test    r15, 749B0FE5h\n00000001000E5505 F9                                      ;; stc\n00000001000E5506 48 63 C0                                movsxd  rax, eax\n00000001000E5509 48 03 F8                                add     rdi, rax\n00000001000E550C E9 D0 49 08 00                          jmp     loc_100169EE1\n\n0000000100169EE1 FF E7                                   jmp     rdi\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've commented out junk code. The code will fetch value from <code>[rsi]</code> into <code>rax</code>, and do some bit-level-operation with <code>rbx</code>; then advance <code>rdi &lt;- rdi + rax</code>; then jump to <code>rdi</code>.</p>\n<p>This structure is everywhere in the dylib, and in a chain connected by <code>jmp rdi</code>, the bit-level-operations are also the same. But chains from different entry point may have different bit operation for <code>rax</code> and <code>rbx</code>.</p>\n<p>The VM doesn't have any central structure (like a dispatcher or something), and the jumps go everywhere, not restricted to some location.</p>\n<p>To call external function like <code>pthread_mutex_lock</code>, it will go out of the VM loop first; then call the external function; then go to another entry point. There are many entry points (<code>push xxxx / call xxxx</code>) to enter VM loop.</p>\n<p><strong>I believe this is some well-known technique</strong>, because when the dylib is modified, it will prompt message:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>File corrupted! This program has been manipulated and maybe it's\n  infected by a Virus or cracked. This file won't work anymore.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's not a standard Mac OS X message, and Google search for this exact message gives a lot of result, but none of them explains the technique itself.</p>\n<h2>Some additional information:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>It has sections named UPX0/UPX1, but I think they are disguise and the technique has nothing to do with UPX. Because the code only does self-checking, no self-modifying. As a result, it's still obfuscated just as the original file after fully loaded.</p></li>\n<li><p>I don't know how the it works exactly by now. But I think it's some sort of a VM, because I've traced the invoke of a function of the dylib, I only find the following normal function calls:</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>pthread_mutex_lock</code> --&gt; 3 <code>new operator</code> --&gt; <code>pthread_mutex_unlock</code>.</p>\n<p>And everything else is done inside by those <code>jump rdi</code> structures mentioned above and switches among many entries points. Therefore the rest of the code logic resides in the VM loop.</p>\n</div>",

But the actual difficulty is how the VM codes (pointed by <code>rsi</code>) behaves, and junk code and unconditional jump isn't essential here. I believe this obfuscation is generated by some well-known <i>specific</i> technique as the \"file corrupted\" message suggests. So that I don't have to deobfuscate it again by myself.</span>",
