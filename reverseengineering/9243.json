I suppose that winload validates the driver's certificate by looking in its own trusted root <em>CA</em> store, so the only <em>CA</em>s that are supported are in this list : </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn170454%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cross-Certificates for Kernel Mode Code Signing</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Question</h2>\n<p>Is there a way to patch <strong>winload</strong> to insert a new Root <em>CA</em> so when it loads our driver it validates the certificate correctly? </p>\n<p>I know that modifying <strong>winload</strong> will break its digital signature, so we can resign it using the private key of our new Root <em>CA</em>, that will do the work theoretically.</p>\n</div>",

So when a driver is loaded into the kernel in system boot the digital certificate is matched to a root CA stored in ci.dll right? I've seen over there that winload before loading ntoskrnl.exe verifies its digital signature against nt5.cat, do you know any kind of info about this?</span>",

Concretely the section \" How Windows NT6 is bootstrapped by its loader\" you will see that winload is responsible of loading the kernel boot drivers, so my driver is going to be loaded by this process. In this article is said that winload verifies itself against nt5.cat. So what I get from here and from your indications is that I have to patch ci.dll and the signature from winload in the catalog. Thanks again for throwing some light.</span>",
