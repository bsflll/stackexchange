If <code>lpFile</code> is a command-line interpreter (such as <code>cmd.exe</code> or <code>powershell.exe</code>) or a program that can accept code as a command line argument (such as <code>perl.exe</code> or <code>ruby.exe</code>), then yes, you could supply arbitrary commands for a command injection attack.</p>\n<p>However, if the <code>lpFile</code> program doesn't execute command line arguments (for example, <code>notepad.exe</code>, <code>pbrush.exe</code>, etc.), then there is no command injection vulnerability. Note that even in these cases though, if the <code>lpFile</code> program tries to open the file path supplied in the command line, this could still be seen as a security issue.</p>\n</div>",

You probably understand why I said <em>might</em>, not <em>can</em>.</p>\n<p>You didn't included info in question, but I think you meant that control of <code>parameters</code> is gained editing executable. If so there is such thing.</p>\n<p>Imagine file is <code>cmd.exe</code> and you can control parameters, but in app parameter is <code>C:\\file.txt</code> it has 11 characters, so you could change it into some other up-to 11 characters parameter (if it is smaller then 11, you need to add <code>NULL</code>s).</p>\n<p>However in real situations <code>ShellExecute</code> parameters are partially hard-coded and are build dynamically during program flow. So answering to your question, <code>ShellExecute</code> is vulnerable to command injection, however, not every app that uses <code>ShellExecute</code> could be taken as a target and actual injecting could be not so easy task.</p>\n</div>",
