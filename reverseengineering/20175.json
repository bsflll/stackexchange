This means that the existing binary now forwards calls down to the new binary rather than handling them directly; the forwarding can be static (the export table shows the redirection), or runtime (the dll has a stub routine that calls down to the new binary). This will impact low-level applications such as security and backup applications that are dependent upon internal APIs and offsets.\"</p>\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/Win7AppQual/new-low-level-binaries\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/Win7AppQual/new-low-level-binaries</a></p>\n<p>See the example below. </p>\n<p>This is the disassembly of OpenProcess in Kernel32.dll which redirects the OpenProcess to Kernelbase.dll\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LGQli.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LGQli.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Disassembly of OpenProcess in Kernelbase.dll that call the Native API NTOpenProcess</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LCeam.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LCeam.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
