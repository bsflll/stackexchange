I also understand that the pointer is being initialized to 100 char here: <code>0x400628</code>-<code>0x40063d</code>.</p>\n<p>I cannot seem to figure out what <code>strcpy</code> is doing and I do not understand how to examine the contents of the addresses listed in <code>0x400647</code> and <code>0x400654</code>.</p>\n<p>Can someone help me work through this?</p>\n</div>",

This value correspond to the address of the memory space you just created through the <code>malloc</code> call.</p>\n<pre><code>0x400639:    mov    -0x8(%rbp),%rax\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, you take the first argument of the function we are in (<code>char **pointer</code> according to your source code) and it is stored in the <code>rax</code> register.</p>\n<pre><code>0x40063d:    mov    %rdx,(%rax)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This line transfert the address of the allocated memory area to the <code>pointer</code> variable.</p>\n<pre><code>0x400640:    mov    -0x8(%rbp),%rax\n</code></pre>\n<p>An (unnecessary) copy of the first argument of <code>function</code> in <code>rax</code> (the register already store this value, probably a glitch of the compiler that did not optimized enough).</p>\n<pre><code>0x400644:    mov    (%rax),%rax\n</code></pre>\n<p>Set <code>rax</code> as the address pointed by <code>pointer</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>0x400647:    movabs $0x2073692073696854,%rcx\n</code></pre>\n<p>To understand that, you need to decompose this magic number <code>0x2073692073696854</code> and cut it into pieces.
