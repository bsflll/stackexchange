Vista introduced <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Address Space Layout Randomisation</a> (ASLR), which causes load addresses to be randomised within certain limits. Also, /LARGEADDRESSAWARE programs can see an extended address space if a 32-bit Windows is started with the /3GB switch; for Wow64 it's about 4GB. Shared/system DLLs tend to go to 7xxxxxxx</span>",
