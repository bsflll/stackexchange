The following \"evalualtion\" of me was done with the public available <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/data\" rel=\"nofollow\">kaggle</a> malware set. Even if it is not a clear classifcation of the used obfuscation technique of the families, hopefully this approach could help you out or point you to the right direction. \nI did the classifaction with the help of different statistics like entropy value, chi-square distribution and a pi approximation.</p>\n<pre><code>NORM    COMPR   ENCR\n-----------------------------------------\n581     691     260      Ramnit      \n2475    3       0        Lollipop \n0       10      2932     Kelihos_ver3    \n6       51      418      Vundo   \n3       22      18       Simda  \n233     260     258      Tracur   \n387     4       7        Kelihos_ver1 \n524     667     37       Obfuscator  \n779     219     15       Gatak  \n\nNORM  = non-obfuscated characteristics (i.e. not compressed/encrypted)\nCOMPR = compressed or packed characteristics\nENCR  = encrypted characteristics\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
