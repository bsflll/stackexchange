    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to understand how to disassemble or at least get a readable copy of the update-binary file located in /META-INF/com/google/android/. It is a modified version for a smartwatch, which contains the key used by the manufacturer to temporarily unlock the bootloader and let the system update properly. I searched on the net but I did not find anything related to this.\nHave you got any idea of how could I extract that key form the binary file? The architecture is MIPS.</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance!!</p>\n</div>",

Maybe you can use <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">IDA Pro</a> (Win/Linux) or <a href=\"https://www.hopperapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hopper</a> (Mac/Linux) or <a href=\"https://www.pnfsoftware.com/jeb2/mips\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JEB</a> (Win/Mac/Linux) to poke around.  If you have a clue about the length or parts of the key, then you could try to search for relevant strings.  </p>\n<p>I've never tried it myself (MIPS), but maybe the approach helps you. ;)<br/>\nCheers!</p>\n</div>",
