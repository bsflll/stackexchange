It just finds JFIF header and tries to guess the size, and saves data starting from the point it found the header at. You may try to carve using photorec, but most probably it won't help either.</p>\n</div>",

It seems that it will only scan partitions for deleted files, not extract images from WITHIN an existing file. I tried throwing my file on a USB drive and running photorec and as predicted it just grabbed old deleted files from the drive, nothing from within my file.</span>",
