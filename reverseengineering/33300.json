I found this <a href=\"https://zairon.wordpress.com/2006/12/06/any-application-defined-hook-procedure-on-my-machine/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">blog</a> from 2006 but I am having difficulty replicating it. I assume this might be due to changes in windows internal structures.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to achieve this or are there recent references to similar adventure?</p>\n</div>",
