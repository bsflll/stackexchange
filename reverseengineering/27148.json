    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm performing my first reverse on a Mach-O file binary through Ghidra. My problem is that Ghidra doesn't create symbol files of the dylib/frameworks that are loaded in the project. It is really problematic because I want to trace the calls through these libraries. (ARM64v8-a, iOS 13.6, image extracted with Cellebrite with checkra1n)</p>\n<p>Here we can see there is no found functions below the import. All these external librairies are loaded in the project. (Some of them have been extracted from the dyld_shared_cache, therefore maybe some are not completely reconstructed. But others are intacts)\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3peeW.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3peeW.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>If I try with a PE file, the function are detected and the symbol file is created under the config folder of Ghidra, but not with any dylib binaries :</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PVCsQ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PVCsQ.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I have found that Hopper succeeds to find references to these external binaries. (Free Version)</p>\n<p>I could just find symbol files online, but until now I did not find a single one, moreover several librairies are relative to the application. (Any application of the analyzed iPhone 8 has the same problem, so I don't think it is related to the analyzed app)</p>\n<p>Someone had this problem ?</p>\n<p>Someone knows where to find symbol files for iOS ?</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading.</p>\n</div>",

You can try to use a different tool like IDA PRO, Rizin or radare2 or Cutter, etc.</p>\n<p>But, which binary are you trying to reverse? Do you know which functions do you want to trace?\nYou can use the tool jtool, read more on <a href=\"http://www.newosxbook.com/tools/jtool.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">jtool - Taking the O out of otool(1), and so much more</a> there is a part where he shows how to get the functions using the tool</p>\n</div>",
