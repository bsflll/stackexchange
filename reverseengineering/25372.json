To fix that, you can add these registers as arguments to this function (right click -&gt; <code>edit function signature</code>). You can see more details <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Fo99X2YNKA&amp;list=PLXqdTlog3E_8Ucym6klVOY9RmjdIy3cbm&amp;index=26&amp;t=0s\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWIcd2BRItc&amp;list=PLXqdTlog3E_8Ucym6klVOY9RmjdIy3cbm&amp;index=27&amp;t=0s\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>As for the pattern you are asking for, the <code>r11</code> register in ARM (I suppose this is the architecture of your binary) is used for accessing local function variables placed on the stack. So, it seems that your function (probably 6 - argument constructor) initialises some class (having 6 members), which was a type of some local variable (declared in caller function) in the original code.</p>\n</div>",
