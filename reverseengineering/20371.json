They both effectively do the same thing. IDA's debugger is probably better integrated with IDA.</p></li>\n<li><p>I'm going to make a recommendation here to use <a href=\"https://x64dbg.com/#start\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">x64dbg</a>. Ollydbg is outdated and unsupported. IDA's debugger works but the interface is clunky and isn't as easy to use as x64dbg. Plus if IDA's debugger crashes, you risk corrupting your IDA database. If x64dbg crashes you don't lose anything except a few minutes of time. </p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
