I know that this website is built with a CMS. How can I get to know which CMS was used?</p>\n<p>So I'm looking for basic, general typicals of common CMSs, so that we can get to know the working power behind any informational website or blog.</p>\n<p>For example, a typical might be that WordPress adds such a line to the HTML:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;meta name=\"generator\" content=\"WordPress 3.5.1\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
