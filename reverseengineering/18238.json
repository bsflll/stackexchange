The <code>offb</code> member of each <code>op_t</code> element is supposed to be the offset of the bytes corresponding to the operand in the instruction bytes. </p>\n<p>Note that it may be 0 since itâ€™s not always possible to determine operand location at the byte level, especially on non-x86 architectures.
