    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a program that executes differently depending on what files are present on my computer. I'd like to run a trace in two scenarios (with the default file and with an edited version of the file) and then compare the traces to see where things differ.</p>\n<p>Is there an in built method to do this in ollydbg? I'm by no means an expect with ollydbg, but I'm willing to put in any amount of time and effort to figure this out - I just need a little direction.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div>",
