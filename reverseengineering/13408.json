This is because actual instructions will be altered in the statically linking process. Some functions might be inlined if used rarely or are relatively short, for example. Advanced optimizations might make matter worse.</p>\n<p>However, You could rather easily find <code>SYSENTER</code> (or <code>int 0x80</code> if using older versions of glibc/linux) instructions and map those to kernel callbacks. Obviously, a lot of API functionality is implemented without ever accessing the kernel, and that you'll need to work harder to recover. It is a possibility (depends on the linker's configuration when compiling the executable) that other glibc functions will be adjacent memory-wise, so finding a few statically linked APIs could help you recover others.</p>\n<p>Last point of advice I could give you is to rename all functions you've identified as part of glibc appropriately, even without actually identifying their functionality, <code>glibcsub_*</code> or a similar easily recognizable pattern. I think you'll find this useful.</p>\n</div>",

E.g. there's almost a zero probability that the code doesn't allocate any memory and doesn't do any string manipulation. So you can count XREFS to all the functions and be sure that those which are called most(and called from all the parts of the binary) are the library functions. After you know where is malloc, you can find free, after you have malloc and free you can find other library functions which use malloc/free.\nSo, if you're ready to spend your time, you can find library functions yourself.</p>\n</div>",
