            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">This probably means the stack frame hasn't been setup correctly yet, so Ida gets confused. Sometimes it helps to single-step a few instructions. Also, when you're certain you're at the very first instruction in the function, check the top of the stack (the dword at [esp/rsp], depending on whether you're on 32 bit or 64 bit) for the return address. If your assembly code wasn't produced by a compiler, and uses a nonstandard way of handling the stack, this might be the only way.</span>",
