    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'll be honest, Pin is confounding my intuition. Let's say, for the sake of argument, I have a line</p>\n<pre><code> a = b + c\n</code></pre>\n<p>and I wish to then store the addresses of b and c as a's dependencies, say, in a map, </p>\n<pre><code>m[address of a].append(address of b, address of c)\n</code></pre>\n<p>My current understanding of this involves </p>\n<pre><code>if (INS_IsMemoryRead(ins)||INS_IsMemoryWrite(ins))\nfor(memOp=0;memOp&lt;INS_MemoryOperandCount(ins);memOp++)\nINS_InsertPredicatedCall(ins, IPOINT_BEFORE, (AFUNPTR) AnalysisFunction, IARG_MEMORYOP_EA, memOp, IARG_THREAD_ID, IARG_END);\n</code></pre>\n<p>where AnalysisFunction would essentially take the memory address from the operation and somehow return it, or put it into a map. But I'm not entirely certain how to do that, or how to correlate the reads to writes properly.</p>\n<p>Any help would be appreciated</p>\n</div>",
