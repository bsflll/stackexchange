It uses QT framework. I can normally save the file from the database but only through its GUI (which is really painful).\nI want to be able to decode the blob in sqlite to the original file.\nI have attached the original and encoded file here <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2BLH3kVAYbgQVVzTTFRRzNHMlk/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a>\n(click download button)\nIt is likely using qtarray and qstring but I am not sure. It seems also that the header is removed while encoding.\nI would really appreciate your help. </p>\n</div>",

The first 4 bytes of the blob is the decompressed size and the compressed content start at 6th byte.<p>\nAfter the decompression you got binary file starting with <code>0xDEADBEAF</code> (in big-endian, marked as yellow in the figure). After it you can find some header parameters, one of the <code>0x22</code> (marked as green) is the number of rows.<p>\nAfter the header you can find the row data as 32-bit float (<a href=\"http://www.binaryconvert.com/result_float.html?hexadecimal=BFBF589F\" rel=\"noreferrer\">see float conversion here</a>):</p>\n<pre><code>6 = 06\n0.756431 = 0x3f41a578\n-1.494892 = 0xbfbf589f\n</code></pre>\n<p><img alt=\"Decompressed blob\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Chx2n.png\"/></p>\n</p></p></div>",
