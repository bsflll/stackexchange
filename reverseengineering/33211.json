    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>If I understand correctly, when a bug-check happens, the <code>KeBugCheckEx</code> function saves the contents of physical memory pages in a swap-file and then the actual <code>.dmp</code> file is created only when the system boots back up.</p>\n<p>Which NT function is used to save the <code>.dmp</code> file during the boot? And is it in <code>ntoskrnl</code> or in <code>crashdmp.sys</code>?</p>\n<p>I also wonder if the same function is responsible for creating different types of crash dump files, i.e. full dump, kernel dump, small dump, live kernel dump?</p>\n</div>",

So I don't know.</span>",

The actual .dmp file is created in user mode after a reboot by the <code>smss.exe</code> process as a part of initializing the page file. <code>smss!SmpCheckForCrashDump</code> has something to do with it. I need to check it further.</span>",
