At any rate, I think if you're worried about your own safety, opening up an old piece of hardware is pretty safe. But you're more likely to be worried about wrecking the hardware -- which is why you might want to post a picture of it</span>",

Equipment, especially older stuff, but really anything was designed to be plugged into the house mains may contain large capacitors in their power circuitry.  These can store a surprising charge that would result in a major shock.  Most modern equipment implements bleeder resistors that render them safe within minutes to an hour at most.  Older equipment should be left unplugged for a day or three unless you know what you are about.</p>\n<p>In particular older CRT monitors and TVs contain a flyback transformer circuit for the electron gun that runs thousands of volts and will hold a charge for a while (hours/days depending on the make and age).</p>\n</div>",

For most power circuits, we are talking a few days at most.  Maybe longer (A week or two) for some real major capacitors (think a soda can sized or larger).</span>",
