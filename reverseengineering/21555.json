I want to know what it is used for?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For our purposes, entropy can be though of as information density or as a measure of randomness in information, which is what makes it useful in the context of reverse engineering and binary analysis.</p>\n<p>Compressed and encrypted data have higher entropy than e.g. code or text data. In fact, compressed and encrypted data have close to the maximum possible level of entropy, which can be used as a heuristic to identify it as such in order to differentiate it from non-compressed/non-encrypted data.</p>\n<p>Example use cases in reverse engineering:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Malware Analysis</strong> - If we have an executable which has a header that can be parsed successfully and the program loads and runs without error, but the overall entropy level of the file is very high and the code can't be analyzed statically because the data outside of the file header and program headers looks random (hence the high entropy), it probably means that the executable is in fact compressed on disk and is decompressed at runtime. Executable compression complicates analysis, so it is a relatively common feature of programs developed for criminal purposes. If we want to analyze the code, its decompressed form need to be recovered somehow.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Firmware Analysis</strong> - In systems with relatively severe hardware constraints, such as embedded systems, firmware updates are often delivered in compressed form in order to save space. In order to analyse the firmware, it first needs to be determined whether it is encrypted or compressed. One way to determine this is through performing an entropy analysis of the file. If the entropy is very high, it is a good sign that the file is indeed compressed or encrypted. To proceed with analysis of the actual firmware, it must first be decompressed/decrypted. If we have a block of data with very high entropy (i.e. close to random), it makes no sense to try to treat it as code and disassemble it, because the results will be meaningless nonsense. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>File Type Identification</strong> - Some file types can be identified on the basis of their overall entropy. For example, we can usually differentiate between image files (png, jpeg, etc) and compiled binaries (ELF, PE) because image files consist of compressed data and therefore (generally) have much higher entropy than compiled binaries.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Besides \"Detect It Easy\", tools such as <code>binwalk</code>, <code>ent</code> and binvis.io can assist with calculating file entropy. You can also build your own tools that do this. </p>\n</div>",

It will allow to detect the parts that have been encrypted/compressed and the parts that appear to be left untouched.</p>\n<p>Indeed, a high disorder in data is exactly what you want to achieve when encrypting data. And, I told you that the two entropy definitions were related, if you store a lot of information in a minimum of bytes, it appears to be with a high level of disorder, so is compression...</p>\n<p>That is why we use entropy graphs of files, be able to distinguish raw parts from encrypted/compressed sub-parts without any prior information of the file format.</p>\n<h1>An Example</h1>\n<p>For example, here is an entropy graph from the tool <code>binwalk</code> coming from <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/16939/decompress-and-analyse-vmware-efi64-bios\">another question from here</a>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/dtSg2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Binwalk entropy graph\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/dtSg2.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Directly from this graph we can see that there is a first part that appear to be raw (probably asm opcodes if we look at the shape of the curve), then a part which is much likely encrypted (compression does not reach an entropy of 1 with such regularity usually), and finally padding with always the same byte (e.g. <code>0x00</code> or <code>0xff</code>).</p>\n</div>",
