This type of preamble or similar may be what you have captured here.  As the posted answer says it's highly likely that your picture is far from the full transmitted message.  Perhaps share the captured file ?</span>",

It does not look like the OOK modulation I was expecting.  I am very new to this so perhaps I am missing something.</span>",
