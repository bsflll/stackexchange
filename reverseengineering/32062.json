    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>The program I am looking at creates 3 different tables.</p>\n<p>The first two tables are created at the same time, one entry at a time. Table 1 is 256 1 byte entries. Table 2 is 256 2 byte entries. All the values in table 2 go from low to high.</p>\n<p>After table 1 and 2 are completed, table 3 is created. Table 3 is consecutive and increasing 1 byte values from 0x00 to 0xFF. For example there might be 12 repeating values of 0x00, then 8 repeating values of 0x01, and then 5 values of 0x02, all the way up to 0xFF. Table 3 is a variable length depending on the data.</p>\n<p>If the decompressed data value was 0x00c5, the program will first pull 0x00 from table 3, followed by 0xc5.</p>\n<p>Update: The right byte in table 2 is the counter for each hex value in table 3. For example if the first value in table 2 is 0x01FF, then there will be 256 values of 0x00 in table 3.</p>\n</div>",
