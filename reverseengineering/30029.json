    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Let's say I have this code in the decompiler of IDA pro:</p>\n<pre><code>var1 = var2; \n</code></pre>\n<p>And assume the type of <code>var1</code> is <code>X</code> (for example <code>X</code> could be char array with size 5). Is there anyway that I can tell IDA that whenever you see such assignments, change the type of <code>var2</code> to <code>X</code> as well?</p>\n<p>Considering that <code>var1</code> is type <code>X</code>, then obviously <code>var2</code> should be type <code>X</code> as well, but right now I have to manually change the type every timeâ€¦ The problem is this is happening inside a large function thousands of times and I can't manually change every time, I need to somehow force IDA to do it. But how?</p>\n</div>",
