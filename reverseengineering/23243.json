This is very difficult to do blindly though since you have only this UART and no other means of observation what happens inside. </p></li>\n<li><p>there may be a strap pin that forces the chip to go into bootloader mode on startup which then may support commands for reading the flash or uploading code into RAM. Again, this is difficult without any documentation. </p></li>\n<li><p>there may be JTAG pins or another diagnostic UART. Itâ€™s quite unlikely IMO that the board has no diagnostic options at all  so try to trace where every pin of the CPU goes and see if you can discover a group of test pads. </p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

I would see about dumping the flash contents from it if that is not what you meant. Test which pins are VDD and VSS with a DMM, then see if you can find some datasheets for SOIC8 flash ICs that have the same power and ground pins. A Raspberry Pi is great for dumping spi flash content.\nCan you link to the EEPROM Dump?</p>\n</div>",
