Compiler vendors normally conform to this ABI to make their code interchangable with that of other vendors, or standard libraries.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia page about calling conventions</a> has information about the standard conventions of most of the common processors. as well as links to some of the manufacturer documents.</p>\n<p>However, noone forces you to use that exact convention. You could, for example, write a JVM that has the Java stack in one register, and the C/native stack in a different one. Or, you could use one register for the call/return stack, a different one for function parameters, and a third one for local variables. The hardware doesn't care, so you can do this if you feel it's advantageous to your application; however, in most cases, not using the standard ABI causes you trouble (as you can't use standard libraries anymore) without gaining you anything.</p>\n</div>",
