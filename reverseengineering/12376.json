Found out multiple functions, ways to make character move, attack, reversed structures containing world data, and so created logic which makes the character grind effectively 24/7.</p>\n<p>Now, the legal questions come in. I've read tiny bit about dmca, the glider bot case, but in the end, if i dont share the knowledge of internal game structure, i do not modify (crack, dump) the executeable, just load a dll which calls appropriate functions and reads memory containing surrounding world information, is it illegal? What if i would like to distribute (sell) it to bigger audience?</p>\n<p>And second question. If the game is really buggy and leaves many decission to client side (so the server takes things on belief), and so i can make the character move and hit 10 times faster by spamming function calls, is it considered as illegal?</p>\n<p>Consider game has a function\nauto AttackMonster = (int(__fastcall*)(MonsterContainer*, void*, int monsterIndex))HardcodedAddressIFoundByReversing;</p>\n<p>And so calling it repeatidly causes client to send attack request to server without performing the attack speed / cooldown checks, resulting in the character killing everything in a light speed granting huge advantage over other players. What about legality with this one?</p>\n<p>So to sum up: All my bot does is: load implant, read memory, call functions from game executeable. No patching no dumping ( no \" illegal things \" i'd like to say... :) )</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for answers and clarification</p>\n</div>",
