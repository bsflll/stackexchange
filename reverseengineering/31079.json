For example on Windows, learning the WinAPI would be useful, and on Linux the Linux programming interface. The reason is that you will know simply by a program's imported functions on those operating systems what it is likely doing in a broad sense. Like, if it imports networking and cryptography OS APIs, well, you can surmise what it might be doing, etc...</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You could also look at YouTube videos. Other than that, it's basically trial and error, there aren't really many \"official courses\" on it tbh. AFAIK, there isn't an equivalent to something like leetcode or AlgoExpert aside from that I suggested.</p>\n</div>",
