(a series of challanges/ books/ any outher working way - i want to be able to look at a program in ida and  feel that i know exactly what to do even in state of the art anty debug protection).</p>\n<p>(I did the guides of LENA, KIGA and read the books:\nReverse Engineering for Beginners\nPractical malware analysis\nReversing: The Hacker's Guide to Reverse Engineering)</p>\n</div>",

From my personal experience reverse engineering is mostly learned by doing things: By actually trying to solve a real problem. Usually for me once the problem is solved, I lose interest in the code.</p>\n<p>My advice for you is to find a project of larger scale that you want to work on, something that interests you personally, and slowly get going through it.\nKeep a journal of what you are trying to do. A text file will do. Sometimes reverse engineering projects can take more than a few months to complete.</p>\n<p>If you feel that you can still not handle something of this scale, you can check out <strong>ReversingHero</strong>: It's a program I use to teach beginners about reverse engineering. </p>\n<p>ReversingHero contains 15 levels of increasing difficulty, and it seems to be interesting even for experienced reversers. It works on Linux x64, but if you use Windows &gt; 10 you can use WSL to run it. Grab yourself a disassembler, a debugger and start solving the challenges in this file. You can find it here: \n<a href=\"https://www.reversinghero.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ReversingHero</a></p>\n<p>Note that ReversingHero has accompanying video course which is paid (not free), but given that you already have some reverse engineering experience I don't think you should be watching the videos.</p>\n</div>",
