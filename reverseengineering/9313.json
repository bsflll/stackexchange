If I configure the executable for a compatibility mode of Windows XP (Service Pack 3) within the file properties then this exception does not occur and the binary executes as expected.  The executable does not produce an exception when running with a debugger attached.</p>\n<p>What is the root cause of this exception, and how would I determine it?</p>\n</div>",

Which version of Win7 are you using? It seems that switching to XP compat. forces 32-bit compatibility, while, for some reason, in native Win7 64-bit even 32-bit apps can (?) sometimes switch to 64-bit code in debugger, resulting in nasty things.</span>",
