You might find they are using different chips, which is why the firmware is different.  In that case moving the firmware  is unlikely to work, in the same way that you can't put a train driver in an aircraft and expect them to be able to drive it.</p>\n<p>If all the chips are the same, then there's probably some way of identifying which model is in use.  This would allow the same firmware to be loaded onto both devices, and it decides at power up which mode to start in.  If this is the case, it would then be a matter of working out how it identifies the model and changing that.</p>\n<p>It's relatively rare for companies to release identical devices only differing in features and firmware though.  Usually there really is some hardware difference that makes using different firmware impractical.  So before you even entertain the idea, figuring out how similar the two devices are internally is the most important step.</p>\n</div>",
