    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>The Watcom compiler uses a fairly unusual calling convention, and IDA seems to be discarding some of the changes as irrelevant to its built-in pseudo-code. In my experience, that usually means I'm doing something wrong, as opposed to IDA :)</p>\n<p>For example, in the following function fragment, the changes to <code>ebx</code> and <code>edx</code> are ignored in the pseudo-code.</p>\n<pre><code>; void __usercall RunScrIncDec(GeneralObject *object@&lt;eax&gt;, int *bufPtr@&lt;edx&gt;, int value@&lt;ebx&gt;)\nRunScrIncDec    proc near\n                cmp     byte ptr [edx], 0Ah\n                jnz     short loc_164288\n\n                inc     ebx\n                inc     edx\n                retn\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note here that bufPtr and value are both incremented, and value is indeed passed by value, not by reference.</p>\n<p>If I change the function's return type so that it's an int by replacing the <code>void</code> return type with an <code>int</code> and appending the value location <code>@&lt;ebx&gt;</code>, then IDA includes <code>ebx</code> one in the pseudo-code, but still ignores <code>edx</code>.</p>\n<p>Is there any way to tell IDA to pay attention to these changes?\nThat <code>edx</code> and <code>ebx</code> aren't merely spoiled by the function, and that they're notable changes that should be reversed to bufPtr++ and value++ rather than not showing any pseudo-code at all?\nOr is this just something that IDA isn't built to handle?</p>\n</div>",

It will consider those values only in the case they're indeed return values the calling function.</p>\n<p>What you'll need to do, as you've figured out yourself, is to make IDA understand those are returned values.</p>\n<p>Here's a trick to let you do that, by setting that function to return a <em>structure</em> of two DWORDs (or any other type defined in the structure).</p>\n<p>First, create an IDA structure by going to the structures view (<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>F9</kbd>) and then create a new structure (<kbd>INS</kbd>).</p>\n<p>In that structure, define two DWORD integers (either by using <kbd>D</kbd> on the bottom of the structure or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> to increase the structure's size first).</p>\n<p>Then go back to the function, and modify the function's prototype. replace the <code>void</code> return type with the name of your structure, and append the <em>value location</em> specifier after the function's name. To specify two registers, in our case <code>EBX</code> and EDX`, use colons in between.</p>\n<p>The final result should look like this, assuming you named your struct <code>s_ret</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>s_ret __usercall RunScrIncDec@&lt;eax:ecx&gt;(GeneralObject *object@&lt;eax&gt;, int *bufPtr@&lt;edx&gt;, int value@&lt;ebx&gt;)\n^^^^^                        ^^^^^^^^^^\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
