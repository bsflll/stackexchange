And I have no clue what tool obfuscated this file.<br/>\nAnd I'm also curious about how can this dylib overwrite exisiting functions?</p>\n<p>Note: I've read <a href=\"https://alexomara.com/blog/a-silly-anti-disassembly-trick/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://alexomara.com/blog/a-silly-anti-disassembly-trick/</a>, however this dylib isn't that trick, but is really obfuscated XD</p>\n</div>",
