    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>What I'm doing now is placing an awful lot of comments about function variable values, global variable values as comments in my IDA database, which I find ugly after a while and obviously not a best practice. </p>\n<p>I was wondering if it's possible to store runtime variable values of your target process from a dynamic debugging session in your IDA database(or any other storage/tool) in some way. For example you run IDA debugger, or some external tool like olly/immunity, and store the encountered values (globals, function parameters) in IDA, so you can see actual values when doing your static analysis in IDA (for example on mouse over).</p>\n<p>I don't know if anybody done this before, but it think it would be a really helpful feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Is this possible, any similar tool/solution out there you know of? How do you process static+dynamic data of the reversed application?</strong> </p>\n<p>I'm not tied to IDA, but I find that environment to be most fitting for storing my result data. I'm interested in any solution.</p>\n</div>",
