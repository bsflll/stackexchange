For example, this attempt to look at Microsoft Access: <a href=\"https://github.com/brianb/mdbtools/blob/master/HACKING\">https://github.com/brianb/mdbtools/blob/master/HACKING</a></p>\n<p>This is fairly consistent with the approach taken in ISO specs for formats.</p>\n<p>This type of work is part of what I do professionally but I haven't come across anything to help me store my information in a consistent and useful manner for anyone else - months down the line it might not even be useful to me. </p>\n<p>Is there a 'community' best practice (methods, tools, authoring tools etc.) to help document research into a file format?</p>\n</div>",

If you know C, this is pretty descriptive, but it has its limitations and at times it can get a bit convoluted when trying to express certain more exotic concepts.

They provide a basic narrative of functionality, pseudo-code, and in the case of OGG/OGV even a full reference implementation.  A standard you took apart, in my opinion, should be documented the same way a standard you designed is documented.  Some fields may be \"unknown\" or \"seems to be magic, just leave it\".  </p>\n<p>I don't think you'll find anything more standard than that is.  If you don't mind posting a document and a parser, github/bitbucket/etc are great.  Some of the other file format questions point to Wotsit.org (I look there), so submitting a link there could be a good thing as well.</p>\n</div>",
