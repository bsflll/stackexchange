    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>On Linux the <em>strace.so</em> pintool gives a good overview on how system calls are intercepted in PIN. One could monitor the value of <code>EAX</code> to see which system call is being invoked(and mprotect and writes could be intercepted in the fashion).</p>\n<p>How could we do something similar for Windows? I see that the <code>int 2e</code> interrupt is used to trap into the kernel and that the system calls numbers are given at <a href=\"http://j00ru.vexillium.org/ntapi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. Is <code>NtWriteFile</code> the analogue of <code>write</code>? Also is <code>NtProtectVirtualMemory</code> the analogue of <code>mprotect</code>?</p>\n</div>",

Also, if its discovered that the cpu supports <code>sysenter</code>/<code>syscall</code>, those are used in place of <code>int 2e</code>. However, this has no bearing on whether or not instrumentation can take place.</p>\n<p>To answer your second question, yes, <code>NtReadFile</code>, <code>NtWriteFile</code> and <code>NtDeviceIoControlFile</code> are the *nix equivalent of <code>read</code>/<code>write</code>/<code>ioctl</code>.</p>\n</div>",
