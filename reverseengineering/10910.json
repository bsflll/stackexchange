You'll have to use WinDbg.</p>\n<p>You need to set IFEO Debugger for your process name to run CDB <strong>as server</strong> (e.g. <code>cdb.exe -server tcp:port=12345 -noio</code>) and the run WinDbg as a client and connect to your server (<code>windbg.exe -remote tcp:server=localhost,port=12345</code>).</p>\n<p>You'll probably want to change the <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\ServicesPipeTimeout</code> Registry value to be a bit longer. This is the time the SCM waits for a service it runs to talk to it.</p>\n<p>If you don't have to debug the initialization you can simply attach to the service after it starts, and then you can use ollydbg.</p>\n<p>All of this and pretty much everything you need to know is documented under the MSDN page titled <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff540613(v=vs.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Debugging a Service Application</a>.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>Edit:</em> If patching the binary is possible you can add an infinite loop in the entry point like <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/users/1876/gandolf\">gandolf</a> suggested and then attach a debugger after you log in.</p>\n<p>Or, if the binary doesn't do any SEH tricks that interfere with it: Add an exception to the entry point (0xCC - int 3 is the obvious choice), set <code>AeDebug</code> to a long running process (such as <code>notepad.exe</code>) and then attach a debugger. This is what <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0735662789\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Inside Windows Debugging</a> proposes (p. 139).</p>\n<p>Or, what's even easier and makes even more sense: Add the same INT3, and set <code>AeDebug</code> to the same <code>cdb.exe</code> command-line as you would put in IFEO and connect WinDbg to it after you log in.</p>\n</div>",
