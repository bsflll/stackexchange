You may need to make a custom binutils build to support your target CPU.</p>\n</div>",

My problem was that my CMake toolchain was erroneously setting CMAKE_OBJDUMP to /usr/bin/objdump instead of /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-objdump. I fixed this by forcing my toolchain.cmake file to use /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-objdump and /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-objcopy, by adding these lines to my toolchain.cmake BEFORE any calls to find_program(...):</p>\n<pre><code>unset(CMAKE_OBJCOPY CACHE)\nunset(CMAKE_OBJDUMP CACHE)\n</code></pre>\n<p>My CMake version is 3.16.3.
