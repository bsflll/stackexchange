The operating system will schedule tasks across the available active cores, and distribute the workload as evenly as possible to ensure efficient utilization of resources.</p>\n<p>Assuming you disable 4 cores, the operating system will only utilize the remaining 10 cores for processing tasks. The operating system will not block off the disabled cores nor wear down the other cores. Although, disabling cores may affect performance as the operating system will have fewer resources to work with.</p>\n</div>",
