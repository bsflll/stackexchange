    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>What i'm trying to achieve is to use a conditional breakpoint, that never actually breaks but logs in x64dbg's console the value of r9 only when it changes, to prevent console cluttering.\nBut i do not understand how to set the expression for the log condition. On a higher level the pseudo code of what i want to achieve could be:</p>\n<pre><code>static last_r9 = 0;\nif(r9 != last_r9){\nLog();\nlast_r9 = r9;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is is even possible to achieve something like that?</p>\n<p>Here's an screenshot just for reference:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/q298c.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/q298c.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
