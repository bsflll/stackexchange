All that I know is it's made of a good number of IDF files, they contains both data and photos/images shown on the screen through the software.</p>\n<p>My question is where to start if I want reverse engineering these files, getting the data with their relations. Would be enough have tables of strings and numbers. I have a little experience with rev.eng. made through Cheat Engine, for some games, but nothing more.</p>\n</div>",

You could try using WinApiOverride or similar to see how the existing viewer calls into its DLLs, and - perhaps with a little reverse engineering to understand those calls - use the same DLLs to access the database in your viewer.</span>",
