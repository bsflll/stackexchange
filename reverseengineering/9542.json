So far, I've studied operating systems, computer networks, computer architecture, cryptography (basic and advanced), systems security &amp; network security. My mathematical/theoretical background consists of theory of computation, complexity theory, abstract algebra, graph theory, number theory and basic algorithm and data structure design/implementation. I'm also currently doing a course on compilers (design/implementation). </p>\n<p>I find reverse engineering quite intriguing; although since I don't have any first hand experience of the area itself, I cannot say much. Bachelor's project is supposed to be a showcase of a person's strengths in computer science at my institute, and being primarily interested in systems security, I'd like to do my main project in some specific sub-area in the aforementioned area only. I'd preferably like to explore more theoretical parts than applied ones, although I'm okay with a fine balance between both.</p>\n<p>I need help in actually knowing if I should go for it or not. I know this is a very vague question (and it'd probably get flagged), but I don't really know any other avenue where I should be asking this. Is there scope for research in this field at an undergrad level? If yes, what more background do I need to acquire before getting into it? I feel taking this up as a research project might be a bit too ambitious since I don't know anything about the field, but in case I <em>do</em> take it up, where shall I start? I need to have a proper problem definition in mind, which I sadly do not have, so I'd appreciate some help/advice on the same.</p>\n<p>Thanks (if you've read this far and aren't annoyed).</p>\n</div>",
