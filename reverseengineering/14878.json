    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>This can be difficult to ask because 1) people assume this is necessarily malicious and 2) unrelated but effectual techniques like GetForegroundWindow can make this impossible to answer.</p>\n<p>So, to keep this as general as possible: If I wish to send keyboard and mouse events to a program but it is ignoring messages other programs receive and interpret just fine, what might I try? What might the developers be trying? The goal is to have multiple windows receiving input at once.</p>\n<p>My specific case is that I wish to be doing things on my system while the target window receives clicks and keyboard input at a set interval. I could just toggle foreground, but I really don't want to.</p>\n<p>If this would better fit somewhere else than reverseengineering or if some variation on this has already been asked I would, of course, be perfectly content to respectively post elsewhere or read said variation.</p>\n</div>",
