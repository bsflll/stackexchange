How do I analyze the exception and the behavior? How do I exploit it?</p>\n<p>I have so many questions. Please help. The memory dump is too big, so it is impossible to identify anything. What steps should I follow? Sometimes shows <code>unexpected HRESULT</code> on R8 register as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DLuR0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DLuR0.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
