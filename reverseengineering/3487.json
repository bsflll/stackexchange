However, this generally requires using a debugger. </p>\n<p>Is it possible for a process to somehow detect if it has been injected by another process using winapi? If so, how?</p>\n<p>More specifically, are there any \"fixed/likely\" characteristics of injected code? For instance, from <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/3482/does-code-injected-into-process-memory-always-belong-to-a-page-with-rwx-access\">this question</a> it appears that injected code can be characterized by always appearing in pages that have the following protection flags set: PAGE_READWRITE_EXECUTE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY and possibly (but unlikely) PAGE_EXECUTE. Can you point out other characteristics of injected code?</p>\n</div>",

When your code and injected one are only running in the same ring (user mode), it all goes down to who is gaining control first.

When a thread is injected, the host's Thread Local Storage callbacks will be called unless the injector takes care to disable that.  If the callbacks are called, then the host can query the start address of the new thread and determine if it is within the host's defined code region (which only the host would know)  See the Thread Local Storage section in my \"Ultimate\" Anti-Debugging Tricks paper (<a href=\"http://pferrie.host22.com/papers/antidebug.pdf\">http://pferrie.host22.com/papers/antidebug.pdf</a>) for an example of that.</p>\n<p>While this does not detect everything (some malware use cavities within the host's existing code section in order to perform the injection), it will certainly catch some things.</p>\n<p>However, the short answer to your question is actually \"no\".  There isn't a way for a process to \"know\" in <em>all</em> cases that something has been injected.  It is \"yes\" for most cases, but not all of them.</p>\n</div>",
