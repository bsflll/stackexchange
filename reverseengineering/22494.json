    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a DLL paused at <code>EntryPoint</code> in <code>x32dbg</code>. I am interested in examining memory following a specific API call that this DLL makes. I found the API call in the <code>imports</code> section when I open the DLL in <code>IDAFree</code> and then I see the API function call in IDA. I follow it in code and IDA shows it's at address: <code>10001B66</code></p>\n<p>My problem is that when I try to set a breakpoint at this address in <code>x32dbg</code> (<code>bp 0x10001B66</code>), it gives me an error:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Error setting breakpoint at 10001B66! (memread)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, in <code>x32dbg</code>, I'm seeing addresses such as <code>714A7D39</code> for my DLL. Now, I'm new to this but I'm guessing that the <code>memread</code> error is because <code>10001B66</code> -- as seen in IDA -- is not a valid memory address in the context of execution in the debugger.</p>\n<p>So how do I get the correct address of this API function call so that I can set the correct breakpoint? </p>\n</div>",
