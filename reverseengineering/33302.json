But after few days it didnt show any trial option. I tried in another emulator it worked again for few days. Somehow it can recognize emulators. It doesnt work even you create new profiles in emulator and change android model,imei etc. I also tried magisk and android faker, but it didnt work.</p>\n<p>So is there any way to bypass this app tracking system?</p>\n<p>How is it tracking?</p>\n</div>",
