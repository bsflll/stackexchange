    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>My goal is to </p>\n<ol>\n<li>extract function names,</li>\n<li>the libraries they come from (if the functions were imported),</li>\n<li>function arguments, and</li>\n<li>strings</li>\n</ol>\n<p>from a .NET binary. How can I do this?\nIs this possible using tools like <a href=\"http://www.telerik.com/products/decompiler.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JustDecompile</a>\nor <a href=\"http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/reflector/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">.NET Reflector</a>? Do they offer an API that allows to do this?</p>\n<p>I noticed IDA's Function Window is populated, but the Strings Window is not. In addition, I guess it would be easier (e.g. to get function arguments) to use a tool that does decompilation...</p>\n<p>PS:\nThe code is not obfuscated, it is not malware but regular software.</p>\n</div>",
