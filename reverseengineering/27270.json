As far as I know, <code>Trace</code>-&gt;<code>Run hit trace</code> and then <code>View</code>-&gt;<code>Run trace</code> should show you the memory referenced.</span>",

However it only shows the modified registers and not the referenced memory. I also checked if there were any options to toggle memory references for the trace but didnt find any.</span>",
