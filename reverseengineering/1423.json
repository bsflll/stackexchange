Using the IDA plugins suggested fixed my immediate problem, but is there an easier way, for future reference, to do it based solely on network traffic?  I would have assumed that since the traffic had no header or identifiable information that it would not be possible.</span>",

If you can set a break-point on those functions and see what is being passed in for the key, this, of course, would be the easiest way.</p>\n</div>",
