    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So I'm just starting to learn reverse engineering and binary exploitation and going through the RPI course where the first lab set is drawn from the IOLI crackmes available on <a href=\"https://github.com/Maijin/Workshop2015/tree/master/IOLI-crackme/bin-linux\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Github</a>. I could post all of the dissassembly here if it would help.</p>\n<p>I'm working on number 5 and I'm confused on one aspect. I understand how to get the solution and get the password ok, but there seems to be a length on the input that I can't trace back to any of the assembly. </p>\n<p>The numbers can add up to more than the 10h and the last one can be odd, but once the input is passed 9 characters, it's not accepted.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nHHbl.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nHHbl.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>I'm using gdb and ida and whatever other tools seem helpful, but the specific tools don't matter much to me. Post an explanation with a radare output if you want. </p>\n</div>",
