When there are question about binary XML, the usual answer is \"use apktool\" (or something similar).</p>\n<p>However, no tool is perfect; actually all suggested tools are more or less buggy, and I don't know tool that can successfully decompile and recompile <strong>any APK</strong> from Google Play.</p>\n<p>Because such tools are usually open source ones, they are rarely updated and don't fix bugs for years (see <strong>Issues</strong> on github for any such tool and see how quickly issues are closed).</p>\n<p>My question is: so, <strong>where is this format documented?</strong> If <code>apktool</code> and similar tools exists, it mean that they found format description somewhere and tried to implement its parser and writer.</p>\n</div>",
