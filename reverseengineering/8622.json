As am new to dbg i googled a lot as i wanted to make dbg work similar for me. As seen below this customisation would help me a lot with my work with all the data displayed instantaneously. I tried voltron from the below link but was unable to get it working with many errors. <a href=\"https://github.com/snare/voltron\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/snare/voltron</a></p>\n<p>Is there any extension other than voltron so that i can get the output as shown in the link below? Would editing the .dbginit file help in any way?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Pg9JH.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://i.sstatic.net/Pg9JH.jpg</a></p>\n<p>TIA</p>\n<p>Regards</p>\n</div>",

Although PEDA is very good, it looks like it is not being actively developed anymore. </p>\n<p>A newer incarnation of this idea is GEF (GDB Enhanced Features) (<a href=\"https://github.com/hugsy/gef\" rel=\"nofollow\">GEF Github repo</a>). It is written in Python as well and it has the advantage of bein <em>multi-architecture</em> (Intel, ARM, MIPS, etc.)</p>\n<p>Both require a minimal change in your .gdbinit to work, no tedious installation, dependencies or anything like that.</p>\n<p>Have fun debugging!</p>\n</div>",
