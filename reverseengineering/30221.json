First 100 characters here:</p>\n<pre><code>  BBFEBBFEBC09BC09BBFEBBFEBC09BC09BC09BC09BBE7BBFEBBFEBBFEBC09BBFEBC09BBFEBBFEBC15BBFEBBFEBBFEBBFEBBF2[continued...]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Luckily I also have an export of this particular file, the corresponding values are here:</p>\n<pre><code>0.036,0.036,0.04,0.04,0.036,0.036,0.04,0.04,0.04,0.04,0.027,0.036,0.036,0.036,0.04,0.036,0.04,0.036,0.036,0.045,0.036,0.036,0.036,0.036,0.031,0.031,0.027,0.013,-0.033,-0.028,0.004,0.013,0.018,0.031,0.027,0.04,0.059,0.059,0.068,0.073,0.054,0.045,0.04,0.036,0.027,0.027,0.036,0.031,0.031,0.022[continued...]\n</code></pre>\n<p>I also found the following metadata that I believe relates to this channel, last three entries are data series the first of which is above:</p>\n<pre><code>objVersion : 1\nSMType : SMP\ninputType : IN1\nPriority : 1\nColorSerialized : 1\nName : ...\nSensor : eSCPT\nAttention : 5\nAlarm : 10\nScaling : eFS\nLowerScaling : 0\nUpperScaling : 0\nUnit : bar\nLowerRange : -1\nUpperRange : 15\nSignalUnit : V\nLowerSignalRange : -0.2\nUpperSignalRange : 3\nCalcFormula : None\nCAN_VID : None\nCAN_REV : None\nCAN_PCODE : None\nCAN_SER : None\nSlopeDin : eRising\nLogicalDOUTOperation : e1A\nDOUTTriggerA : eLevel\nConditionA : None\nDOUTTriggerB : eLevel\nConditionB : None\nSlopeDout : eRising\n\n\nobjVersion: 1\nSMType: SMP\ninputType: IN1\ninterval: 16\nactValuesSerializedSMP: BBFEBBFEBC09BC09BBFEBBFEBC09BC09BC09BC09BBE7BBFEBBFEBBFEBC09BBFEBC09BBFEBBFEBC15BBFEBBFEBBFEBBFEBBF2[continued...]\nminValuesSerializedSMP: BBDCBBD0BBE7BBDCBBE7BBDCBBDCBBE7BBE7BBF2BBE7BBE7BBE7BBDCBBFEBBF2BBFEBBF2BBF2BBF2BBFEBBE7BBF2BBE7BBE7[continued...]\nmaxValuesSerializedSMP: BC15BC09BC15BC09BC09BC15BC09BC15BC15BC09BC09BC20BC20BC15BC15BC20BC20BC20BC2CBC20BC20BC20BC15BC20BC09[continued...]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Somewhere it mentions 1 decimal place which made me think fixed point or <code>bcd</code>.</p>\n<p>Does anyone recognize this encoding, are there any keywords that might help me in the right direction?\nAre there any resources that I could look at that may help.\nIf there are any relevant tags please either add them or let me know.</p>\n<p>Things I have already tried:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Big and little endian floats and ints (16bit) ( <code>h</code>, <code>H</code>, <code>e</code> in python struct module)</li>\n<li>BCD (<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/71626800/2121419\">from this answer on SO</a>) as well as reversed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Things that I have considered and not (completely) explored:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scaling the values but some of the range values in the header/metadata</li>\n<li>Some sort of operation using <code>LogicalDOUTOperation</code> from the metadata.</li>\n<li>What is SMP Encoding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Complete Data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pastebin.com/7xday1bf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Encoded Values</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pastebin.com/wEDmWr9V\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Actual Values</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>First 20 points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/M3fhJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Encoded Values\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/M3fhJ.png\"/></a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ERM47.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Actual Values\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ERM47.png\"/></a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Taking the encoded Value <code>X</code> and the actual value <code>Y</code>:\nthe following appears to hold: <code>AX+B = Y </code> where <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are <code>9/23000 = 0.00039130....</code> and <code>-18.79591...</code></p>\n</div>",
