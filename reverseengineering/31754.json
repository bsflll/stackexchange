            "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">That depends on the way how the developer of the app prevents editing of the field. Therefore I would first start by checking stackoverflow.com how to make a field non-editable (you may end up e.g. here: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/4297763/150978\">stackoverflow.com/q/4297763/150978</a>). Then check the app code if it uses this way of making the field non-editable and thus you know what to change. BTW: There was a very similar question yesterday: <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/q/31748/1848\">reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/q/31748/1848</a> If it wa screated by you please don't create a new account every day...</span>",

Find the address on smali code &amp; the class that calls for it, those should be the class that initializes the button, and from there you should be digging the code.\nYou must call that button resource to make it clickable/unclickable, for example look for setEnabled call around it.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Reference, try compiling the code with ProGuard obfuscation is turned off and analyze the smali code:-\n<a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-enable-disable-button-in-android/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-enable-disable-button-in-android/</a></p>\n</div>",
