    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Frequently when I use Radare2 I work mostly in hexadecimal. This means I'm constantly having to remember to type <code>0x</code> in front of addresses, which is different from the machine-language monitors I'm used to using. (I'm generally working with binaries for 8-bit systems, where decimal is rarely used when working in machine language.)</p>\n<p>Is there any way to set the default input radix to hexadecimal? I'd like to be able to type <code>s ff00</code> instead of <code>s 0xff00</code> at the command line, and <code>gff00</code> instead of <code>g0xff00</code> in visual mode.</p>\n<p>And if I can do this, how does one enter decimal numbers, should that be necessary, in this mode?</p>\n<p>Links to documentation are appreciated.</p>\n</div>",

To do so, you can modify the <code>libr/core/cmd_seek.c</code> file (which is responsible for handling seek command) as follows:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bnQsP.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"r2SeekHAck\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bnQsP.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>And then use <code>make</code> to compile the project. After this, you will get the feature you want (will also work with <code>g</code> in Visual Mode):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MKtGY.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"r2HexSeekHack\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MKtGY.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p>You can find the patch code below:</p>\n<pre><code>ut64 addr;\nif ((input[1] &gt;= '1' &amp;&amp; input[1] &lt;= '9') || (input[1] &gt;= 'a' &amp;&amp; input[1] &lt;= 'f'))\n{\n    char inputHex[strlen(input) + 1];\n    inputHex[0] = '0';\n    inputHex[1] = 'x';\n    int i = 2;\n    for (; i &lt; strlen(input) + 1; i++)\n        inputHex[i] = input[i - 1];\n    addr = r_num_math (core-&gt;num, inputHex);\n} \nelse\n     addr = r_num_math (core-&gt;num, input + 1);\n</code></pre>\n</div>",
