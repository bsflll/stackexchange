Is the disassembly incorrect? How do I interpret one single row?</p>\n<p><code>DCB \"0000000000000000 l    df *ABS*\",9,\"0000000000000000 gic.c\",0xA</code></p>\n<p>The row above doesn't seem to be continuous data even. How are the columns  (space/tab and comma separated) significant? I can locate the following column values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DCB</li>\n<li>0000000000000000</li>\n<li>1</li>\n<li>df</li>\n<li>*ABS*</li>\n<li>9</li>\n<li>0000000000000000</li>\n<li>gic.c</li>\n<li>0xA</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

If you press the <code>*</code> \"Define array\" key somewhere inside this, you will see it's indeed a single long array of bytes.</p>\n<p>The starting address is only repeated for your convenience. \"The\" address of a larger structure is in general the address of its first byte.</p>\n</div>",
