The dialog shown will allow you to select the register, the offset delta to add to the displacement, and the struct you want to apply.</p>\n<p>The dialog does some preparation work/struct analysis before showing up. If you have a large selection or a lot of structures it can take a while to appear, you just need to be patient. When you change the register/delta inside the dialog, the analysis needs to be updated, which again takes time. Placing the selection cursor over an occurrence of the register you want to change <em>before</em> calling up the dialog is a good idea.</p>\n</div>",
