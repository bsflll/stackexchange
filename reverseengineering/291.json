It looks like their using RS232 for serial communication (proper setup, right voltage), but I do not know the bus settings (speed, parity, etc.). Is there any way to determine the bus settings without brute force (trying everything)? </p>\n<p>I have a multimeter and an oscilloscope on my workbench.</p>\n</div>",
