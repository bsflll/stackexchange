It shouldn't be too difficult to sanity check the decrypted data to see if you are dealing with data in a reasonable range, or just meaningless bytes. Besides that, it sounded like you know some of the values to expect in the decrypted data. Nonetheless. We are talking about hypothetical situations here. In reality none of us have the time to spare to allow any modern algorithm to crack some of the more secure encryptions out there.</span>",
