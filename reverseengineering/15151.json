    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>A while back, on a <code>Linux</code> system, I found a strange binary being executed at seemingly random times with some strange arguments, briefly appearing in <code>ps</code>. There was nothing to be found at the usual suspect like <code>init.d</code>, <code>.bashrc</code> and <code>crontab</code>. I found where the binary was located, renamed it, and put a script it its place. The script displayed and passed through all the received arguments and recorded the time and the duration of the binary execution, as well as some <code>/proc</code> information. I was able to figure out what called it, when, and what were the arguments. What is the name of this <code>honeypotting</code>, <code>MITM</code> technique?</p>\n</div>",
