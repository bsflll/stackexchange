I analyze the new thread and at the end of that, it calls <code>RtlExitUserThread</code> and the thread is terminated.</p>\n<p>To visualize, you can consider the following:</p>\n<pre><code>  PUSH EAX                              ; dwCreationFlag = 0\n     .\n     .\n     .\n  CALL DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-28]           ; CreateRemoteThread\n     .\n  (lines which I would also like to analyze)\n</code></pre>\n<p>As I described, the new thread starts and it ends with a call to <code>RtlExitUserThread</code> but I would like to analyze the lines after the call to <code>RtlExitUserThread</code>.</p>\n<p>How can I go back to the main thread, because there was a lot of lines to analyze (after the call to <code>CreateRemoteThread</code>)?</p>\n</div>",
