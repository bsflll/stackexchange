    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am trying to decompile a Android ARM native binary using Hex-Rays IDA Pro. IDA detects the possible formats as </p>\n<ul>\n<li>ELF for ARM (Shared object)</li>\n<li>Binary file</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I choose ELF for ARM (Shared object), then it correctly decompiles and detect most of the standard functions like tan/sin/cos etc. But when I try to run the remote android debugger, I am getting the alert messages</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Input file is a dynamic library, it cannot be run by itself. Please specify the host application.</li>\n<li>The file can't be loaded by the debugger plugin. Please verify that the parameters are valid.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I select Binary file, then it is not decompiling correctly. Also remote android debugger option is not listed in debuggers list.</p>\n<p>I am able to execute the binary file directly on an Android ARM emulator.</p>\n<p>What am I doing wrong? How can I debug a ELF for ARM binary executable file with IDA pro?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I have already tried with <code>android_server</code> running on an AVD and a physical device. When I try to connect [ELF for ARM (Shared object)], I can see the following output in <code>android_server</code></p>\n<pre><code>=========================================================\n[7] Accepting connection from 127.0.0.1...\n[7] Closing connection from 127.0.0.1...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Are all ARM binary executables detected as shared object? Or is my executable file being misidentified as a <code>.so</code> file?</p>\n</div>",

This allows you to pass the shared library as an argument and allow it to be \"run\" via IDA Pro. Hopefully this solves your issue.</p>\n</div>",
