To set the break point where it writes <strong>Incorrect password.</strong> I need to run the program first. But after it prints the password is incorrect, it closes, and when I click Debug&gt;Restart it deletes the break point.</p>\n<p>So, how can I fix this?</p>\n<p>I am using OllyDbg 2</p>\n</div>",

It's because it supports x86 architecture, while C# program is compiled to Common Intermediate Language which is not x86 assembly. You can rewrite it in C++ an everything should be fine.
