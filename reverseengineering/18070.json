This exe file is gui based and does not support command line execution. </p>\n<p>So my requirement is to create a program which loads this dll and use the funciton to decode an input file so that I can use this program in some scripts.</p>\n<p>The exe expects two inputs. Source file name and destination file name.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PHUFk.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"exe parameters\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PHUFk.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>When I disassembled the exe, only 1 parameter is being passed to the dll function call, which is the source file name. <strong>I couldn't find how the destination file name is passed to the function.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SZQFY.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"dll function call in exe\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SZQFY.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Disassembly of dll function shows 2 exported functions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kf6ub.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"dll exports\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kf6ub.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>assembly code for dll function from IDA is as follows</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yZhLo.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"convert2\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yZhLo.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>While calling the dll function from exe, the stack is as follows</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PXbnp.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"stack during function call\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PXbnp.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>From this I understood that the a pointer to the source file name is passed as the argument.
