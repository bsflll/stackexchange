Also, I think that the two QWORD are either from longs or characters. I'm guessing that the jne jump is probably a conditional statement, but I'm not too sure. It looks like the function is recursive since it has a line that calls \"bar\" again. </p>\n<p>My guess for the overall function is that it takes two longs and recursively adds them (Fibonacci, maybe?). I don't have much reasoning for this guess though, and I could be incorrect. </p>\n<p>Could anyone please help me solve this problem? Or, if there's a way for me to pass in parameters (I don't even know what kind of argument the function takes) and see the output, then I can try to backtrack and figure out what the program is doing. </p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n</div>",
