Please <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/posts/33331/edit\">edit</a> your question to add links to any documentation (descriptions, images, whatever you have) of the board and the sensors. -- What did you try for now? Did you record raw data or waves? Did you start to draw a (partial) schematic? What kind of device uses this board for what purpose?</span>",
