I have no trouble solving them, but I have come across something that I do not understand and it irks me.</p>\n<p>I have a function call to, in this example, <strong>sub_80484B4</strong>. The caller is <strong>sub_8048542</strong>. It pushes to values on the stack, (<strong>arg_4</strong> and <strong>num</strong>). However, As you can see in the disassembly of <strong>sub_80484B4</strong>, it only shows one argument, <strong>arg_4</strong>.</p>\n<p>What happened to <strong>num</strong>? Is Ida just saying <strong>arg_4</strong> only because <strong>num's</strong> value is not referenced in the callee?</p>\n<p>I use Radare2 and it showed the same thing. Am I missing something or are the tools just simplifying?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0USWi.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Caller pushes two values onto stack\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0USWi.png\"/></a><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/zLRc7.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Callee shows one argument\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/zLRc7.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
