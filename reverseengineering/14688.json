As it shows in attached picture, I have provided the before and after sections of file. In patched file, a new subroutine is added in a cave, and then it branches to an existing subroutine that has changed to an instruction.</p>\n<p>My question is, how do you recreate such a patch? I know how to edit bytes in IDA, but not sure how to add new ones.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DHFS2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DHFS2.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
