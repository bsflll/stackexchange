As i'm using Ubuntu, my arm assembler is $ndk-root/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.6/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-as; on windows, i'd assume a .exe file should be in a similar location. My answer to <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/9094/offset-calculation-for-branch-instruction-in-arm/9096#9096\">this question</a> shows how to use arm-as and arm-objdump to get the hex bytes quickly.</p>\n</div>",
