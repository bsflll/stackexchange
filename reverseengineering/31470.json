Afterwards the certificate verification will work unless the app uses cert/key pinning.</p>\n<p>Alternatively you can use anti-SSL/TLS verification/pinning scripts included in <a href=\"https://github.com/sensepost/objection\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Objection</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to develop a script yourself it is easier to hook the <code>javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager</code> method <code>checkServerTrusted</code> and replace it with an empty method.</p>\n</div>",

When I try to establish a connection with a python script, the server drops the connection. As I understand it, the problem is the lack of a certificate. I am trying to read the certificate that is in the <code>trustManagerArr</code> variable.</span>",

For selecting a client certificate (and key) an implementation of <code>KeyManager</code> respectively <code>X509ExtendedKeyManager</code> is responsible in plain Java/Android HTTPS connection. The TrustManager is only responsible for verifying the server certificate.</span>",

Therefore it is crucial to identify when the connection is closed. If the handshake is successfully completed, a missing client certificate is very unlikely an issue.</span>",
