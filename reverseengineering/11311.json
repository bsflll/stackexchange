The latter is used by the Windows PE loader such that if the flag is set then the pages for that section are marked as executable in memory (via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit</a>).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>can we consider a section with at least one of those two as definitely containing code?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not <strong>always</strong>, no.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Generally, what is the criterion by which to decide whether a PE section contains code or not?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the <code>.text</code>/<code>.code</code> sections will <em>usually</em> contain code, and a section with the <code>IMAGE_SCN_MEM_EXECUTE</code> flag will <em>usually</em> contain code, the only real way to say that a section definitely contains code is if the CPU actually executes code in that section at runtime.</p>\n</div>",
