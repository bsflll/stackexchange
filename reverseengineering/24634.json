Failing to figure out how to fix the error.</p>\n<p>I am in the early stages of analyzing a firmware update for a consumer router. Busybox is included with the firmware and I am trying to see what I can run with it in an emulated environment. </p>\n<p>I see that a version of the uClibc library is included with the firmware: <code>/lib/ld-uClibc-0.9.29.so</code></p>\n<p>I tried symlinking ld-uClibc-0.9.29.so to ld-uClibc.so.0 but I receive <code>ln: failed to create symbolic link 'ld-uClibc.so.0': Operation not permitted</code> so my understanding of the symbolic linking process in this context is certainly coming up short.</p>\n<p>How can I get qemu-mipsel-static to recognize the library? Do I need to install a different library?</p>\n</div>",

By default symbolic linking is not enabled on a shared folder as the host OS might not be able to understand a symbolic link.
