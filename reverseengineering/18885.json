If you would like a great example of use cases to see both in action (individually and together), consider the following workshop: <a href=\"https://www.begin.re/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Reverse Engineering for Beginners</a> (specifically, <a href=\"https://www.begin.re/hacking-minesweeper\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the final section</a> regarding hacking Minesweeper)</p>\n</div>",

Actually, it isn't maintained any more (or is it?) while IDA is actively maintained. One real advantage over IDA, however, is that OllyDbg is freeware while IDA is a commercial application and its freeware version lacks debugging capabilities.</p>\n</div>",
