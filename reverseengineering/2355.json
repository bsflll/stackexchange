Just attach the debugger to the process and do <code>!chkimg &lt;module&gt;</code>. It will download a clean copy of the module from the symbol server and compare it, reporting on differences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://community.websense.com/blogs/securitylabs/archive/2010/04/29/analyzing-malwares-using-microsoft-tools.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">This article</a> has an example of the output you can expect to see when something has modified a binary.</p>\n</div>",
