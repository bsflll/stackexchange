Why; because I want to learn C# :). Second thing; It is related to RCE because I'm \"patching\" an offset adress rather than modifying the original code.. maybe I should have put it in the main stackoverflow forum but I taught it belong to this forum.</span>",

This works well if the CLASS files aren't obfuscated or overly complex.</li>\n<li>As you answered in your question, you could extract the CLASS, hex edit it to make your changes, and add it back into the JAR with a tool like WinZip, WinRAR, or 7-zip.</li>\n<li>Use the Java Virtual Machine Tools Interface to dynamically patch the program at runtime.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unclear from your question what this has to do with C#, though.</p>\n</div>",
