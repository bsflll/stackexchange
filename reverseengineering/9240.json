This would bring up a list of functions called from the main module. You can the set a logging breakpoint on all the functions. The disadvantage of this approach is that dynamically resolved function calls cannot not be intercepted.\n<img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VOfDV.png\"/></p></li>\n<li><p>Search for <em>Name in all modules</em>. Next set logging breakpoints on all exported entries. Disadvantage of this approach is that there will be a lot of false positives such as when a function from <em>kernel32</em> calls into another function in <em>ntdll</em>, it will be logged too. To clear the false positives you can use a conditional logging breakpoint to check if the return address is within the ranges of the main module. \n<br/><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HSWXW.jpg\"/></p></li>\n<li><p>Use a dedicated tool for this purpose like <a href=\"http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">API Monitor</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nektra.com/products/spystudio-api-monitor/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SpyStudio</a> etc. If you use the SpyStudio, be sure to check out the <a href=\"http://whiteboard.nektra.com/trace-an-application-from-startup\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">docs</a>.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
