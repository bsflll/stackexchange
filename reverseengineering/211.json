    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>In Windows Store application development for Windows 8, there is a class called remoteSettings that lets a developer store batches of data so that the user will have access to it across several machines, as long as they are logged in with the same account. </p>\n<p>I hooked up WireShark and discovered that the packet is stored in Azure, and is secured with TLS. I would like to MITM myself so that I can decrypt the packet and see if the data in encrypted on Azure.</p>\n<p>I obviously don't have the private key for Azure, so I'd like to know if anyone has an idea on how to accomplish that MITM analysis.</p>\n</div>",

I'm not sure whether the Windows store respects the proxy settings or whether it has a pinned certificate. If it does respect the proxy settings, which it should, and it doesn't have a pinned certificate you should be able to trivially man-in-the-middle it with Fiddler.</p>\n<p>If the data isn't HTTPS and the cerificate isn't pinned, one option is to proxy the secure connection using <a href=\"http://www.gomor.org/bin/view/GomorOrg/SslNetcat\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SSLNetcat</a>. What you do is that you change your hosts file so that the Store executable connects to SSLNetcat running locally, then you set up SSLNetcat such that it uses a cerificate for which you have the private key. Then you either just have SSLNetcat forward the data directly to a program of your choice or enter the private keys into Wireshark and use it to sniff the traffic.</p>\n<p>If the data isn't HTTPS, if the cerificate in the binary is pinned and not stored in a file, you can either patch the Windows Store executable and replace the certificate with your own for which you have the private key. OpenSSL should be able to generate a replacement certificate for you easily. This private key can then be entered into Wireshark which will then decrypt the traffic.</p>\n<p>You're fairly close to copy protection territory so you might run into a number of complications.</p>\n</div>",

It complicates matters a bit since you're more likely to run into pinned certificates, self verifying executables and even kernel level integrity checks. I'm unfamiliar with the Microsoft Store so I can't advice further than generalizations.</span>",

For many Windows applications (including IE), this happens in <code>lsass.exe</code> in the following function (taken from Win7 SP1 32-bit):</p>\n<pre><code>Caller:  ncrypt!_Tls1ComputeMasterKey@32+0x57 \nEIP:     ncrypt!_PRF@40+0x11a\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can then decrypt the captured packets after the fact in Wireshark by setting <code>(Pre)-Master-Secret log filename</code> in the SSL preferences to a file file that looks like:</p>\n<pre><code>RSA Session-ID:87492B3586DE289FAE1598B0A19CC7BCCB69371993F2C0DF32438034E06FE3FB\nMaster-Key:F58C0EFA2BF87602646B318400DFEB0C8CCDE59408C9F13C6D923F6208743BD34EA8BA17BCE02B9BD8DFED5A58036068\n</code></pre>\n<p>The session ID here can be found in the TLS headers (unencrypted) for the stream you're interested in. (Don't be fooled by the RSA -- this works for all TLS connections regardless of the ciphersuite in use.)</p>\n<p>The advantage of this method is that, since you're not doing a man in the middle, the client application doesn't have to trust your CA, which is especially handy if you're trying to reverse some malware that actually does crypto right.</p>\n<p>The downside is that you need to be able to debug <code>lsass.exe</code>, which can be tricky; there's some information on how to do that <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/alejacma/how-to-debug-lsass-exe-process\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>",
