By default BinDiff will automagically match functions, and then only output the comparison score between the function matches that it finds.</p>\n<p>I have an a priora candidate function match <code>[func_i from database A, func_j from database B]</code> and I want to get the BinDiff comparison score of this pair.</p>\n<p>Bonus points if this can be batched and run from the command line, where I can provide a list of function pairs and get the BinDiff comparison score for each pair.</p>\n</div>",
