    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to make a website that displays the feedback from the Windows 10 Feedback Hub but i have met a roadblock. I'm using Fiddler 4 (Fiddler Everywhere doesn't have support for UWP yet and WireShark didn't give me much data) to see the requests being sent to Microsoft's servers.\nI have tracked down that the request that receives the feedbacks is the following:</p>\n<pre><code>GET https://uif.microsoft.com/FeedbackCloudService.svc/feedbacks?&amp;language=en-US&amp;sortCategory=0&amp;searchCategory=1&amp;feedbacksFilter=0&amp;issueFilter=0&amp;statusFilter=0&amp;buildFilter=0&amp;userFilter=1&amp;filterFormFactor=1&amp;isRefresh=False&amp;hasSticky=False&amp;useCol=1 HTTP/1.1\n</code></pre>\n<p>But this request require a Bearer token (not JWT) which changes each day. The token is never being received from any of the previous requests sent what i can gather so I assume it's being generated locally in the app. Example of what that token can look like:</p>\n<pre><code>Bearer t=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&amp;p=\n</code></pre>\n<p>So now I wonder if there's any way to crack open the Feedback Hub app and see how this token is being generated or where it's getting it from. I know pretty much nothing about RE and especially not about UWP RE since it's not dotnet so I can't use dotPeek on it or similar.\nAny help would be appreciated!</p>\n</div>",

Maybe you'll find something useful there (like network related libraries, etc). Another option may be searching for some unique strings like \"FeedbackCloudService.svc\" inside the .exe or one of its dependencies (dlls). Also, I think static analysis (with ghidra or ida) could be helpful, too</span>",
