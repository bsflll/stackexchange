    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main() {\n\n    int number1, number2, sum;\n\n    printf(\"Enter two integers: \");\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &amp;number1, &amp;number2);\n\n    \n    sum = number1 + number2;\n\n    \n    printf(\"%d + %d = %d\", number1, number2, sum);\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So this is my simple C code and it has only three variables only but when I'm debugging it in disassembly the value of <code>eax</code> is also copying in other 'variable looked' like r/m32 addresses, I can't figure out why it is doing this. It can't be compiler generated code because I've switched off those options.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Ba6XC.png\"/></p>\n<p>Here's the starting disassembly see the value of <code>eax</code> is going to variables (<code>sum</code>, <code>number2</code>, <code>number1</code>) but why it is going to <code>[ebp-18h]</code> and so on. Also these <code>[ebp-18h]</code> is not used in any other place in disassembly. It's just shown here.\nAnd other question is why <code>0CCCCCCCCC</code> is moved into <code>eax</code>.</p>\n</div>",

Yes, these are variables on the stack and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">magic number</a> in EAX is used to denote uninitialized values. Quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>CCCCCCCC</code> Used by Microsoft's C++ debugging runtime library and many DOS environments to mark uninitialized stack memory. CC resembles the opcode of the INT 3 debug breakpoint interrupt on x86 processors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So in all likelihood you built a debug configuration with MSVC.</p>\n</div>",

Also in the past it likely would have caused the debugger to trip upon uninitialized data on the stack which happened to be executed in error cases (the last part is more or less a guess from me).</span>",
