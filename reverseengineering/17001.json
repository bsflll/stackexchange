I'm thinking about extracting what it contains - probably binaries - and use <code>strings</code>, <code>grep</code> and a couple of automated github/bitbucket/etc. searches to identify potential GPL violations.</p>\n<p>I know this approach is very limited, that's why I'm looking for advices and/or existing tools that could be relevant?</p>\n</div>",

It can allow you to analyze an embedded device for bugs, vulnerabilities, or GPL violations without ever having access to the device.
