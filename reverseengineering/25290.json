    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to break execution when a string is loaded in memory.</p>\n<p>I can´t find the string by using the <code>search for -&gt; string references</code></p>\n<p>So I press <code>Alt + M</code> and press <code>Ctrl + B</code> to search my string once is loaded, I can see it.\nI try to right click on the address and set a hardware breakpoint but the software closes as soon as that string is shown so it doesn't break on the next run.</p>\n<p>How can I set a condition so if a string appears a break happens?</p>\n<p>I tried <code>shift + F4</code> like with ollydbg and then I try to create an expression like this <code>UNICODE[EAX] == \"myString\"</code> but it says <code>invalid expression...</code></p>\n<p>I also tried the same expression using traceInto, but it definitely is not matching for the string, because I can't see it int he dump and even if I compare with a huge string, it doesn't do anything at all.</p>\n<p>Any suggestions or ideas?</p>\n</div>",
