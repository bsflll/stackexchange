    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>As the title stands, I want to label local variables ([ebp - x] addresses) the same way I do with functions and global variables. What I've learned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I found no way to label locals in the debugger window.</li>\n<li>There's <code>Locals</code> tab in the bottom panel. I can give names to locals there, but they don't propagate to the main window.</li>\n<li>I can rename variables in the decompiler window, but again, they don't sync with the debugger window.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If x64dbg lacks this functionality, is there any plugin that achieves this?</p>\n</div>",
