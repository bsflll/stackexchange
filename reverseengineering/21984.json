Are\n  <code>DLLEntryPoint</code> and <code>DLLMain</code> similar functions for Dlls?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is almost correct. <code>Start</code> <em>is</em> the symbolic name of the entry point in this case, true. However, whether it performs some kind of initialization depends entirely on the library. I wager IDA has recognized some runtime library (such as the Visual C++ runtime) by way of a FLIRT signature and used that information to point out <code>DllMain</code> to you.</p>\n<p>Conceptually <code>DLLEntryPoint</code> and <code>DLLMain</code> mirror what you found for <code>.exe</code> files, yes.</p>\n</div>",
