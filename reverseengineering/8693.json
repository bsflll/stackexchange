Can somebody enlighten me ? Or show some source to read and learn what is exactly going on here ?</p>\n<p>OK I have managed to solve this problem by clicking right, then Analysis then Remove object scan for module. I think Olly is misinterpreted the code for some reason, even if I did not understand why this solved my problem. Anyway If there is somebody to explain why Olly did this, is welcomed.</p>\n</div>",

When I open the program and not run yet, Ollydbg still could not give correct instructions, If my problem was related to that post I should have faced this when the program is running, am I wrong ?? Also I have opened program with static analysis tool other than ollydbg it shows all instructions clearly.</span>",
