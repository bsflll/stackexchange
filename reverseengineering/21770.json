Basically, there are multiple people who set their profiles to <em>public</em>, allowing search engines such as Google to index them. If you initiate an anonymous browsing session and search for a profile, you will get a page that looks like this:</p>\n<p>(example for <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/parag-agrawal-5a14742a\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/parag-agrawal-5a14742a</a>)\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1k3mE.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"public profile screenshot\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1k3mE.png\"/></a>\nIf you try repeatedly, however, or if you test an automation software such as selenium for accessing these profiles, you will after a while be redirected to an authwall page, and no more public profiles will be visible to you. </p>\n<p>I have already tried to hide all kinds of fingerprintable data, such as IP, user agent, screen resolution (for canvas fingerprinting), but after a few requests, my access limit drops to one single public profile. I guess they make an analysis of the request pattern within their servers, making my section identifiable. </p>\n<p>I would like to know which features are observed to determine whether a visitor is human or not, and how could I simulate human behavior. </p>\n</div>",
