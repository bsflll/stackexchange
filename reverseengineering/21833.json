    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>There are some images hidden somewhere in a PE I have, I can't figure out how to extract them. </p>\n<p>This PE is from around 1997 (I think it's 32 bit) and I believe it contains some 3D model renders from the game Shadow Warrior as .PICT files. Using PE Explorer, I was able to see the section headers: [![Headers][1]][1]\nHowever, I see no way to actually unpack the data.</p>\n<p>Any help would be appreciated</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT3:</strong> I am now almost certain that all the images are actually stored within this file: <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/4rmr0e545a8vova/GW_SW.MPL?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/4rmr0e545a8vova/GW_SW.MPL?dl=0</a>\nIt's a MPL file, which usually doesn't hold images, but looking at file sizes, it seems to be the only likely candidate.</p>\n<p>I believe the program is supposed to extract and uncompress some audio and picture from inside this MPL, but I have no idea how to do that myself.</p>\n<p>The program only runs under old operating systems, so if there was a way to take the images out of memory as the program was uncompressing, I don't think I can do that here on my newer pc. However, I do have access to a few DLL files that I can extract from the START.EXE.</p>\n</div>",
