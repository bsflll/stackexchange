    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I am attempting to reverse a .NET 7 program and patch it, but it is a bundled file.</p>\n<p>When importing the EXE into dnSpy I get the headings of a PE file (.text, etc.) and nothing else. However, if I start debugging the EXE I can see all of the DLLs that are loaded, including the main module the application is using (program is \"cracktest.exe\" and the main module is \"cracktest.dll\".</p>\n<p>When modifying the module using dnSpy, I can save the DLL to my file system but I cannot get the application to use this new DLL.</p>\n<p>My question is how can I modify the \"cracktest.dll\" module and save it so that the program will use it?</p>\n<p>I have noticed this PR on dnSpy: <a href=\"https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy/pull/49\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy/pull/49</a> regarding bundled EXEs but it seems to be incomplete, are there other methods to achieving this, thanks.</p>\n</div>",
