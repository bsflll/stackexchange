    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm trying to figure out how this old game is (de)compressing files, but I don't have much knowledge about file compression.\nI tried running the game from a debug tool to see if I could spot something in the assembly, but that's way over my head..Also tried Ghidra but didn't bring me any closer. I can pinpoint roughly in the gmae code where it's reading file headers and starting allocating memory/decompressing, but what actually happens is a mystery.</p>\n<p>The smallest compressed file is just 5kb, I uploaded it here: <a href=\"https://ufile.io/scibn9hp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://ufile.io/scibn9hp</a></p>\n<p>The game is from 1996. Can anyone point me in the right direction for learning this stuff? Should I try understanding the program, or is it possible to understand the compression by just messing with the file?</p>\n</div>",

Examining the file in a hex editor, you can see <code>CWE sprite</code> in the file header - I Googled that and found this: <a href=\"https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=21665\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=21665</a> - might be a start.</span>",
