Sorry not sure if my terminology is correct but I have a reference in my file \"fp\" that is the memory offset and is shown like</p>\n<pre><code>ld24    fp, #0x808000\n</code></pre>\n<p>all of the references in the file show something like,</p>\n<pre><code>lduh    R0, @(-0x2700, fp)\n</code></pre>\n<p>which make it difficult to link the memory addresses. If I press Ctrl-R I can correct these offsets in the file line by line but I would like a script that can do the whole file in one go if possible.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yjDR7.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yjDR7.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>this gives me what I am looking for</p>\n<pre><code>lduh    R0, @((unk_805900 - unk_808000), fp)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Any help would be appreciated, thanks</p>\n</div>",
