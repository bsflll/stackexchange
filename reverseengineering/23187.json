    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>When I press \"G\" in the CPU view of the debugger I often get the following screen:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QAe3U.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Use Graph command or menu action to draw control flow graph here...\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QAe3U.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>In what cases can this error message happen? Obviously I can't yet give an exact way to reproduce it, I'm curios what to look for next time when I encounter such an issue. Is it from my side because I did not enable or did not care about something? </p>\n<p>Do you also sometime encounter such a message?</p>\n</div>",
