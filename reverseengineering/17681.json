    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Found a WP site (not mine) with lovely obfuscated code injected into the footer so I've been trying to de-obfuscate it.</p>\n<p>I ran it through <a href=\"http://matthewfl.com/unPacker.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">unpacker</a>, then <a href=\"https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">converted hex to ASCII,</a> then un-minified to bring back line breaks and wound up with something someone like me can actually kind of recognize as javascript:</p>\n<pre><code>var _0x1386=[\"$ = ~[]; \n$ = {\n    2: ++$,\n    $$$$: (![] + \"\")[$],\n    1 $: ++$,\n    $0$0: (![] + \"\")[$],\n    0 $0: ++$,\n    $0$$: ({} + \"\")[$],\n    $$0$: ($[$] + \"\")[$],\n    0 $$: ++$,\n    $$$0: (!\"\" + \"\")[$],\n    $1: ++$,\n    $0$: ++$,\n    $$1: ({} + \"\")[$],\n    $$0: ++$,\n    $$$: ++$,\n    $2: ++$,\n    $1$: ++$\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then followed some of the instructions of <a href=\"https://blog.korelogic.com/blog/2015/01/12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this dude who analyzed very similar javascript</a>.</p>\n<p>After doing so, this is where I'm at:</p>\n<pre><code>$ = -1; \n$ = {\n    2: 0, \n    $$$$: \"f\",\n    1 $: 1,\n    $0$0: \"a\",\n    0 $0: 2,\n    $0$$: \"j\", \n    $$0$: \"d\",\n    0 $$: 3,\n    $$$0: \"e\", \n    $1: 4,\n    $0$: 5,\n    $$1: \"t\",\n    $$0: 6,\n    $$$: 7,\n    $2: 8,\n    $1$: 9\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>**I'm specifically stuck (I think) lines in the $ object that have an integer and then space in the property name. ** Also, the hex alphabet wouldn't include \"j\" or \"t\" if I'm not mistaken, so maybe I am evaluating those expressions incorrectly?</p>\n<p>Grateful for any bones thrown my way. I know it's a rube question that shares some in common with existing questions about deobfuscation, but it's not a duplicate question - I'm just a guy trying to learn Javascript and coding a little better by way of this exercise.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n</div>",
