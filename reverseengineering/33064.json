    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>In fastcall functions, the callee cleans the stack and returns the value in eax. This completes the function call.And actually we put first two arguments in ecx and edx, still caller cleans stack 8 bytes.</p>\n<p>I wonder why happens that way. We put the datas into registers not stack? Am i right?</p>\n<p>How is it possible cleaning registers that way?</p>\n<p>Example Code:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n\nint __fastcall TestFunction(int num1, int num2, int num3, int num4, int num5)\n{\n    int nSum = 0;\n    nSum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5;\n    return nSum;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    int nSum = 0;\n    nSum = TestFunction(10, 20, 30, 40, 50);\n    printf(\"Result: %d\", nSum);\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><img alt=\"Assembly version of example code\" src=\"https://tufan-gungor.github.io/assets/img/calling_conventions/Untitled%203.png\"/></p>\n</div>",

The add esp 8 belongs to printf argument 1 format string , 2 value passed to format  the tegisters ecx and edx are not cleared by that instruction.</span>",
