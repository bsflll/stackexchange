    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm attempting to use a legacy systems recovery feature that typically required calling/faxing a company that is no longer around. </p>\n<p>Basically, the system was designed to go into a recovery mode and it provided a 4 character code that was provided over phone/fax to the software company and they would provide you with what looks like a HEX code to gain access to the system. </p>\n<p>I've been playing around with my limited knowledge on the subject for a little while now and have made zero progress. The system does run on a local server so maybe there are some decompilers or other processes that can be recommended? (Tomcat Based Webserver)</p>\n<p>The Username is Administrator, below are 4 records from previous resets. Looks like MD4  or MD5 Hash to me.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Recover Code - Recovery Password</p>\n<p>C969 - CF45FE53C10C541D831BB00A88C2497E </p>\n<p>H924 - 4A90846DBA0DC78EFEC6FAB389D4DD97 </p>\n<p>B939 - D960D76B1BA23E1AC872A289CB1DD15D </p>\n<p>I996 - 0DF5117F8731CE4C4C65D383C77BD97E</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The other details:</p>\n<p>Windows XP \"Server\"</p>\n<p>Full file system administrative access</p>\n<p>URL <a href=\"http://localhost/recoverymode=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://localhost/recoverymode=true</a></p>\n</div>",
