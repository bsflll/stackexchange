    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I have a set of equations in string format as given below. Need to assign some value to the left-hand side variable (In the below example: rsp, esp). Then have to calculate and store the results on the right-hand side variable (i.e., rax, esp, rsp).</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p><code>rax = rsp</code></p>\n<p><code>esp = esp - 0x4</code></p>\n<p><code>rsp = rsp - 0x30</code></p>\n<p>Though I have used the <code>eval</code> function in python, it is throwing me an error message as it won't support <code>=</code>. Could someone please help me to find the answer?</p>\n</div>",
