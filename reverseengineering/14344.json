    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So here's the rundown:</p>\n<p>The files in themselves are .spc. Normally, you'd think this is a spectrum file, but it's a custom file made by the developer themselves. It contains an image that is used/will be used in the game, and me and a group is trying to figure out how to decode it. </p>\n<p>Here's things we've tried and know so far:</p>\n<p>-Initially, we thought that it was a PKSC7 certificate envelope. It was not, as it was a custom file. They were unpacked from a general .cpk file, which all games in the series have utilized.</p>\n<p>-The game in question is a PSVITA and PS4 (although our files are from the Vita version) game and is called New Danganronpa V3</p>\n<p>-We received info from a third party that does not want to share how to decompress the files. They were the ones that taught us the SPC file is NOT a certificate or spectrum file, and that the method to decompress it was backwards and strange, and was found out mostly by accident</p>\n<p>-We found out some strange stuff in hex files, but the most relevant information is that the .spc files are CPS., a little-endian compression method. According to some help we've found elsewhere in the internet, this is a big hint on how to decrypt said files - we've tried switching it to big-endian, but we haven't found much other than the hex data changes to be more coherent.</p>\n<p>-Other things we've found in the hexdata include stuff like filepaths (such as a thing called \"SPCpack\", a few things ending in .srdi and .srd, and -BEGIN CERTIFICATE- at the top of one. Here's an image: <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RQLHe.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"Hexdata with first three digits\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RQLHe.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>If the files themselves are needed, they are available here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mega.nz/#!6xtmgBzQ!RNfIUlC94bQs4YPTVD0GuMFTi3LfqeIMrKdaxqRtCp8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://mega.nz/#!6xtmgBzQ!RNfIUlC94bQs4YPTVD0GuMFTi3LfqeIMrKdaxqRtCp8</a></p>\n</div>",

Since the plain text strings are interrupted by other codes - see <code>chara?_black.b?mp</code> -, it probably is an LZ/ARC-like derivative (bytewise, rather than the more modern bitwise, compression).</span>",
