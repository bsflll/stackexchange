The general case is undecidable.</p>\n<p>If your program has not been compiled to be position-independant, there are probably some references to constant memory addresses. Especially as soon as you make a call to a function defined in an external library, the PLT/GOT mechanism uses known addresses. But if you can disassemble and analyze the program, you may fix them. But deciding whether an 32 bits word will be used as an address or as an integer is undecidable. It may work in simple programs, but don't expect to make it work on obfuscated programs without a lot of work.</p>\n<p>And I'm not aware of a tool doing that.</p>\n</div>",
