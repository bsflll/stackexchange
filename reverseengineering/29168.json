In my day long research, I learnt that I had to take apart the device and find JTAG and so on and then dump firmware and other code but I still feel some stuck and I posted another question if both of you could help me about this. Here is the question link : <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/29171/how-can-i-identify-jtag-in-this-case-and-utilize-it\" title=\"how can i identify jtag in this case and utilize it\">reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/29171/â€¦</a></span>",

For example I had firmware from a previous device, it would print register context on crashes, I was able to find an exploit from the first to exploit the second, eventually dumping all memory through the crash info by repeating</span>",
