I actually feel like reversing flutter built apps did not get much reverse writeups on the community. one of the tools for the task <code>reflutter</code> which I used in this case failed because the <code>flutter</code> version built with the <code>apk</code> is not supported by the <code>reflutter</code>. so the author provided  <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/ptswarm/reflutter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">docker image</a> in which one allows to implement his own patches there is manual Flutter code change is supported using specially crafted Docker. but the environment variables passed there, included <code>HASH_PATCH=[Snapshot_Hash]</code> <code>COMMIT=[Engine_commit]</code>. in this case if I know the <code>snapshot Hash</code> from the <code>apk</code> how can I get the matching <code>Engine commit</code> for example in this case this is <code>Engine SnapshotHash: adb4292f3ec25074ca70abcd2d5c7251</code>, so how can I retrieve the matching <code>Engine Commit</code>?</p>\n</div>",
