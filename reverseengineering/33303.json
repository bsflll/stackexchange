    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I’m trying to repurpose a batch of small TFT screens salvaged from disposable vapes (1.8-inch, made by YIHUA TFT). I’ve searched for information on the display and the connector type but haven’t found much, so I’m hoping to get some guidance.</p>\n<p>The screen has a 10-pin FPC cable, 6.4 mm wide, and it connects using a press-in/snap-in connector, not the usual ZIF slide-in type. The ribbon cable reads YIHUA TFT YH-177RX6955C2. I’m attaching pictures of the display and the board it was connected to, including a close-up of the chip labeled “Notion,” which seems to be the display controller.</p>\n<p>I found this blog about something similar . <a href=\"https://ripitapart.com/category/disposable-vape-hacks/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This website</a> looks to be similar to what I'm trying to do. Just a different screen/connector. Mine might not be as difficult as this I think (possibly even more difficult)? But I could be wrong. Either way I believe I am on the right track.</p>\n<p>What I’ve Tried:</p>\n<p>Searches for YIHUA TFT and YH-177RX6955C2 didn’t yield any specific datasheets or specs.</p>\n<p>I looked into ZIF and FFC connectors, but this one seems different (more like a direct press-fit type).</p>\n<p>I plan to interface it with an Arduino or ESP32, assuming it might use a standard protocol like SPI, but I’m unsure where to start without a pinout.</p>\n<p>Questions:</p>\n<p>Can anyone help confirm the type of FPC connector this is?</p>\n<p>Does anyone have experience with YIHUA TFT displays or similar press-fit connectors?</p>\n<p>Are there recommended steps for testing unknown TFT displays with a microcontroller?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DdmHuRA4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"image1\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DdmHuRA4.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/26Q9GulM.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"image2\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/26Q9GulM.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UmJQsQtE.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"image3\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UmJQsQtE.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0klp3hKC.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"image4\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0klp3hKC.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZL32ChTm.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"image5\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZL32ChTm.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oJRs9qA4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"image6\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oJRs9qA4.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2d4QK3M6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"image7\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2d4QK3M6.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

Please do not add new information in comments, this is not a forum. Please <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/posts/33303/edit\">edit</a> your question to enhance it. -- What does your research on the assumed MCU reveal? And you could re-engineer the connections of the connector's pins to find supply lines and communicatoin lines. Then can happen with partial disassembly, as you have multiple of the devices.</span>",
