    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I was doing a CTF challenge and I need to see the value of RAX register in radare2.\nI first dumped all of printable ascii characters as input, one of the function encoded the input and spit out the result into RAX registers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XrPoS.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XrPoS.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Each integer separated by space represents one character. The problem is it cut shorts at the 52th character (... 1248 1264 12) where is my input has 94 characters.\nIn GDB you can do <code>set print elements 0 </code> to remove the output limit. Is there such thing in radare? How can I print the entire register value in string?</p>\n</div>",
