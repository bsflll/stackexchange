If I have an ARM disassembly loaded, the debugger menu is shown and I can work with the options and start QEMU. The failure point is \"cpu tricore\" since if I change it to \"cpu arm\" and load an arm disassembly, the debugger menu appears and through the debugger options I can see my new entry. I just cannot get the menu to appear when a Tricore disassembly is loaded. I have tried cpu name as TRICORE and other variants including the actual CPU type, but the IDA Pro equivalent to \"arm\" is \"tricore\" as a CPU type. </p>\n<pre><code>.TRICORE_test\nname       QEMU: TRICORE\ncpu        tricore\narea       DATA RAM     0x80000000:0xDFFFFFFF\narea       IO   SYSREGS 0xF0000000:0xFFFFFFFF\ninitial_sp 0x08000000\n\ncmdline    \"$(QEMUPATH)/qemu-system-tricore\" $(QEMUFLAGS) -M tricore_testboard -kernel \"%e\"\n</code></pre>\n</div>",

It appears that QEMU added Tricore support after IDA added QEMU support for other CPUs, but an IDA user cannot enable it for Tricore? I could write a plug in using the instruction set simulator from Infineon to enhance static disassembly.</span>",
