This is obviously the reason the strings you defined are there.</p>\n<p>Although your code does not <em>directly</em> define any constructs except those few string literals, the <code>.rodata</code> section will hold all data deemed <em>globally scoped</em> and <em>read-only</em> by the compiler and linker, regardless of whether it was defined in your code or an additional variable/object your program uses explicitly or implicitly.</p>\n<p><strong>Now to your question;</strong> I mentioned additional objects can be explicitly and implicitly defined in your code, without you actually writing them. One explicit example is all the code <code>#include</code>ed in your program (<code>cstdio</code> in this case). Code implicitly included in your program is, for example, the code GCC adds that wraps and calls your defined <code>main</code> function and handles different operating system interfaces (setting up functions related stdin, stderr, stdout) as well as set up and teardown of program objects (that code is where globally scoped objects are initialized by calling their constructor in C++).</p>\n<p>Although this is explained in depth in the linked answer, the actual values (<code>1</code> and <code>2</code>) appear to be for a constant defined by GCC's <a href=\"http://repo.or.cz/glibc.git/blob/HEAD:/csu/init.c#l24\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>init.c</code></a>:</p>\n<pre><code>const int _IO_stdin_used = 0x20001;\n</code></pre>\n<p>That file is part of GCC's initialization code mentioned above, and is used to control the version of a input/output library GCC implements input/output in programs with.</p>\n<p><em>it's worth noting that an hex-dump will help increase confidence in whether that is indeed the reason for the additional bytes you're seeing, as well as following the compilation and linking process, of course</em></p>\n<p>A difference worth mentioning between your example and the one in the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34733136/why-static-string-in-rodata-section-has-a-four-dots-prefix-in-gcc\">SO question</a> if the 14 zero bytes, which are of course padding to a boundary of 16 bytes, which is something compilers often do to optimize for execution time. <s>Replacing the <code>-O3</code> with <code>-Os</code> (optimize for size) will probably drop the 14 null bytes, although that is not guaranteed and may depend on the version of GCC you're using.</s></p>\n</div>",
