    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm new to the science of reverse engineering. I recently downloaded <strong><em>immunity debugger 1.85 32bit Assembler-Level Debugger</em></strong>. My host machine is <strong><em>Windows 7 64 bit</em></strong>. I have <strong><em>python 2.7 installed as 32 bit image</em></strong> and <strong><em>MSVCR90.dll</em></strong> in pythons install directory. Whenever I execute the pycommands I get a MSCVR90.dll runtime error R6034. Does this debugger work on 64 bit host? If so what can I do to correct this runtime error? </p>\n<p>Your advice is really appreciated... </p>\n</div>",
