    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>So I have a Royal DS 2260. It's an ancient \"digital organizer\" from the late 90s.</p>\n<p>It has a 2.5mm headphone jack that can be used to either send/receive data to and from other digital organizers and (using a special serial cable) connect to a \"wintel\" pc where it's contents can be synced to/from the device.</p>\n<p>Well, I'm not paying some scalper on ebay way to much for that serial cable, so I tried to make my own.</p>\n<p>But, it didn't work! But then, I got smart.</p>\n<p>I know, after reading some pages on the ticalc website about DIY link cables, that the 9 pin serial port can be used (much like the parallel port) as GPIO.</p>\n<p>So I realized that it's incredibly likely that this thing doesn't use the RX and TX pins, but instead the other pins on the DSUB connector that can be controlled by software.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have any information about using the 9 pin serial port on \"wintel\" computers as GPIO? Because I didn't find much of anything on google.</p>\n<p>Update: Yep, when the software enters sync mode, RTS changes from high to low.</p>\n</div>",
