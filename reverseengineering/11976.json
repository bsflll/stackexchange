Unless you want to detect a single specific file with no variant, don't do that. Now, I can tell you one history about \"some known AV vendor\" that will remain anonymous. Somebody at the top decided that MD5 was the \"future\" of AVs and, as so, decided to detect almost everything via MD5 hashes. 1 year later they received a call from Akamai because they had to pay +$1 million as the signature files grown too much, as well as the invoice from Akamai web servers because of the deployed file size... So, in short: no.</span>",

SHA1 and SHA256 are better in the sense that it is so much harder (but possible, as stated in the previous answer) to find collisions, that is to find different files that produce the same SHA hash.</p>\n<p>Lastly, hashing used for malware detection is a very bad approach since it is <em>easily</em> defeated (polymorphic malware, malware builders, etc).

Forget the fancy methods with hash collisions of my virus to a legitimate exectuable, it is much easier to circumvent all hash based Antiviruses.  </p>\n<p>The PE file format on windows and the ELF file format on Linux are used for executables (like .exe, .dll, .so, ...). Both formats specify the end of the file - everything after that is not parsed. That means an attacker can append random data and the file still runs like it did before.<br/>\nAppending random data however changes the hash. If the attacker sends a different file to every victim that means that you would need to get each and every single one of those file to flag it as malicious.</p>\n<p>And with some botnets having a million infected PCs that means you database would need to grow to that size - at which point you probably should search for another method of identification.</p>\n</div>",
