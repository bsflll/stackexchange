In 16-bit era, 32-bit numbers were represented by a pair of registers, in this case <code>ax:dx</code>. The check for 16 is an optimization: if the shift is over 16, the low register value is lost completely, so it can be discarded and replaced by <code>dx&gt;&gt;(shift-16)</code>, while the high register is filled with the sign bit as the result of the <code>cwd</code> instruction.

If <code>cl</code> larger than 16, move <code>dx</code> (upper 16 bit) into <code>ax</code> and convert it to a 32 bit number, subtract 16 from <code>cl</code> because this is implicitly done by ignoring the lower 16 bit, then shift the upper part (which is now <code>dx:ax</code> thanks to the <code>cwd</code>) by that number.</p>\n<p>I didn't try to understand the top part, but my assumption is it does exactly the same for shift widths below 16 bits.</p>\n<p>Basically, it's a 32 bit right shift done in 16 bit architecture.</p>\n</div>",
