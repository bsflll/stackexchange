But, if you are familiar with the specific file format, then writing a Loader is probably the best option.  There is a full chapter on Loader Modules in the (<a href=\"http://www.nostarch.com/idapro2.htm](IDA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">nostarch.com/idapro2.htm](IDA</a> Pro Book)</span>",

And there must be a processor module which will know how to dissemble the data loaded by loader plugin. Otherwise IDA will load the file as binary and that's it.</li>\n<li>even if you have loader + processor module, this doesn't mean you can debug it. You need a debugger module which will know how to load the initial binary file into device and the through some communication will run it step by step in the remote debugger.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Nintendo 3DS is ARM11, so there's a processor module in IDA. As for loader you'll have to search if somebody made one or implement it yourself. As for 3DS debugger plugin for IDA, I highly doubt it exists.</p>\n</div>",
