If the section table is corrupted or missing, this will fail. </p>\n<p>However, the section table is <a href=\"https://github.com/BR903/ELFkickers/tree/master/sstrip\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">not actually required</a> for a file to be executable by the OS, so it can be removed or modified without affecting the file's behavior. In such cases, you can use <code>-b binary -D</code> to tell <code>objdump</code> to disassemble <strong>all</strong> bytes in the file, ignoring any file structure. This will try to disassemble everything, including <em>file headers</em>, <em>data sections</em>, <em>string tables</em> etc. You will need to make sense out of the resulting disassembly by distinguishing actual code from nonsense produced by disassembling unrelated data. Alternatively, you can figure out the actual executable parts of the file and <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/6604/60\">disassemble just that</a>.</p>\n</div>",
