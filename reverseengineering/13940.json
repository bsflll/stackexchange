That would be a good place to start if you can get hold of it. Alternatively would it be possible to monitor the pins when the chips is in place and work out what values the control devices read from the EEPROM up to and including engine start? That might narrow down the candidates to try changing.</span>",

In some cases the data format may be obvious by just looking at it, but more often it won't be. Monitoring reads/writes as @Rup mentions may work in some cases but the only 100% reliable way IMO would be to RE the code (e.g. ECU/immobilizer firmware) which reads and writes this data to see how it's processed. </p>\n</div>",
