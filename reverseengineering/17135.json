    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Recently I got really interested in BIOS RE and I used <strong><em>chipsec</em></strong> to dump the content of SPI Flash ROM of my <strong>HP Omen</strong> Desktop PC to start my journey. But unlike older BIOSes, the binary file was pretty huge (8.4 MB). </p>\n<p>The bios image is <strong>AMI A0.57 rev A</strong></p>\n<p>I have a couple of problems with this BIOS image:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>I can't disassemble it correctly. Using <strong><em>radare2</em></strong> with <em>-b flag</em>, I tried 16,32 and 64 but the file doesn't get disassembled correctly. </p></li>\n<li><p>Using <strong><em>UEFI Tool</em></strong>, it fails at parsing it correctly.</p></li>\n<li><p>I googled and google and google. There no resource to solve my problem.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><em>IDA Pro</em></strong> also treats the file as BIOS Image and uses one of its plugins <strong><em>bios_image.py</em></strong> to analyze the file but fails at some point with an error: Cannot relocate segment something at something (some addresses) because it overlap another segment.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then I thought maybe Chipsec has failed with dumping the SPI Flash and the file is corrupted but I downloaded the BIOS image from HP's website (ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp81501-82000/sp81781.exe) and the file is the exact same. So, I have no clue and I need help to start learning BIOS reverse engineering.</p>\n<p>P.S. I have read BIOS Disassembly Ninjutsu Uncovered; and I can provide the binary if necessary.</p>\n<p>Please be <strong>as specific as possible</strong> in your answer since I googled 100 times and I'm really disappointed.\nThanks!</p>\n</div>",

I can't find <i>anything</i> on this. My laptop is booted into legacy bios and has EA at 0xFFFF0 and 90 90 E9 at 0xFFFFFFF0</span>",
