The OllyDbg break at the breakpoint, but when I step over, the OllyDbg put a hardware breakpoint. (Yesterday not happened in OllyDbg, but today during training it happened.)</p>\n<p><strong>ŸçEdit :</strong> A red square usually occurs when step over, but goes to the next line immediately. But in this call, when i click F8 to step over, the program has stopped and no longer works.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kMFzp.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kMFzp.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
