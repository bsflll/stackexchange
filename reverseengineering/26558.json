Fine, use something like <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pefile/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pefile</a> then or report the issues LIEF has or even fix them yourself. I don't see why IDAPython itself should pack a parser for PE files when IDA provides this out-of-the-box in the respective loader module. However, I'll ping one of the IDA folks.</span>",

What you <em>can</em> do is to retrieve the list of exports and/or imports for the file which was used to create the database. If you need the low-level IAT details you’ll have to parse it manually from memory or database (not sure if database keeps enough information so you may need to go back to the input file).</p>\n</div>",
