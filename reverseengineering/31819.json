    "content": "<div class=\"s-prose js-post-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>I'm reverse engineering a malware that at some point tries to connect to <code>http://api.ipify.org</code> in order to get the IP address of the infected PC.</p>\n<p>I was able to replicate this behaviour with a small Python script, but for some reason, I can't get the same result when debugging the malware (in my dynamic-analysis VM using <strong>x32dbg</strong>), due to the fact that execution hangs indefinitely inside <code>HttpSendRequestA</code>.</p>\n<p>I tried to trace the execution flow inside that API, and the reason of the hang is a call to <code>WaitForSingleObjectEx</code> in <strong>wininet.dll</strong> (so, nothing to do with the malware itself).</p>\n<p>If I try to patch the <code>dwMilliseconds</code> param of <code>WaitForSingleObjectEx</code> (causing a timeout) I can get further to the execution, but eventually I get stuck another time when the malware tries to perform another http request.</p>\n<p>I tried to run this sample on another dynamic-analysis VM with Fakenet-ng installed and I can't even see the attempt to perform the http requests from the log.</p>\n<p>In both VMs the network is online.</p>\n<p>Am I missing something obvious here?</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n<p>I tried to run the malware outside the debugger (still in a VM with fakenet) and I see the http requests from the log! So the issue described here <strong>only happens when running INSIDE the debugger</strong>. Still, I don't think that this is an anti-debugging trick: I have reverse-engineered and documented EVERY function of this malware and I haven't found any anti-debugging stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT2:</strong></p>\n<p>It seems that this user had the same issue (usign a different debugger):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/19431/ollydbg-runs-away-when-stepping-over-wininet-httpsendrequestw\">OllyDbg \"runs away\" when stepping over wininet.HttpSendRequestW</a></p>\n<p><strong>EDIT3:</strong></p>\n<p>Found a workaround (described in the answer bellow)</p>\n</div>",

What flags are sent to InternetOpen()? Is it setting the async flag? After clearing the dns cache, do you see it doing name lookup before the hang?</span>",

There isn't any flag pushed to InternetOpenA (it pushes 0 as dwFlags param). I don't see any name loopups either. I'm thinking about coding a little prog that simulate this behaviour using same APIs/params and see what happens while debugging it.</span>",

Because I've written a little app (exe, NOT dll) to simulate exacly what the malware is doing, using the same windows apis and in this case I got no deadlock. So I started to suspect that the issue was indeed the fact that I was debugging a dll.</p>\n<p>So this is what I did:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Using dll_to_exe I've convert the malware from dll to exe (thanks @hasherezade for this great tool) [https://github.com/hasherezade/dll_to_exe]</li>\n<li>Since the malware uses a custom entry point, I loaded the new executable in x32dbg,  reached the real entry point, then fired up Scylla and produced a new dump with the EP set to the real entry point (I know that this can be done without Scylla at all by simply using a PE editor, but I was lacking any PE editor in that VM and the network was intercepted by Fakenet-NG).</li>\n<li>Loaded this new executable (with the correct EP) in the debugger and executed it. It reached HttpSendRequestA call and I was able to step over it without any deadlock.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Still, if you know why the deadlock happens in the dll version please tell me. I also tried to use OllyDBG just to make sure that this wasn't a bug of x32dbg, but I was able to repliace the same issue there too.</p>\n</div>",
