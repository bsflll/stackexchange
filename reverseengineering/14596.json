Remember to try both little-endian and big-endian variants. For finding the entrypoint, see here: <a href=\"https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/11096/\">Reverse Engineering MIPS Bootloader</a></strike></p>\n<p>Note that it may be possible that the firmware is packed or encrypted (check binwalk's entropy analysis); in that case reading it directly from the flash chip may be necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: So, apparently the code is <em>not</em> MIPS after all. Going by the objdump output, the instruction set seems to be a derivative of the Motorola/Freescale MCORE (previously Motorola RCE), even if they call it \"csky\". You should be able to disassemble raw binary by specifying binary file format and architecture to objdump, e.g.:</p>\n<pre><code>objdump -D -b binary -m csky file.bin\n</code></pre>\n<p>In case you don't get good results, try adding <code>-EB</code> or <code>-EL</code> to force big-endian or little-endian disassembly. Note that sometimes you may get nonsense disassembly in case there is data intermixed with code (<code>-D</code> forces disassembly of the whole file).</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT2</strong>:  C-sky support has been added to official binutils source tree. <a href=\"https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commitdiff;h=b8891f8d622a31306062065813fc278d8a94fe21\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The commit</a> message says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>V1 is derived from the MCore architecture while V2 is substantially\ndifferent, with mixed 16- and 32-bit instructions, a larger register\nset, a different (but overlapping) ABI, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>EDIT3</strong>: C-SKY and Motorola MCore architecture support <a href=\"https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/pull/11448\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">was added</a> in Radare2 reverse engineering framework. You can use it with <code>-a mcore</code> radare2 switch, also it should recognize the architecture in the ELF file directly.</p>\n</div>",
