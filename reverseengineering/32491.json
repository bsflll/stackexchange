For background: this software will communicate with an external server in order to determine if the boot sequence should continue or not.</p>\n<p>My current understanding is as follow<br/>\nUEFI/BIOS -&gt; <strong>Pre-boot environment</strong> -&gt; Windows(after booting)</p>\n<p>I found that the pre-boot environment operates using the so called \"mini kernel\". Is it true and is this mini-kernel the same Windows kernel with just limited stuff enabled?</p>\n</div>",

Are you talking about <code>bootmgfw.efi</code> which to my understanding <i>does</i> run in the context of the UEFI ... or what is it you mean? There is something called minwin, but I think it's related to WinPE not the early boot stages.</span>",

I am talking about the phase that operates Bitlocker, which must run from a bare bone disk partition (unencrypted), with enough drivers to operate. Once it decrypted the main c: it \"pivots\" to the \"real\" Windows kernel (with full drivers). This is analogous to the initramfs booting step in Linux. But it is likely very different hence my request to find information.</span>",
