But I am not sure if it really gets all privileges the system has. Can it read/write code inside the kernel without segfaults, etc.? I want to use kernel module for unwinding the stack to kernel level to backtrace every function my program calls.</p>\n</div>",

Regarding if you can have segfaults on your module the response is yes, you can crash the kernel if your module is not written properly</span>",
