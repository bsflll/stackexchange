Another thing is i executed the program line by line, it somehow jump back to the entry point at <strong>0x00043b33</strong> and then go back to the address <strong>0x770B0D54</strong> later again. Can someone guide me on this？ </p>\n</div>",

The address <code>0x770B0D54</code> is in kernel code and it's probably before kernel starts executing user code. Useful if there's some magic happening before <code>main</code> is executed and you want to step through that.</p>\n<p>On the other hand <code>0x00043b33</code> is int user code and it's probably the address of the <code>main</code> function so that is the real code of the application.</p>\n<p>In OllyDbg you can control the initial breakpoint in Options-&gt;Debugging, Startup and exit\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/M3sx8.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/M3sx8.png\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
