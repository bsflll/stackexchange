    "content": "I wrote some code that does the following:\n\nSearches for and finds an offset in a binary file to add code (looks for a sequence of  00s I can overwrite).\nThen, I change the entrypoint of the ELF to the above address.\nThen, I write my code to the address and <pre><code>jmp</code></pre> back to the original entrypoint.\n\nSo, what happens is when the binary starts it will execute code at the address I changed the entrypoint to, I can see my code in <pre><code>gdb</code></pre> but any kind of instruction other than <pre><code>nop</code></pre> will trigger a segfault.\nCan ayone help me understand why this happen?\nFor the record, in the binary I am using, the place where I write my code is a place where I found a bunch of <pre><code>00</code></pre>s. It is in the <pre><code>.eh_frame</code></pre> section.\nI added the executable flag to the section in case that was the cause, but it did not help.\nI am trying to add code to a \"hello world\" program written in C.\nAn offset in the following section is located as a place to write code to:\nBefore any modifications the binary has the following:\n<pre><code>Section: [17] .eh_frame\nAddr: 00000000004005d0 Offset: 0005d0 Size: 0000f4 Flags: A\nEntry point address:               0x400400\n</code></pre>\nAfter my code runs:\n<pre><code>Section: [17] .eh_frame\nAddr: 00000000004005d0 Offset: 0005d0 Size: 0000f4 Flags: A**WX**\nEntry point address:               **0x4006b6**\n</code></pre>\nInside GDB:\n<pre><code> Breakpoint 1, 0x00000000004006b6 in ?? ()\n(gdb) x/10i $rip\n=> 0x4006b6:    nop\n   0x4006b7:    nop\n   0x4006b8:    nop\n   0x4006b9:    add    0x1,%ebx\n</code></pre>\nWhen I hit the <pre><code>add 0x1, %ebx</code></pre> the program segfaults.\n** I've also tried a <pre><code>add 0x1, %rbx</code></pre>.\nEDIT\nI am pretty sure I found the issue.\nWhen writing my assembly code I was using GCC and then using the eXamine command to get the bytes for each instruction but I was doing something like this:\n<pre><code>__asm__(\"movl 0x00, %rax\") (trying to access 0x00 location..)\n</code></pre>\nInstead of <pre><code>__asm__(\"movl $0x00, %rax\")</code></pre> (moving a <pre><code>0</code></pre> constant into register as I wanted).\nSo, I am an idiot but at least I realized it myself ;))\nthanks all who looked and helped.\n",

You can read it, but the CPU won't execute it.\nOne solution is to change the permissions for that section in the ELF header (in the sections listing). Another would be to find another code cave (that's how regions you can add code to are often called) in an executable section. You could also create your own section if you can't find an appropriate code cave.\nP.S.\nAn area full of nulls is not necessarily an area you can edit, those null bytes might still be used or parsed or whatever.\n",
