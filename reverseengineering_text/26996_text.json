    "content": "As a personal project, I've been trying to reverse engineer the model for a Naruto PS2 game, but to no success in trying to visualize vertex data and faces with Model Ressearcher, and the .OBJ extraction using PCSX2 didn't work either, since it uses culling. Could you guys please help me out? thanks in advance.\nSamples: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AIwxQT7cg9l2PO1N_0zm1rXhUpyp1y0_/view?usp=sharing\n",
