    "content": "I am trying to reverse engineer a datalogger file (parker <pre><code>.scpo</code></pre> I believe).\nI think it must be a 16bit format but I cant get the numbers to line up.\nData is stored in the form of a hex string I believe. First 100 characters here:\n<pre><code>  BBFEBBFEBC09BC09BBFEBBFEBC09BC09BC09BC09BBE7BBFEBBFEBBFEBC09BBFEBC09BBFEBBFEBC15BBFEBBFEBBFEBBFEBBF2[continued...]\n</code></pre>\nLuckily I also have an export of this particular file, the corresponding values are here:\n<pre><code>0.036,0.036,0.04,0.04,0.036,0.036,0.04,0.04,0.04,0.04,0.027,0.036,0.036,0.036,0.04,0.036,0.04,0.036,0.036,0.045,0.036,0.036,0.036,0.036,0.031,0.031,0.027,0.013,-0.033,-0.028,0.004,0.013,0.018,0.031,0.027,0.04,0.059,0.059,0.068,0.073,0.054,0.045,0.04,0.036,0.027,0.027,0.036,0.031,0.031,0.022[continued...]\n</code></pre>\nI also found the following metadata that I believe relates to this channel, last three entries are data series the first of which is above:\n<pre><code>objVersion : 1\nSMType : SMP\ninputType : IN1\nPriority : 1\nColorSerialized : 1\nName : ...\nSensor : eSCPT\nAttention : 5\nAlarm : 10\nScaling : eFS\nLowerScaling : 0\nUpperScaling : 0\nUnit : bar\nLowerRange : -1\nUpperRange : 15\nSignalUnit : V\nLowerSignalRange : -0.2\nUpperSignalRange : 3\nCalcFormula : None\nCAN_VID : None\nCAN_REV : None\nCAN_PCODE : None\nCAN_SER : None\nSlopeDin : eRising\nLogicalDOUTOperation : e1A\nDOUTTriggerA : eLevel\nConditionA : None\nDOUTTriggerB : eLevel\nConditionB : None\nSlopeDout : eRising\n\n\nobjVersion: 1\nSMType: SMP\ninputType: IN1\ninterval: 16\nactValuesSerializedSMP: BBFEBBFEBC09BC09BBFEBBFEBC09BC09BC09BC09BBE7BBFEBBFEBBFEBC09BBFEBC09BBFEBBFEBC15BBFEBBFEBBFEBBFEBBF2[continued...]\nminValuesSerializedSMP: BBDCBBD0BBE7BBDCBBE7BBDCBBDCBBE7BBE7BBF2BBE7BBE7BBE7BBDCBBFEBBF2BBFEBBF2BBF2BBF2BBFEBBE7BBF2BBE7BBE7[continued...]\nmaxValuesSerializedSMP: BC15BC09BC15BC09BC09BC15BC09BC15BC15BC09BC09BC20BC20BC15BC15BC20BC20BC20BC2CBC20BC20BC20BC15BC20BC09[continued...]\n</code></pre>\nSomewhere it mentions 1 decimal place which made me think fixed point or <pre><code>bcd</code></pre>.\nDoes anyone recognize this encoding, are there any keywords that might help me in the right direction?\nAre there any resources that I could look at that may help.\nIf there are any relevant tags please either add them or let me know.\nThings I have already tried:\n\nBig and little endian floats and ints (16bit) ( <pre><code>h</code></pre>, <pre><code>H</code></pre>, <pre><code>e</code></pre> in python struct module)\nBCD (from this answer on SO) as well as reversed\n\nThings that I have considered and not (completely) explored:\n\nScaling the values but some of the range values in the header/metadata\nSome sort of operation using <pre><code>LogicalDOUTOperation</code></pre> from the metadata.\nWhat is SMP Encoding\n\nComplete Data:\n\nEncoded Values\nActual Values\n\nFirst 20 points:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking the encoded Value <pre><code>X</code></pre> and the actual value <pre><code>Y</code></pre>:\nthe following appears to hold: <pre><code>AX+B = Y </code></pre> where <pre><code>A</code></pre> and <pre><code>B</code></pre> are <pre><code>9/23000 = 0.00039130....</code></pre> and <pre><code>-18.79591...</code></pre>\n",
