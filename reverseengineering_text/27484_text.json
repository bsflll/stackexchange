    "content": "I have a suspicious process. I found it by ProcessHacker's network tab.\nProcessHacker display the process as Unknown.\nThe process listening into a constant port number that's also not found by standard windows tools.\nThe process id also not found by standard windows tools.\nLooking at Wireshark traffic, I see there is traffic going to two IPs in Russia.\nI attempted to attach Frida into this process but Frida reports an error like below,\n<pre><code>[Error: Unexpected error allocating memory in target process (VirtualAlloc returned 0x00000005)]\n</code></pre>\nI've used both 64 bit and 32 bit versions of Frida but still same error.\n",
