(Fortunately, in this case, it's just CLC).\nUpdate: I have fixed this issue, and the solution has drastically reduced the size of my script.

I am how-ever in need of some starting advice, plus I need to make sure I am not re-coding the wheel here.\nI have since written some other IDAPython code using the higher level idautils to create call trees, and collate xrefs and such. But I don't know how to rewrite the actual disassembled code at that level.  There is one example in the IDAPython repo: https://github.com/pfalcon/idapython/blob/master/examples/ex_idphook_asm.py but that's\n\nFull of silly bugs (I fixed them)\nHooks the Assembly command, not the disassembly process\n\nI have reviewed the answer to a similar question at Creating IDA Pro debugger plugins - API documentation and examples?.  I have looked at various examples of quite nice IDAPython code that can:\n\nAdd comments while disassembling\nChange the line color while disassembling\n\nBut, I have seen nothing about actually changing instructions.\nI have not purchased The IDA Pro Book because I do not live in the U.S. and I do not want to wait n weeks for on-demand printing and delivery. I am not adverse to writing an <pre><code>.idc</code></pre>, as I'm quite familiar with C (more-so that with Python), although I suspect despite the shallower learning curve (and assumedly ready examples) it would be harder (long term) than using higher level IDAPython code.  (I'm learning Python as I go, but .. well, didn't we all?)\nBecause the code I am working with is exclusively 64-bit, there is little (basically no) pre-existing deobfu samples or code out there.\nAnd so here I find myself, asking for your patient guidance.  (Very patient if you actually read all of that).\nPS: I took the time to document everything I had done, because I know how little respect we all have for people who don't even attempt something before hollering for help.\nPPS: OMG 2nd most avid member of RE is Igor Skochinsky, I can only bow in humility.\n",

            "content": "There are two scenarios to be distinguished, which you (implicitly) mention as well:\nI. Obfuscated pattern with no jmps in between interrupting the control flow,\nII. Obfuscated pattern with interrupting jmps.\nDefinitely there are several possibilities to remove the obfuscation. I will try to describe one of them which I (partly) applied.\nScenario I is straightforward (and with that one I made some successful tries and wrote a program for it):\n\nIdentify the pattern \"by hand\", write down the bytecode sequence, and write down the - simpler - bytecode replacement.\nRead the binary into the own programmed \"remove obfuscation\" application.\nLet the program search for all occurences of the obfuscation bytecode.\nLet the program replace all found occurrences with the (hopefully simpler) replacement. You might gain a lot of space for possible patches.\nVery important: Test the modified (i.e. simplified) program\n\nScenario II is the more difficult part, as the breaks can show up anywhere and no unique bytecode sequence is possible any more for an obfuscation pattern. I would probably proceed in the following way, however not having tried it yet:\n\nIndependent from obfuscation, find a solution to remove the \"breaks\" in the code, i.e. try to remove the usually many, many useless jmp statements. In case you can solve this, it has the big additional advantage that the code is not broken any more in Ida by the jmps. Maybe there exist already some automated solutions, although presently not known to me.\nApply Scenario I\n\nAs to my experience, the Scenario I is the lesser frequent case, although having been encountered as well. The following - real - obfuscated x64 code sequence demonstrates the importance of removing the \"code breaks\". In this sequence there are no less than six breaks where the program each time jmps between addresses separated far distant from each other.\n<pre><code>    loc_startObfuscatedSequence:                        \n                    lea     rsp, [rsp-8]\n                    mov     [rsp], rbp\n                    mov     rbp, offset loc_target1\n                    xchg    rbp, [rsp]    \n                    mov     [rsp-8], rcx\n                    jmp     loc_break1  \n\n    loc_break1:     lea     rsp, [rsp-8]\n                    jmp     loc_break2\n\n    loc_break2:     mov     [rsp-8], rdx\n                    jmp     loc_break3\n\n    loc_break3:     lea     rsp, [rsp-8]\n                    jmp     loc_ break4\n\n    loc_ break4:    mov     rcx, [rsp+10h]\n                    mov     rdx, offset loc_target2\n                    cmovz   rcx, rdx\n                    jmp     loc_break5\n\n    loc_break5:     mov     [rsp+10h], rcx\n                    lea     rsp, [rsp+8]\n                    mov     rdx, [rsp-8]\n                    jmp     loc_break6\n\n    loc_break6:    lea     rsp, [rsp+8]\n                    mov     rcx, [rsp-8]\n                    retn\n</code></pre>\nIf I interpreted this correctly, the obfuscated sequence is a replacement for the simple\n<pre><code>jz  loc_target2\njmp loc_target1\n</code></pre>\nMore complex patterns like the one of the example might contain simpler ones. As a consequence, you would start with the simple patterns and then move from simpler to more complicated ones, increasing the readablility of the code (and making Ida more happy) with each de-obfuscation step.\n",

My distorm3 based disassembler will stream out instructions while skipping <code>jmp</code> and i've already implemented signature based patching for those six lines at the top of your example.  BTW your example is so similar to my own, that I wonder if they weren't both generated by the same engine. Some of it's other tricks are <code>mov rax, rsp</code> <code>add rax, 0fffffffffffffff8h</code> <code>mov rsp, rax</code> or the belief beggaring <code>lea rsp, [rsp-8]</code> <code>sub rsp, 20h</code>.</span>",

An own solution has IMO the advantage that you can tailor it perhaps better to your needs. I assume the basic algorithmic effort might be similar. However, I have no experience with the Ida SDK, only with some idc. With respect to the obfuscation engine, the similarity is striking indeed.</span>",

The advantage to developing it in IDA would be that the whole community benefited, and I'd learn a new skill.  BTW, I believe the protect is generated by (and we don't want google to bring up this page)  <code>char url[] = { 0x61, 0x72, 0x78, 0x61, 0x6e, 0x2e, 0x63, 0x6f, 0x6d };</code>   But I do want to get IDA to replace LEA based BSP manipulations with something IDA's stack counter can use.</span>",

I did it in C#, due to the comfortable GUI possiblities and file handling. If more basic stuff is needed, my technique is C# GUI frontend and C++ DLL backend with a plain C pinvoke interface. But maybe others have another opinion. BTW, the mentioned book of Chris Eagle is highly recommended. An excellent book. And your suggestion of the obfusc provider makes absolutely sense...</span>",
