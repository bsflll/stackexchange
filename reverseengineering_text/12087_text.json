    "content": "Bit of a noob question, I'm working through some examples on crackmes.\nIn Ollydbg and x64dbg, in the stack, disassembler and registry windows, there are texts to show values of memory locations, for instance:\n\nI would have thought IDA would have had this information readily available in the debugger, however it seems the user has to hover over addresses to view it.\n\nIs there a way to display this available in IDA? It is much more useful in Olly/x64 to have the text, rather than <pre><code>debug070:7EFDE000</code></pre> etc\nThanks\n",
