    "content": "Docs.\nIf I understand this correctly, this function pre-computes virtual addresses of imported DLLs and writes them to the IAT of an image (provided that <pre><code>BIND_NO_UPDATE</code></pre> is not set as parameter). My understanding is that you do this to an image (on file) to make it start faster.\n\nHow does the windows loader know that the image has already been bound (and that it does not need to compute virtual addresses)?\nIn the DllCharacteristics in a PE file (in the optional header), there is a flag called <pre><code>NO_BIND</code></pre>. Does <pre><code>BindImageEx</code></pre> fail if this is set?\nWhat is the difference between <pre><code>BIND_NO_BOUND_IMPORTS</code></pre> and <pre><code>BIND_NO_UPDATE</code></pre> if the only updating it does is to the IAT?\n",
