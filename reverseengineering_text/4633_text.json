IÂ´m trying to prove that a malicious software is capable of changing the PE signature so we can not trust in some tool tell us a PE is a NullSoft Installer only because it have found the NullSoft signature. \nAny help will be appreciated, recommended tools, etc ...\nEDIT\nAfter reading the Stolas's answer I decided to edit the question and add more info.\nI already tried with to use an hex editor on an original NullSoft installer and I searched for the string <pre><code>NullSoft</code></pre> this yielded the following result:\n\nThe string was found in a <pre><code>XML</code></pre>:\n<pre><code><?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\n<assembly xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\" manifestVersion=\"1.0\">\n    <assemblyIdentity version=\"1.0.0.0\" processorArchitecture=\"X86\" name=\"Nullsoft.NSIS.exehead\" type=\"win32\"/>\n    <description>\n        Nullsoft Install System v2.46\n    </description>\n    <dependency>\n        <dependentAssembly>\n            <assemblyIdentity type=\"win32\" name=\"Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls\" version=\"6.0.0.0\" processorArchitecture=\"X86\" publicKeyToken=\"6595b64144ccf1df\" language=\"*\" />\n        </dependentAssembly>\n    </dependency>\n    <trustInfo xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3\">\n        <security>\n            <requestedPrivileges>\n                <requestedExecutionLevel level=\"requireAdministrator\" uiAccess=\"false\"/>\n            </requestedPrivileges>\n        </security>\n    </trustInfo>\n    <compatibility xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:compatibility.v1\">\n        <application>\n            <supportedOS Id=\"{35138b9a-5d96-4fbd-8e2d-a2440225f93a}\"/>\n            <supportedOS Id=\"{e2011457-1546-43c5-a5fe-008deee3d3f0}\"/>\n        </application>\n    </compatibility>\n</assembly>\n</code></pre>\nThese seems to be what I want to insert in my \"malicious\" app. So, how can I add that into my app? \nMy app it's just a \"Hello world\" written in Visual C++.\nI'm aware that I have to write this at the same offset that in the original, but I just don't know how.\n",

Both can be done via a simple hex editor of your choice</span>",
