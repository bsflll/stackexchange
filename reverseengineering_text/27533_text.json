IN in[128]; !     OUT out[128]; !  !     PARTS: !     Xor(a=in[0..31], b=in[96..127], out=red); !     Xor(a=in[32..63], b=in[64..95], out=king); !     Xor(a=in[64..95], b=in[96..127], out=dave); !     Concat(a=in[0..31], b=dave, c=red, d=king, out=ayk); !     Switch(a=ayk[3..6], b=ayk[19..22]); !     Switch(a=ayk[54..61], b=ayk[32..39]); !     Switch(a=ayk[63..70], b=ayk[120..127]); !     Switch(a=ayk[95..98], b=ayk[81..84]); !     Xor(a=ayk[0..31], b=ayk[64..95], out=earl); !     Xor(a=ayk[64..95], b=ayk[96..127], out=cosmo); !     Xor(a=ayk[32..63], b=ayk[96..127], out=abbott); !     Concat(a=abbott, b=comso, c=ayk[0..31], d=earl, out=phoenix); !     Reverse(in=phoenix, out=out); }</code></pre>\n\ni was asked to reverse it and retrieve the value of <pre><code>in</code></pre> , how can i do it please knowing that i have the value of <pre><code>out</code></pre>? thanks\n",
