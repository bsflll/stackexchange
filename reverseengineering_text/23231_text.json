    "content": "Edit: The audio data is on a separate IC\n\nThere are a few seconds of audio in a toy's 128 kB firmware - somewhere...\nHere is a downsampled look at the bits (white = 1):\n\nMy beginner's attempts to analyse the disassembly in order to find the audio data blocks have not been successful so far. There appear to be sections that are visually different, although it's not something very obvious. Trying the different raw audio import options in Audacity only results in \"noise\".\nI am assuming a (simple?) compression scheme is in use, so maybe RLE, DPCM or even ADPCM.\nMy guess is that the areas that do not show the byte boundary (LSB/MSB set = white) as clearly (=higher bit frequency?) are worth a closer look. \nI am going to try to gather information about the audio resolution and rate by analysing the audio output, to help get an estimate of what I am looking for.\nA few ideas on how to proceed:\nFinding data (as opposed to code) from program analysis:\n\nuse analysers showing data sections (= no instructions, not reached in program flow) - which? what limitations apply?\nfind <pre><code>const</code></pre> data (not copied to RAM at initialisation)\n\nFinding audio data directly by:\n\nproperties of audio data (AC signal)\ncompare with samples of data patterns in simple audio compression\n\nWorking with a debugger:\n\nit might be possible to set a data change / register write breakpoint for the peripheral that is likely to generate the audio output (Timer/PWM/DAC/DMA) and work backwards from there\n\nBut all of these require a lot of legwork and more background knowledge than I currently have, so the outlook is rather limited..\nWhat other approaches to finding data in firmware should I consider?\n",

Here's the widely used (I think) Sun decode code: search for bytes 0F and F0 near lots of shift instructions, and you might get lucky.\n",

            "text": "If it's a simple enough compression scheme (ADPCM, uLaw, etc.), playing it as if it's PCM will sometimes actually work. You'll get something that's noisy as heck but the underlying audio (e.g. voice, music) will be audible under the noise. This lets you determine at least two things: the bitrate/sample rate of the audio, and where in the file the audio is. (I realize you've tried this - but maybe try listening very carefully to the noise!)\n",

Must have been the cheapest option.\n",
