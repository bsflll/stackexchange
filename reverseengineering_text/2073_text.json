            "content": "Moving <pre><code>esp</code></pre> into <pre><code>ebp</code></pre> is done as a debugging aid and in some cases for exception handling.  <pre><code>ebp</code></pre> is often called the frame pointer.  With this in mind, think of what happens if you call several functions.  <pre><code>ebp</code></pre> points to a block of memory where you pushed the old <pre><code>ebp</code></pre>, which itself points to another saved <pre><code>ebp</code></pre>, etc.  Thus, you have a linked list of stack frames.  From these, you can look at the return addresses (which are always 4 bytes above the frame pointer in the stack frame) to find out what line of code called a stack frame in question.  The instruction pointer can tell you the location of current execution.  This allows you to generate a stacktrace which is useful for debugging by showing the flow of execution throughout a program.\nAs a practical example consider the following code:\n<pre><code>void foo();\nvoid bar();\nvoid baz();\nvoid quux();\n\nvoid foo() {\n    bar();\n}\n\nvoid bar() {\n    baz();\n    quux();\n}\n\nvoid baz() {\n    //do nothing\n}\n\nvoid quux() {\n    *(int*)(0) = 1; //SEGFAULT!\n}\n\nint main() {\n    foo();\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\nThis generates the following assembly (with Debian gcc 4.7.2-4 <pre><code>gcc -m32 -g test.c</code></pre>, snipped):\n<pre><code>080483dc <foo>:\n 80483dc:   55                      push   %ebp\n 80483dd:   89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp\n 80483df:   83 ec 08                sub    $0x8,%esp\n 80483e2:   e8 02 00 00 00          call   80483e9 <bar>\n 80483e7:   c9                      leave  \n 80483e8:   c3                      ret    \n\n080483e9 <bar>:\n 80483e9:   55                      push   %ebp\n 80483ea:   89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp\n 80483ec:   83 ec 08                sub    $0x8,%esp\n 80483ef:   e8 07 00 00 00          call   80483fb <baz>\n 80483f4:   e8 07 00 00 00          call   8048400 <quux>\n 80483f9:   c9                      leave  \n 80483fa:   c3                      ret    \n\n080483fb <baz>:\n 80483fb:   55                      push   %ebp\n 80483fc:   89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp\n 80483fe:   5d                      pop    %ebp\n 80483ff:   c3                      ret    \n\n08048400 <quux>:\n 8048400:   55                      push   %ebp\n 8048401:   89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp\n 8048403:   b8 00 00 00 00          mov    $0x0,%eax\n 8048408:   c7 00 01 00 00 00       movl   $0x1,(%eax)\n 804840e:   5d                      pop    %ebp\n 804840f:   c3                      ret    \n\n08048410 <main>:\n 8048410:   55                      push   %ebp\n 8048411:   89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp\n 8048413:   83 e4 f0                and    $0xfffffff0,%esp\n 8048416:   e8 c1 ff ff ff          call   80483dc <foo>\n 804841b:   b8 00 00 00 00          mov    $0x0,%eax\n 8048420:   c9                      leave  \n 8048421:   c3                      ret    \n</code></pre>\nNote that <pre><code>leave</code></pre> is the same as:\n<pre><code>mov %ebp, %esp\npop %ebp\n</code></pre>\nWith this in mind, and the standard-ish C calling convention on x86, we know that the stack at the segfault is going to look like:\n\ntop of main's stack frame\nstack space for main - in this case, enough to align on 16 bytes\n<pre><code>0x0804841b</code></pre> return address for <pre><code>call foo</code></pre>\npointer to <pre><code>1.</code></pre>\nstack space for foo\n<pre><code>0x080483e7</code></pre> return address for <pre><code>call bar</code></pre>\npointer to <pre><code>4.</code></pre>\nstack space for bar\n<pre><code>0x080483f9</code></pre> return address for <pre><code>call quux</code></pre>\npointer to <pre><code>7.</code></pre>\nstack space for quux\n\nThe instruction pointer will be <pre><code>0x08048408</code></pre>. <pre><code>ebp</code></pre> will point to <pre><code>10.</code></pre>.\nAt this point, the processor generates an exception, which the operating system processes.  It then sends <pre><code>SIGSEGV</code></pre> to the process, which obligingly terminates and dumps core.  You then bring up the core dump in gdb with <pre><code>gdb -c core</code></pre>, and you type in <pre><code>file a.out</code></pre> and <pre><code>bt</code></pre>, and it gives you in response:\n<pre><code>#0  0x08048408 in quux () at test.c:20\n#1  0x080483f9 in bar () at test.c:12\n#2  0x080483e7 in foo () at test.c:7\n#3  0x0804841b in main () at test.c:24\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>#0</code></pre> is generated from the instruction pointer.  Then, it goes to <pre><code>ebp</code></pre> (10), looks at the previous item on the stack (9), and generates <pre><code>#1</code></pre>.  It follows <pre><code>ebp</code></pre> (i.e. <pre><code>mov %ebp, (%ebp)</code></pre>) to (7), and looks 4 bytes above that (6) to generate <pre><code>#2</code></pre>.  It finally follows (7) to (4) and looks at (3) to generate <pre><code>#3</code></pre>.\nNote:  This is but one way of doing such stack tracing.  GDB is very, very smart, and can perform the stack trace even when you use <pre><code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code></pre>.  However, in a very basic implementation this is probably the simplest way to generate a stack trace.\n",

I think it misses the point of which is the real purpose of this instruction.  \n\nis done as a debugging aid and in some cases for exception handling\n\nWell.. not really, not only. It is part of the standard function prologue for x86 (32 bit), and it is the (common) technique to set up a function stack frame, so that parameters and locals are accessible as fixed offsets of <pre><code>ebp</code></pre>, which is, after all, the *B*ase frame *P*ointer.\nMaking <pre><code>ebp</code></pre> equal to <pre><code>esp</code></pre> at function entry, you will have a fixed, relative pointer inside the stack, that will not change for the lifetime of your function, and you will able to access parameters and locals as (fixed) positive and (fixed) negative offsets, respectively, to <pre><code>ebp</code></pre>.\nYou can or cannot see this standard prologue in release, optimized code: optimizers can do (and often do) FPO (frame pointer optimization) to get rid of <pre><code>ebp</code></pre> and just use <pre><code>esp</code></pre> inside your function to access params and locals. This is much trickier (I would not do it by hand) as <pre><code>esp</code></pre> can vary during the function lifetime, and therefore a parameter, for example, can be accessed using 2 different offsets at two distinct points in the code.\n",
