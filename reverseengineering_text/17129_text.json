    "content": "In practicing reading source code and analysing I've been looking at a program called <pre><code>aescrypt2_huawei</code></pre> which floats around the web and encrypts/decrypts the XML config file from Huawei routers like the HG8245 router installed by Internet Service Providers. The router is discussed on a number of blogs and the aescrypt2 can be downloaded and examined. I have also found the source code and put it on GitHub.\nSo far I've found:\n\nNIST SHA256 Test Vector in the source \ninflate 1.2.5 calling code\nIdentified the code path to the decrypt section\n\nWhat I haven't found:\n\nAny S-boxes for AES\nThe key\n\nRunning <pre><code>findcrypt</code></pre> in IDA Pro is also not turning up anything which leads me to believe my <pre><code>findcrypt</code></pre> plugin isn't working. However, I then start looking for the S-boxes sequence 0x63 0x7c which can easily be found in the source code and IDA pro doesn't find that either... I then dropped to hexdump and searched for 0x63 and it is not there. Given that I can see the S-box in the source and I just compiled the binary myself what am I doing wrong?\nShouldn't the forward S-box appear in the data segment more or less as-is?\nAnd now that I've found the key through the debugger in the <pre><code>.bss</code></pre> segment why isn't the string in the data segment?\n",

            "content": "Initialization of the forward S-box\nAs you probably saw in the source-code, the forward S-box is present several times and initialized at two different places. \nThe first time that the forward S-box (<pre><code>Fsb</code></pre>) is declared is at the top of <pre><code>aes.c</code></pre>:\n<pre><code>uint32 FSb[256];\n</code></pre>\nThis array is then dynamically generated by <pre><code>aes_gen_tables()</code></pre> like this:\n<pre><code>FSb[0x00] = 0x63;\nRSb[0x63] = 0x00;\n\nfor( i = 1; i < 256; i++ )\n{\n    x = pow[255 - log[i]];\n\n    y = x;  y = ( y << 1 ) | ( y >> 7 );\n    x ^= y; y = ( y << 1 ) | ( y >> 7 );\n    x ^= y; y = ( y << 1 ) | ( y >> 7 );\n    x ^= y; y = ( y << 1 ) | ( y >> 7 );\n    x ^= y ^ 0x63;\n\n    FSb[i] = x;\n    RSb[x] = i;\n}\n</code></pre>\nThe other initialization of <pre><code>Fsb[256]</code></pre> is easy to spot in the code file and is a static constant which is defined like this:\n<pre><code>/* forward S-box */\n\nstatic const uint32 FSb[256] =\n{\n    0x63, 0x7C, 0x77, 0x7B, 0xF2, 0x6B, 0x6F, 0xC5,\n    0x30, 0x01, 0x67, 0x2B, 0xFE, 0xD7, 0xAB, 0x76,\n    0xCA, 0x82, 0xC9, 0x7D, 0xFA, 0x59, 0x47, 0xF0,\n    0xAD, 0xD4, 0xA2, 0xAF, 0x9C, 0xA4, 0x72, 0xC0,\n    0xB7, 0xFD, 0x93, 0x26, 0x36, 0x3F, 0xF7, 0xCC,\n    0x34, 0xA5, 0xE5, 0xF1, 0x71, 0xD8, 0x31, 0x15,\n    0x04, 0xC7, 0x23, 0xC3, 0x18, 0x96, 0x05, 0x9A,\n\n         < ... Truncated for readability ... >\n\n    0x9B, 0x1E, 0x87, 0xE9, 0xCE, 0x55, 0x28, 0xDF,\n    0x8C, 0xA1, 0x89, 0x0D, 0xBF, 0xE6, 0x42, 0x68,\n    0x41, 0x99, 0x2D, 0x0F, 0xB0, 0x54, 0xBB, 0x16\n};\n</code></pre>\n\nTwo initialization of <pre><code>Fsb[]</code></pre>?\nYes, the author of the program describes it in the comments:\n<pre><code>/* uncomment the following line to use pre-computed tables */\n/* otherwise the tables will be generated at the first run */\n\n/* #define FIXED_TABLES */\n\n#ifndef FIXED_TABLES\n\n/* forward S-box & tables */\n...\n...\n...\n\n#else\n\n/* forward S-box */\n\nstatic const uint32 FSb[256] =\n{\n    0x63, 0x7C, 0x77, ...\n...\n...\n</code></pre>\nThus, if you want the array to be pre-determined, just uncomment <pre><code>#define FIXED_TABLES</code></pre> and you'll be fine.\n\nDebugger time!\nThe functions which is responsible to generate the forward S-box is <pre><code>aes_gen_tables( void )</code></pre> which is called from <pre><code>aes_set_key( ... )</code></pre>. The latter is called from the aescrypt2.c. We can spot the call to <pre><code>aes_set_key()</code></pre> in IDA:\n\nFrom there, locating <pre><code>aes_gen_tables()</code></pre> is easy peasy:\n\nAs we said, the array is dynamically filled with values and we can view it using the debugger. Let's find the address of the array to be initialized and put a Hardware Breakpoint on Write on this address.\nHere's the part where the first item of the <pre><code>Fsb</code></pre> is initialized:\n\nThis is the equivalent part from the source code:\n<pre><code>/* generate the forward and reverse S-boxes */\n\nFSb[0x00] = 0x63;\nRSb[0x63] = 0x00;\n</code></pre>\nNow put the Hardware Breakpoint on <pre><code>0x00412F00</code></pre>:\n\nNow we all set and we can start the debug session. Press the play button and start the program, then you'll have to input information to the console that has just popped up. After done, pressing Enter in the console will trigger our HW breakpoint. This is where <pre><code>Fsb[0]</code></pre> is set to 0x63. Press the play button and the breakpoint again will be triggered, this time it's at the end of the generation loop and our array will be filled:\n \nThere we go, now we found our forward S-box after it was dynamically generated by the program.\n",
