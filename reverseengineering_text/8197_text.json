    "content": "GDB has a reasonably robust API which is exposed to Python at runtime.  It allows for inspecting various types, but does not appear to allow creation of types.\nHowever, types can be manually added by loading an object file at runtime (https://stackoverflow.com/q/7272558).\nIs there any way to add or create a new <pre><code>gdb.Type</code></pre> object at runtime?\nThe intent is to then allow inspection of memory via <pre><code>gdb.Value.cast</code></pre> to the <pre><code>type.pointer()</code></pre> and then <pre><code>.dereference()</code></pre>d.  This would be much better/easier than manually deserializing data field-by-field.\nAlternatively, I thought that I could just load an object file programmatically.  It looks like GDB is perfectly happy to load cross-architecture object files for symbol/type purposes.  In order to not kill any real/useful symbols, or create misleading ones, a non-existent address should be used.  However, loading a <pre><code>.o</code></pre> at an unmapped address requires the user to verify (type <pre><code>y</code></pre>), so when done from <pre><code>gdb.execute(...)</code></pre> it fails outright.\n",
