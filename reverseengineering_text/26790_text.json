    "content": "I want to run (simulating) MIPS file with Qemu:\n<pre><code>$file httpd\nhttpd: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS32 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0, no section header\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>chroot</code></pre> to <pre><code>rootfs</code></pre> and then run my file:\n\ni found <pre><code>oalShm_init</code></pre> function into <pre><code>libcms_core.so</code></pre> library and decompile it with <pre><code>ghidra</code></pre>:\n\nfirst <pre><code>httpd</code></pre> file use <pre><code>shmget</code></pre> for create shard memory and then use <pre><code>shamt</code></pre> for give access to this space;\nbut Qemu error in this function and can't mapping or can't run it\nhow to i can resolve this problem?\n",

            "content": "From the man page:\n\nThe addr argument to shmat specifies a pointer value indicating the\naddress at which the memory segment is to be attached. If addr is NULL\n, the segment will be attached at an address selected by the system.\nIf addr is specified, shmat will fail if the segment cannot be\nattached as specified because memory is already allocated near the\naddress specified\n\n.\nIt seems the code expects 0x58800000 to be a valid address and it isnâ€™t under QEMU.\nYou can try to either play with QEMU configuration to make it valid or patch the executable to use 0 instead so the address is determined by the system.\n",

As packages lag behind compiling qemu from source is probably needed.\nThere are a lot of weird bugs with user space emulation in general. Sometimes it's a good idea to spin up some light distro with qemu-system (and chroot to your target binaries/libraries) for a sanity check.\n",
