            "content": "I asked the question on github and got the following reply:\n\nAssuming stack analysis has been performed and the function has been\n  marked with stack references as shown above, you can iterate over the\n  references \"from\" the body of the function (i.e., AddressSetView). The\n  references returned would need to be filtered as other type of\n  references would also be returned. Although there are a variety of\n  ways to obtain references here is one example:\n\n<pre><code>Function f;\nProgram p;\nReferenceManager refMgr = p.getReferenceManager();\n    for (Address fromAddr : refMgr.getReferenceSourceIterator(f.getBody(), true)) {\n        for (Reference ref : refMgr.getReferencesFrom(fromAddr)) {\n            if (ref.isStackReference()) {\n                StackReference stackRef = (StackReference) ref;\n            }\n        }\n}\n</code></pre>\nThe important part is that your analysis must take place AFTER the stack analysis happened, which is quite late. You can control when your analysis runs in the constructor by passing the point where you want to run into the parent constructor.\n",
