    "content": "I'm trying to create a basic program that has memory tampering protection, however it always says it's correct, even if I nop the whole license check function in Ollydbg or change and rebuild the code.\nI'm following the Surreptitious Software book, and wrote the following program:\n<pre><code>#include \"stdafx.h\"\n\n#define CORRECTHASH 5131241\n\nvoid BEGIN() {}\n\nconst std::string correctlicense(\"ABC\");\n\nbool licenseCheck() {\n\n    std::cout << \"Enter license: \";\n\n    std::string license;\n    std::cin >> license;\n\n    volatile DWORD d;\n\n    // Fingerprint\n    __asm {\n        lea ebx, d\n        mov ebx, 0x050b072b\n    }\n\n    return license.compare(correctlicense) == 0;\n}\n\nUINT hash(UINT *beginAddress, UINT *endAddress) {\n\n    UINT h = *beginAddress;\n\n    for (; beginAddress <= endAddress; beginAddress++) {\n        h ^= *beginAddress;\n    }\n\n    return h;\n}\nvoid END() {}\n\n\nint main()\n{\n\n    UINT uHash = hash((UINT*)BEGIN, (UINT*)END);\n\n    std::cout << \"[Protection checks]\" << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Tampering: \";\n\n    if (uHash != CORRECTHASH) {\n        std::cout << \"Failed ( \" << uHash << \" )\" << std::endl;\n        system(\"PAUSE\");\n        return 0;\n    }\n    else {\n        std::cout << \"Correct\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    if (licenseCheck()) {\n        std::cout << \"Correct!\" << std::endl;\n    }\n    else {\n        std::cout << \"Failed!\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n\n    system(\"PAUSE\");\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\nThe program basically 'hashes' the code between the BEGIN function and END function, but it doesn't seem to work. The hash is always correct even after tampering.\nI'm using Windows 7 and Visual studio 2017 the build/run the program.\n",

            "content": "Does the book actually use this as an example? This is not going to work in general. \nThe theory behind the snippet is that the code will be compiled in such a way where all of the functions are situated in the assembly language output in the same order in which they were situated in the C code. That is a broken assumption in general. The compiler is under no obligation to layout the functions in the binary in the same order in which they were laid out in the source code. \nIn this case I would expect that the functions <pre><code>BEGIN</code></pre> and <pre><code>END</code></pre> will be merged together into the same function via a compiler optimization known as clone detection, that it would compile to a single RETN instruction, and that the hash value would be the <pre><code>UINT</code></pre> corresponding to a RETN followed by padding bytes prior to the next function (if there is one).\nYou could figure out exactly what's going on by looking at the disassembly listing for the compiled code (or passing a flag to the compiler that caused it to emit the assembly language version).\n",
