    "content": "The code under inspection is a native Android library used in an Android application.\nThe decompiler is showing me a lot of lines in the style <pre><code>DAT_12345678 = 0x12345678</code></pre> with ascending addresses.\nI know that this is the initialization of an uninitialized array.\nWhen I want to set the data type, I get the error message <pre><code>Address not found in program memory.</code></pre>.\nI guess I have to create a memory block first, but in the <pre><code>Memory Map</code></pre> window I do not see an option to add blocks.\nHow can I fix that? Thanks.\n",
