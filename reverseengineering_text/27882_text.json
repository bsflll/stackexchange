What does that mean?\n\n\nOllyDbg wants to help you, and offer you an additional info — “What is currently at a given address?”\n\n<pre><code>address -> something</code></pre> means that at the <pre><code>address</code></pre> is currently <pre><code>something</code></pre> — see the following pictures of memory dump.\n\n(In the C-language parlance, address is a pointer to memory: “address points to something in memory,” so you may read <pre><code>-></code></pre> as “points to”.)\n\n<pre><code>pBytesRead = reverseMe.402173 -> 0</code></pre> means that at address <pre><code>402173</code></pre> is currently <pre><code>0</code></pre>,\n\n<pre><code>Buffer = reverseMe.40211A -> 00</code></pre> means that at address <pre><code>40211A</code></pre> is currently <pre><code>00</code></pre>.\n\n\nBut why <pre><code>0</code></pre> in the first case, and <pre><code>00</code></pre> in the second one?\nBecause - again - OllyDbg wants to help you. It is smart enough to correctly interpret the meaning of the memory content — in a given context — for you, a human:\n\nIn the first case (<pre><code>pBytesRead</code></pre>), the expected data is a number, so it converts the double-word (4 consecutive bytes; LPDWORD in the documentation means Long Pointer to Double-Word) into a decimal number (<pre><code>0</code></pre> in your case):\n\n\nin the second case (<pre><code>Buffer</code></pre>), the expected data is a byte (e.g. a character), so it shows it as an ASCII-character (e.g. <pre><code>'p'</code></pre>) if it is possible, or as 2 hexadecimal digits otherwise (<pre><code>00</code></pre> in your case):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Size (Number of Bytes to Read) = 70 means? Does it mean that the program should read <pre><code>70</code></pre> decimal?\n\n\nYes - more precisely, at most (maximum) 70 bytes.\n",
