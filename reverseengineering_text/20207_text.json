    "content": "I'm reversing an ELF x86 binary which apparently has anti-reversing/anti-debuging protections, and one of the first thing the ELF does is to call a sys_signal with a SIGTRAP value :\n<pre><code>.text:08048063                 mov     eax, 48         ; sys_signal\n.text:08048068                 mov     ebx, 5          ; SIGTRAP\n.text:0804806D                 mov     ecx, offset sub_80480E2\n.text:08048072                 int     80h             ; LINUX - sys_signal\n.text:08048074                 jmp     short loc_8048077\n</code></pre>\nI have three questions :\n\nFirst, am I right to think that the purpose of this is to create a handler for the SIGTRAP signal, probably in order to prevent any debuger use\nSecond, if this is creating a SIGTRAP handler, I should find a <pre><code>__sighandler_t</code></pre> at <pre><code>sub_80480E2</code></pre>, according to this x86 syscall table. How can I setup IDA so that it recognizes it as a __sighandler_t struct?\nThird, I could not find any detailed information about this structure. What is its composition?\n\nI found in <pre><code>signal.h</code></pre> those lines : \n<pre><code>/* Type of a signal handler.  */\ntypedef void (*__sighandler_t) (int);\n</code></pre>\nIs __sighandler_t only a ptr to a function?\nThanks ! Feel free to tell me if I'm not beeing clear or if I forgot a usefull information.\n",

            "content": "First, am I right to think that the purpose of this is to create a\n  handler for the SIGTRAP signal, probably in order to prevent any\n  debuger use\n\nWhen a SIGTRAP is raised, normally the handler given in parameter of <pre><code>signal</code></pre> is called. If you have a debugger attached, this function will not get called.\nIf your handler is never called, you can assume a debugger is attached.\nHere is a simple example:\n<pre><code>#include <signal.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid on_trap(int n)\n{\n        puts(\"on_trap\");\n}\n\nvoid callme(void)\n{\n        puts(\"hello\");\n        __asm__ volatile(\"int $0x03\");\n        puts(\"bye\");\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n        signal(SIGTRAP, on_trap);\n        callme();\n        return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\nNormal run:\n<pre><code>$ ./antidebug\nhello\non_trap\nbye\n</code></pre>\nWith gdb:\n<pre><code>gdb -q antidebug\nReading symbols from antidebug...(no debugging symbols found)...done.\n(gdb) r\nStarting program: /tmp/antidebug\nhello\n\nProgram received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.\n0x0000000008001174 in callme ()\n(gdb) c\nContinuing.\nbye\n</code></pre>\n\nSecond, if this is creating a SIGTRAP handler, I should find a\n  __sighandler_t at sub_80480E2, according to this x86 syscall table. How can I setup IDA so that it recognizes it as a __sighandler_t\n  struct?\n\nsighandler_t is a typedef for a function pointer, not a structure.\nIf you want to define a memory area as a structure, you can use the shortcut <pre><code>ALT+Q</code></pre>.\n\nThird, I could not find any detailed information about this structure.\n  What is its composition?\n\n<pre><code>sub_80480E2</code></pre> contains code, as mentioned this is not a structure but a function pointer.\nImagine you have the syscall <pre><code>sigaction</code></pre> instead, you can simply check the man page to see the structure definition.\nBut IDA Pro has most of structures definition from standard libraries.\n\nIs __sighandler_t only a ptr to a function?\n\nYes.\n",
