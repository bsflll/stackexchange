    "content": "During RCE of a piece of code, I have found this:\n<pre><code>    loc_40244F:\n    mov eax, [ebx+20h]\n    add ebx, 14h\n    test eax, eax\n    jnz loc_402397\n</code></pre>\nWhat I know is that ebx points to the import directory structure of the considered PE file.\nBut when I look at it, I see the following:\n<pre><code>     Import Directory\n     +0 DWORD   OriginalFirstThunk; \n      4 DWORD   TimeDateStamp;\n      8 DWORD   ForwarderChain; \n      c DWORD   Name;\n     10 DWORD   FirstThunk;\n</code></pre>\nSo, to which location is the [ebx+20h] expression pointing ?\nI hope somebody can help me.\nbest regards,\n",

Although the PE documentation states that the last import descriptor must be all 0, having no Name field indicates the other fields are meaningless, so it's enough to only test the Name field.
