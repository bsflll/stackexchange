    "content": "I am debugging with x32dbg a program (x) which at some point opens another program (y). Is it possible to continue debugging also on program (y) when opened by the first one (x)?\nUnfortunately, program y must necessarily be opened by x otherwise an error will occur, so it is not possible to debug program y individually.\nThanks for any reply.\n",
