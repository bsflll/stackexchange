    "content": "Whenever I try to debug a 3D game through VMware and IDA Pro, an \"access violation\" pops up.\nThe error occurs in the body of the program after memory is allocated by the operator New.\n\nMemory is allocated\npointer is not null\n\nbut, when trying to write to the allocated memory, an error occurs.\nIf I try to debug the program in x64dbg and turn on the \"hide debugger\" option, this problem does not arise.\nHowever, it is inconvenient to work through this debugger, because I'm debugging a game that only runs in full screen.\nso, how to hide Remote Windows Debugger in IDA Pro?\n",
