This will give you the way to alter that process IO.\nBut why would you do that? This will look like pretty malicious activity.\nAre you sure, there is no way to solve your problem without doing what you've asked?\nUpdate - I hope what you are saying is true.\n\nCode injection - will explain the injection with several examples:\n\n\nIntroduction\n  Windows Hooks\n  The CreateRemoteThread & LoadLibrary Technique\n    -- Interprocess Communications  \nThe CreateRemoteThread & WriteProcessMemory Technique\n    -- How to Subclass a Remote Control With this Technique\n     When to Use this Technique  \n\n\nAPI Hooking\n\nAlso, do some searching on the subject of hooking, there are a lot info on the Net.\n",
