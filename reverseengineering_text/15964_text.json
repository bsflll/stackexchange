    "content": "I have two files that have the extension <pre><code>.P1</code></pre> and <pre><code>.P2</code></pre>\nThese files are ROM sound files from a particular 'real world' fruit machine (also known as a slot machine).\nThere is some Fruit Machine emulation software (MFME) that reads both the sound ROM files and the game ROM files in order recreate the fruit machine within a PC.\nI'm playing around creating my own fruit machine with the editor side of MFME, based on an existing fruit machine, and want to edit the sounds on this machine.\nUnfortunately MFME doesn't have the functionality to edit sound files, only to read them.\nThe sound ROMs are apparently comprise of all the sounds packed one after another with a table at the start pointing to where each sound file is (lots of short beeps, buzzes, pings etc as you would expect from a fruit machine).\nDoes anyone know what software I would need to edit these files in order to insert my own sounds? I originally thought I would need a disassembler but when I downloaded one it wouldn't open them as they weren't either .exe or .dll files (I tried changing the extension of the file but the disassembler still knew they weren't the correct type of file).\nHow can I go about reverse engineering these files in order to edit them? Any ideas?\nThanks. :-)\n",

            "content": "The MFME source code is available to read.\nYou'll probably want to start with interface.cpp, which has most of the logic for deciding which sound format to load in <pre><code>TForm1::Load(String)</code></pre>. There are at least ten or so different formats from the look of it.\nYou can then take a look at <pre><code>sample.cpp</code></pre> which has the implementation for loading files. <pre><code>LoadJPMSound</code></pre> is of particular interest, but there are other formats to consider.\nHere are the key facts for JPM sounds:\n\nFile starts with a 1-byte sample count prefix (so I guess 255 samples max?) \nNext comes a 4-byte magic number (0x5569A55A)\nAfter that there's some sort of page table which describes the addresses of the sound data within the ROM.\nEach audio \"page\" has a 1-byte flag value at the start. The two MSBs specify the kind of sound.\n\n\n00 means silence, where the remainder of the byte (i.e. <pre><code>flag & 0x3F</code></pre>) specifies how long the silence should be in increments of 20 samples. A zero value here means an empty audio sample.\n01 means there are 256 \"nibbles\" of audio. I'm not sure if this means 4-bit values but I haven't seen any bit manipulation in the decoding. The sample rate is set to 160000 divided by the remainder of the flag value plus one.\n10 means the same as above, except the number of \"nibbles\" is stored as a byte following the flag.\n11 means that the sample is a repeating loop. The number of repeats is computed as <pre><code>(flag & 0x7) + 1</code></pre>.\n\n\nFor YMZ samples, the file contains 250 sample entries, each consisting of:\n\n16-bit masked sample count, compute as <pre><code>count = (((value & 0xFF00) >> 8) / 6) * 1000</code></pre>\nHigh byte of buffer pointer.\nHigh byte of sample pointer.\nMid byte of buffer pointer.\nMid byte of sample pointer.\nLow byte of buffer pointer.\nLow byte of sample pointer.\nSample data in the following format:\n\n\n4-bit YMZ280B format sample data (channel A)\n4-bit YMZ280B format sample data (channel B)\n\n\nThe YMZ280B format is step-based format where each next signal value in the wave is encoded as the difference from the previous signal value (or 0 for the first sample). The 4-bit value is an index to a lookup table containing the possible steps: The step LUT is calculated as follows:\n<pre><code>// nib from 0000 to 1111\nfor (nib = 0; nib < 16; nib++) {\n    int value = (nib & 0x07) * 2 + 1;\n    diff_lookup[nib] = (nib & 0x08) ? -value : value;\n}\n</code></pre>\nThat should hopefully get you started. The source code should get you the rest.\n",

I'm not sure if I can potentially make a 'local' version of MFME that would allow me to overwrite existing sounds. Probably way beyond my technical ability but will be an avenue I'll explore. Thanks for all the info you've provided, you've really helped me along. Cheers :)</span>",
