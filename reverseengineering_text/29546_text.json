            "content": "I expect that the compiler emitted two different symbol references in the two LEA instructions, and uses the compare instruction to detect at run time whether the two symbols were resolved to the same address at link time. Many modern compilers/linkers offer \"link time code generation\" aka \"whole program optimization\", where the compiler's optimizer runs at link time. In such a system, there would be no need for a runtime check, but the compiler is (re-)called at link time and can optimize (in this case: eliminate/not generate the dead path) in response to seeing all modules getting linked together.\n",
