            "content": "In the paper Heart of Darkness - exploring the uncharted backwaters of HID iCLASS TM security\n is a technique described (section III.C) that might work,but it does require a working device which might not be at hand in your situation.\nIn short they use a TTL-232 cable in synchronous bit bang mode to emulate the PIC programmer. They then override the boot block by a special dumper firmware. Why it seems to work:\n\nMicrochip PIC microcontrollers internal memory is an EEPROM which means that data are stored and erase by pages (which hold a predefined amount of data).\n  The \"key\" point is that , whenever memory is copy protected, individual blocks can be erased resetting the copy protection bits only for these blocks.\n",
