            "content": "It seems that an exception happens in the program you’re debugging but is not handled by the debugger, so it escapes to the OS-wide exception handler (WER) which offers you to handle it with the visual studio debugger, but this is not possible because it’s already being debugged by x64dbg so you get this error message. You have two options:\n\nEdit x64dbg exception settings to make sure no exceptions are ignored  so you can catch it in x64dbg and debug the reason. If the program has its own exception handler, let the exception happen, step through handler and find out why it’s not being handled properly.\nDetach x64dbg and debug the exception in Visual Studio.\n\nHowever, it is indeed possible that the program has some kind of anti-debugging technique which allows exception to escape to the OS instead of catching it in the debugger.\n",
