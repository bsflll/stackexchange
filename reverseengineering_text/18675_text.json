    "content": "I'm currently trying to understand a peculiar behaviour with a shellcode. When reaching a MOV instruction just before an interrupt the shellcode get modified:\n\nAs you can see on the radare2 output, my shellcode is still there before the mov instruction, but once I step into it all the shellcode seems scrambled. I tried this shellcode on an ubuntu virtualbox VM.\nThe target binary is taken from RPISEC lab3B.\nThe shellcode come from pwntools, I tested it first directly from the lib and it works on the VM. I'm wondering how executing a mov instruction can have such an impact especially since I'm not getting any sigsev.\n",
