    "content": "I recently purchased a Uniden Radio Scanner (BCD325P2). I looked at the Windows FW Update App in dnSpy, then pulled the FW bin directly.\nFCC Parts List gets me R5F5631BCDFP#V0, which appears to be a Renesas Electronics 32-bit Microcontrollers - MCU RX631 1MB/128KB.\nThe latest FW bin for this model is here:\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/vp2drmh7dvgjpfi/BCD325P2_V1_08_01.bin/file\nThe FW bin looks packed or obfuscated, there are no strings and binwalk shows nothing.\nCould someone point me in the right direction?\nI would really like to get this loaded into a disassembler.\n",
