    "content": "My college has its ERP platform in a Flash interface, accessible only via Internet Explorer. I am looking into ways I can interface with it via things like ruffle. So I can write my own frontend using modern frameworks. Thing is, accessing the ERP from anything other Internet Explorer results in the browser download a Flash file <pre><code>campus-lynx.swf</code></pre>. This means the platform is locked to Windows only. Flashfox on Android works as well.\nThe ERP is available directly at erp.nitdelhi.ac.in or clicking \"internet\" at the top of nitdelhi.ac.in.\n",

Even site itself state \"Best Peformed With Mozilla FireFox Version 2 and above\".\nMost recent Firefox versions start dropping Flash support, that may be the case. But you always can install portable version of Firefox 52 without this issue.\nJudging by controls look and feel the application was build with Adobe Flex Builder.\nThere was several commercial Flash decompilers such as https://www.eltima.com/products/flashdecompiler/\nYou can try to decompile SWF file to figure out protocols being used.\nMost probably there is something standard such as XML or Action Message Format.\nUPD: Network activity tab in browser clearly indicate usage of AMF protocol. There is a plenty of AMF support libraries for various programming languages. Google it.\n",
