Also devices with big FPGAs are going to be useless since you won't be able to get inexpensive tooling for them. Your best bet is to just buy a board with a Spartan-6 LX75 on it since that is the biggest the no added cost tools support. Alternatives aren't worth much consideration unless you want cheap over performance. If it isn't an FPGA board designed for reprogramming it probably isn't worth your time.\n",
