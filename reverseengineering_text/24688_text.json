            "content": "This is an \"operator overload\" member function, specifically a conversion operator.\nThis function is called when you treat the value of the object instance (in this case, a <pre><code>string</code></pre>, as a different type (in this case, an <pre><code>unsigned long</code></pre>).\nFor example, if there is a function that expects an unsigned long as an argument, but you pass a string object instead, this operator member will be called to convert the string to match the type.\nThere are many types of conversions, such as casting:\n<pre><code>string a = ...;\nunsigned long b;\n\nb = a; //or:\nb = (unsigned long)a;\n</code></pre>\nYou can find more information here:\nhttps://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/cast_operator\n",
