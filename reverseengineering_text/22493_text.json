    "content": "I am trying to learn about injecting a DLL into a process and I wanted to simply execute a code which injects an already built DLL so that I could then check with OllyDbg if it worked.\nI am using the code below for this:\n<pre><code>LPCSTR DllPath = \"E:\\\\testdll.dll\";\nGetWindowThreadProcessId(FindWindowA(0, \"Calculator\"), &ProcessId);\nHANDLE hProcess = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, ProcessId);\nLPVOID pDllPath = VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, 0, strlen(DllPath) + 1, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE);\nWriteProcessMemory(hProcess, pDllPath, (LPVOID)DllPath, strlen(DllPath) + 1, 0);\nHANDLE hLoadThread = CreateRemoteThread(hProcess, 0, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandleA(\"Kernel32.dll\"), \"LoadLibraryA\"), pDllPath, 0, 0);\nWaitForSingleObject(hLoadThread, INFINITE);\n</code></pre>\nApparently this worked (I have added a MessageBox inside the DLL in order to check that) but I can't find my DLL inside the 'Executable Modules' in OllyDbg. Also, the code inside the DLL keeps running even if I close the process it was injected into.\nWhat did I do wrong?\n",

            "content": "After the target process is gone the code should not be running anymore, which makes me suspect you inject into a different process.\nTry printing your <pre><code>ProcessId</code></pre>.\nIf <pre><code>FindWindow</code></pre> or <pre><code>GetWindowThreadProcessId</code></pre> fail, you'll likely end up injecting into pid 0 (the idle process). I'm a bit surprised that it works, but it would explain why your DLL code is actually executed, not visible in the calculator module list and persists even after exiting the calculator.\n",
