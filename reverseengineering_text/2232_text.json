    "content": "I have the following data:\n<pre><code>.data:004305FC word_4305FC     dw 1583h                \n.data:004305FC                                         \n.data:004305FE word_4305FE     dw 35B6h                \n.data:00430600                 dw 6835h\n.data:00430602                 dw 6553h\n.data:00430604                 dw 6351h\n.data:00430606                 dw 23F5h\n.data:00430608                 dw 6845h\n.data:0043060A                 dw 6344h\n.data:0043060C                 dw 6823h\n.data:0043060E                 dw 2342h\n.data:00430610                 dw 2474h\n...\n</code></pre>\nIn addition, I have the following disassembly of the code accessing the data:\n<pre><code>...\nmov     eax, [ebp+Variable_1]\nxor     ecx, ecx\nmov     cx, word_4305FE[eax*2]\n...\nmov     eax, [ebp+Variable_1]\nxor     edx, edx\nmov     dx, word_4305FC[eax*2]\n...\n</code></pre>\nIt looks like array within another array. Am I correct? If not, what do you think the data structure is? If it is a single array, why is it been accessed through 2 different \"heads\" <pre><code>word_4305fc</code></pre> and <pre><code>word_4305FE</code></pre>?\nThank you.\nADDED:\nThe following is in response to the comments below. Thank you, guys, so much for your input! I really do appreciate it and RE community in general. I feel as if my question needs certain clarification. I do realize that this is an array. I also clearly see that <pre><code>Variable_1</code></pre> is an index to the array. In addition, I can see iteration. However, it is not my question. What I am really looking for is clarification or possibly an explanation. How would I be able to distinguish if this array is indeed more complex data type? Why did compiler choose to refer to this data type with 2 different angles: using 2 global variables both <pre><code>word_4305fc</code></pre> and <pre><code>word_4305FE</code></pre>? Is there a specific reason for it? Is it an indication of more complex data type?\n",

            "content": "As Dcoder indicated, an array of <pre><code>short</code></pre> data types begins at the lower address, and the increment of the base of the array by <pre><code>2</code></pre> corresponds to adding <pre><code>1</code></pre> to the index.  Consider the following C code:\n<pre><code>short array[256];\n\n// ...\ncx = array[variable_1+1];\n// ...\n\n// ...\ndx = array[variable_1];\n// ...\n</code></pre>\nConsider the choices that the compiler has in compiling these snippets of code.  It could produce code like this:\n<pre><code>mov eax, [ebp+Variable_1]\nxor ecx, ecx\nmov cx, word_4305FC[eax*2+2] ; note the +2 and the -FC address\n</code></pre>\nOr maybe:\n<pre><code>mov eax, [ebp+Variable_1]\ninc eax ; note this\nxor ecx, ecx\nmov cx, word_4305FC[eax*2] ; note the -FC address\n</code></pre>\nOr, in the case of what you posted, this is an equivalent code sequence:\n<pre><code>mov eax, [ebp+Variable_1]\nxor ecx, ecx\nmov cx, word_4305FE[eax*2] ; note the -FE address\n</code></pre>\nWhat the compiler did was to eliminate the \"+2\" in the address displacement, or the \"inc eax\" in the index computation, and replaced it by adding 1*sizeof(short) to the address of the array.  This allows for a more optimized computation that does not have any increments taking place at runtime.\n",
