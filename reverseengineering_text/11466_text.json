Disassemble the next opcode. You will read some data sections and get invalid opcodes. You may skip the process or mark these \"instructions\" as bad and proceed until you get the next valid opcode and resume as described.\nRecursive Traversal\nRead the first N-bytes until you get a correct opcode. Proceed until you disassemble any sort of jump, store your current position, follow the jump and proceed as described. Stop disassembly when you get an invalid opcode and resume at the previously stored position.\nBoth approaches require some basic information like\n\nWhere does your program code start?\nWhat architecture is the code for?\n\nSome of these information are part of the header (e.g., in PE- oder ELF-Files).\nThe Linux Interactive DisAssembler (LIDA) has a short introduction how the program disassembles the code and how objdump does its work. This is a good starting point to get familiar with the topic.\n",

And note that .text is only a name for the segment, you can call it .flups for all the OS cares.\nThe things that are interesting is that:\n\nThe OEP is within that section\nThe section has Read and Execute rights.\n\nA disassembler can just jump to EOP and start reading bytes (opcodes) (http://ref.x86asm.net/). It can just start reading from the top down or it can also enumerate the results, eg follow calls/jmps in order to find weird code.\nAlso, in the DosHeader there is a reference to where the PE here starts. This one has the OEP for you.\nReading the radare source code can help you really understanding disassemblers.\n",

For example, ScratchABit is written in Python, is very easy to study and hack on.\n",
