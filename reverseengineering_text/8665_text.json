    "content": "I am following this tutorial on reverse engineering. In the step where I \"search for all referenced strings\" I get a window as follows:\n\nWhen compared to the image on the tutorial for the step, I found that the column headings of my window are : Address Command Comments where as according to the tutorial it is supposed to be: Address Disassembly Text String (It is not seen on the tutorial but I dig the internet before making this post).\nI am using Windows 8.1. I have run Ollydbg as administrator with compatibility mode for Windows 7 and Windows XP SP3, used Ollydbg 1.10 and 2.0 but I get same results. The module loaded is also the correct (not the ntdll). The exe version is a different one but I installed it and the overall functionality of the new version is still the same - gives out the exactly same error message for invalid registration.\nWhat am I doing wrong/missing here?? What might be the reason of this and how can I overcome it?\n",

I guess this problem might have been occurred because your version doesn't support OS architecture or to be more specific, it doesn't have the proper plugins.\n\nSuggestions:\n\nTry to use \"R4ndoms_OllyDBG\" mod of OllyDBG... it's compatible with Win 7/8 x86/x64.\nDon't go after strings, try to go after the api (that you think it's being implemented), or you can look in the stack.\nUse another debugger like x64dbg or IDA Pro.\n",

Watch the first 20 videos because each one has great amount of info.If you just want to find that specfic tutorial, you'll find it easily because it has an appendix (ex. html file) listing the most important APIs. Also, you can use IDAFactor plugin to do so, still I advice you to watch the series to know exactly what you are doing.</span>",
