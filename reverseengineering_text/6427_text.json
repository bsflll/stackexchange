    "content": "I have a target application protected with CrypKey.\nWhen i try to attach to the apps in OllyDbg and Ida Pro i receive Unable to attach to this process.\nThe bad news is that i want to unpack the main exe after executing of Crypkey loader but after patching main exe and loader to obtain an infinite loop at the end of the code of the loader i am unable to attach to main exe and reach the OEP.\nDo you know how or why i am unable to attack? A good solution in this cases?\nThank you very much\nSee image below:\n",

At the end of this process i need to return to main exe and continue debugging to reach the OEP. I am unable to do it because the main exe refuse to be attached as process from any debugger. I hope that now the scenario it's more clear.</span>",

If such is the case check whether you can attach to the main process before the loader process is created. If you cannot, then the main exe may well be <a href=\"http://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2856/how-to-attach-debugger-or-start-analysis-of-process-that-is-debugging-itself\">debugging itself</a>.</span>",
