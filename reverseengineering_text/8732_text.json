            "content": "I don't know about existence of such an ability in IDA, but you can do it with IDAPython as follows:\n<pre><code>#I didn't check this code, use carefully, beware of errors\n\nimport idc\nimport idaapi\nimport idautils\n\ndef set_breakpoints_on_calls(ea):\n    print \"Setting breakpoints on \", hex(ea)\n    for ref in idautils.CodeRefsTo(ea, 0):\n        print \"Adding bpt on \", hex(ref)\n        idc.AddBpt(ref)\n\ndef set_breakpoints_on_screen_ea():\n    print \"Started\"\n    set_breakpoints_on_calls(idc.ScreenEA())\n\nidaapi.add_hotkey(\"Alt-Z\", set_breakpoints_on_screen_ea)\n</code></pre>\nBy running this code from execute script window you are adding hotkey Alt-Z\nwhich sets breakpoints to all calls to the address where cursor is located.\nYou can add this code to <pre><code>idapythonrc.py</code></pre> file in IDA root folder to make this shortcut persistent (you'll need to rerun IDA after it).\n",
