If its smaller than the original <pre><code>pyc</code></pre> you can replace the corresponding bytes in the exe.  However its a bit more work as pyinstaller stores the pyc, zlib compressed. You have to edit the pyinstxtractor script and comment out the statements which does the zlib decompression Line 239: <pre><code>if entry.cmprsFlag == 1:</code></pre>. So original <pre><code>gui.pyc</code></pre> get replaced with your modified pyc. Do note that both have pyc header removed and are zlib compressed.\n",
