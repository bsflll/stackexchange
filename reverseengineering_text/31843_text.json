    "content": "Based on Detailed API call descriptions not available in x64dbg\nWhen I debug a known API call like for example WSARecv, in OllyDbg I can nicely see the parameters in the stack:\n\nI've installed both plugins: xAnalyzer & APIInfo\n\n\nBut I can't get x64dbg (in this case x32dbg) to show the parameters like Olly:\n\nI tried to <pre><code>right click in CPU window -> xAnalyzer -> Analyze module</code></pre> but didn't make any difference...\nRight now I'm using OllyDbg and x32dbg simoultaneusly only because of this... How can I see in x32dbg the parameters like I can see nicely in Olly?\n",
