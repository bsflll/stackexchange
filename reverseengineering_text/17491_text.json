    "content": "While reverse engineering a game using the Hex Rays decompiler I was looking for how an array of NPC's was accessed. I found the array but I don't quite understand the unusual formula for getting the index of the NPC. First an integer is <pre><code>&</code></pre> with <pre><code>0xFFF</code></pre> then the result is multiplied by 4 to get the index.\nExample:\n<pre><code>dword_1F4A8A5C[4 * (v3 & 0xFFF)]\n</code></pre>\nI'm really not sure if this is standard or if it's weird output from the Hex Rays decompiler. If anyone has an explanation please let me know. Thanks.\n",

And I had the misconception that it was an array of pointers to structures. Not an actual array of structures. Thank you, you've helped tremendously. If you would like you can turn it into an answer and I'll accept it.\n",
