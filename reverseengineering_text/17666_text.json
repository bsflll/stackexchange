            "content": "LDR loads a 32-bit constant (LDRH (halfword): 16 bit, LDRB (byte): 8 bit) from memory into the specified target register (r0 in your example).\nSince 32-bit constants cannot be encoded in 32-bit opcodes (or 16-bit for Thumb instructions), the assembler stores the constant in the text segment close to the referencing instruction and then references the value using (usually) PC-relative addressing, i.e. some offset from r15.\nThus, ldr is in fact a pseudo instruction. The following code\n<pre><code>    .code 32\nmain:\n    ldr r0, =0x12345678\n    bx lr\n</code></pre>\nis translated by the assembler into\n<pre><code>00000000 <main>:\n       0:   e51f0000    ldr r0, [pc, #-0]   ; 8 <main+0x8>\n       4:   e12fff1e    bx  lr\n       8:   12345678    .word   0x12345678\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see, the constant referenced in the original ldr instruction is in fact stored at address 0x8 instead of in the instruction itself. The ldr instruction at address 0 then references this value using PC-relative addressing. The offset to the PC is 0 (instead of 8), since the actual PC value is always the address of the current instruction + 8 - this is an effect of the early ARM processor pipeline which has to be preserved for compatibility.\n",

            "content": "<pre><code>ldr</code></pre> without <pre><code>=</code></pre> does PC relative loads\nThis is true for both labels and numbers.\nBut you will of course rarely use numbers directly in your assembly. Maybe you have provided some disassembly without labels?\nBoth of the following work in GNU GAS ARMv8. With a label:\n<pre><code>    ldr x0, pc_relative_ldr\n    b 1f\npc_relative_ldr:\n    .quad 0x123456789ABCDEF0\n1:\n    /* x0 == 0x123456789ABCDEF0 */\n</code></pre>\nwith an offset:\n<pre><code>    ldr x0, 0x8\n    b 1f\n    .quad 0x123456789ABCDEF0\n1:\n    /* x0 == 0x123456789ABCDEF0 */\n</code></pre>\nBoth are equivalent. The assembler just happens to convert the label into the correct offset for you.\nGitHub upstream with assertions.\nSTR does not have PC-relative addressing like LDR in ARMv8, you just have to calculate the address into registers first: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28638981/howto-write-pc-relative-adressing-on-arm-asm/54480999#54480999\n",
