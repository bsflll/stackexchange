    "content": "I'm working on a native binary patching library. It currently works on Linux and I'm trying to add Windows support.\nFor that, I need to implement a way to enumerate all functions in a PE binary (EXE) or shared library (DLL). For libraries, iterating exported functions is good enough.\nHowever, I need a way to get a list of functions in the running executable, together with addresses that I can call.\nOn Linux, I used <pre><code>libelf</code></pre> for this, but I have no idea what to use for PEs.\nThe target executable is unstripped, but there's no source code.\n",

You can learn more about the PE format here.\nSadly this directory only contains information about where the corresponding metadata (<pre><code>.pdb</code></pre> file) is. A pdb may be generated when compiling along with the executable / library.\nA <pre><code>pdb</code></pre> file is composed from different Streams. You are most propably interessted in the <pre><code>Global Symbol Stream</code></pre>.\nI would suggest trying any <pre><code>.pdb</code></pre> parser (I don't think there is a complete implementation out there) to parse it.
