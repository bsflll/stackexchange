    "content": "I have a board that is using kline to communicate and I have a tool that can read the software from that board. I want to see the communication that is happening between the two to see how the tool is able to read the firmware from that board.\nI didn't find any tool or any information on how to sniff kline packets. Found only how to sniff CAN packets.\nI it is possible to sniff data using arduino or raspberry or any other tool.\nAll I'm interested in is making a software that can read the firmware from that board.\n",
