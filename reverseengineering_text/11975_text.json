    "content": "I have recently been sifting my way through a whole load of assembly to try to identify how a program is decrypting some data. Thus far I have identified how the IV is extracted, that the IV is 16 bytes long and that the decryption method uses Cipher Block Chaining. Consequently I believe that the encryption method being used is AES-128-CBC. \nThe next step has been to try to identify the key being used to decrypt with, the issue is that the assembly for the individual block cipher encryption is about 2.5MB in size. However, what I have observed is that it is all of a very similar form, for example, a snippet:\n<pre><code>add.w      r0, r12, #0x13\nstr.w      r0, [lr, #0x44]\ntst.w      r0, #0xff\nmov        r0, r12\nit         eq\neoreq      r0, r12, #0x75\n\nadd.w      r1, r12, #0x5d\nstr.w      r1, [sp, #0xf00]\ntst.w      r1, #0xff\nit         eq\naddeq      r0, #0x3b\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>r12</code></pre> contains the encrypted data, loaded from a passed in argument (<pre><code>r0</code></pre>) as follows:\n<pre><code>mov        r4, r0\nadd.w      lr, sp, #0x1000\nldrb.w     r12, [r4]\n</code></pre>\nAll of the assembly in the subroutine is of the exemplar form, some offset is added to the encrypted data, stored, tested against <pre><code>0xff</code></pre> (always <pre><code>0xff</code></pre>) and then some operation is performed as a result, either XOR, OR, ADD or MOV affecting another register (in the examples that is <pre><code>r0</code></pre>). \nMy current hunch is that this may be an AES-128 implementation with unrolled rounds.\nDoes this look AES-128 to you and do you agree the encryption been deliberately obfuscated to hide the key? If so then how has it been obfuscated and would it be possible to find the key?\nAdditional info\nHere's a link to the full ASM file for the block cipher encryption subroutine.\nAnd this is a link to the subroutine that uses CBC and calls the above subroutine referenced in the main question.\n",

            "content": "I think you identified the purpose of the functions and its parameters correctly. So, the function <pre><code>sub_44d84</code></pre> has four parameters: <pre><code>(<decryptionFunction=0x1>, <IV>, <bytesToDecrypt>, <decryptedBytes>)</code></pre> and calls the <pre><code>sub_46d554</code></pre> function for every blocks using CBC.\nThe <pre><code>sub_46d554</code></pre> function received 2 parameters:\n\n<pre><code>R0</code></pre>: Encrypted input block \n<pre><code>R1</code></pre>: Decrypted output block\n\nThe bytes from the input blocks are read out from the first part of the function, performs the decryption steps and writes out to the output buffer in the last part of the function. \nTo understand the decryption function, first building blocks of the obfuscation should be understand. So, I picked up some example codes after the second bytes was read out from the input block (the start of the function is a little bit messy because of the compiler optimization).\n\nIn the above image the line marked with green reads out the second byte of the input block and the orange line initializes the <pre><code>R2</code></pre> register. The yellow and blue blocks are perform similar functions. Both blocks starts with an addition, stores the result to a local variable and check whether the result was equal to <pre><code>0xFF</code></pre>. If the result was <pre><code>0xFF</code></pre> the value of the <pre><code>R2</code></pre> was changed. Since the <pre><code>R2</code></pre> was changed only if the addition was <pre><code>0xFF</code></pre> and the addition used always the <pre><code>LR</code></pre> (which contained the second byte of the input), the value of the <pre><code>R2</code></pre> register can be changed only once. Because the new <pre><code>R2</code></pre> value depends only from the <pre><code>LR</code></pre> these blocks implements a lookup table, which is a substitution box.\n[EDIT] The lookup table is built up from the building blocks similar to the highlighted ones. So, in pseudo code, the lookup table is implemented in the following way:\n<pre><code>if (input == 0xb1) out = 0x5b\nif (input == 0x42) out = 0x56\n...\n</code></pre>\nTo understand the reason why the result is stored into a local variable, let's check the next usage of the local variable <pre><code>var_1A8</code></pre>.\n\nIt reads out the local variable, which was the result of the addition, and checks whether it is <pre><code>0xFF</code></pre> similar to the previous cases. Since the value of this local variable will be <pre><code>0xFF</code></pre> only if the result of the addition was <pre><code>0xFF</code></pre> in the place, where the value was originally stored, the comparison checks whether the input byte is equal to a specific value again. \nIf we search for the local variable <pre><code>var_1A8</code></pre> in the whole function, we receive a lot of results with a specific patter (<pre><code>STR</code></pre>, <pre><code>LDR</code></pre>, <pre><code>LDR</code></pre>, <pre><code>LDR</code></pre>) repeatedly.\n\nThe <pre><code>STR</code></pre> means the storage of the addition and the <pre><code>LDR</code></pre> means the usage of this addition. So, every bytes are checked four times and than another byte will be used.\nBy comparing all of the input bytes usages with the local variable usages, the following patter can be found:\n<pre><code>i0 = input[0x00]\nd0_0 = table0[i0]\nid = input[0x0d]\nd0_d = table1[id]\nia = input[0x0a]\nd0_a = table2[ia]\ni7 = input[0x07]\nd0_7 = table3[i7]\n\nd1_0 = table4[i0]\nd1_d = table5[id]\nd1_a = table6[ia]\nd1_7 = table7[i7]\n\nd2_0 = table8[i0]\nd2_d = table9[id]\nd2_a = table10[ia]\nd2_7 = table11[i7]\n\nd3_0 = table12[i0]\nd3_d = table13[id]\nd3_a = table14[ia]\nd3_7 = table15[i7]\n</code></pre>\nSo, reads out 4 bytes, performs the substitution and stores the result in a local variable. After it, the same was performed with the next 4 bytes and so on. After the whole block was processed the stored results were read out and xored value of some previous results was used as a new input, for example:\n<pre><code>nb_0 = d0_4 ^ d2_d ^ ...\nd0_0 = table16[nb_0]\nnb_1 = d1_2 ^ d3_8 ^ ...\nd0_1 = table17[nb_1]\n...\n\nd1_0 = table20[nb_0]\nd1_d = table21[nb_1]\n...\n</code></pre>\nBy checking the pattern of the local variable usage, it clearly seen that it uses 9 round of substitution.\nBased on the above, I think, that the decryption function can be an AES-128 implementation. Because the add round key, sub bytes and shift rows steps operations can be implemented with lookup tables in one step, and the mix columns operation in another step. Because there is 9 round only, the initial round and the first round of the AES may be implemented with one lookup table.\nSo, the key (if it is really an AES implementation, the expanded key) is mixed into the implementation. Although I'm not a crytographer, I guess that you may retrieve the expanded AES key by xoring the values of the lookup tables with the Rijndael S-Box values. However, it seems to be a hard and time-consuming process, so you may consider to emulate the code if you want to just decrypt some data.\n",

From the sounds of things it looks like you've identified the intermediate 9 rounds of AES with the <code>SubBytes</code> step (the first pattern you found) and the <code>MixColumns</code> step (the second pattern, XORing with previous results) within each round. That  makes me wonder then about the <code>ShiftRows</code> and <code>AddRoundKey</code> steps. During decryption the last round (10th) will simply add the <i>original</i> key using bitwise XOR, have you seen anything like this at the end of the function?</span>",
