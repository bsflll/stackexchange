    "content": "I am trying to disassemble a few Arm Cortex-M3 .elf binaries and run a custom IDAPython script (script.py) from the command line (in batch mode). I have been able to do that with the following command:\n<pre><code>/path_to_idapro/idat -B -parm:ARMv7-M -logfile.log -S\"/path_to_script/script.py arg1\" elf_to_disassemble\n</code></pre>\nHowever, I need to load an SVD file before running script.py so that my analysis will be complete. In IDA Pro GUI, I do the following:\n\nEdit > Plugins > SVD file management\nSelect the SVD file\n\nHow can I pass the SVD file (e.g., /path_to_SVD/STM32F103.svd) as an argument to my previous command?\nI have already searched the command line switches of IDA Pro https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/417.shtml, and to my understanding, there isnâ€™t such an option.\nI am currently using IDA Pro v7.6 in Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS.\n",

This normally allows you to select plugin modes, but does not allow you to pass strings to your plugin.\nThus, I think there are two not-so-pleasant options:\n\ngenerate idb manually and only then analyse it in batch mode (doesn't make much sense when analysing at scale)\nuse a custom SVD Loader Plugin with a hardcoded file value or passed through configuration file (check out this and this as an input pointers)\n",
