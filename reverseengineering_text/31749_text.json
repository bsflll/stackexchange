    "content": "Im new to reverse engineering and doing a crackme that requires me to make a keygen, yes i know making a keygen isn't a beginner task however im stuborn, i am trying to debug the program to understand what it does to check for a valid key but i continue to get hit with the \"A debugger is present on your computer\" text the program prints out, I am aware of where it is checking for the debugger (i think), i just don't know how to avoid it, i can't patch the file so ive got to avoid it without tampering with the original code, anybody know how to get past this or? Thanks i'd really appreciate it.\n",

(<< this is probably architecture specific)\nSingle step in your debugger. At this point if you're using a debugger like IDA free and viewing in graph mode (hit spacebar to toggle between the listing view and graph view) you should see a flashing line that connects the current code block to the \"bad\" code block. In this case \"bad\" just means the code block that you DON'T want to reach aka the <pre><code>exit()</code></pre> block, etc.\nModify value that was identified in step 3. If you're using IDA free you can right click on the register > modify value. If it's currently a 0 and the bad branch is flashing, generally you can just change it to a non-zero value (e.g. 1) to get the good branch to flash\n\nNote: it is helpful to actually understand how the function works. e.g., if a debugger is present this function will return XX, otherwise it will return YY. That way you're not arbitrarily modifying values... you can do so with intention.\nHope this helps!\n",
