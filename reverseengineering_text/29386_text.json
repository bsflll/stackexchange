    "content": "I am trying to learn the hexrays ctree api. I am using the python bindings.\nThe task I am trying to automate is tracing the arguments to wrmsr instructions.\nI notice that hexrays represents them like this:\n<pre><code>__writemsr(*(_DWORD *)SYSTEM_BUFFER, *((_QWORD *)SYSTEM_BUFFER + 1));\n</code></pre>\nUsing Hexrayscodexplorer I figured out that this is a \"helper\" expression:\n<pre><code>helper __writemsr\nea->FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\nvoid (__fastcall *)(unsigned int, unsigned __int64)\n</code></pre>\nBy the looks of the decompilation output, I expect I should be able to access the arguments to the \"helper\" (<pre><code>*(_DWORD *)SYSTEM_BUFFER, *((_QWORD *)SYSTEM_BUFFER + 1)</code></pre> in this case) - however the spots where I would look for operands or function arguments for a function call (cot_call) aren't populated.\nIs this possible to do?\nI have so far tried to look for arguments in:\n<pre><code>cexpr_t.x\n\ncexpr_t.y\n\ncexpr_t.a\n</code></pre>\nI'm sure I just don't understand how these helper expressions work in IDA. Unfortunately the function I'm trying to analyze is nested very deeply in a huge function, so it's kind of hard to see how all of the trees work together in the ctrees graph view provided by Hexrayscodexplorer.\nAre the arguments held in some other cexpr object? How do I get to them?\n",
