            "content": "Unfortunately there's no easy answer here.\nMost of these tools employ different types of heuristics to determine the version used. Often times just applying binary signatures which could be inaccurate. Without gaining a decent understanding of VMProtect to recognize the differences this will be quite difficult.\nIf tools used are open-source or well-documented, you can go over the signature used to detect the version, and validate it manually once you have a good understanding of the rational behind it.\n",
