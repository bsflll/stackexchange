You need to remove the breakpoint and then assign the trace.\nIf you set a function to be traced, and it doesn't print anything, put the cursor on the desired function, on the menu press <pre><code>Debugger -> Tracing -> Function tracing</code></pre>.  Try again.\nYou can view all the traces in the breakpoint window by pressing  <pre><code>Ctrl+Alt+B</code></pre>.\n",
