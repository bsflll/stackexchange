    "content": "I keep coming across a compiling pattern that IDA doesn't automatically handle well.  Consider the following example:\n<pre><code>mov rax, rsp       ; Set rax at the start of the function\n...\nlea rbp, [rax-5Fh] ; Shortly afterward, set rbp as the frame pointer at a nonstandard offset\n...\nmov [rbp+3Fh], rcx ; Reference all stack offsets from rbp for the rest of the function\n...\n</code></pre>\nIn this example, it appears that IDA has lost track of <pre><code>rbp</code></pre>'s state as an offset into the stack frame, presumably because of the additional indirection.  (We copy from <pre><code>rsp</code></pre> to <pre><code>rax</code></pre> to <pre><code>rbp</code></pre>, rather than just from <pre><code>rsp</code></pre> to <pre><code>rbp</code></pre>)\nI would like the above example to look something more like this:\n<pre><code>var_20= qword ptr -20h\n...\nmov [rbp+5Fh+var_20], rcx\n</code></pre>\nHowever, as one would expect, if I change the type of <pre><code>3Fh</code></pre> to be a stack offset, I get the following:\n<pre><code>arg_37= qword ptr 3Fh\n...\nmov [rbp+arg_37], rcx\n</code></pre>\nWhich is obviously not correct.  I have two questions:\n\nIs it possible to generate the desired output?\nIf not, how would one normally deal with this?\n\nSolutions I am aware of:\n\nI could create a structure for the stack frame and specify the offset delta (occasionally also adjusting for negative offsets).  The downsides are that I would have to create a structure for each stack frame I analyze, and I would also not have cross-references.\nI could just use the incorrect offsets in the stack frame.  This would give me cross-references, but I would expect things to break when touching <pre><code>r</code></pre>, the offset storing the return address.\n\nAlso relevant: I'm using IDA Pro 6.2.\n",
