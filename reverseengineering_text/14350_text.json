    "content": "I have an INS object in the instrumentation function, and I wish to get the actual bytes used to code this instruction. Looking at the INS functions, the closest I found was a function to disassemble it (show the assembly code), where I'm seeking for the actual bytes.\nAssistance is highly appreciated.\n",
