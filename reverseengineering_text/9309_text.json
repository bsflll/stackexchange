    "content": "I bought a decibel meter off amazon recently (http://www.amazon.com/Sound-Measure-Tester-Pressure-Decibel/dp/B00CPKSE38/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436376590&sr=8-1&keywords=wensn) which outputs db measurements to a microsd card. I opened the sd card's content on my computer and encountered four separate *.wsn files, two of which I created and the other two apparently made by the manufacturer in testing perhaps. Anyway, did a google search for the .wsn file extension and can't find anything but something called a \"whoopsie skin file\" which doesn't appear to be what I'm looking for. Can anyone help me find a way to parse this file? I imagine it simply contains a table of information with two columns (db level and time)\nHere's the link to a sample of the file. It is time series data for just a couple of seconds from the decibel meter.\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0yWXI3LgLr4ME1DeUs4SDFMX1E/view?usp=sharing\nUpdate:\nThe db measurement device's manufacturer is \"wensn\", which clearly accounts for the file name extension. I've found two leads so far:\n\nmanufacture website for device (not very helpful, in fact it has been HACKED)\nreverse engineering wensn usb stream data (pretty advanced stuff)\nwensn usb stream github parsing project in python\n\nbut both are for parsing usb streams of *.tmp files from the device, rather than the static wsn files. I'm guessing I could utilize this code to parse the wsn files, but I don't know how to do that yet. Honestly I'm in way over my head at this point.\nI first posted this question meta.stackexchange, you can find that discussion here. The expected output data is columnar, time and decibel level, as seems to be indicated here.\nUpdate 2:\nI think there may be a way to decode this file using the 'sigrok' utility, which is used to read all sorts of serial outputs from scientific sensors.\n",

It would be really helpful if you could use the software that comes with the device, open the file with it, and tell us whatever the software makes of that data.\nBtw, the german vendor Voelkner (they are reputable and i bought from them on several occasions) has a german/english PDF manual of the product, which refers to www.omnitronic.com for the newest version. That web site forwards to a shop that sold the product, doesn't have it in stock anymore, but still has a download page for manual and software. The product looks slightly different, but has the same overall layout and key positions, so there is reason to assume it's the same electronics in a slightly different plastic case, and the software might work for you and even be better than whatever came with your device - the amazon reviews says the software is in chinese and lacks a driver; the zip on \"my\" download page includes a \"Vista Driver\" folder and an installer that seems to support english.\n",

This doesn't look like the data on the usb stream, so that link or the Python project are probably not going to help you much:\n\nFurthermore, there seems to be a counter in columns <pre><code>2</code></pre> and <pre><code>a</code></pre>: <pre><code>51</code></pre>, <pre><code>52</code></pre>, <pre><code>53</code></pre>, ... The bytes in columns <pre><code>6</code></pre> and <pre><code>a</code></pre> are the same. The bytes in column <pre><code>e</code></pre> and <pre><code>2</code></pre> are also the same, but with 2 difference, showing us that this part is not very well aligned. A nicer alignment to further reverse engineer would be to shift column <pre><code>e</code></pre> to the leftmost position or so. \nYou could get a larger sample to see if <pre><code>da</code></pre>, <pre><code>a0</code></pre> and <pre><code>5a</code></pre> are constants or that they are part of the counter, or possibly something else. For example, it could also be that they are actually part of the measurement, but seem to be constant here because the sound level on the moment of measurement was constant.\nIn any case, it seems at this point that only columns <pre><code>0</code></pre>, <pre><code>4</code></pre>, <pre><code>8</code></pre> and <pre><code>c</code></pre> carry data. Once you have confirmed that hypothesis (by looking at more data), you could start generating sounds and see how the data you see relates to the sounds you generate.\nConsidering that the manufacturer uses its own name as an extension, it is unlikely this file has some common-used table format, so I can't give you more tips than this.\nA note about the hex editor. As said, I used vi with xxd (i.e. open the file in vi and then <pre><code>:%!xxd</code></pre>). However, there are plenty of hex editors, also for Windows. I don't know of any that allows you to shift the start column, which would be useful to check alignment.\n",
