    "content": "I'm trying to determine - using IdaPython - if a function prototype is user-defined or have been automatically guessed / defined by IDA (i.e. without specific user interaction).\nThe flag is probably available somewhere but I haven't been able to find it, despite multiple tries.\nAccording to the documentation for the <pre><code>Functions Window</code></pre>:\n\nA bold font is used for functions that have a definite (user-specified) prototype.\n\nFor example (disassembled Windows kernel with PDB), in the Functions window the <pre><code>PsReferenceImpersonationToken</code></pre> function is in bold, and its decompiled code prototype (signature) is in blue:\n\nOn the other hand, the <pre><code>ObReferenceFileObjectForWrite</code></pre> function is not in bold in the Functions window, and its decompiled function prototype is in yellow:\n\nWhat I'd like to find - using IdaPython - is that, given a function <pre><code>ea</code></pre>: is the function prototype user-defined or not? (i.e. bold in functions windows and blue in the decompiler).\nI've tried using <pre><code>cfunc_t</code></pre> and <pre><code>cfuncptr_t</code></pre>, checking the flags between various functions, but nothing definitive came out of it. Tried also with the vds4.py example (with some modifications) but to no avail.\nNote: I'm using IDA Pro 9.0 SP1 and have the x64 decompiler.\n",
