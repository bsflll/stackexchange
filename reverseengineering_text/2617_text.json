To quote VMWare Workstation 9 Documentation Center:\n\nWhen you map a virtual disk and its associated volume to a drive on the host system, you can connect to the virtual disk without opening a virtual machine.\n  After you map the virtual disk to a drive on the host system, you cannot power on any virtual machine that uses the disk until you disconnect the disk from the host system.\n\nThe menu is accessed by:\n\nWindows host: Select File > Map Virtual Disks.\nLinux host: Select File > Mount Virtual Disks.\n",

VMware allows you to use an ISO file directly for the dvd drive, you can do that by going in the hardware settings of your VM, selecting the CD/DVD drive and then selecting the ISO image. Your VM should then boot on the Livecd and you can now do your changes as you normally would.\n",
