    "content": "They are multiple reports of recaptcha v2 bypass. Most of the time, the explanation is neural networks services provided by Google or ɪʙᴍ.\nBut there is something I am failing to understand : for most captcha (and including recaptcha v1) the manually deciphered text is sent directly to the server inside an ʜᴛᴛᴘ header. But with recaptcha v2, response sent to sever looks like :\n<pre><code>g-recaptcha-response:03AJpayVEtSKNOXg7TJwMkmxzLA_HrnWMKm6p0ox6W6hhMcw3Bzxab8ariLgg8Q8wXpUcF8HLkhAd1ixXgNvBDde5ggVXidl3NuHSQcnP4QqJkVvWZ2s4_CQ1lHTw6oNEqXyiBuS3CkiHBhoB5akijJ6ld115K_OWZo6mfB4xz_-I2P36fVqT9VzEUz26wrauN9QZuC6lh80mf-fkxqCPmNYSOcMrHxR33Flby05gzo5cD1B-2FucaoFP11p2svvZrWC_vAjz5bGOzW0DufM2kkdtLIlhzl9GBzm_chyirSJItHGdz0bMuxDYZkRKY8c4gXUmzT09VEgivi032zZnNXtrVA04gXF5yE0tAtnGTwi31hMdzumPoc6GdLdIbvfbXgdyndocCLIph-j9T8ePf3JO8Jfcf6BNcmUKT2SrhZjIAPUOZV2Mg7Qua_s4zNHYx1-NE8zoe9SG-VxuPbx2sjR32ce4oapa6VA\n</code></pre>\neven with an audio to text sample.
