But also then if the resource is on the client computer it is possible to extract them from memory.\n",

The NUL terminator will  make WinZip or WinRAR unable to extract files (and also read file names).\n\n\nHowever, none of these increases security. Resources will be able to get decrypted or extracted, these are only \"simple tricks\" to prevent standard reading / extraction. But people with enough knowledge will be able to bypass them and fix the files.\n",
