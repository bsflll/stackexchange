    "content": "Im developing a plugin in which I would like to be notified when user makes some modification to the code. I know there is a patch table which can be accessed through <pre><code>Plugingetvalue</code></pre> function but I would like to do some actions as soon as user modifes code and not to check patch table every now and then. Is it possible to do this and how?\n",
