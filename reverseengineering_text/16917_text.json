            "content": "arm64 syscall numbers are defined at: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.17/include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h\nThis is a bit confusing since it is quite different from x86 and x86_64 and arm 32-bit which define syscall numbers under <pre><code>arch/</code></pre>, e.g. <pre><code>arch/arm/tools/syscall.tbl</code></pre> for arm 32-bit, but the arm64 file has a comment saying:\n\nNew architectures should use this file and implement the less feature-full calls in user space.\n\nso I'm guessing that it is just because aarch64 is new and used a newer more arch agnostic mechanism, while the old ones can never break userland compatibility and thus cannot be updated to the new mechanism.\nThis is corroborated by the following minimal runnable aarch64 assembly Linux call example that works on QEMU and uses <pre><code>64</code></pre> for <pre><code>write</code></pre> and <pre><code>93</code></pre> for <pre><code>exit</code></pre>:\nmain.S\n<pre><code>.text\n.global _start\n_start:\n    /* write */\n    mov x0, #1\n    ldr x1, =msg\n    ldr x2, =len\n    mov x8, #64\n    svc #0\n\n    /* exit */\n    mov x0, #0\n    mov x8, #93\n    svc #0\nmsg:\n    .ascii \"hello world\n\"\nlen = . - msg\n</code></pre>\nGitHub upstream.\nAssemble and run:\n<pre><code>aarch64-linux-gnu-as -o main.o main.S\naarch64-linux-gnu-ld -o main.out main.o\nqemu-aarch64 main.out\n</code></pre>\nTested in Ubuntu 16.04 amd64.\n<pre><code>strace</code></pre> source code\nThis is a good place to easily cheat to check the syscall numbers, see: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/421750/where-do-you-find-the-syscall-table-for-linux/499016#499016\nIt also confirms what I said about newer archs seeming to have unified call numbers.\n",
