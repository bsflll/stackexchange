    "content": "I am trying to analyze a .NET file that I suspect is malicious. The file is protected by XerinObfuscator and also has Anti-dnSpy and Anti-debug protection. I tried to use de4dot to deobfuscate it, but encountered an error. Here are the details: (Sorry for my english)\nFile info:\n<pre><code>File name: WIN.exe\nFile size: 10.24 MB\nBase address: 0000000000400000\nEntry point: 0000000000400000\nMIME type: application/x-dosexec\n</code></pre>\nProtection and obfuscation:\n<pre><code>Obfuscator: XerinObfuscator\nProtection:\n    Anti-debug\n    Anti-dnSpy\n    Obfuscation (Modified EP + CLR constructor + Strange EP position + Strange sections)\n    Packer: Compressed or packed data (High entropy + Section 0 compressed)\n</code></pre>\nTools used:\n<pre><code>de4dot: An error occurs when attempting to deobfuscate:\n    Copy\n\n    Unhandled exception: System.ApplicationException: Invalid new target, it's null\n    in de4dot.blocks.Block.ReplaceLastInstrsWithBranch(Int32 numInstrs, Block target)\n\n    The file is recognized as protected by an unknown obfuscator, but the deobfuscation terminates with an error.\n\nDetect It Easy: Confirms the presence of obfuscation and protection mechanisms.\n\n    Additional details:\n\n        Linker: Microsoft Linker\n        Language: C#\n        Libraries: .NET Framework 4.8, Costura.Fody, Guna UI\n        Tool: Visual Studio\n        Protectors: ByteGuard, XerinObfuscator\n</code></pre>\nWhat I tried:\n\nUsing de4dot (de4dot-cex).\nUsing dnSpy (but the file has Anti-dnSpy protection, and I got many errors).\nUsing ExtremeDumper, the file closes immediately even if I open it without other programs running.\nAnalyzed via VirusTotal - see https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/b7d7b3ffcff7b9574369aa9af6e9f155861f9bcf3c55434c8b89a6ffef6f8d6f\nAnalyzing via Install and Follow in Uninstall Tool (Found only that the file saves the screenshot to a randomly named folder in the images folder and has a random name and .jpeg format).\n\nQuestion:\n\nIs there any way to bypass XerinObfuscator and Anti-dnSpy protection?\nWhat tools or methods can be used to deobfuscate such a file?\nHow can I analyze the behavior of a program if it is protected by Anti-debug?\n\nAdditional information:\n\nThe file is probably malicious (stiller) as it saves screenshots to a hidden folder.\nScreenshot from DIE: https://ibb.co/cH70Kb7\nOn the Xerin's Github, I found a Telegram channel where there was a link to some stiller, and the author (Repo's author) is SmokeLoader.\nScreenshot with errors and files that dnSpy was able to get (I apologize that in Russian): https://ibb.co/HLr3ZQsH, https://ibb.co/W4kZS957.\nFile download (30 days): https://easyupload.io/ht0xzt\nFile found in Telegram channel - https://t.me/+KxxtvBVmA25mYzhi (@SATURN_SOFTWARE), message link - https://t.me/c/2053026588/8893\n.NET Deobfuscators list - https://github.com/NotPrab/.NET-Deobfuscator\n",
