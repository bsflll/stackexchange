    "content": "Since now, when I am analyzing a binary, I'm using a \"pen and paper\" method to locate the different location of the function, the different type of obfuscations, and all my discoveries. It is quite inefficient and do not scale at all when I try to analyze big binaries.\nI know that IDAPro is having a data-base to store comments and a memory zone, but, in case we do not want to use IDAPro, what techniques or (free) tools are you using to collect your notes and to display it properly ?\n",
