    "content": "I have a file used to flash new firmware to a phone and I need to unpack it into smaller files that are contained in the \"TBN\" file. The smaller files that are contained in the TBN file are common files used when flashing phones that usually come as separate files so I know about them but I don't know how to extract them from this TBN file.\nHow do I go about unpacking this file?\n",
