More precisely, I am trying to change the count increment in the <pre><code>AL</code></pre> register by placing a breakpoint condition saying <pre><code>AL = Al - 1</code></pre>  but it doesn't seem to apply ?!\n\nHow it Looked when done correctly\n",

It's unclear if it explicitly allows assignments or if it's just a side effect that sometimes works.\nTry something like this instead: SetRegValue(al-1, \"al\")\nI don't have IDA on hand to test this out, but the function returns true so it might avoid the problem you're seeing.\n",
