    "content": "So I was wondering if is there a way for IDA to appears in the righ click options of an executable.\n\nAs you can see, <pre><code>Debug with x64dbg</code></pre> was built by itself, IDA 32 didn't do, so I just changed it in the Registry Editor, which it works, but it doesn't show the IDA's icon, also I'm pretty sure this not the right way since I saw some people with this option just like x64dbg is doing it.\nThanks!\n",
