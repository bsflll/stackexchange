    "content": "I was trying to recreate this game because it was down but I really love it.\nI tried to decompile the apk and I got the java code and the assets then I looked around the code and found out the main code is not in the java but the lua folder inside the assets but the thing is that it get encrypted by XXTEA (For Example: this is main.lua).\nSo I'm trying to use IDA to read the lib .so file to find the key but it's a bunch of stuff that doesn't let me get the key easy so I tried to use frida to trace and print out the key when the decrypt get called but sadly because the server was down so the function never get called.\nPlease help me decrypt all the lua file or at least pls help me get the key to decrypt it, I really need it.\n",
