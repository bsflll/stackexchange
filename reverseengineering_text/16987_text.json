            "content": "The error you've received was probably thrown by either Themida or WinLicense, a well known protectors. I'd say here that fully bypass of both Themida and WinLicense are goals that are hard to reach for an inexperienced reverse engineer.  \nBecause it's the 3rd question you ask about this subject, and it seems like you are truly struggle with it, I'll show you a quick step-by-step tutorial of how to bypass <pre><code>IsDebuggerPresent</code></pre> on runtime, from inside IDA and avoid the pop-up message.  \n\nFirst, let's create a small program which all it does will be to check whether it was executed inside a debugger or not:\n<pre><code>#include <windows.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(){\n    if (IsDebuggerPresent()) {\n        printf(\"Debugger found\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Debugger not found\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see, the program only contains a <pre><code>main()</code></pre> function which will print \"Debugger found\" or \"Debugger not found\", depends on the result of <pre><code>IsDebuggerPresent()</code></pre>.\nLet's compile the program. I used TinyCC because it is less noisy than some of the other compilers. Basically you can use whatever C compiler for windows you wish.\n<pre><code>./tcc.exe check_for_debugger.c\n</code></pre>\nNow that we have an executable <pre><code>.exe</code></pre> file, let's execute it:\n<pre><code>./check_for_debugger.exe\nDebugger not found\n</code></pre>\nAs expected, we ended up with \"Debugger not found\" printed to the console. Let's open the executable in IDA Pro. As you can see, the main function looks something like this (click on it to enlarge):\n\nLet's execute it. You may want to put a breakpoint before the program exits but not before the message is printed.\nWe can see that \"Debugger found\" was printed to the console.\nNow let's modify the result of <pre><code>IsDebuggerPresent()</code></pre> by changing the value of <pre><code>eax</code></pre> just after the function was called. For this, we'll create a breakpoint in offset <pre><code>0x0040100F</code></pre> (in my program) which is where the result of <pre><code>IsDebuggerPresent()</code></pre> is checked by <pre><code>test eax, eax</code></pre>.\nExecute the program inside IDA. The program has stopped at our breakpoint on <pre><code>test eax, eax</code></pre> and we can see in the registers panel that <pre><code>eax</code></pre> has non-zero value (in my case eax==1). \n\nLet's right click on <pre><code>eax</code></pre> and choose \"Zero value\", and immediately the value of <pre><code>eax</code></pre> will changed to zero.\n\nNow let's continue the execution (don't forget the breakpoint before <pre><code>exit()</code></pre> in case you removed it for some reason). And as we wanted, the message \"Debugger not found\" is printed in the console.\n\nHope you understood how to bypass <pre><code>IsDebuggerPresent</code></pre> by modifying the value of <pre><code>eax</code></pre>, now you can continue your reverse-engineering process.\n",

Anyway, this is how you bypass IsDebuggerPresent and if you'll check you can see that probably other anti-analysis trick is catching you.</span>",
