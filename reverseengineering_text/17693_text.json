    "content": "I am unable to find if it does. This PDF linked here says that from version 4.8 IDA Pro supports remote debugging. But I can't seem to find this in the UI for the Freeware Version 5.0. Or is it that IDA Pro and IDA Freeware are different irrespective of version number.\n",

            "content": "I'll start by saying that there's already IDA Free 7.0 which is much better than version 5.0. However, both the free edition of IDA 7.0 and IDA 5.0 are not supporting remote debugging of any kind.\nHex-Rays stated that, and other limitations, in their IDA 5.0 freeware page (which is now replaced with version 7.0). I'm quoting from a backed-up page:\n\nThe freeware version of IDA v5.0 has the following limitations:\nno commercial use is allowed\nlacks all features introduced in IDA > v5.0:\nv5.1, v5.2, v5.3, v5.4, v5.5,v5.6, v5.7, v6.0, v6.1, v6.2, v6.3, v6.4, v6.5, v6.6 v6.7 v6.8\nlacks support for many processors, file formats, debugging etc...\ncomes without technical support\n\n(emphasizes are mine)\nA similar description is available on the IDA 7.0 Freeware page as well:\n\nThe freeware version of IDA v7.0 has the following limitations:\nno commercial use is allowed\nlacks all features introduced in IDA > v7.0\nlacks support for many processors, file formats, debugging etc...\ncomes without technical support\n\n\nEdit:\nAs both OP and @blabb mentioned -- apparently, IDA 5.0 do supports local-debugging but is not supports remote debugging.\nAs can be seen in this screenshot from IDA Free 5.0, the \"Debug application setup\" window doesn't contain the settings for remote debugging:\n\nIn contrary, the screenshot from the PDF attached by OP is showing these settings:\n",
