    "content": "I'm building a fan website for a japanese mobile game. I'd like to have access to game data like character stats and ability names. I'll start by saying that this is the first time I have done something like this and could use any help. \nThis is what I have done so far. \n\nThere is a folder containing custom .pack files, which I think are binary files of unknown format.\nWithin this folder there is also a .dat file with the names of the .pack files followed by a string of numbers (e.g. <pre><code>master_attribute.pack  8CDF54ED0AE78C4FF663C3F639F28B7F</code></pre>). I do not know if this is related.\nEach .pack file starts with the hex signature <pre><code>C9</code></pre>, which according to this wiki, is a .com file, which i think is an outdated executable file?\nMost of the .pack files, when read as utf-8, contain snippets of the information I'm looking for but it is riddled with out-of-place continuation bytes (this is likely irrelevant because I am naively assuming that these files are utf-8 text files). \n\nHere is an example of one of the smaller files, the japanese text are relevant and are not random.\n\nAs I said in the start, this is my first exposure to such things. I am stuck and welcome any help on what I can do next. \nFor reference, here are some of the files\n",

Japanese has had strong resistance to UTF-8 Unicode because their older text encoding standards, of which there are several, take up less space for Japanese text. A lot of those Japanese characters just look like random gibberish. But then again I can see <pre><code>シメリア</code></pre> that looks like proper Japanese and indeed turns out to be some character from World of Warcraft. As UTF-8 is a multibyte encoding, which byte offset you start interpreting can make a difference, though the bit patterns of UTF-8 make it pretty much self-synchronizing.\n",
