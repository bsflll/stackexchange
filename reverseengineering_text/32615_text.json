    "content": "After getting rejected from a promising interview process with Company A, the interviewer reached out to me and provided me with Reverse Engineering challenges Company A provides publicly to work on.\nWhat I've done: (disclaimer: I'm still a Novice)\n\nextracted the .img as firmware.img\nfile firmware.img\noutput: Linux kernel ARM64 boot executable Image, little-endian, 4K pages\nstrings firmware.img\nsummary: gibberish until what looks to be stuff for a tcp/udp server\nxxd firmware.img\nsummary: all bytes are 'ff' from 00036650 - 000aade0\n\nTools that did not work (incompatible file?):\n\nbinwalk\nobjdump\nreadelf\n\nOther things that failed:\n\nmount\n\nThis is the part I'm currently at, is I'm unable to mount the firmware.img, but the errors keep saying \"corrupted\" as I try different ways to mount the file.\nWhat recommendations or different approaches should I consider?\n",
