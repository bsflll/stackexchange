    "content": "I'm trying to find a string value stored in memory by a binary (possibly written in C) that won't show up when I perform \"strings a.out\". I have tried examining particular memory addresses of interest that I have picked out from the assembly code but with no success. Thus, I am looking to try and print all the string values stored in memory (or char* arrays) by the program. Is there a way to do this? (note: the file does not contain debugging info). Thanks!\n",

If you disable ASLR, you should be able to set a memory breakpoint on the string address and then figure out how it was 'encrypted'.\nAnother solution is to print the return address using __builtin_return_address.\n",
