    "content": "Easy Victory was developed in Java for Android\nI was very curious about how Easy Victory takes data from the game's balls and billiard cue force/velocity to calculate trajectories\nThis is not a mod because Easy Victory is not the modified 8 Ball Pool\nSomehow it reads data from the game table in real time\nIt runs in the background and runs the game if the game is installed on the smartphone. Otherwise it redirects to the Play Store to download\nHow was that possible?\nI used Apktool and Ghidra to decompile but I couldn't identify where the cheat actually gets the game information\n",

            "text": "A non-rooted Android system uses sandboxes for each app so direct manipulation of the game is unlikely. But there techniques exist where you load a third party apk file (e.g. 8 Ball Pool) into a running app instance (e.g. Easy Victory). In such a case the whole app runs in the same sandbox as easy victory does so direct memory access is possible. If 8 Ball Pool has settings or a high score table those values should be different to the values you see when directly start 8 Ball Pool vs when you start it in easy victory.\n",
