    "content": "As a part of college project, I have to showcase how I can get ios app from jailbroken devices and reverse-engineer it. In the first part of slide, I am showing how we can get the IPA file from jailbroken device, also can decrypt the iOS app (either through clutch2 or ipainstaller). I am showing how attacker can use class-dump-z and enumerate classnames and method names.\nI am also trying to add a scenario, where I not only get the decrypted app from jailbroken iPhone but also can change few things in it. I am trying to change parameters in Info.plist file.\nBelow are the steps I performed:\n\n\nUnzip the decrypted iOS app (.ipa file) into directory named <pre><code>unzipped_app</code></pre>\nGo to Payload -> Appname.app -> Info.plist\nChange app name\n\n\nQuestion:\nNow, how do I recompile the <pre><code>unzipped_app</code></pre> directory back to .ipa file?\nI came across this question Disassemble, edit and re-assembly iOS ipa apps but this is not providing solution to my question.\n",

            "content": "With the help of Robert's comment, I explored that path and found a solution.\nIPA file is basically a form of ZIP file and likewise we can unzip it easily.\n\nmacbook$:> unzip -d unzipped-dir appname.ipa\n\nThis will give us directory format as\n\nunzipped-dir/Payload/appname.app/Info.plist [and other contents of ipa file along with app binary]\n\nOnce appropriate modifications are done in Info.plist, we can save the Info.plist file.\nNow, transfer the <pre><code>Payload</code></pre> directory from macbook to <pre><code>jailbroken</code></pre> ios device.\n\nmacbook:$> scp -r Payload/ root@<iphone-ip>:/var/root\n\n-- On Jailbroken Device --\n\nInstall AppSync from Cydia (add source-> http://cydia.akemi.ai).\nInstall Filza (should be available directly in Cydia search)\n\nOpen Filza app and go to <pre><code>/var/root</code></pre>. This is the location where we sent <pre><code>Payload</code></pre> directory via scp.\n\nLong press <pre><code>Payload</code></pre> directory and click \"Create ZIP\" --> This will create <pre><code>Payload.zip</code></pre>\n\n\nLong press the newly created ZIP file <pre><code>Payload.zip</code></pre> and rename it to <pre><code>new-app.ipa</code></pre> (or whatever you want to name it, but make sure to keep the extension as <pre><code>.ipa</code></pre> and not <pre><code>.zip</code></pre> anymore) --> This will create <pre><code>new-app.ipa</code></pre> in same directory ie /var/root/\n\n\nClick on <pre><code>new-app.ipa</code></pre> and click on \"Install\" on top right corner.\n\nDone. This will install the new ipa file.\nSelf signing or any other type of signing is not required as (up to my limited knowledge) AppSync disables the code signing checks on jailbroken device.\nWriting self answer hoping that someone might get help from this.\nThank you.\n",
