You have to set search.in value to \"range\" in order to \"tell\" r2 it should look within the scope you provided.\n<pre><code>e.search.in=range\ne.search.from=[addr]\ne.search.to=[addr]\n</code></pre>\nif you want to search whole memory use\n<pre><code>e.search.in=dbg.maps</code></pre>\nGood luck!\n",
