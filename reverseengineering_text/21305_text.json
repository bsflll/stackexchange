    "content": "Loading the source into IDA, I have this function:\n\nAccording to the source for Lua, this function should be passed a pointer to the Lua_State struct:\n<pre><code>LUA_API int lua_gettop (lua_State *L) {\n  return cast_int(L->top - L->base);\n}\n</code></pre>\nI'm currently trying to figure out what pointer is being passed to this procedure (In this case <pre><code>arg_0</code></pre>). I can attach a breakpoint and it correctly breaks, but how would I find the associated <pre><code>.data</code></pre> location for where it's stored?\n",
