    "content": "In my IDC script I open a log file, do some analysis, write in the file and close the file like this:\n<pre><code>main(){\nopen_log();\ndo_analysis();\nclose_log();\n}\n</code></pre>\nCurrently I am using this script on command line, and I am trying to close the GUI after analysis(or be more exact, don't not open GUI while analyzing)\nHere is command line I use:\n<pre><code>\"z:\\ida6.1\\idaq.exe -A -SfunctionEnumeration.idc z:\\Linux\\targetfile\"\n</code></pre>\nI modified my script like this:\n<pre><code>main(){\nopen_log();\ndo_analysis();\nclose_log();\n\nWait();\nExit(0);\n}\n</code></pre>\nCurrently it will generate the log file, but no content in it..\nIt seems that IDA Pro is closed before the write operation(or close operation)\non the log file, but I don't understand why because Wait() is called in my script...\nI read the IDC manual and haven't find anything useful...\nCould anyone give me some help? Thank you!\n",
