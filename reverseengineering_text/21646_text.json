    "content": "I am new to OllyDbg and I made a small (.NET Console App) program to test if I can crack the password. To set the break point where it writes Incorrect password. I need to run the program first. But after it prints the password is incorrect, it closes, and when I click Debug>Restart it deletes the break point.\nSo, how can I fix this?\nI am using OllyDbg 2\n",
