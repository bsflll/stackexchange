Its not always there but when it is its the best choice. \nSince you are already debugging and reversing it, you can always hook it's fullscreen request API (usually <pre><code>ChangeDisplaySettings</code></pre> or <pre><code>ChangeDisplaySettingsEx</code></pre> on Windows).\nIf you can't hook or find the fullscreen API (if the software has anti-debugging it might be kind of a chicken and egg problem), you can always call <pre><code>ChangeDisplaySettings</code></pre> yourself and disable fullscreen mode after getting a window handle for the program's fullscreen window. \nOr you could simply use one of many existing tools for exactly that, they're covered in this SO question: https://superuser.com/questions/318748/force-fullscreen-games-to-in-window-mode\n\nHope that helps :)\n",
