    "content": "I have a malware sample that adds a DLL to the registry key <pre><code>HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows\\AppInit_DLLs</code></pre>.  There is malicious functionality in the DLL referenced by the registry key but this malware sample does not load or call the DLL, nor does it exhibit any other malicious behavior.\nWhy would malware add a DLL to this registry key?\n",

            "content": "Basically, all DLLs listed in that reg-key are loaded when any process is started. \nFor more info see Working with the AppInit_DLLs registry value.\n\nAll the DLLs that are specified in this value are loaded by each Microsoft Windows-based application that is running in the current log on session.\n\nThey are usually used by malicious code (tho it doesn't have to be malicious) as a way of DLL injection, to hook functions for example. To be more precise, AppInit DLLs are actually loaded only by the processes that link user32.dll.,as peter ferrie points out, AppInit DLLs are loaded by user32.dll after it has been loaded. \nThe actual registry path differs between 64bit and 32bit version of OS.\nSo for for 32 bit DLL on 32 bit systems the path is:\n<pre><code>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows\\AppInit_DLLs] \n</code></pre>\nFor  64 bit DLL on 64 bit system :\n<pre><code>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows\\AppInit_DLLs]\n</code></pre>\nFor for 32 bit DLL on 64 bit system:\n<pre><code>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows\\AppInit_DLLs] \n</code></pre>\nMultiple entries are split with space or comma, and the path to the DLL must not contain any spaces for obvious reasons.\nOn Vista and later, the AppInit DLLs need to be signed, tho the registry value <pre><code>RequireSignedAppInit_DLLs</code></pre> can be set to 0 which disables this requirement.\n",
