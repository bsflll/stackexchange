    "content": "I have a log file from the target Linux machine stating where crash has occured:\n<pre><code>0x00000000046195d3 MyApp!UnknownFunction(0x44195d3)</code></pre>\n\nI have fully analyzed and disassembled in IDA <pre><code>MyApp</code></pre> binary\n\nI also have MDMP file from the target machine\n\n\nNow, obviously I can't just go to <pre><code>0x00000000046195d3</code></pre> in the disassembled binary because it wont be a correct offset. Is there any way I can use information from minidump to adjust offset so it matches in IDA too?\nP.S. I dont have not dont want to use windbg or x64dbg - every single google result leads to these\n",
