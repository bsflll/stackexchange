    "content": "I'm trying to set a conditional hardware breakpoint on Windows Kernel-Mode in Windbg by using the following syntax :\n<pre><code>ba w1 ffff802312345678 \"j(@rip==ffff802387654321 || @rip==ffff802387654330) 'gc';''\"\n</code></pre>\nI used the above command in order to ignore every access to my target location (<pre><code>ffff802312345678</code></pre>) from <pre><code>ffff802387654321</code></pre> or <pre><code>ffff802387654330</code></pre>, so everytime access from somewhere else is taken, then I would be notified.\nBut the problem is, it still breaks on <pre><code>ffff802387654321</code></pre> or  <pre><code>ffff802387654330</code></pre> among the other locations. \nI also read it's official documents about \"Conditional Breakpoints and Register Sign Extension\" and also test something like this:\n<pre><code>ba w1 ffff802312345678 \"j((@rip & 0xffffffffffffffff)=ffff802387654321 || (@rip & 0xffffffffffffffff)=ffff802387654330) 'gc';''\"\n</code></pre>\nBut it still won't work.\nSo my question is:\n\nWhat's wrong with the above command and how can I achieve the desired\nresult ?\n",
