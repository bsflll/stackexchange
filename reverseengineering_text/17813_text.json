    "content": "I am using <pre><code>qemu-arm</code></pre> to run a statically linked binary on an Ubuntu system. There is little to no chance of emulating the entire system.\nThe binary reads <pre><code>/proc/cmdline</code></pre> as it starts up, to check for a specific parameter concerning MTD partitions. Obviously, my <pre><code>/proc/cmdline</code></pre> does not match.\nIs there any easy way to alter the contents of <pre><code>/proc/cmdline</code></pre> for this emulated binary?\n",

            "content": "The typical way to do something like this is to write a small library that intercepts open/read and fakes out the data your program is looking for, and then arrange for that library to be loaded by passing in an <pre><code>LD_PRELOAD</code></pre> environment variable (QEMU's <pre><code>-E</code></pre> option).\nIt's pretty straightforward; you could adapt the instructions here on emulating NVRAM in QEMU.\n",
