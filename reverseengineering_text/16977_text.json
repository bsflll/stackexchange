As if I have no clue and I ask someone else there is blah blah , what steps do I take?\n",

Please include this in your question, but assuming its IDA, double click on \"IsDebuggerPresent\", or if its x32dbg / x64dbg you can right click on it -> follow in disassembly -> IsDebuggerPresent \nEDIT:\nI see you tagged IDA, so what you need to do is double click on IsDebuggerPresent\n",
