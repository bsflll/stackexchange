    "content": "I'm trying to debug Control Panel and I'd like to disassemble <pre><code>shell32.dll</code></pre>. Because control panel is a 64-bit executable, it loads the 64-bit version of the dll (contrary to the name). When I view the disassembled code in debug mode, I can confirm that it is indeed 64-bit. Ida claims that it's located at <pre><code>C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\shell32.dll</code></pre>; however this dll is entirely 32-bit. I also checked <pre><code>C:\\WINDOWS\\SysWOW64\\shell32.dll</code></pre>, but it's also 32-bit.\nCan someone explain what's going on here?\nThanks!\n",

            "content": "What you are seeing is the result of WoW file-system redirection.  The effect occurs when a 32-bit executable requests a copy of a file in the Windows directory.  Since a 64-bit result would probably make no sense to a 32-bit executable, you get the 32-bit copy instead.\nIf you use Explorer to copy the file from the system32 directory, and then examine the result, you will find that it is a 64-bit executable.\n",
