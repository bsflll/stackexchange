    "content": "I'm using Windbg to track all functions that could result in the blue screen errors. My method is to call certain suspects manually through windbg .call command. However, I always got syntax error. Here is my attempt.\n<pre><code>nt!DbgBreakPointWithStatus:\nfffff807`0d3c9cc0 cc              int     3\n2: kd> .call WdFilter!SwitchToPanicMode(0,0)\n                                           ^ Syntax error in '.call WdFilter!SwitchToPanicMode(0,0)'\n2: kd> bp nt!EtwTracePageFault\n2: kd> .call WdFilter!SwitchToPanicMode(this,0,0)\n                                                ^ Syntax error in '.call WdFilter!SwitchToPanicMode(this,0,0)'\n2: kd> .call /v nt!EtwTracePageFault(this,0x0)\n                                             ^ Syntax error in '.call /v nt!EtwTracePageFault(this,0x0)'\n2: kd> .call /v WdFilter!SwitchToPanicMode(this,0x0,0x0)\n                                                       ^ Syntax error in '.call /v WdFilter!SwitchToPanicMode(this,0x0,0x0)'\n2: kd> x /d /t nt!EtwTracePageFault\n</code></pre>\nSuppose I have known that function SwitchToPanicMode takes in 2 function arguments, which .call format should I use to manually trigger the function? Or is there any way that can get around(maybe like use !analyze -v when the program crashes)?\n",

It says I need a different address because ntdll!DbgBreakPoint is in user mode. Not sure how to get the address.\n",
