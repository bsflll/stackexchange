    "content": "I'm trying to update/port this NIOS2 Processor Module for IDA Pro v9.0.\nWhen I load an elf binary, I got this warning: Undefined or unknown machine type 113. But when I move on, processor module works and I can disassemble binary.\nI want to get rid of that warning. Apparently IDA Pro parses ELF file and finds <pre><code>e_machine</code></pre> is equal to <pre><code>113</code></pre> which is actually <pre><code>Altera Nios II soft-core processor</code></pre>. But also it is undefined for IDA Pro 9.0.\nI have tried <pre><code>set_processor_type()</code></pre>, but it is something else.\nI have searched google and there is a deprecated IDAPython function which is <pre><code>loader_elf_machine</code></pre>; so, this is not working for me either.\nSo my question is rather obvious. I know the machine; I know what <pre><code>113</code></pre> refers to. Is it possible to get rid of this warning by using IDA Python? Can I define this number as a machine while loading processor module?\n",
