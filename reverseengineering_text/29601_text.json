    "content": "I saw an interesting value in IDA at address <pre><code>0xf8766</code></pre>; I want to view the value at that address.\nI debug an Android application with Frida, how can I put this address in Frida to watch this value?\nI know that I need to use <pre><code>Memory.readByteArray(ptr(0xXXXXX), 8)</code></pre>, but what will be the correct address?\nShould I read <pre><code>/proc/PID/maps</code></pre> to see the first address and then add this address to the address that I want to see? The first address is <pre><code>anon:dalvik-main space (region space)</code></pre>\n",
