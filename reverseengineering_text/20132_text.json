    "content": "I have a big library in which IDA found ~84300 functions but using <pre><code>aa</code></pre> in radare2 I was just able to found ~3000.\nI tried setting <pre><code>anal.hasnext</code></pre> to <pre><code>true</code></pre>, <pre><code>anal.from</code></pre> and <pre><code>anal.to</code></pre> to the start and the end of the .text section but with not luck\nSo is there an optimal way to analyze all the functions using radare?\nBy optimal I mean avoiding xrefs or other analyzis\nThanks\n",

For a more detailed information i would always suggest visiting the sourcecode as a lot of <pre><code>aa</code></pre> commands are combinations of different steps. A good starting point is at <pre><code>libr/core/cmd_anal.c</code></pre>\n<pre><code>aab</code></pre> instead is a total different approach and can create a lot of false positives.\nYou could also give <pre><code>aaa</code></pre> a try but i assume that will take some time to finish.\n",
