    "content": "I've decided to reverse this crackme. Obviously it's packed. I was told by PeID that there is only UPX inside. Ok, but <pre><code>upx -d</code></pre> simple crashed that's why I've concluded that this UPX may be scrambled somehow.\n\nBinary didn't run properly in debugger(windbg) for unpacking it so I've dumped exe from working process and tried to fix imports. Maybe I should have tried Olly with plugins? However IDA still warns me that some imports might be destroyed(see picture). My question is: did I unpacked it correctly? If no what else should I do to unpack it?\nUnpacked\n",
