    "content": "It sounds like a stupid question but I honestly can't find the answer... I've looked at https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/content/ and googled for hours but it still eludes me.\nHow do I modify the memory in radare2? I know if I want to modify a register value I can do:\n<pre><code>dr eax = 0xA\n</code></pre>\nBut what about modifying a value in the stack or the heap at a specific address?\n",
