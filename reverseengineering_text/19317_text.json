Put breakpoint on the end of function as well  Suspend all other threads. \nPerform full process memory dump\n2.1 For windows - use windbg command  <pre><code>.writemem c:\\output\\start_address.dmp start_address end_address</code></pre>. Or use  procdump: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump\n2.2 For linux - use <pre><code>cat /dev/[pid]/maps</code></pre> and then from GDB make dumps: \n<pre><code>dump memory /output/memory_start_address start_address end_address</code></pre>\nRun to the end of function, perform [2] again in another directory\nCompare between two dumps to see all the changes [Notepad++]\nIf needed - confirm your findings with RE of the function. \n\nGood luck\nD.L.\n",
