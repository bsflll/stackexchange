    "content": "I'm currently reversing a virtualized sample  that uses a custom VM bytecode. After defeating the anti-disassembly tricks I'm finally faced with the <pre><code>vm_dispatch</code></pre> function. I have to figure out the custom vm opcodes in order to determine what the program actually does. Unlike most other vms, there are no <pre><code>vftables</code></pre> which makes it very hard for me to reverse since there are more than 100 virtual handlers which are not defined as functions (All of the handlers are defined in <pre><code>loc_XXXX</code></pre> code blocks. Example image is below).\n\nTrying to decompile the <pre><code>vm_dispatch</code></pre> function leaves me with this:\n<pre><code>  ...\n  a lot of local variable initialization\n  ...\n  assign vm handlers\n  ...\n  bytecode_array[53] = &loc_4041A3;\n  regs->VIP = 0x6000;  // virtual ip\n  memcpy(bytecode_array + regs->VIP, bytecode, bytecode_size);\n  regs->R5 = -1;\n  vm_code = *(bytecode_array + regs->VIP++);\n  __asm { jmp     [ebp+eax*4+vm_handler_array]; jump to the appropriate handler }// switch jmp\n}\n</code></pre>\nI know it's not fully decompiled because there are more than 100 blocks, each executing a specific vm bytecode. None of that is reflected on the decompiler output.\nIt's really time-consuming to go through each <pre><code>loc_XXXX</code></pre> without being able to define VM specific structures like <pre><code>VM</code></pre> and <pre><code>REG</code></pre> and to read the low-level assembly. My question is, is there any:\n\nWay to convert <pre><code>loc_XXXX</code></pre> code blocks to functions to that I can decompile the code and create structures?\nRight approach to read the assembly / make it easier?\n",
