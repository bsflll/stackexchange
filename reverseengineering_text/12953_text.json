            "content": "Sure, the only necessary thing here is to control the return address of the current stack-frame and be able to build a 'stack-pivot'. Once you have that you can write your ROP approximately anywhere in memory (as long as you can reach it from the return address that you control). For example, you have some attacks that write their ROP in the heap (not in the stack) or in newly allocated memory pages.\nSo, the usual ways to control the return addresses are:\n\nBuffer-overflows (but you do not want to use this);\nHeap-overflows (heap-spray, use after free, ...);\nFormat string bugs.\n\nThere might be others but these are the ones I consider as 'classics' to control return address of a function.\n",
