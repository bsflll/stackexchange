    "content": "I was using Ghidra trying decompile a .sys driver. Kinda newbie, but getting some help.\nI see decompiler outputs a lot of \"artifacts\" (code weird or hard to understand). At least I have renamed some functions after see the functionality of them. Because at some point I was unable to get rid of many of those artifacts (usually by adjusting the right types in some variables) I decided to try another de-compiler: JEB Community Edition (from PNF Software).\nIt seems that it outputs better de-compiled code than Ghidra, it detects a lot more types tha Ghidra too, but the now I hit the wall with the following.\nIn Ghidra I have a function that I renamed like this:\n<pre><code>int FUN_10001ea0(void)\n\n{\n  EnumerateAndProcessPCIDevices(ProcessMatchingPCIDevice);\n  return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\nProcessMatchingPCIDevice (also renamed) seems to be a function too, because I double click that and it send me to the function. However, in JEB decompilation result is not the case. Look:\n<pre><code>int sub_10001EA0() {\n    sub_10001A40(&gvar_10001E10);\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\nFor some reason it just detects it as a global variable. Double click but it only shows declaration in Disassembly.\nIs there any missing analysis or functionality in JEB that Ghidra does have?\n",

Given it's a variable, it's not local and there is only the address as additional context, this seems sensible. I don't think there's much more to it, really. Otherwise I may have misunderstood what you're asking. Side-note: it would probably have been better to show the original output from Ghidra (before your changes) for comparison.\n",
