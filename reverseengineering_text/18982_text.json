But since in your case it uses a register, it reminds me of C++ vtables. \nSo in C, how about calling a pointer to a function? Something like this:\n<pre><code>void (*fptr)(void);\nvoid foo(void) {\n   /* some code */\n}\nfptr = foo;\n(*fptr)();   /* <-- your indirect call generated here */\n</code></pre>\n",
