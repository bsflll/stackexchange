    "content": "Analyzing the ELF file /usr/bin/curl (Ubuntu 14.04, 64bit), I stumbled upon a strange function (see image). It is called regularly via <pre><code>call sub_403D90</code></pre> but does not end with a ret. Instead, it jumps to a label / another function (<pre><code>sub_403C90</code></pre>).\nThis is strange because there seems to be no return to <pre><code>sub_403D90</code></pre>, as from <pre><code>sub_403C90</code></pre> onwards in the control flow, there are no jumps but only rets.\nCan someone explain to me why this is? Does it makes sense?\n",
