In your case, however, the compiler knew <pre><code>sum()</code></pre> was only called once. It knew it was called with known (literal) arguments and so there was no point in delegating the computation to runtime. Essentially your example is <pre><code>constexpr</code></pre> without explicitly saying it. Optimizers in compilers these days are fairly smart and will catch much more convoluted cases (but fail with some trivial ones, too). Change the code to take in <pre><code>argc</code></pre> from <pre><code>main()</code></pre> and it should look different.\n",
