    "content": "I am using nmap to scan open ports on a device which uses FTP protocol to transfer firmware for update. But it is showing all 1000 ports are closed.\nIt comes with a software to update its firmware. When we connect device to computer and use ifconfig to list IP addresses connected with device, it shows new IP address which is used by that device. Using wireshark we can monitor all protocols used by that software and device to communicate with each other. But there is no mention of FTP protocol in wireshark output. only SSDP, LLDP and MDNS protocols are used. I want to know how that software is transferring data to device when all ports are closed (as shown in Nmap output). If ports are protected using firewall, is there any way to bypass that firewall? and how to identify that firewall first. Please help and if I missed some points which I must mention to explain my problem then please comment.\nLink to wireshark output - here\n",

If the device is downloading the update e.g. from a website there is no need for an open port on the device since it does not run a network service itself. Also firewalls often block incoming but not outgoing connections.\n",

First its assistant software downloads firmware from its CDN website and than it uses FTP protocol to transmit it to the device using USB. How do I know? because in previous version of devices FTP port was open and you could monitor packets transferring from Computer to device using wireshark. But in this version you can see that it creates a Host with particular IP - 192.168.42.3 (in our case) . This IP is always same. by scanning this IP using nmap you can see Host is up but it shows all ports are closed.\n",

In the latter case you won't see any open ports, nor lots of packets on the ethernet interface. You'd need to capture on the USB port. Was the Wireshark dump captured during firmware download to the device? Transferred amount of bytes seems rather small ... You could try to disassemble the firmware and look if it still has software for ftp or if an ftp or firewall service is enabled. Maybe they just removed ftp (if it is not used for updates). github.com/o-gs/dji-firmware-tools\n",
