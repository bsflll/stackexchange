            "content": "It looks like \"Breakpoint at\" means \"the breakpoint was hit\", not \"breakpoint was set\".\nThe breakpoint can be only triggered once the program is running. Since you call <pre><code>log()</code></pre> before <pre><code>run()</code></pre>, the log message is printed first. If you want to log when the breakpoint is hit, you need to use another approach (not familiar with ImmDbg API so can't recommend anything specific).\n",
