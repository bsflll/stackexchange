    "content": "I am modifying the Dolphin Emulator Alpha for android, but I'm having some trouble with a string in it's <pre><code>smali</code></pre> code. The value I am having trouble with is <pre><code>dolphin-emu</code></pre>, it is the name of the folder that houses the emulators data and files. So far I have olny found two files containing the string, a configuration file in the <pre><code>assets</code></pre> folder, and a smali script. The issue is that even afyer changing both strings to <pre><code>Dolphin Emulator</code></pre>, the folder is still generated as <pre><code>dolphin-emu</code></pre>. I have scoured the application for any other references to this string and cannot find any more. How is the folder being generated with this name if I have replaced the string that represents it?\nI am using APK Editor Pro to modify the app, this is the method I almost always use. I've been modding android apps for years and have modded hundreds of them, but this one has me truly stumped. I've used every method I have developed over the years to hunt it down and nothing works. Using the built-in search function, I have searched for these strings to see if it is \"split\" or possibly even hidden:\n<pre><code>\"dolphin-emu\"\n\"dolphin\n\"/dolphin\nemu\"\nemu/\"\n\"DOLPHIN-EMU\"\nect...\n</code></pre>\nNothing else turns up, the app is not obfuscated or protected, and I can't find anything else that could potentialy hold the string I am trying to mod. Initially this was about simply changing the value, but now I just want to figure out how this is happening. Even uninstalling then re-installing after modifying the APK did not work, I thought that it may be possible for a settings file in the apps data folder to \"remember\" where the folder was stored. I've never had this much trouble locating and modifying a string in an app before.\n",

            "content": "After I did some more digging in the APK, I found what handles the fylesystem for the emulator. It is the <pre><code>libmain.so</code></pre> binary. Because it is handled by this file, modifying it is next to imposdible, this is because <pre><code>.so</code></pre> files are akin to windiws <pre><code>.dll</code></pre> binaries and are signed. Since modifying the file is not really an option, the only alternative answer to changing the emulators filesystem is to re-build it from the source code.\n\nThis is the first instance I have found something like this in an android app. Usually modifying file paths can be achieved through decompiling and modifying the <pre><code>DEX</code></pre>. Because of this, looking into the <pre><code>.so</code></pre> binaries was the last place I looked.\n",
