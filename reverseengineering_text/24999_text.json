    "content": "Is there an easy way to extract all of the strings from Go binaries that will work cross architecture?\nThe problem with Go is that strings are stored without a null terminator, so you can't use the \"strings\" command plainly.\nI found two solutions so far -\n\ngostringsr2 - Extracts strings using references to the string section (by using radare2). But this method doesn't work 100% and screws up some strings because there are indirect references, etc...,\n\ngolang_loader_assist - Extracts strings by searching for <pre><code>lea</code></pre>/<pre><code>mov</code></pre> instruction to the string section. But this method only works for x86 architectures.\n\n\nIs there a more generic and correct way to extract the strings from Go compiled binaries?\n",

For UTF-8 there are specific bit patterns to look for in the various bytes of each multibyte character. For UTF-16 you need heuristics. ASCII-compatible runs have interleaves 0 bytes and bytes >= space. Unpaired surrogates are a flag that it's unlikely to be UTF-16 after all. In all cases the fidelity is lower than finding null-terminated strings.\n",

If you don't want to have to split up the blobs yourself and strings are not terminated then it seems there is no \"easy way\" until somebody knowing all the architectures writes a unified tool using principles like the tools you mention use. In the meantime you might be able to analyse your binary with Ghidra. Ada Pro can surely do something too. But those are more heavyweight than you seem to be looking for and won't always find every string.\n",
