    "content": "I have some questions about some hopper disassembler features.\n\nIs there a way to add a structure definition to the database ? How ?\nIs there a way to assign a type (especially structure or structure pointer) to a local variable ? How exactly ?\nIs there a way to assign a synonym for register and see this synonym in decompilation view ?\n\nUsed version of the Hopper is 4.0.35.\nThank you in advance.\n",
