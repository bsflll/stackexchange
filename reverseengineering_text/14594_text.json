    "content": "I find myself playing in strange territory lately, venturing far outside my comfort zone to test some theories. At present I want to return <pre><code>True</code></pre> every time a specific program calls <pre><code>IsDebuggerPresent</code></pre>, without actually debugging the program.\nSince I'm not a software developer, I'd really rather avoid writing code to do API hooking. My next thought was to use a modified <pre><code>kernel32.dll</code></pre> in the same directory as the program, counting on \"DLL Load Order Hijacking\". So... I modified a copy of the dll, essentially replacing the export for <pre><code>IsDebuggerPresent</code></pre> with <pre><code>mov eax, 1</code></pre>\nIf I open the DLL in IDA and examine the export, it shows exactly the code I patched in, but if I run the executable, when it makes the call to <pre><code>IsDebuggerPresent</code></pre> the same address I modified instead shows a JMP to the proper <pre><code>IsDebuggerPresent</code></pre> instructions.\nIs what I'm trying to do even feasible, or do I have to do API hooking to make it work? I'm Really looking for a simple POC, so again, I'd prefer not to have to figure out a metric buttload of C++ just to test a theory.\n",

For a list of known DLLs on the current system, see the following registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\KnownDLLs.\n\nSo for your case, I would suggest giving API hooking a try ;) It really isn't too hard (Windows to the rescue for all your shady needs).\nedit:\nsome pointers for hooking\nYou may go ahead and use Windows Hooking API\nHowever, it is quiet straight forward to do yourself:\n\nUse GetProcAddress to find GetDebuggerPresent in your address space (Windows does not like ASLR). You can assume it is at the same location in the other process.\nBackup the first few bytes (ReadProcessMemory), insert any hook (WriteProcessMemory) and you code (VirtualProtectEx).\n\nside node: you may need to elevate the permissions of your process first (OpenProcessToken, ...).\nedit 2:\nI found some of my old code. You can find it here. Please note this code was written for a research project to avoid Sandbox detection and that I was a student at the time (i.e. the code may not be high quallity).\n",

Instead of a DLL name, simply place a full path and the DLL will be loaded from your specified location for all processes.\n\nAlthough this might not be advised as there's a risk of a malicious entity exploiting those changes to hijack DLLs on your machine, it's definitely an easy way to test your endeavors without writing any API hooking code, as requested :)\nAnother approach would be searching for some pre-made API hooking utilities (there, are, plenty)\n",

Then the usual <pre><code>WriteProcessMemory()</code></pre> method should work to set this value in the remote process.\nYou could also try a typical DLL placement attack on some dependency of your target program (e.g. <pre><code>version.dll</code></pre> which isn't a known DLL) and have that loaded DLL do the manipulation of the PEB for you from within the remote process.\n\nAnd always keep in mind that in order to do effective reverse engineering, you should first have a firm grasp of forward engineering ðŸ˜‰\n",
