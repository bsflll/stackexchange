    "content": "I have some questions about the AFL Fuzzer:\n\nHow does the AFL Fuzzer know where to inject the payload in the code I compile? For instance if I want to inject it in a specific parameter, how do I do it?\nAs I understood, if I put all test cases in the input directory it knows to build randomly injections based on that input, yes?\nI saw a video shows that if for instance there are two inputs in the code, so in the test case each line is for each input. Is that correct? Since I want put a full message (for example HTTP request) into one variable, so how do I do it ? \nI have compiled everything correctly but for some reason it does not find any new paths. In addition, if I do not put the <pre><code>-m none</code></pre> I get the following error : \"Fork server crashed with signal 6\".\nI don't understand when to put <pre><code>@@</code></pre>.\n",

            "text": "Hi and welcome to RE.SE. As far as I understand AFL, it mutates whatever input is provided and is able to generate input which triggers faulty behavior. The way it does that is by exploiting the fact that <pre><code>fork()</code></pre> keeps the full state of the program prior to the <pre><code>fork()</code></pre> and so it's relatively cheap to follow different execution paths simply by mutating the input as it goes. The author of AFL even provides a corpus of image files generated by AFL \"from thin air\" simply by fuzzing some image processing tool and generating/mutating input for it.\n",
