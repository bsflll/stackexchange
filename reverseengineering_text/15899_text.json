    "content": "While reversing a binary, whatever symbols we name inside IDA IDB database, is it possible to load the same in GDB while debugging? e.g. I tried wsym which attempts to inject those as symbols. However, the project seems to be in too beta to work properly. I want to use <pre><code>pwndbg</code></pre> for debugging, so using IDA's integrated remote debugging support is not really an option.\n",
