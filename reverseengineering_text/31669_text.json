    "content": "I am currently studying computer science and I have to do a mandatory internship (6 months) soon. I am really enjoying re and I would love to get an internship in that area. My problem is that the number of re internship jobs I found on various job search engines is extremely limited to quite non existing.\nDo you have any ideas where I could look for jobs instead? I am living in germany but I also wouldnt mind to move to a nearby country.\nThank you very much!\n",

So maybe you can try browsing the homepages of some companies that sell antivirus products/services to see if they provide such jobs, or even contact them directly.\n",
