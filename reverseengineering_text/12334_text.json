    "content": "I'd like to mark some data as being an enum, and have that automatically propagate to all uses of this piece of data. Both direct accesses to the data (e.g. <pre><code>cmp data_with_enum_type, enum_value</code></pre>), and future use by any register it is copied into (e.g. <pre><code>mov al, data_with_enum_type | cmp al, enum_value</code></pre>).\nIs this possible in IDA, or something that could be straightforwardly scripted, or something an existing plugin may handle?\n",
