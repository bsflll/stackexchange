The correct simplification is:\n<pre><code>if ((int)a4 >= 0)\n</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code> if ( (__PAIR__(v17, v12) & 0x8000000000000000ui64) != 0i64 ) {\n</code></pre>\nshould look like this\n<pre><code> if( v17 < 0 || v12 < 0 ) {\n</code></pre>\n\nNope, it should look like this:\n<pre><code>if ((int)v17 < 0) {\n</code></pre>\nYou may want to read up on how the most significant bit (MSB) is used as the sign bit in two's complement notation.\n",

I understand the variables could be created out of thin-air due to the way assembly works. But I do believe this should still check both at once am I wrong? also since it checks for a 64 bit mask i'm guessing thats 32 bit per variable? this is made for x86 exe not 64bit exe.</span>",
