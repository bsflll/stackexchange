    "content": "An executable that access the Internet uses my IP to do so. Is it be possible, with the help of a software or something like that, to change what IP an executable uses to access the Internet? Without the need to change/mask all my system's IP at once. The solution should be able to change a single executable IP, maybe a pack of executables would also work for me.  \nI have an executable that sends information to a host, and I need to open 2 or more instances of that executable and need they to reach the host with different IPs.\n<pre><code>My IP -> qqq.qqq.qqq\nExecutable 1 -> xxx.xxx.xxx\nExecutable 2 -> yyy.yyy.yyy\n</code></pre>\nWhere Executable 1 and 2 can use proxy, IP that change all the time, doesn't matter -- they just need to reach the host with different IPs.\nPossible easy solution I read once:\nCreate a virtual machine and use a proxy software  on it, programs from my main computer would use my IP, programs from virtual machine would use proxy software IP\nBut if i could avoid this solution, would be nicer.\n",

You can tell ProxyCap which applications will\n  connect to the Internet through a proxy and under what circumstances. \nhttp://www.proxycap.com/\n\nForceBindIP \n\nForceBindIP is a freeware Windows application that will inject itself\n  into another application and alter how certain Windows socket calls\n  are made, allowing you to force the other application to use a\n  specific network interface / IP address. This is useful if you are in\n  an environment with multiple interfaces and your application has no\n  option to bind to a specific interface.\nhttps://r1ch.net/projects/forcebindip\n\n\nI used Proxifier in the past for gaming and torrenting purposes and it might be what you're searching for.\n",
