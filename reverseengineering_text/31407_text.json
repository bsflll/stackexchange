    "content": "When I run notepad.exe with x64dbg it runs as WOW64 process. But when I run it with x32dbg it runs as x64 process with x64 instructions. I am running it from the same directory C:\\Windows\\System32\notepad.exe, but in process explorer I see different executable location for WOW64 process -C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\notepad.exe\nHowever, when I open both executables in WOW64 and System32 directories in PE-Bear, both have the same OptionalHeader.Magic = NT32 and both have the same 32-bit instructions\n\nWhy is this happening and where can I find the x64 executable?\n",

For legacy compatibility, <pre><code>system32</code></pre> contains 64-bit programs and <pre><code>wow64</code></pre> contains 32-bit programs.  When something is requested by a 32-bit program from system32, it is redirected to syswow64.\nA full explanation is here Windows Club\nWOW stands for Windows on Windows and syswow64 is a compatibility layer for 32 bit programs running on 64-bit Windows.\nA fuller explanation is here Wikipedia\nMy guess is that file explorer (and/or PE bear) is getting redirected and you are actually looking at the same file.\nThey are two different files with different headers as seen in the image\n",
