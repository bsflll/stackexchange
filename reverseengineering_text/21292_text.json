    "content": "I have an application, which sometimes fails. I run procdump and see some first chance exceptions like this:\n<pre><code>[14:29:38] Exception: E06D7363.?AVCServicesMDException@@\n[14:29:38] Exception: E06D7363.?AVCServicesMDException@@\n[14:29:38] Exception: E06D7363.?AVCBaseException@@\n[14:29:38] Exception: E06D7363.?AVCBaseException@@\n</code></pre>\nI want to attach to process and analyze some of these exceptions. But have difficulties with setting WinDbg to handle it.\nI run <pre><code>.foreach(exc {sx}) {.catch{sxe ${exc}}}</code></pre> & <pre><code>sxe *</code></pre> to catch all first chance exceptions and events.\nBut got nothing similar to exceptions from dump (written by procdump).\n",
