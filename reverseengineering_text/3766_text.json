Found them there. I was able to compile the plw plugin (especially to enable debugging on Linear Executable files as said in an Issue on the repo), but DOSBox was being harder, so I found that one (btw, if anyone tries to compile the EXE, the C++ standard must be set to at most C++14 in all Makefiles).</span>",

Uses DOSBox-X it seems.</span>",
