    "content": "I've been given an ELF binary file which self describes as PowerPC 64-bit. The <pre><code>e_entry</code></pre> field of the ELF header points to the beginning of a section called <pre><code>.opd</code></pre>. According to this specification, it is supposed to point to a function descriptor. The same specification states that a function descriptor consists of three doublewords (64-bit words). \nHowever, the binary in question (available here) appears to have only two 32-bit words for each function descriptor. \nSo the question is, why are there 32-bit pointers in this 64-bit binary?\n",
