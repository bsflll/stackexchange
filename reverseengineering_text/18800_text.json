    "content": "So my C program looks like:\n<pre><code>int main()\n{\n    int a = 5;\n    int b = 1;\n    int c = add(a, b);\n    printf(\"%d\", c);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint add(int a, int b){\n    return a + b;\n}\n</code></pre>\nAnd I am trying to understand the behaviour of how parameters are passed into the stack. In order to do the same, I reversed the code to disassembly:\n\n\nNow <pre><code>esp</code></pre> is being copied into <pre><code>ebp</code></pre> in the <pre><code>add</code></pre> function, then why add <pre><code>8</code></pre> and <pre><code>12</code></pre> to access the values <pre><code>5</code></pre> and <pre><code>1</code></pre> in the next lines - shouldn't it be <pre><code>[ebp]</code></pre> and <pre><code>[ebp + 4h]</code></pre>? I am really confused here.\nThanks.\n",

It can store other things as well, for example the return address of the function or the registers which need to be saved temporarily, as well as for local variables. In your example, the <pre><code>push ebp</code></pre> adjusts <pre><code>esp</code></pre> by 4 bytes, so after <pre><code>esp</code></pre> is copied to <pre><code>ebp</code></pre> in the next instruction, the stack frame looks like this:\n<pre><code> [ebp+0] old ebp value (pushed by \"push ebp\")\n [ebp+4] return address from the call (originally at [esp+0])\n [ebp+8] first argument (a)\n [ebp+C] second argument (b)\n</code></pre>\n",
