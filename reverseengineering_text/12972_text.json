    "content": "I have an exe on my desktop that i began debugging a while ago, so i have a lot of notes/breakpoints stored in the udd file. I now need to move that exe to a different directory but Olly sees it as a new exe because of the change in directory, so it creates a new udd file.\nAfter a bunch of searching i see that Olly v1 has an option \"Debugging options -> Security -> Ignore path and extension\" but i don't see this in Olly v2. Per http://ollydbg.de/version2.html, the ability to do this has been present since OllyDbg 2.01 alpha 3:\n\nOption to load .udd information even when path, file name or file checksum is different.\n\ndoes anyone know how to do this?\n",
