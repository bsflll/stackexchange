    "content": "I am planning to do some reverse engineering on an application that was written in a object oriented way. And now I'm kind of curious what a C++ class would look like in assembly. I already found out the basics about functions and their calling conventions. But classes are probably way more complex, right?\nSo let's say we have this class:\n<pre><code>class Rectangle {\n    int width, height;\n  public:\n    void set_values (int,int);\n    int area() {return width*height;}\n};\n\nvoid Rectangle::set_values (int x, int y) {\n  width = x;\n  height = y;\n}\n</code></pre>\nand this object:\n<pre><code>Rectangle rect;\nrect.set_values (3,4);\n</code></pre>\nWhat would/could it look like in assembly?\n",
