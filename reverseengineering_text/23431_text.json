    "content": "I'm new to Ghidra so go easy on me. Running it on Windows.\nAfter successfully extracting a Bluetooth door lock's firmware from a nRF51, I proceeded to decompile it using Ghidra. My aim is to able to read some of its original source code, even though I understand it won't be as clean as the original.\nBut, after analyzing the bin file, I get tons of error. Architecture used/tried to solve this issue was both the ARM Cortex LE 32 bit and the ARM v6 LE 32 bit. Looked for solutions on the internet and I did not find anyone with the same issue. All of the errors are <pre><code>Bad Instruction</code></pre>.\nHere's pictures of two different analyze:\nWithout ARM Aggressive Instruction Finder (Prototype)\n\nWith ARM Aggressive Instruction Finder (Prototype)\n\nThe reason I posted two pictures of my code browser because those two different analysis gave me different amount of bookmark. I know it's because of the Instruction Finder but who knows this might help you to help me.\nI have also tried adding a line into my <pre><code>ia.sinc</code></pre> file as suggested by a user named nsadeveloper789 on a GitHub issue but it did not solve my issue. I have also tried the <pre><code>No Return</code></pre> method from a PDF lesson (page 11) and no luck as well.\nDid used SVD-Loader as well but still doesn't solve the issue as the SVD-Loader's script itself might have an issue and I've commented on this issue on GitHub (currently no specific solution). You can have a look at this issue here. \nDoes anyone knows how to solve this issue? I've been trying for a week or two now and even asked this in the unofficial Ghidra's Discord group but no answer yet.\nLooking forward for your answers. Thanks in advance.\nHere's a link to download the bin file:\nhttps://filebin.net/5abhimciwdfr5gfi\n",
