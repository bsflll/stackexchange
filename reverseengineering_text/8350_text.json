    "content": "I was recently working with the Microsoft documentation about the PE and COFF specifications.\nChapter 5 shows several more or less \"soft\" indicators and characteristics to recognize what kind of stuff a section contains. However, the section characteristics flag is often the same for several different sections, and as I have read, the section name can be of arbitrary value, so it is not a big help too.\nActually, I can only definitely recognize code sections by looking if the <pre><code>IMAGE_SCN_MEM_EXECUTE</code></pre> flag is set, as other sections should not have this flag set.\nBut how could I, for example, recognize the resource directory? It only has <pre><code>IMAGE_SCN_CNT_INITIALIZED_DATA</code></pre> or <pre><code>IMAGE_SCN_MEM_READ</code></pre> set, and many other sections have the same flag.\nDo I have to evaluate with some made-up and typical section names (<pre><code>RSRC</code></pre> or <pre><code>.rsrc</code></pre> for this example)? It will mean that I may get tricked out by custom section names. Do I even have to try-and-error analyzation of section data to get a more definite result of what the section contains?\nOr is there a flag somewhere in the PE headers I skipped, helping me out in this case?\n",

I see that there are also data directories for import and export tables. That can help me further already, parsing the contents of those sections. If the result is still wrong, I just won't parse the section.</span>",
