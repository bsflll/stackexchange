    "content": "Update: I installed Eclipse and PyDev in Linux and my code works now. This confirms it was an issue setting up the Python/Jython paths. I would still like to know how to import ghidra.jar into jython so that I can use the command line in the future. Any help here would be greatly appreciated.\nI am making a ghidra project on Linux. I am using a Ghidra jar and jython to code my application. I am adding ghidra to my path with system.path.append() and I am running my program with\n<pre><code>jython main.py</code></pre>.\nMy code worked with Pydev in Eclipse on Windows, but on Linux I am getting\n\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: java.net.MalformedURLException: unknown protocol: ghidra\n\nwhen I reach <pre><code>ghidraProject.createProject()</code></pre>. I investigated the source and I found that the error occurs when Java tries to make a url from a string. I know Ghidra has a protocol handler which should be handling the protocol \"ghidra\". I assume Java doesn't register the protocol handler somehow. I tried <pre><code>Handler.registerHandler()</code></pre> with no luck.\nWhy is \"ghidra\" an unknown protocol on Linux, but the same code works (save for the PyDev environment) in Eclipse/Windows?\nError printout:\n",

If you want to check out how the Ghidra provided <pre><code>pythonRun</code></pre> entry point handles a minimal jython REPL embedded inside Ghidra, check out: https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/da94eb86bd2b89c8b0ab9bd89e9f0dc5a3157055/Ghidra/Features/Python/src/main/java/ghidra/python/PythonRun.java\nThe crucial part here is:\n<pre><code>ApplicationConfiguration configuration = new HeadlessGhidraApplicationConfiguration();\nApplication.initializeApplication(layout, configuration);\n</code></pre>\nwhich runs through various initialization steps that the overall Ghidra code assumes to have happened when being executed, one of them being the setup for the <pre><code>ghidra://</code></pre> protocol handler.\nSpecifically the call to <pre><code>ghidra.framework.protocol.ghidra.Handler.registerHandler()</code></pre> happens inside <pre><code>ghidra.ProjectInitializer#run</code></pre>.\n",
