    "content": "I am working on a console windows executable. So far what I figured out is that the executable checks number of command line arguments. Afterwards, it branches out depending on the number of arguments passed (argv). The jumps are looked up using some sorts of jump table, which is constructed dynamically. It seems to be a daunting task try to figure out all of the possible command line arguments. It looks like the binary only executes only when certain number of particular arguments is parsed. I have collected some possible options using <pre><code>strings</code></pre> utility. \nIs there a general road map for reversing command line arguments? What are possible approaches to reversing them? Are there any tools that could be employed?\n",
