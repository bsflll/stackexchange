    "content": "I'm looking to find out if a firmware of a device is readable and potentially writeable. The device has a USB port and other devices by this manufacturer have had firmware updates (through USB) so it's within the realm of possibilities this is doable.\nHow will it be possible to find out if the firmware is accessible through the USB port? If it helps the device is a Cloupor Mini\n",

What happens if you use the firmware flash tool for a different device by this manufacturer, does it output any error messages like 'no device found' or 'incompatible device'? The first would suggest the USB has no other meaning than charging the battery, the second could mean the device responds to the flash tool in some way.\n",

Linux has 2 tools to work with DFU devices:\n\ndfutool\ndfu-util\n\ndfu-util is more advanced and for example allows to list connected DFU-capable devices, e.g. when run on my laptop:\n<pre><code># dfu-util -l\ndfu-util 0.5\n\n[...]\nFound Runtime: [0a5c:21e6] devnum=0, cfg=1, intf=3, alt=0, name=\"UNDEFINED\"\n</code></pre>\nBoth of the tools may be useful though when working with different devices and their peculiarities.\nNote though:\n\nQuite a few vendors don't go out of their way and just use DFU, for which standard implementations and tools are available. But of course, any particular device may use a proprietary upgrade protocol. One particular case is when device uses USB solely for async serial protocol (UART/RS-232) emulation.\nWhile DFU provides means for both reading and writing firmware, any particular device may block reading as basic means of IP protection.\nAs for writing firmware, it may be protected with check codes/signatures, so writing arbitrary firmware may be not possible.\n\nIf you want to upgrade and modify firmware, consider buying only open devices (use community resources to discover them), and avoid, ignore, and warn other users of non-open ones.\n",
