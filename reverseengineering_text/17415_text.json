To do this we'll use the <pre><code>iz</code></pre> command which will print strings from the data sections:\n<pre><code>[0x00400430]> iz\nvaddr=0x004005c4 paddr=0x000005c4 ordinal=000 sz=14 len=13 section=.rodata type=ascii string=Hello, World!\n</code></pre>\nWe can see that \"Hello, World!\" is located at <pre><code>0x004005c4</code></pre> and its length is \"13\". That means that we need to replace this string with another string of length \"13\". We'll use \"Good, Bye!!!!\" which is 13 character length as well.\nWe'll use the <pre><code>w</code></pre> command to modify the string in this address:\n<pre><code>[0x00400430]> w Good, Bye!!!! @ 0x004005c4\n</code></pre>\nNow exit from radare2 and execute the program, The changes will affected immediately.\n<pre><code>beet:/tmp$ ./modified_helloworld\nGood, Bye!!!!\n</code></pre>\net voil√†! We changed the output.\nYou can read more in the \"Editing\" chapter from radare2book.\n",
