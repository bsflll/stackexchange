    "content": "I am given a large memory dump (several megabytes). I need to update idb's memory. What I do now is: PatchQword(addr, value) if value != Qword(addr) for every qword in memory dump. Unfortunately, every PatchQword takes way too long (around 3-4 PatchQwords per second).  \nSO the question is: is there a way to tell IDA to update large regions of memory at once?\n",
