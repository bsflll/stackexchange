    "content": "I am trying to unpack a clear spot firmware update\nThe firmware I am trying to reverse can be found on the download page of the vendor\nI have used the fwtools to unpack the firmware as described on this page.\nAfter I did this, I managed to get a \"kernel.bin\" and a \"rootfs.bin\".\nNow I want to include a new/additional certificate to this modem and make some edits on the administrator page that is within this modem (a Wimax one).\nSo I checked the rootfs file using the <pre><code>file</code></pre> tool. And I got the following output:\n<pre><code>rootfs.bin: Linux Compressed ROM File System data, little endian size 4280320 version #2 sorted_dirs CRC 0xbf224100, edition 16777728, 268441607 blocks, 1325400384 files\n</code></pre>\nThis was no to little help so I gave binwalk a try and I got this:\n<pre><code>  DECIMAL         HEX             DESCRIPTION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0               0x0             CramFS filesystem, little endian size 4280320 version #2 sorted_dirs CRC 0xbf224100, edition 16777728, 268441607 blocks, 1325400384 files\n8               0x8             Squashfs filesystem, big endian, version 2.1, size: 4276396 bytes, 1028 inodes, blocksize: 65536 bytes, created: Fri Jun 22 23:02:36 2012\n</code></pre>\nBut for doing the entire firmware file I got the following output.\n<pre><code>    root@bt:/pentest/reverse-engineering/binwalk# ./binwalk -m /pentest/reverse-engineering/binwalk/magic.binwalk /root/fwtools_20100826c/bin.linux/imw.bin\n\nDECIMAL         HEX             DESCRIPTION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n855032          0xD0BF8         CramFS filesystem, little endian size 4280320 version #2 sorted_dirs CRC 0xbf224100, edition 16777728, 268441607 blocks, 1325400384 files\n855040          0xD0C00         Squashfs filesystem, big endian, version 2.1, size: 4276396 bytes, 1028 inodes, blocksize: 65536 bytes, created: Fri Jun 22 23:02:36 20\n</code></pre>\nAs this did stoke me as odd I didn't continue. I don't know how to unpack the firmware. I think I have tried about everything I know you can do manually, firmware mod fit, fwtools, the whole lot!\nCan someone shed some light on my issue and tell me how to continue?\n",
