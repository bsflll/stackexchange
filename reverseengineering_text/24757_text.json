    "content": "I have a clear <pre><code>.class</code></pre> file, which is likely obfuscated. However, Ghidra is not detecting it as Java, and shows it as <pre><code>Raw binary</code></pre>, which prevents me from using the <pre><code>Java Class Analyzer</code></pre> on the file.\nHow can I force Ghidra to identify the file as <pre><code>Java class file</code></pre> or to show me the <pre><code>Java Class Analyzer</code></pre>?\n",
