    "content": "Okay. So I've just come up with the most amazing program for java developers and reverse-engineerers and I was wondering if something like the following program already exists:\nWhat I'm thinking of is like a middle-ground between something like DirtyJOE and a Java Decompiler.\nI already know that:\n\nIt's possible to inject and manipulate code in a compiled class using ASM\nYou can decompile an unobfuscated jar into a readable and understandable state\nIt's practical to explore and edit a class using a GUI because DirtyJOE can do that amazingly well\n\nSo is there some sort of program that can show me a decompiled class and allow me to manipulate/inject into different parts of it individually?\nFor example, I would like replace one method with my own or change a field's access within a compiled class file.\nSo basically I'm looking for a frontend for ASM built with an interface based on decompiled source code.\nDoes this exist? If not, what's the closest thing I'm going to get to it?\n",

            "content": "Some tools you can use. However note that none of them has the ability to recompile classes, i.e you cannot decompile a single class to source, modify it, and then recompile back. It may be possible using Reflection API but then you need to do a lot of modification on the decompiled source itself. Other ways may be to decompile the entire bunch of classes and then recompile all when done.\n\nClass Editor\nThis is a tool to open Java class file binaries, view their internal\n  structure, modify portions of it if required and save the class file\n  back. It also generates readable reports similar to the javap utility.\n  Easy to use Java Swing GUI. The user interface tries to display as\n  much detail as possible and tries to present a structure as close as\n  the actual Java class file structure. At the same time ease of use and\n  class file consistency while doing modifications is also stressed. For\n  example, when a method is deleted, the associated constant pool entry\n  will also be deleted if it is no longer referenced. In built verifier\n  checks changes before saving the file. This tool has been used by\n  people learning Java class file internals. This tool has also been\n  used to do quick modifications in class files when the source code is\n  not available.\n\n\n\nJBE - Java Bytecode Editor\nJBE is a bytecode editor suitable for viewing and modifying java class\n  files. It is built on top of the open-source jclasslib bytecode viewer\n  by ej-technologies. For verification and exporting the class files,\n  JBE uses the the Bytecode Engineering Library by Apache's Jakarta\n  project.\n\n\n\nClass Construction Kit\nThe Class Construction Kit is a tool for the visual creation or\n  modification of Java class files. It is implemented using BCEL and\n  Swing.\n\n\n\nreJ \nThe reJ project aims to allow improved visibility into Java class files, whether they were created compiling from Java\n  sources, another language or by any other kind of tool. Basically\n  anything that will run in a Java Virtual Machine.\n  reJ is a library and a graphical tool for inspection (viewing,\n  searching and comparing) and manipulation (modification, obfuscation,\n  refactoring of methods, fields, attributes and code) of classfiles for\n  the Java platform.\n\n\n\nBcelEditor\nBcelEditor is a tool for the visual modification of Java class files.\n  It is implemented using BCEL. \n  Note: You need to register on the site to get access\n\n\n\nMethodBodyEditor for Java\nA Java class editor Note: You need to register on the site to\n  get access\n\nOther than this, some other generic java tools are available on tuts4you\n",
