    "content": "I can't figure out exactly how these binary matrix files are formatted, other than the 2 little-endian 32-bit unsigned integers in the header. Supposedly the following is a 3x3 identity matrix:\n<pre><code>0300 0000 0300 0000 0000 803f 0000 0000\n0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 803f 0000 0000\n0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 803f \n</code></pre>\nAnd the following is a 3x2 matrix with arbitrary numbers whose value I'm not certain of:\n<pre><code>0300 0000 0200 0000 0000 803f 0000 4040\n0000 a040 0000 0040 0000 8040 0000 c040\n</code></pre>\nBasically, is there an encoding where <pre><code>0000 803f</code></pre> can translate to a value of <pre><code>1</code></pre> while <pre><code>0000 0000</code></pre> translates to <pre><code>0</code></pre> for each of the matrix values?\n",

This is either something you can recognise with some experience or have python show you:\n<pre><code>In [1]: import struct\n\nIn [3]: struct.unpack('f', \"0000803f\".decode('hex'))\nOut[3]: (1.0,)\n</code></pre>\n",
