    "content": "I am currently learning to use ghidra, and I found the Symbol Tree.\nGhidra found some namespaces that I would like to export.\nThese namespaces don't even have to be readable, just reusable, such that I can use them in another application.\nIs there any way in Ghidra to export those namespaces in a reusable form? And if not, what would be my best bet of achieving this?\nSome additional information:\n\nThe namespace is written in Visual C++ or C++.\nThe application is running on windows, and so is Ghidra.\n\nIf any more information or clarification is needed, please tell me.\n",
