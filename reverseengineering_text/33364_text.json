I was able to recover computed jumps (by manual patching), however I am struggling to recover control flow graph. Is there any way to do that? I've already tried using HexRaysDeob IDA plugin, but it didn't help. Can you share your experience in this area? What are you usually doing for deobfuscation?\n",

            "content": "It's not very clear from the way you phrased it, but I assume you're asking how to recover the CFG of a function obfuscated with control flow flattening technique.\nOn the surface, the solution seems pretty simple:\n\nfind the switch/dispatch variable\nfor every write to the switch variable inside the dispatcher loop, replace it with a jump to the basic block/switch case for the corresponding value\n\nHowever, finding a way to automate this (unless you need to recover just one function) is the hard part. Most existing solutions were made for a specific target and may or may not work on yours, but understanding the basics should allow you to figure out how to do it in your specific situation.\nA few links on the topic that may be useful:\n\nDeobfuscating Geetest CAPTCHA: A Practical Guide to Control Flow Flattening \nAutomated Detection of Control-flow Flattening\nDeobfuscation: recovering an OLLVM-protected program\n",
