    "content": "I have an iOS app which uses digest HTTP authentication with nonce which expires every 5 minutes.\nThe client calculates response as following:\n<pre><code>HA1=MD5(username:realm:password)\nHA2=MD5(method:digestURI)\nresponse=MD5(HA1:nonce:nonceCount:cnonce:top:HA2)\n</code></pre>\nMy goal is to figure out the password.\nBrute-force attack appears to be unfeasible here. I've also tried to recover the password from the keychain and decrypted app binary/resources. I've also tried to impersonate authentication server to force client to fallback to basic authentication, but it didn't work either. Any other ideas?\n",
