However, I could not find what changes were made.\n\nI believe that this program modifies some files and the registry, but I do not know which files and registry keys.\nI checked registries in Google and couldn’t figure out what is exactly the threat of the program to the system? The question is  about a kind of modification on the files . I haven’t noticed such kind of modification.\nI spent many hours on debugging the program and tracing assembly code, but couldn’t find the damage file.\ndownload the file from here\n",

In this case, when this file is uploaded to VirusTotal and we click on the \"Behavior\" tab, there is a choice of reports from 4 different emulators/sanboxes to look over, all of which list file system interactions and registry interactions. \nIf you are interested in malware analysis, there are many resources available to help you get started. I have heard Practical Malware Analysis is quite good, but there are many others.\n",
