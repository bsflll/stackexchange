    "content": "I'm working on a Linux x86_64 ELF binary using IDA 6.6.\nWhen I run the Hex-Rays Decompiler on a function (by pressing F5) it always shows me the pseudocode for the <pre><code>_init_proc</code></pre> function, no matter what I run it on. It's stuck on that function and won't show me anything else in the pseudocode view. No errors are displayed or printed to the log.\nIf I produce the C file (Ctrl+F5) the full pseudocode is generated, so it's just an interface issue.\nThis is driving me mad. Things I've tried:\n\nRestarting IDA\nRecreating the database\nDeleting all decompiler information for <pre><code>_init_proc</code></pre>\nDeleting all decompiler information for the function I'm trying to decompile\n\nHas anyone encountered this behaviour before? Any suggestions?\n",
