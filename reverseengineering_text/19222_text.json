    "content": "Has anyone ever attempted to decompile the code for a Pokemon game and figure out how the battle AI works? e.g. How it decides which move to use, or use a Potion/even withdraw based on the current state of the game. I'm very interested in how it works because I would like to build my own battle AI as part of a research project.\n",
