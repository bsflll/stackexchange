Any ideas how I should proceed?\n",

So there was a loop and there were two exit points. One was the overflow which was handled by the DLL itself. And the other was a jz after a test instructions. The place I was stuck was because a function called vbavarfornext  was changing the vales or eax, ebx and edx registers. And because of which this jz jump was being taken..  is there any document which tells me the details of which registers will be modified?</span>",
