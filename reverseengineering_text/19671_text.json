    "content": "I have a Petrainer PET998DRU shock collar (similar to this one) that got partially chewed up by the dog it is supposed to train. I salvaged it to the point where I have the following buttons:\n\nMode (to select light, beep, vibrate, and zap\nActivate (to send appropriate stimulation)\nUp arrow (to increase the amount of stim)\n\nThe display does not work so I don't know what the setting (which stim and how much) is on other than trial and error.\nI have followed the method on here: http://brettleaver.com/collar/ to get as far as I have gotten but the protocol differs on this model and I have only been able to figure out the device ID and the stim type (I think). I can replay the packets on a separate 433Mhz transmitter and the collar responds appropriately but I want to figure out the whole packet. The amount of stim is what I need helping decoding.\nLogic for beep\n\nI decoded this as <pre><code>0xDF 7E DE ED 7F D6 AB</code></pre>\nIf this is wrong, then please let me know because it may give me a clue as to why I can't figure out the rest.\nLogic for zap\n\nI decoded this as <pre><code>0x‭DF DE DE ED 6F 7A AA C0‬</code></pre>. The last bits to finish up the last octet are assumed to be logic 0's. Maybe this assumption is wrong though.\nI decoded the other packets similarly but I won't post all the images.\nEDIT: I have since gotten captures of vibrates and zaps where I know the duration is 0.\n\nLight: <pre><code>0xDE FE DE ED 7F D5 AB</code></pre>\nBeep: <pre><code>0xDF 7E DE ED 7F D6 AB</code></pre>\nZap: <pre><code>0x‭DF DE DE ED 7F EA AB‬</code></pre>\nVibrate <pre><code>0x‭DF BE DE ED 7F DA AB</code></pre>\n\nAll the packets except the Light start out with <pre><code>0XDF</code></pre>. The next position (7, F, D, or B) seems to determine stim type. The next 5 are always<pre><code>0xE DE ED</code></pre> so that seems to determine the device ID. All the characters after that are encoding the duration of the zap or buzz and then something to do with a checksum of some sort.\nHere is what I got for the buzz stim in sequential order. After recording each one, I incremented by one and then sent the command again:\n\n<pre><code>0x‭DF BE DE ED</code></pre> <pre><code>7F AD 55 80</code></pre>\n<pre><code>0x‭DF BE DE ED</code></pre> <pre><code>7F 6D 55 80</code></pre>\n<pre><code>0x‭DF BE DE ED</code></pre> <pre><code>7F 56 AA C0</code></pre>\n<pre><code>0x‭DF BE DE ED</code></pre> <pre><code>7E ED 55 80</code></pre>\n<pre><code>0x‭DF BE DE ED</code></pre> <pre><code>7E D6 AA C0</code></pre>\n...\n\nAn interesting thing I found is that one of the following patterns are always present but I can't figure out the significance:\n\n<pre><code>0x__ _B 55 60</code></pre>\n<pre><code>0x__ _D 55 80</code></pre>\n<pre><code>0x__ _6 AA C0</code></pre>\n<pre><code>0x__ _5 AA B0</code></pre>\n\nEDIT: Another interesting thing to note is that there is never 2 consecutive zeros. \nAssuming I haven't made a huge mistake from the beginning (this is my first attempt at reverse engineering something), does anyone see an obvious encoding scheme or checksum that is being used?\nMy end goal is to code up a new 433MHz transmitter and make it controllable with a yet to be made mobile app.\n",

            "content": "Answer\nConsider a \"gap\" to be a \"low\" interval between two consecutive \"high\" interval, ignoring the first longest one. Then, a bit <pre><code>1</code></pre> corresponds to a long gap, and a bit <pre><code>0</code></pre> corresponds to a short gap.\n\nTherefore, the messages decoded that way are:\n<pre><code>88 14 4b 00 ee   : Light\n84 14 4b 00 de   : Beep\n81 14 4b 00 7e   : Zap\n82 14 4b 00 be   : Vibrate\n82 14 4b 01 be   : Buzz stim in sequential order\n82 14 4b 02 be\n82 14 4b 03 be\n82 14 4b 04 be\n82 14 4b 05 be\n82 14 4b 06 be\n82 14 4b 07 be\n82 14 4b 08 be\n</code></pre>\nThat follows the exact same pattern as described at http://brettleaver.com/collar/, except that the remote UID is <pre><code>14 4b</code></pre> instead of <pre><code>20 89</code></pre>.\n(quoting the link above:\n\nNow we can easily decode what the remote is sending! After changing the settings several times and looking at how it changes the transmission, it became clear what the signal represented.\n<pre><code>81 20 89 32 7e</code></pre>\nThis will be set to <pre><code>8</code></pre> if the remote is on channel 1\nThis will be set to <pre><code>f</code></pre> if the remote is on channel 2\n<pre><code>81 20 89 32 7e</code></pre>\nThis will be set to <pre><code>1</code></pre> when the remote is requesting a shock\nThis will be set to <pre><code>2</code></pre> when the remote is requesting a vibration\nThis will be set to <pre><code>4</code></pre> when the remote is requesting a beep\nThis will be set to <pre><code>8</code></pre> when the remote is requesting an LED flash\n<pre><code>81 20 89 32 7e</code></pre>\nThese bytes represent the UID of the remote, and never change.\n<pre><code>81 20 89 32 7e</code></pre>\nThis byte represents the intensity of the vibration/shock.\nThe collar will ignore anything above 100\n<pre><code>81 20 89 32 7e</code></pre>\nThis will be set to <pre><code>7</code></pre> when the remote is requesting a shock\nThis will be set to <pre><code>B</code></pre> when the remote is requesting a vibration\nThis will be set to <pre><code>D</code></pre> when the remote is requesting a beep\nThis will be set to <pre><code>E</code></pre> when the remote is requesting an LED flash\n<pre><code>81 20 89 32 7e</code></pre>\nThis will be set to <pre><code>E</code></pre> if the remote is on channel 1\nThis will be set to <pre><code>0</code></pre> if the remote is on channel 2\n<pre><code>81 20 89 32 7e</code></pre>\nThis last byte is equal to the first byte, but with its bits reversed and inverted. I think it’s some kind of error checking mechanism, as the collar will ignore all transmissions where this isn’t the case.\n\n)\n\nDerivation\nConsider the signal in binary:\n\n1101111110111110110111101110110101111111101011010101010110000000\n1101111110111110110111101110110101111111011011010101010110000000\n1101111110111110110111101110110101111111010101101010101011000000\n1101111110111110110111101110110101111110111011010101010110000000\n1101111110111110110111101110110101111110110101101010101011000000\n1101111110111110110111101110110101111110101101101010101011000000\n1101111110111110110111101110110101111110101010110101010101100000\n1101111110111110110111101110110101111101111011010101010110000000\n\nNote how the <pre><code>bold italic</code></pre> part appear in all of the sequences, and not in a fixed place? That leads me to suspect that the message has a variable length, and the trailing zeroes doesn't matter.\nThe common prefix of all the messages is <pre><code>11011111101111101101111011101101011111</code></pre>. We will cut out this part, but leave a <pre><code>1</code></pre> in the message -- the reason will be apparent later.\nThe remaining part is:\n<pre><code>11110\n11101\n111010\n11011\n110110\n110101\n1101010\n10111\n</code></pre>\nNote that this is supposed to be (a part of) an increasing, consecutive number sequence.\nFrom OP's observation (there are no two consecutive zeroes), and note that there are 3 pairs in the data above where the latter one is the former one with a <pre><code>0</code></pre> appended, I guess that a <pre><code>0</code></pre> is encoded as a <pre><code>10</code></pre> and a <pre><code>1</code></pre> is encoded as a <pre><code>1</code></pre> (or vice versa).\nReplacing <pre><code>10</code></pre> with <pre><code>1</code></pre> gives:\n<pre><code>1110\n1101\n1100\n1011\n1010\n1001\n1000\n0111\n</code></pre>\nLooks good enough. This counts in decreasing order, so we have to negate the bits (<pre><code>0</code></pre> is encoded as <pre><code>1</code></pre>, <pre><code>1</code></pre> is encoded as <pre><code>10</code></pre>).\nIt's obvious that the bits come in decreasing significance (most significant bit first). Because the value represented is from 1 to 100, the 3 previous bits are also a part of the value.\nI also suspect that\n\nis only a start-of-transmission mark and does not contribute to the data,  because it's larger than all the others.\n",
