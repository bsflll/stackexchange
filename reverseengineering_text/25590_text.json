    "content": "I have some measured data comes from a various types of sensors. The sensors are connected to a data-logger in order to store measurement data. After measurement, the data transported and stored in a logosense data-logger.\nEDIT: For reading the stored measurement data we can use \"HYDRAS 3\" a software developed by OTT (using RS232 serial connection and OTT hrdrosence protocol). After reading the data this read-file has been obtained. At the same time we have monitored the serial port and the communication between the data-logger and HYDRAS to obtain the following monitor-file.\nMy question is how can i map these two file and extract the measured data at different measurement times from the monitor-file?(or just understand the file).\nIt seems that my question is not a cryptography problem, I was wondering how Reverse Engineering can solve my problem. Any starting tips?\nP.S. the read-file is just for level sensor and the measured data are in meters. e.g. 3.522 at time 10:00, 3.515 at time 11:00 and both are measured on 11/11/2019\nAny help or guidelines will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n",
