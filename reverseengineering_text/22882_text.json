    "content": "If I want to debug process in embedded that running linux , I can run gdb-server in embedded and attach to process with Ida.\nThe problem is if this process has 1 thread that can't stop over than x seconds (for example this thread feed the watchdog).\nHow can I attach to debug all threads in the process instead the thread that feed the watchdog(I know the thread id) . Or maybe debug only 1 thread in the process that interesting me.\nWhen I attach to process and debug all thread are stopped.\n",
