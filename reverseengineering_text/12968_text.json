    "content": "This is probably a stupid question.\nImagine our dissassembled function takes 1 parameter, for example \"unsigned short *\"\nHowever, in c++ this could be a BSTR, or something else...what is the best way to figure out the type of input that is expected? \nRight now I am just making educated guesses..but there must be a better way? (Or if someone can point me to good books/resources covering this)\n",
