    "content": "I want to enable telnet in my router (ZTE F670L V9.0.11P1N20D), So, I backup my router and i have a file <pre><code>config.bin</code></pre>, Size 23.5KB. I fired up kali and when i issue this command:\n<pre><code>$ file config.bin\nconfig.bin: OpenPGP Public Key\n</code></pre>\nI got this above output, I tried to extract this via binwalk, but no success.\nEven though, Telnet is enabled on my router by default but the port is filtered:\n<pre><code>PORT    STATE    SERVICE\n21/tcp  open     ftp\n23/tcp  filtered telnet\n53/tcp  open     domain\n80/tcp  open     http\n139/tcp open     netbios-ssn\n443/tcp open     https\n</code></pre>\nI tried resetting the router but still Port is filtered.\nSo, I hope there's a solution to extract that <pre><code>config.bin</code></pre>.\n",
