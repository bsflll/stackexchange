It seems the fourth row does not match with the others? More data would possible simplify the format analysis.\nThe last byte may be a CRC.\nThe second nibble of the first byte may be related to day for row 2, 4, 5, 6, 7. This may be false as it does not hold up for all rows. However, given the fact that the 6th and 7th row only differ at the first byte it is possibly related, assuming the last byte is a CRC.\n",
