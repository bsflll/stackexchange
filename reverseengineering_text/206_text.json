This does take a bit of effort and some resources (purchasing Internet addressable IP address). However, the advantage of this method is that you are virtually guaranteed to capture malware that are actively being used currently in the wild. There is the possibility that you might hit a jackpot and also get infected with a brand new malware that might even exploit 0-day vulnerabilities. This approach is very helpful for people who are already well-versed in the field of reversing. I have used Dionaea (http://dionaea.carnivore.it/) in the past to set up my own honeypot with very good results. It's replete with instructions, background, and references.\nFor beginners and for people who don't want to put too much effort gathering samples, I would advise taking the route of downloading the malware from the sites the other posters have indicated.\n",

An example of this is malware.lu\nRecommendation: Try requesting access to malware.lu and similiar repos. Check the list at the bottom for more. This is a great way to get access to a lot of samples fast.\nHoneypots\nResearchers can use server and client side honeypots to try and collect malware.\nRecommendation:\nCheckout http://dionaea.carnivore.it/ for a server side honeypot. These are great for collecting self propagating malware.\nCheckout https://github.com/buffer/thug for a client side honeypot.\nManually\nYou can browse the shady portions of the internet and look for samples yourself.\nThis is pretty much the standard list of sample sources:\nhttp://www.kernelmode.info/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=308\nEach one of the above samples has its own pros and cons.
