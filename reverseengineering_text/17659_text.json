First choose the function from where you want to start (e.g. <pre><code>main</code></pre>). Go to the <pre><code>main</code></pre> function, right click on the disassembly window (IDA view) and choose Proximity browser. Alternatively press Num -  to open proximity browser or Num + to open graph view. The window will be like this:\n\nRight click on the <pre><code>main</code></pre> rectangle, select Collapse children and then select Collapse parents. Now right click on the blank area, select Add node by name, choose your second function to which you want to connect <pre><code>main()</code></pre>. Here for example I choose <pre><code>printf()</code></pre>. \n\nNow right click in the <pre><code>main</code></pre> rectangle, select Find path, choose <pre><code>printf</code></pre> from the find path window. You can see the connection between <pre><code>main</code></pre> and <pre><code>printf</code></pre> and also the intermediate <pre><code>Log</code></pre> function.\n",
