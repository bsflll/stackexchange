    "content": "Trying to analyse a dump from MC9S12X series MCU and can`t get how IDA making cross flash page references and if it could be done without scripts.\nThe project contains 64 code segments with linear addresses 0x700000, 0x704000,  etc. Every segment`s head points to flash window with virtual address 0x8000. When I try to make automatic analysis all CALL/branch instructions points to the current segment. How could I assign any segment a page number?\n",
