It's for an embedded system, but I don't have any details about the normally targeted environment. \nHere's what <pre><code>file</code></pre> shows: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI4 version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped\nI've tried running it on Linux using qemu and the process immediately terminates with the message \"Killed\". Running <pre><code>strace ./executable</code></pre> returns this:\n<pre><code>execve(\"./executable\", [\"./executable\"], [/*13 vars */] <unfinished ...>\n+++ killed by SIGKILL +++ \nKilled</code></pre>\nI'm using the Debian Wheezy image from here: https://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/armel/\nAny ideas why this is happening?\n",

Hunting for that will require you to search for signal-sending APIs like <pre><code>kill</code></pre> and how/when they're being used by the application.\nA more simple solution, that is not necessarily RE related, could be that the process is killed by the OOM killer.\nTo test that, you can run <pre><code>mesg | egrep -i “killed process”</code></pre> inside the emulated machine.\nIf that's the case, you can easily disable it (add <pre><code>vm.oom-kill = 0</code></pre> in <pre><code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code></pre>).\n",
