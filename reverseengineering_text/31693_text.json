I actually feel like reversing flutter built apps did not get much reverse writeups on the community. one of the tools for the task <pre><code>reflutter</code></pre> which I used in this case failed because the <pre><code>flutter</code></pre> version built with the <pre><code>apk</code></pre> is not supported by the <pre><code>reflutter</code></pre>. so the author provided  docker image in which one allows to implement his own patches there is manual Flutter code change is supported using specially crafted Docker. but the environment variables passed there, included <pre><code>HASH_PATCH=[Snapshot_Hash]</code></pre> <pre><code>COMMIT=[Engine_commit]</code></pre>. in this case if I know the <pre><code>snapshot Hash</code></pre> from the <pre><code>apk</code></pre> how can I get the matching <pre><code>Engine commit</code></pre> for example in this case this is <pre><code>Engine SnapshotHash: adb4292f3ec25074ca70abcd2d5c7251</code></pre>, so how can I retrieve the matching <pre><code>Engine Commit</code></pre>?\n",

It would make sense to read this script and see if it misses something.\n",
