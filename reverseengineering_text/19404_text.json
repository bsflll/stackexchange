    "content": "There are certain older, non-DirectX-based games that I can hack inside of a VM, which is amazing because I can save snapshots of states to then restore if, say, the game crashes after I attempt something. The time savings here are fantastic, what with not having to redo what I did to get to a certain point.\nThe issue is that I would like to achieve the same sort of thing, but with games that utilize DirectX 10+. You can't do that with VMs due to a lack of support, graphically. (You can technically do it with VMWare, but you also need to buy a hardware GPU unit of theirs, which is thousands of dollars.)\nBearing that in mind, are there any applications that can help achieve this? Short of that, is there any theoretical (possibly even practical) way that, on a host, one could pause an application, then capture the state of execution such that it could be resumed later on said host? Something like a memory dump plus gathering context of threads, register states, and whatever else might be needed--as well as what steps might be to restore that full state?\nI know this is probably a bit of an outlandish question, but I appreciate any insight on the matter. Thank you!\n",
