    "content": "Using <pre><code>radare2</code></pre>, I am reverse engineering a custom language interpreter.  It stores compiled functions as a list of pointers to language primitives.  I would like to <pre><code>seek</code></pre> to these locations, but typing in the hex addresses is very frustrating.  I can't seem to find any syntax for saying \"seek to the address stored at the current location\".\nE.g., say I am looking at the following in visual mode:\n<pre><code>; UNKNOWN XREFS from entry0 @ 0x400382, 0x400384\n; UNKNOWN XREF from entry0 @ +0x82\n;-- section..text:\n0x004000b0      .qword 0x00000000004002f3 ; aav.0x004002f3    ; [01] -r-x section size 736 named .text\n0x004000b8      .qword 0x0000000000000064\n0x004000c0      .qword 0x0000000000400301 ; aav.0x00400301\n0x004000c8      .qword 0x000000000040032e ; aav.0x0040032e\n0x004000d0      .qword 0x000000000040030c ; aav.0x0040030c\n. . .\n</code></pre>\nThe \"current location\" is at <pre><code>0x004000b0</code></pre>, and it stores the value <pre><code>0x4002f3</code></pre>, which is where I'd like to seek.  For now, I have to type <pre><code>g</code></pre> followed by reading and typing out, or selecting and pasting, the address <pre><code>0x4002f3</code></pre>.\nIs there some efficient way to say \"seek to the value stored at <pre><code>$$</code></pre>\"?\n",
