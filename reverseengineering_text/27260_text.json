Then you can overwrite the variable by struct names such as for instance:\nIf you have this code:\n<pre><code>mov rax, qword [rsi + 8]\n</code></pre>\nYou can do:\n<pre><code>\"td struct ms1 { uint64_t a; int member1; };\"\naht ms1.member1\n</code></pre>\nThen the code will be documented:\n<pre><code>[0x000052f0]> pd 1\n0x000052f0      488b4608       mov rax, qword [rsi + ms1.member1]\n</code></pre>\nThere is nothing automatic in this process.\n",
