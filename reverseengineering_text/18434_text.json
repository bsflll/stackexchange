    "content": "I was trying to patch an application, but the application is required to exact same class size as the original one but editing class file with JByteMod, Recaf or whatsoever always changes the class file size. Is it possible to patch class file without changing its size? I have one older patch which I got from Internet & its have the exact same thing.\nI was trying to patch the application by putting static byte array instead of the private static byte (to bypass some restriction).\nHow can I do this without changing the size of the class file?\nThe jar file is required Java 9.0.4 to run & I have tried JBE bytecode deitor: http://set.ee/jbe/ but it was not able to open the class file.\n",

            "content": "Can you post the classfile, as well as the changes you want made to it? Depending on the changes, it should be possible. Obviously if you want to add a lot of new code or data, that won't be possible without changing the size, unless you delete a corresponding about of existing code from the classfile.\nAnyway, Krakatau is capable of editing a classfile without changing the size. In particular, if you disassemble a classfile in roundtrip mode and reassemble it without modification, you'll get the exact classfile back. However, it still requires knowledge of bytecode and the classfile format to understand which changes you can make without affecting the size, or which things to delete to balance out increases in size.\nThat being said, this is likely not a fruitful approach. If the jar is checking classfile size, it is likely doing other integrity checks as well. Your best bet is to just find the integrity checks and remove them.\n",

It works for only one class file. Though the other two class file changes the file size. I have noticed one thing that disassembling original class file with \"Krakatau\" &amp; assemble it back make the changes. &amp; running it with \"javap -c\" shows lots of difference.

The program is working fine now but after 20min the software crash automatically, because heap dump shows memory leak but I don't able to fix it. can you please take a look at this program &amp; rectify the issue if possible.
