    "content": "I am using Intel Pintool BBLs to count the total number of static and dynamic basic blocks.\nThe below is the distinguish between static vs dynamic basic blocks (bbls):\n\nA dynamic basic block is defined as a sequential run of instructions\nthat starts with an instruction that is a target of a taken branch and\nends with the first taken branch in sequence. Thus, one dynamic basic\nblock may contain one or more static basic blocks that are defined as\nfollows: a sequential run of instructions that starts with an\ninstruction that is a target of a taken branch and ends with the first\nbranch in sequence\n\nIntel Pintool User Manual  defines their basic block (BBLs) as:\n\nPin breaks the trace into basic blocks, BBLs. A BBL is a single\nentrance, single exit sequence of instructions. Branches to the middle\nof a bbl begin a new trace and hence a new BBL\n\nI am not clear if Pintool BBLs is static or dynamic bbls?\nPlease advice!\n",
