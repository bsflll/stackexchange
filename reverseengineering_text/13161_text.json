            "content": "I'm not sure what you mean with \"original tiling\". As far as I know Immunity just displays the <pre><code>CPU</code></pre> window initially. All the other windows are normally closed. So I would recommend to just close all windows and open <pre><code>View</code></pre>><pre><code>CPU</code></pre>.\n\nTo \"reset\" the tiling within the <pre><code>CPU</code></pre> window. Just close all windows expect the <pre><code>CPU</code></pre> window. Minimize the <pre><code>CPU</code></pre> window manually and click <pre><code>Tile horizontal</code></pre> afterwards. Normally the tiling within the <pre><code>CPU</code></pre> window should be centered now.\n\nIn the case you want to display multiple windows and re-arrange them:\n\nclose all windows\nopen the windows of interest with <pre><code>View</code></pre>><pre><code>CPU</code></pre> / <pre><code>Memory</code></pre> / <pre><code>Log</code></pre>/ <pre><code>...</code></pre>\nTile windows with: <pre><code>Window</code></pre> > <pre><code>Tile horizontal / vertical</code></pre>\n\nUntil now, I didn't find a better solution.\n",
