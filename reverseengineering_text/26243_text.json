    "content": "I am looking for instruction-level hooking library for win32 x86/x64.\n\nI want to write hook insertion and hook implementation code in C/C++ (compiled into dll).\n(Therefore instrumentation tools are out of question. Injection is not a problem in my case.)\nI need hooking onto arbitrary addresses.\nI want the hooking library saving registers, call my native function, and then restoring registers, and return/jump to specific addresses.\nIt is very tedious to do this on manually at a per-site basis and therefore I want an existing library. Furthermore, x64 MSVC does not support asm. It seems that manual hook is impossible unless other tool-chain are used?\n\nDoes such kind of hooking libraries exists?\n",
