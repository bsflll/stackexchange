Once you set the hardware breakpoint you can go to <pre><code>Breakpoints</code></pre> tab, right click the breakpoint on which you want to set condition, and select <pre><code>Edit</code></pre>. Now you can set the break condition.\nLet's say your value is written to the memory in such way <pre><code>mov dword ptr ds:[edx],eax</code></pre>, so you can set the <pre><code>Break condition</code></pre> to <pre><code>EAX==2F</code></pre>, and then the program will be interrupted only when the value to write is equal to 2F.\n",
