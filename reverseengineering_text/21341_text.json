    "content": "I'm reversing a 32bit binary for a challenge I got at a college lab and I'm having a hard time trying to understand the intent of the asm code.\nThe binary is a 10 level reversing game where you get no info at the start and have to figure out everything on your way on building a flag at the end.\nBasically it uses a lot of encryption techniques to derive strings from integer values (as far as I got). I figured out some of the imports it uses like <pre><code>LoadLibraryA</code></pre>, <pre><code>GetProcAddress</code></pre> (I guess it uses them later on somehow). \nWhere I'm currently stuck is the asm code calls <pre><code>GetProcAddress</code></pre> with <pre><code>kernel32.dll</code></pre> handle as the first argument and <pre><code>0</code></pre>( or <pre><code>NULL</code></pre> I guess ) as the second argument. The return I get is then used to make some integer division. My problem is that I get <pre><code>NULL</code></pre> from the <pre><code>GetProcAddress</code></pre> call and then when hitting the <pre><code>idiv</code></pre>, I get a Division By 0 Exception thrown. \nHere's a picture: \nOn <pre><code>0x00401A85</code></pre> <pre><code>eax</code></pre> is <pre><code>0</code></pre>(<pre><code>NULL</code></pre>). Any ideas on how to solve this? What's the idea behind passing <pre><code>0</code></pre>(<pre><code>NULL</code></pre>) as the second parameter?\nThanks!\n",

            "content": "According to Microsoft Docs: GetProcAddress:\n\n<pre><code>lpProcName\n</code></pre>\nThe function or variable name, or the function's ordinal value. If\n  this parameter is an ordinal value, it must be in the low-order\n  word; the high-order word must be zero.\n\nHere the second parameter is an ordinal value. This may be done intentionally to hide the function name that the program imports. According to Wikipedia: DLL:\n\nEach function exported by a DLL is identified by a numeric ordinal and\n  optionally a name. Likewise, functions can be imported from a DLL\n  either by ordinal or by name. The ordinal represents the position of\n  the function's address pointer in the DLL Export Address table. It is\n  common for internal functions to be exported by ordinal only. For\n  most Windows API functions only the names are preserved across\n  different Windows releases; the ordinals are subject to change.\n\nTo get the function name first see the DLL file name in <pre><code>LoadLibrary()</code></pre> or <pre><code>LoadLibraryEx()</code></pre>. Open that DLL in IDA. Go to View Menu > Open subviews > Exports. Or use <pre><code>dumpbin /exports mydll.dll</code></pre> command to list all the exported functions and their corresponding ordinals. See dumpbin reference for further details.\n",
