    "content": "I made an iOS app that simply changes the background color when I tap the button. the goal is to change the color with Hopper. I successfully changed the color from blue to red but I cannot change from blue to green because the string \"green\" is bigger than \"blue\" so it's overlapping the next instruction:\n\n\n\n\nSo my question is what can I do ?\n",

You'd also need to update all the code referencing <pre><code>\"blueColor\"</code></pre> to use your new space address. One such candidate space could be strings describing segment and sections for <pre><code>__TEXT</code></pre> and <pre><code>__text</code></pre> respectively in the Mach-O header. Both of them will be exactly 16 bytes (padded with zeroes).\n",
