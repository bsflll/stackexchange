When I load the file again in IDA, I can see two functions - <pre><code>Start</code></pre> and <pre><code>WinMain</code></pre>\nFrom what I understand, <pre><code>Start</code></pre> is the entry point for an exe and it does some initialization before it calls <pre><code>WinMain</code></pre> or <pre><code>Main</code></pre>.

            "content": "First, please read this.\nEssentially the difference is (in both cases) that one - the entry point - refers to the address where the initial code will be located and the other - \"main function\" - will be the one provided by the (C) runtime, potentially hiding gory details from you.\n\nFrom what I understand, <pre><code>Start</code></pre> is the entry point for an exe and it\n  does some initialization before it calls <pre><code>WinMain</code></pre> or <pre><code>Main</code></pre>. Are\n  <pre><code>DLLEntryPoint</code></pre> and <pre><code>DLLMain</code></pre> similar functions for Dlls?\n\nThis is almost correct. <pre><code>Start</code></pre> is the symbolic name of the entry point in this case, true. However, whether it performs some kind of initialization depends entirely on the library. I wager IDA has recognized some runtime library (such as the Visual C++ runtime) by way of a FLIRT signature and used that information to point out <pre><code>DllMain</code></pre> to you.\nConceptually <pre><code>DLLEntryPoint</code></pre> and <pre><code>DLLMain</code></pre> mirror what you found for <pre><code>.exe</code></pre> files, yes.\n",
