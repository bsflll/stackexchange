    "content": "I'm trying to reverse engineer an ages-old game compiled with Borland C++ in 1995. So far, I have found out that start @0x401000 passes to __startup in cw3220.dll (which apparently is Borland's C++ runtime dll) the following:\n\npointer to the begin of a list of global static constructors (<pre><code>{ char flag0; char flag1; void* fun}</code></pre>)\npointer to end of said list\npointer to begin of a list of destructors (as above)\npointer to end of dtor list\nint flag - GUI app or not (should __startup call <pre><code>main(argc,argv,env)</code></pre> or <pre><code>WinMain(hInstance,hPrevInstance,lpCmdLine,nShowCmd)</code></pre>)\nunknown int flag1\npointer to entry function\npointer to a function which IDA has automagically named <pre><code>matherr</code></pre>\npointer to a function <pre><code>matherrl</code></pre>\nunknown int flag2\nunknown int flag3\n\nIs there any documentation available which tells the meaning of flag1/2/3 in the info struct, flag0/1 in the ctor list entries and how Borland C++ handles exceptions - functions using classes always call <pre><code>__InitExceptBlock</code></pre>, but I never see checks for exceptions after function calls, how is try/catch handled?\n",

            "content": "<pre><code>cw3220.dll</code></pre> indicates that you're looking at BC++ 5.0. AFAICS the only official documentation regarding the startup code is BC5/source/RTL/source/startup/Win32/c0nt.asm, plus <pre><code>_startup.h</code></pre> and <pre><code>startup.c</code></pre> (also somewhere under <pre><code>source/RTL</code></pre>). The struct is defined in <pre><code>_startup.h</code></pre>:\n\n<pre><code>typedef struct module_data\n{\n    INIT *init_start;           /* start of a module's _INIT_ segment */\n    INIT *init_end;             /* end of a module's _INIT_ segment */\n    INIT *exit_start;           /* start of a module's _EXIT_ segment */\n    INIT *exit_end;             /* end of a module's _EXIT_ segment */\n    int  flags;                 /* flags (see below) */\n    int  hmod;                  /* module handle */\n    int  (*main)();             /* main/WinMain/_dllmain function */\n    int  (*matherr)(void *);    /* (EXE only) _matherr function */\n    int  (*matherrl)(void *);   /* (EXE only) _matherrl function */\n    long stackbase;             /* (EXE only) base of stack */\n    int  *fmode;                /* (EXE only) address of _fmode variable */\n} MODULE_DATA;\n\n/* MODULE_DATA flags.\n */\n#define MF_WINDOWS  1           /* this is a Windows application */\n</code></pre>\nIf you install from PAKs then it can happen that the RTL sources don't get installed even if you select everything, but the RTL source is present in the BC5 directory on the installation CD (at least in my copy). That documents at least the calling side.\nA lot of BC++ 4 internals were documented in the Borland Open Architecture Handbook that had to be ordered separately at nominal cost (one floppy). I can't locate the stuff ATM but I've seen copies floating around on the 'net, under the name of <pre><code>bc4boa.zip</code></pre>...\n",

IDA is fairly good at recognising BC++ library functions; if all else fails you can tell it to apply various BC++ signatures explicitly. The C library code included with the free compiler should be fairly similar to that shipped with BC++ 5.02 (see <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/PFYWyEWQ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">heap.c</a>).</span>",

That's why I mentioned using small test programs and a similar-enough reference compiler; that allows you to match functions and data incrementally by their function and the way they're used by other code (e.g. startup).</span>",
