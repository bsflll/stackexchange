I'll try to keep it short. Anyways, when trying to xref an operand (to find its offset), it brings me to an rdata function. It looks like this:\n<pre><code>.rdata:00000001419318D8                 dq offset aFhealth      ; \"fHealth\"\n</code></pre>\nAny idea how I can get the offset from this? It's the only thing that shows up when I search for fHealth in the strings view, and in this game the game itself is stored in the exe, not in another dll.\n",
