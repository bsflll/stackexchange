    "content": "I have recently came across the following sequence of assembly instructions. \n<pre><code>call    ds:WSAStartup\npush    ecx\npush    edi\nmov     ecx, 69E65AC4h\nmov     edi, 2776452Ah\npop     edi\npop     ecx\njmp     short loc_ABCD\n</code></pre>\nPlease help me make sense of these particular 4 instructions below:\n<pre><code>mov     ecx, 69E65AC4h\nmov     edi, 2776452Ah\npop     edi\npop     ecx\n</code></pre>\nWhy would you move direct values into registers, just to over write them with next 2 instructions?\nADDED:\nIn regards to Rolf Rolles and peter ferrie comments bellow. First off, thank you, guys, for your input. I really appreciate it. What puzzles me the most and seems to be relatively interesting is the fact the the executable in question seems to be clean and clear of code obfuscation of any sort. How relevant is such a small amount of obfuscation for AV defeating purposes? I would assume, not too relevant. \nI have also came across the post here on RE What is the purpose of 'mov edi, edi'?  . \nRE user QAZ on the accepted answer mentioned something about support of run time hot patching. Could it be something along those lines?\n",

The compiler is pretty good about eliminating useless code like that (through non-memory-based liveness analysis, one of the oldest and simplest global data flow analyses) so I doubt that code would be generated by a compiler, except perhaps with optimizations disabled (and even then I am skeptical, since the values are not used in any computation).</span>",
