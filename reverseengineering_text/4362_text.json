    "content": "How can I view the <pre><code>XMM0</code></pre>-<pre><code>XMM7</code></pre> registers within OllyDbg? I can right click on the registers window and go to <pre><code>view MMX</code></pre> registers, but I'm not exactly sure that these are the same. I see an instruction: <pre><code>MOVSS DWORD PTR DS:[ESI+8],XMM0</code></pre> and as step through that instruction, the value shown in <pre><code>MM0</code></pre> on the register window does not become the value stored at <pre><code>[ESI+8]</code></pre>.\nSo, I suppose another question is: Are the <pre><code>XMM0</code></pre> and <pre><code>MM0</code></pre> registers different?\n",

            "content": "To answer properly your question, yes. <pre><code>xmm</code></pre> registers were introduced by Intel with the <pre><code>SSE</code></pre> instruction set (IS) in 1999 with the Pentium III CPU. <pre><code>SSE</code></pre> stands for Streaming SIMD Extension and is a set of vector instructions. <pre><code>xmm</code></pre> registers are 128bit wide and can hold 4 <pre><code>floats</code></pre>, 2 <pre><code>doubles</code></pre>, or 16 <pre><code>chars</code></pre>. <pre><code>SSE</code></pre> can speed up signal processing applications (image processing, sound processing, compression, ...), encryption, and others quite dramatically when used properly. \nOn the other hand, <pre><code>mm</code></pre> registers are part of the <pre><code>MMX</code></pre> IS, another vector instruction set older than <pre><code>SSE</code></pre> (1997 I suppose), and are 64bit wide. \nNowadays the vector instruction sets are becoming quite a fashion in a certain way (vector <pre><code>CPUs</code></pre> were the standard for supercomputers back in the 70s & 80s - Cray's, ThinkingMachine's, ... computer were all vector based). In the past few years, Intel came up with many versions of <pre><code>SSE</code></pre> and two new IS called <pre><code>AVX</code></pre> & <pre><code>AVX2</code></pre> (Advanced Vector Extension) with 256bit wide vectors implemented on SandyBridge/IvyBridge/Haswell, and <pre><code>AVX-512</code></pre> first implemented on the KNC (Knight's Corner) of the Xeon Phi processor & co-processor line.\nI encourage you to check the Intel documentation & Wikipedia for more information.\n",
