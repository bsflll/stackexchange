    "content": "I'm using IDA batch scripting to run a script on a dataset of malware\nthe problem is i need to run the VB6 idc script after auto analysis is finished, and wait for it to finish and find all the functions, then run my own script (my script is in IDApython and VB6 script is a idc file)\nto manually run this VB6 script i go to file and choose script file ( there is no menu button or shortcut added)  and wait for it to finish and find all VB6 functions\nso what is the easiest way to achieve this? can i execute a idc script from my IDApython script and wait for it to finish?\n",
