    "content": "I'd like to know how to change stdin multiple times for the given binary for debugging purposes.\nI know I can launch the application with\n<pre><code>r2 -r profile.r2 -d binary\n</code></pre>\nWhere, inside the profile.r2 file I have\n<pre><code>program=binary\nstdin=./path/to/some/file\n</code></pre>\nBut I'd like to know how, if at all possible, to switch stdin so that I can supply multiple different inputs during a single debugging session\nWill I have to use <pre><code>r2pipe</code></pre> and its interface or is there a simpler way of achieving this in radare2?\nIf not possible in radare2, how would I go about doing this with <pre><code>gdb</code></pre>?\nThanks for any help on this.\n",

The next call to <pre><code>read</code></pre> will block until more data is available in the pipe, allowing us to supply a different input all while debugging in a single session.\nNOTE: The pipes are prone to breaking so recreating them might be necessary.\n",
