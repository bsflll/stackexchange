    "content": "When I use the ollydbg run trace I don't seem to he getting every single line as I expect to. First off let me explain what Iexpect to see:\n<pre><code>Address hexDumb Command comments EAX ECX etc...\n0042AD43 BLAH JNZ 00112345 somecomment 01010101 10101010... etc....\n0042AD48 FLAH XOR EAX, ECX anothercomment 01010101 10101010... etc...\n</code></pre>\nEssentially each line from the CPU window, all of the data that you see for each line.\nWhen I step into each command by hand in ollydbg then I get to see each command of the thousands that are executed. However when I use the run trace I get a hand ful of commands, somewhere in the range of 50 commands.\n",
