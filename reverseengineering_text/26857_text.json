    "content": "I have a program (P.exe) with several dependencies (A.dll, B.dll etc). I decompiled and studied B.dll, but at runtime, P.exe is using A.dll. The horizon is updating in ISA view-RIP, but I don't have the decompiler view.\nHow can I get the decompiled view of A.dll, where the horizon is ?\nUsing IDA pro 7.5\n",
