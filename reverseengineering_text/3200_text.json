Different ARMs have different instruction sets and use overlapping byte encodings for them. <pre><code>objdump</code></pre> from the Android NDK is a perfect match for CPUs used in Android products, and it's free.\n",

You are either going to produce the same file or something that won't work because disassembler does not make task of making changes to compiled code sufficiently easier. I haven't estimated dump completely, but from what I see, it was not supposed to compile as is. Human readable annotation like \"Disassembly of section .plt:\" are not commented as they should be in real assembler sources.</span>",
