Nevertheless, when I try running an elf-32 or 64 I get the following error:\n<pre><code>E:Cannot execute file. System error: Unknown error. File name: \".\\hello\"\nE:Pin is exiting due to fatal error\n</code></pre>\nThe code I used is a simple C hello world:\n<pre><code>#include <stdio.h>\nint main()\n{\n\n   printf(\"Hello, World!\");\n   return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\nCompiled with:\n<pre><code>gcc -m32 hello.c -o hello\n</code></pre>\nI am new to Pin, nevertheless I gathered it acts as it's own binary loader so I'm surprised this did not work.\nThank you in advance.\n",

However in the downloaded zip the pintool is a dll and the pin version is for windows which is why I am confused.  >  \"in any case, this seems to be a PIN support issue and not really about RE\"     Fair enough I'll try asking on intel dev forum\n",
