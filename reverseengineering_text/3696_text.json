            "content": "There are several reasons for that:\n\nCompiler itself - you will get slightly different code while using different compilers due to optimizations compiler implements, its default options.\nto actually run your code, compiler will insert bootstrap code for, processing possible command line commands, security protections that are common today, language specifics support:\n\nbuffer overflow - stack cookies\nUAC protections\nRTTI - real time type information, C++ thing\nand there are others too.\n\nAnother thing, is compiler optimizations which in most cases will make the code you wrote, look completely different. In some cases, compiler can event remove you code at all - you will get an \"empty\" executable :-)\n\nI hope that you understand, that to add all the above, compiler needs to add some code and this is even before <pre><code>your code</code></pre> is there. Of course, you can disable all of the above by playing with the parameters.\nReducing Executable Size is a pretty good list of useful info which can help you to understand what is going on under the hood.\nMy suggestion is to write the following code\n<pre><code>int main()\n{\n   return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\nremove all optimizations and start your study from there by adding/removing compiler options one in a time.\nHave Fun!\n",
