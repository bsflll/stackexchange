You will also get statistics related to the various kinds of slack within the hiberfil.sys files and interesting NTFS metadata within both active contents and slack.\nHere's a direct download link:\nhttps://arsenalrecon.com/apps/download/HibernationRecon_1.1.0.55_Beta.zip\nSome screenshots and more information here:\nhttps://arsenalrecon.com/apps/hibernation-recon/\nWe'll post updates @ArsenalArmed.\n",

You might want to check it out with them.\nThe Moonsols Windows Memory Toolkit has an utility called \"hibr2bin.exe\" that is able to convert windows8 hibernation files to raw dumps, those should be similar to windows10's, so they have a good chance of working.\nAdditionally, I encountered this message from more than a year ago:\n\nWe've analyzed the hiberfil.sys file format of Windows 8, and will release a Decompressor a month later. Anybody who want to joint us or want to own the Decompressor may mail to us, [emailÂ protected].\n\nyou might want to hit him up.\n",
