Thus, any modification to the <pre><code>interpreter</code></pre> variable will invalidate the hash.\nI also have no idea what the numbers inside the <pre><code>instructions.txt</code></pre> file mean, because only the obfuscated interpreter understands the meaning of those numbers. So I can't remove the hash check from the <pre><code>instructions.txt</code></pre> file, because I don't know where it is.\nAny ideas, how to deobfuscate such application?\n",

I would add <pre><code>print</code></pre> statements to print the variables of the inner functions of the implementation of <pre><code>F(x)</code></pre>, if I see that some variable is a constant, then I can delete the code computing that variable to simplify the function, and keep iterating.

For this I'd run this on linux with <pre><code>strace</code></pre> and check how the python interpreter deals with this file on a level of system calls. If additional read exists, the option may be real. In addition it is possible that it loads some libraries, which can be seen when python interpreter is running with command line options <pre><code>-d</code></pre> (debug) and <pre><code>-v</code></pre> (verbose).\nIf it opens \"interpreter.py\" I'd copy the script and run the copy from the same folder with changes. If it reads it by name and checks only its checksum the problem is solved.\nIf this doesn't work, I'd suggest that it takes the file name from <pre><code>__FILE__</code></pre> constant, and change it in the copy to point to the original file. If the same assumptions remain, problem solved.\nIf this doesn't work, I'd try to check for a library function that computes checksum and override it. If it exists, overridden function will return the required value, and same assumptions remain, problem solved.\nIn addition I'd check if it imports <pre><code>inspect</code></pre> module and calls something like <pre><code>inspect.getsource</code></pre> (this gets the source of the function). If it is so - just override it with something that will return the original function.\nIf this doesn't work, I'd seriously try to understand the obfuscated function, but there is one more option: it is possible to write LD_PRELOAD like library which will override all the file IO, and will push to the obfuscated code the original version for computing the checksum.\n\nGood luck.\n",
