    "content": "I have some code (I assume Delphi) which uses only the EAX and EDX register for passing the arguments (and of course the stack if more are required). I looked which calling conventions would match, but I haven't found one which uses only EAX and EDX. \nAFAIK Borland fastcall/register is using EAX and EDX, but also ECX, which is not the case here.\nCan I tell IDA somehow about this calling convention? How would I do this?\n",
