    "content": "I've been trying to reverse engineer a malware that has been packed with <pre><code>VMProtect v3.0</code></pre>. My first instinct was to google an automated way for this and I found a script. Unfortunately the script to unpack <pre><code>VMProtect</code></pre> protected binary does not work with version 3.0.\nSo far I've seen that the packer changes the access rights of the sections to be writable, decrypts the original code and writes the code to the sections then changes the access rights for those sections back to their initial values. I saw that by putting breakpoint on the <pre><code>VirtualProtect</code></pre> API. After the final call to <pre><code>VirtualProtect</code></pre> I put the access breakpoint on the sections that had <pre><code>executable</code></pre> right and when my breakpoint was hit I expected it to be the <pre><code>OEP</code></pre> but when I dumped the process it did not run.\nFrom my research I understand that you need to rebuild the <pre><code>IAT</code></pre> and tools like <pre><code>UIF</code></pre> & <pre><code>Scylla</code></pre> won't be any help. Can you give me some tips on how to find the <pre><code>OEP</code></pre> or how to deal with this kind of packing mechanism in general?\nP.S. This is the first time I am dealing with <pre><code>VMProtect</code></pre> protected malware.\nUPDATE\nSha256 Hash: <pre><code>8200755cbedd6f15eecd8207eba534709a01957b172d7a051b9cc4769ddbf233</code></pre>\n",

            "content": "Note: I never unpacked VMProtect myself.\nFrom looking at a sample unpackme, all intermodular calls that normally pointed to the IAT, are replaced with direct calls to what I think are obfuscated redirections inside the VMProtect's section that eventually lead to code inside .dlls. It's possible the executable will function if dumped correctly without rebuilding the import table, but it won't work after a reboot when .dll addresses change. Easy but unreliable ways of knowing which redirection leads to which imported function I can think of are by tracing or setting execution breakpoints on imported .dlls and calling the redirections. You can also dig deep into the import resolution mechanism of VMProtect.\nSome protections virtualize the entire entrypoint function but I don't know if VMP has that as a feature. This means setting a page guard on the executable section won't break on the OEP - it's going to break on the first non-virtualized function called by the OEP function. The virtualized OEP function executes inside the protector's section. So if the OEP is virtualized what I'd try doing is finding the VM entry for that function (in VMProtect it's a push  + call pattern) and setting the entrypoint to that when dumping. You can also paste the entrypoint function from another unprotected executable - for example if you have an earlier unprotected build of this malware compiled in the same environment in which case it's possible you even can borrow the imports.\n",
