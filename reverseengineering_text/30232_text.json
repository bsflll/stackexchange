            "content": "TLDR: In radare2, while debugging, you use <pre><code>dr <register>=<val></code></pre>\nUse the -d flag to begin Radare2 in debugging mode\n<pre><code>r2 -d /usr/bin\n</code></pre>\nYou'll have a prompt in front of you, type v and then p a few times to get to the debugging view.\nPress colon to enter commands. You'll most likely want to analyze the binary. To do this, press colon and then <pre><code>aaa</code></pre> or <pre><code>aa</code></pre>. Note, that <pre><code>aaa</code></pre> does could take more time, but does performs a more in-depth analysis.\nOnce in debugging mode, use db [address] to set a breakpoint. For example, to set a breakpoint at main\n<pre><code>db main\n</code></pre>\nAnd you can get to main, enter <pre><code>s main</code></pre>. This jumps to main (s is for seek).\nThen, if you want to change the register <pre><code>rdi</code></pre>\n<pre><code>dr rdi=0x20\n</code></pre>\nFor more register options, see: https://r2wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/options/d/dr/\n",
