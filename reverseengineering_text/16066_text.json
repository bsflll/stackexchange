    "content": "I need some help identifying this IC. It comes from a bladeless fan.\nIt is presumably a 230V Power MOSFET(?) element connected to the FCM8201 Three-Phase Sine-Wave BLDC Motor Controller.\nThe thick top traces come from a capacitor connected to the rectified 230V AC.\nMore photos on the EEVBlog Forum.\n",
