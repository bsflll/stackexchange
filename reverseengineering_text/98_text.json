            "content": "I initially thought you wouldn't be able to dump the program, but it turns out that you can — see the second section of this answer.\nRunning the program\nMost of the usual methods won't work because the executable is setuid. If you start the program normally, it runs with elevated privileges (euid ≠ ruid), and most debugging facilities are reserved to root. For example, anything that relies on attaching to the program with <pre><code>ptrace</code></pre> is reserved to root. This includes just about anything you could do in a debugger. Linux lets you dump the memory of a running process (with <pre><code>ptrace</code></pre> or through <pre><code>/proc/$pid/maps</code></pre> and <pre><code>/proc/$pid/mem</code></pre>), but that too is disabled for a setuid executable.\nYou can run <pre><code>strace ./bin</code></pre>, and see what system calls the program makes. However, this runs the program without any extra privileges. It may well stop early and complain that it can't read a file, or that it isn't running as the right user.\nYou can see statistics like CPU usage, IO usage, network usage, memory usage, etc. in <pre><code>/proc/$pid</code></pre>: files like <pre><code>status</code></pre>, <pre><code>sched</code></pre> and <pre><code>net/netstat</code></pre> are world-readable (whether the program is actually started with extra privileges or not, the setuid restrictions apply). The one interesting thing I see is the program's network connections. The really juicy stuff, like memory contents (<pre><code>mem</code></pre>) and even open files (<pre><code>fd</code></pre>) is disabled either way. Preloading a library with <pre><code>LD_PRELOAD</code></pre> or running the program with a different <pre><code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code></pre> is also disabled either way. Nor will you get a core dump.\nSo what works? You can see open network connections, maybe one of them will give you a clue or will be spoofable. You can try to figure out what files the program accesses by modifying them when you can, or by running the program from another directory (try making a symbolic link).\nIf you have access to a chroot jail on the machine, try running the program from there. If you can run a virtual machine which implements shared folders (e.g. VMware or VirtualBox), see if you can access the program from there. This is all about subverting the security of the system: the permissions are designed to hinder you in your task.\nAn advanced technique is to observe the program under heavy load and try to deduce what it does from the time it takes. Pollute the disk caches and see what files become quickly accessible. See how the swap usage varies depending on what the program does (so you get an idea of how many different pages are in its working set, not just how much total memory it's using). A lot of trial and error will be required. When you know the code and are trying to obtain the data, this is a well-known side channel attack. When you don't know the code, I expect it to be very difficult to obtain useful information this way.\nDumping the memory contents\nI initially thought you couldn't dump the memory of the program because of the setuid bit (which usually wouldn't be a problem because you'd just copy the executable, but here this isn't possible because the executable is not readable). This turns out to be wrong. If you attach to the program with <pre><code>ptrace</code></pre> before calling <pre><code>execve</code></pre> (like running <pre><code>strace ./bin</code></pre> does), you do have access to <pre><code>ptrace</code></pre> in all its glory, including <pre><code>PTRACE_PEEKDATA</code></pre> and <pre><code>PTRACE_PEEKEXEC</code></pre>. That doesn't run the program setuid, so it may behave differently, but the code and static data loaded into memory are the same either way.\nKudos to samuirai for pointing this out.\nHere's an overview of how you can dump the program's memory:\n\nFork, and call <pre><code>ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, ...)</code></pre> in the child then execute the program (<pre><code>execl(\"./bin\", \"./bin\", NULL)</code></pre>).\nIn the parent, call <pre><code>waitpid</code></pre> to wait for the child to return from <pre><code>execve</code></pre>.\nFigure out the address at which the code is loaded. The value of the IP register (obtained through <pre><code>PTRACE_GETREGS</code></pre>) should give a clue, and you can look for file format headers.\nRead the child's memory word by word (<pre><code>PTRACE_PEEKTEXT</code></pre>, <pre><code>PTRACE_PEEKDATA</code></pre>).\nReconstruct the file format (e.g. make an ELF binary from text and data sections) if needed. Dump out the data into a file.\nKill the child — it won't even get to execute anything.\n\nDougall pointed out a working proof-of-concept tool for ELF executables: xocopy.\n",
