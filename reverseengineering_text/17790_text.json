    "content": "IDA shows this following code in separate subroutine. \nAssembly:\n<pre><code>sub_180049410 proc near\njmp     rax\nsub_180049410 endp\n</code></pre>\nPseudo-Code:\n<pre><code>__int64 __usercall sub_180049410@<rax>(__int64 (*a1)(void)@<rax>)\n{\n  return a1();\n}\n</code></pre>\nThe previous subroutine calls it as (off_180052510 and sub_180049410 are same)\n<pre><code>mov     rcx, [rsp+0C8h+var_88]\nmov     rax, [rcx]\nmov     r8, rsi\nmov     edx, 5\nmov     rax, [rax+18h]\ncall    cs:off_180052510\nmov     rcx, [rsp+0C8h]\ntest    eax, eax\njs      loc_18000969B\n</code></pre>\nSo, why IDA shows it in separate subroutine? Can I join that in it's previous function?\n",

            "content": "No. Ofc, you can modify assembly in IDA with API funcs by yourself, but there is no need in this. <pre><code>call</code></pre> instruction is not just jumping to code, it also modifies stack, pushing there return address, so called function can correctly return (read https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_26.html ). Thats why this code is shown in another subroutine, and thats why just inlining <pre><code>jmp rax</code></pre> to code won't be correct in this case.\nAlso, rax value will be known only in runtime, so IDA's static analysis can't provide information, which function exactly will be called here. So <pre><code>sub_180049410</code></pre> its just function to call some other function via pointer to it.\n",
