    "content": "I'm new to reverse engineering. So I decided to start with some game files in my computer. The main goal was to understand how hex editor used to identify files and extract needed data.\nIn my case I have 2 <pre><code>.ebx</code></pre> files and Chunk ID file. The goal is to use the <pre><code>ebx</code></pre> to extract the data in the chunk file but I am confused. I used 010 editor template to see whether it will find any wav/mp3 data, and it did. I appreciate if someone can explain some of the stuff here and give me some good tuts where I can learn this kind reversal?\nChunk ID file\nEbx File audio\n",
