    "content": "I had some fun using IDA Pro Dalvik Debugger in the past using AVD emulator. \nHowever I stumbled upon a APK that somehow does not run well inside AVD. APK runs fine on a real device so I am trying to use IDA Pro dalvik debugger to debug the APK on a real device. \nThe problem is, when using AVD all I had to setup was packagename and activity name in the <pre><code>Debugger Setup -> Set specific options</code></pre> and debugger worked well but trying on a real device keep fails with message like <pre><code>ADB error: listener 'tcp:239166' not found</code></pre> or <pre><code>IDA started the application but unable to connect ..</code></pre> message. \nI tried <pre><code>adb forward</code></pre> on a port Dalvik debugger is using but no progress :(\nCan anyone provide help? Thanks in advance.\n",
