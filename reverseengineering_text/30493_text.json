    "content": "I currently don't have a pc. I have two rooted devices <pre><code>Arm64</code></pre> host device with Debian rootfs and the device to be debugged which contains the lldb-server binary <pre><code>armv7</code></pre>. I am trying to remote debug my android device using LLDB. I pulled the <pre><code>lldb-server</code></pre> binary from android ndk24 and put it in <pre><code>/data/local/tmp</code></pre>. Installed Debian sid on <pre><code>another term</code></pre> and <pre><code>apt</code></pre> installed <pre><code>lldb</code></pre>.\nI connected client device via wifi-hotspot (one with <pre><code>lldb-server</code></pre>) using the host with the linux rootfs.\nThe commands I ran on server device\n<pre><code>./data/local/tmp/lldb-server platform --listen \"*:2000\"Â  --server\n</code></pre>\nChecked using <pre><code>netstat</code></pre> and the lldb-server had bound to all addresses(<pre><code>0.0.0.0:2000</code></pre>)\nOn host(client <pre><code>lldb</code></pre>) device in <pre><code>debian sid</code></pre> terminal I ran:\n<pre><code>apt install lldb\nlldb\nplatform select remote-android\nplatform connect connect://192.168.201.132:2000\n</code></pre>\nThen I got <pre><code>error failed connect port</code></pre>.\nHowever, using <pre><code>GDB</code></pre> and <pre><code>gdbserver</code></pre> everything worked perfectly. I have tried installing <pre><code>lldb</code></pre> on <pre><code>debian buster</code></pre> but same result and even ran the <pre><code>lldb-server</code></pre> binary on the host(device with <pre><code>debian sid</code></pre>) but same result. Right now I'm stuck here. How do I solve this?\nHelp will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\nEdit Here is output of <pre><code>telnet</code></pre>\n<pre><code>root@localhost:~# telnet 192.168.43.1 2000\nTrying 192.168.43.1...\nConnected to 192.168.43.1.\nEscape character is '^]'.\nConnection closed by foreign host.\nroot@localhost:~# telnet 192.168.43.1 5555\nTrying 192.168.43.1...\nConnected to 192.168.43.1.\nEscape character is '^]'.\nKilled\nroot@localhost:~#\n</code></pre>\nAnd heres same network output from lldb.\n<pre><code>lldb) platform select remote-android\n  Platform: remote-android\n Connected: no\n(lldb) platform connect connect;//192.168.43.1:2000\nerror: Invalid URL: connect;//192.168.43.1:2000\n(lldb) platform connect connect://192.168.43.1:2000\nerror: Failed to connect port\n(lldb)\n</code></pre>\nAnd now I dont really know the problem. Should i try installing on a different rootfs? Let me do that.\nEdit 2\nInstalled ubuntu focal and still got same results on lldb 10.0.0.\n",

I finally managed to use <pre><code>lldb</code></pre> remote debugging but again faced more challenges but eventually prevailed.\nWhat I did was instead of using <pre><code>lldb</code></pre> platform command I used <pre><code>lldb gdbserver</code></pre> command which function correctly but had a caveat of accepting local connections only and rejecting connections from external addresses.
