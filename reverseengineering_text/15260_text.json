    "content": "Hello!\nI want to get the touch overlay of a Chromebook Pixel Display Assembly to work. I attached a picture of the Cable coming out of a mxT1664S touch controller. Can someone tell me what type of receptacle I need to make a breakout board? Also, any clues about what this cable might transfer are highly appreciated.\nThank you!\n",
