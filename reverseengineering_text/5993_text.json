It is not currently accepting answers.\n                                \n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Questions on software development are off-topic here, but can be asked on Stack Overflow.\n\n\nClosed 10 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Improve this question\n                    \n\n\n\nI've been trying to figure how a html5 browser like chrome or firefox performs geolocation under the hood but I'm running into some difficulties.\nDifficulties\nTo be more precise, I want to know what happens when a piece of javascript calls <pre><code>navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition (success_func)</code></pre> but before <pre><code>success_func</code></pre> actually gets called back. I want to know how the browser goes about obtaining the latitude and longitude coordinates. What's the protocol it uses? What servers does it query to obtain this information? etc.\nHere's what I have determined and tried:\n\nChrome and Firefox uses the MAC of nearby wifi access points to obtain geolocation by sending it to googlesapi.com. It is this MAC-wifi based implementation I am most interested in.\nBy the time <pre><code>success_func</code></pre> gets called, the browser has already obtained the geolocation data.\nI made limited progress using proxy and packet captures like tcpcatcher and wireshark. I see a query is being made to <pre><code>googleapis.com:443</code></pre> but of course it's over tls/ssl which means I can't read it. (using ssl monitor in tcpcatcher causes geoloc to fail in browser)\nI tried using builtin devtool and console in browser but it seems to omit the communication that grabs the geoloc data. For example, using chrome's devtool (ctrl+shift+I), it does not show any <pre><code>CONNECT</code></pre> methods or connections to <pre><code>googleapis.com</code></pre> even though tcpcatcher clearly captures that during geolocation.\nI've tried looking at the source to determine this but not having much luck. The problem is that browser codebases are just humongous and locating the pertinent class and source files would be difficult especially since I'm unfamiliar with their overall design. grepping for interesting keywords only goes so far.\n\nIf you guys were trying to determine and reverse the protocol a given browser uses to implement geolocation how would you guys proceed?\nOther Resources\nHere are some things I've already looked at that I found helpful:\n\nhttp://samy.pl/mapxss/\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/3041113/how-exactly-does-html5s-geolocation-work\n\nThe problem is some of the info mentioned there is out-of-date and no longer accurate. My aim now is to figure out exactly what changed and how an external custom application can use this protocol itself for geolocation.\n",

Assuming Firefox for Desktop, there is only the NetworkGeolocationProvider (FirefoxOS may also use GPS).\nIn essence, Gecko opens an XMLHttpRequest to the URL specified in <pre><code>about:config</code></pre> as <pre><code>geo.wifi.uri</code></pre>. Per default this is <pre><code>https://www.googleapis.com/geolocation/v1/geolocate?key=%GOOGLE_API_KEY%</code></pre>.\nBlink performs its http request in network_location_request.cc, with the same API endpoint defined as in Firefox (cf. location_arbitrator_impl.cc).\n(NB: I looked at Gecko HG revision a4f779bd7cc2 and Blink SVN revision 287303)\n",
