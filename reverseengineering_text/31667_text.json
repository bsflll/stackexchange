If you would already know for sure that one of the two too frameworks was used that you may already have found indicators for the one or the other framework, which would make writing a concrete answer much easier. If this was just a guess by you than it would be better to remove it from the question as it could mislead people and end up in answers that are not helpful to you.\n",

            "content": "There are several ways to identify which cross platform framework(s) are used within an app:\n\nUse the Internet and learn what files and components are added by a certain framework and then look at the APK file of your app. Often certain file-names or file extensions inside the APK are good indicators which framework is used. https://stackoverflow.com is a good place to start. Read questions on different framework and make yourself familiar with file names mentioned for each framework. You will soon be able to see which files are specific for which framework.\n\nUse sample apps that make use of a certain cross platform framework. Often you can find sample apps (e.g. Hello world) in compiled form in Play Store or on  Github project pages (or other developer services). Download them and unzip them and and compare them to your APK file. Note that some frameworks may change over time so old apps of framework X my look on APK level totally different than newer apps.\n\n\nAlternatively you can try to build sample apps you find in source code form yourself but that would require to make yourself familiar with every framework technology and build-system.\n",
