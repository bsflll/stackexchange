    "content": "I am doing a reverse homework. see the following pictures:\n\nas can be seen from this picture, before call <pre><code>push touch3</code></pre>, \"saved rip\" is at 0x5561dca8, which is equal to the current rsp(0x5561dca8).\nonce called <pre><code>push touch3</code></pre>, the \"saved rip\" is at 0x5561dca0, which is also equal to new rsp(0x5561dca0).\nMy question is, why push instruction changed the \"saved rip\" address.\n",

Then, a simple <pre><code>push</code></pre> will overwrite the saved <pre><code>rip</code></pre>.\nAs you can notice on the first picture, your saved <pre><code>rip</code></pre> is at <pre><code>0x5561dca8</code></pre> and, your <pre><code>rsp</code></pre> as well. Therefore, a <pre><code>push</code></pre> operation will store the address of the <pre><code>touch3</code></pre> function as return address of the stack-frame.\nNothing really difficult here.\n",
