    "content": "I modified the byte-code of a third party Java desktop application's <pre><code>.class</code></pre> file (and repacked the <pre><code>.jar</code></pre>), only to see that during runtime, my change made no difference, unless my change caused a crash somehow. The most simple experiment I did was to use a hex editor and simply replace a letter in a text string in the <pre><code>.class</code></pre> file. Runtime (of course, after restarting the Java application), the text was still the original text.\nHere's an example of the original byte-code:\n<pre><code>ldc \"Some text.\"\n</code></pre>\nUsing a hex editor, I changed the string, and looked again in the byte-code editor:\n<pre><code>ldc \"Xome text.\"\n</code></pre>\nThe decompiled code also shows the modified string. There are no more references to the original string in the <pre><code>.class</code></pre> file. Despite this change, the displayed text at runtime is \"Some text.\" rather than \"Xome text.\".\nIs there anything I need to take into consideration, e.g. some sort of cache (outside the scope of the application) that must be cleared? I tried to delete the \"Temporary Internet Files\" in the Java console, to no avail.\nThank you for any assistance you can provide! :)\nRemoved: The decompiled code and modified files for the real-world application I was experimenting on, due to their questionable nature (didn't really help anyone anyway).\n",

            "content": "Firstly, I would mention that instead of using a general purpose hex editor, a dedicated <pre><code>class</code></pre> editor would be much better. There are plenty of them. \nYou tried editing the <pre><code>class</code></pre> file and to your surprise the changes you made were not reflected. At that point you should be pretty much sure that there must be some other tricks such as generating the strings dynamically, encryption, obfuscation etc.The <pre><code>class</code></pre> files could also be loaded from some other locations such as a <pre><code>cache</code></pre> which you do not expect.\nOne way to get information about which classes are loaded is to use the following command line switch while starting java.\n<pre><code>java -verbose:class -jar <Your jar file>\n</code></pre>\nThis way the <pre><code>jvm</code></pre> will notify you when classes are loaded and from which locations. Using this you can know if there is some sort of hidden <pre><code>cache</code></pre> from which it loads <pre><code>class</code></pre> files.\nAfter this option fails, i.e. when you are sure that there is no such hidden <pre><code>cache</code></pre>, you can almost be sure that there is <pre><code>encryption</code></pre> involved or the strings are generated \ndynamically. <pre><code>Decompiling</code></pre> would help, but of course if there is no obfuscation to hinder decompiling. If everything else fails, you may try inspecting the <pre><code>bytecode</code></pre> of the <pre><code>class</code></pre>files as a last resort.\n",
