    "content": "I am trying to use the OllyFlow plugin for OllyDbg 1.10. It requires WinGraph32.exe, which was apparently distributed with IDA at some point, because the book Game Hacking says:\n\nWingraph32 is not provided with OllyFlow, but it is available with the free version of IDA\n\nIt appears the current free version of IDA no longer has WinGraph32.exe included - so, how can I get the OllyFlow plugin to work?\n",
