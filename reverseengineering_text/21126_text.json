    "content": "I am currently trying to reverse an app and I have one very stupid question I cannot figure out by myself.\nThe app was packed using FSG 2.0 and I successfully manually unpacked it and rebuilt the IAT (at least I believe I did).\nThe app is a Windows 32 bits PE and it has a small GUI (it's a crackme that has one simple input and once you click ok, it just replies goodboy or badboy).\nFrom what I can see, it imports the SendMessage function and actually uses it but I can't find any GetMessage (nor PeekMessage) function imported.\nConsidering it is a GUI, is that even possible ?\nAny hints appreciated !\n",

So there's a chance some function from there gets called and does the equivalent of GetMessage. Also, no need to call <pre><code>GetProcAddress()</code></pre> ... either use the NT Native API as well or better yet, walk the export table and find your desired function by hash.
