That is, /etc/passwd has the shell set that way (see <pre><code>chsh</code></pre> on full-blown systems). Typically your alternative shells will also have to be in <pre><code>/etc/shells</code></pre> so as to be eligible as login shells.\n",

Have a look here to have an idea.\nIf, instead, you want to change where the symbolic link points, you can you have to be root and use the <pre><code>ln</code></pre> command. Keep in mind that changing the shell in this way can have serious unwanted consequences.\n",
