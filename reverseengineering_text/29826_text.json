    "content": "Suppose the decompiler came up with something like this:\n<pre><code>if (Status >= 0)\n{\n  // ... some other pseudo code\n}\n</code></pre>\nIs it possible to prettify this code with the <pre><code>NT_SUCCESS()</code></pre> macro, like this:\n<pre><code>if (NT_SUCCESS(Status))\n{\n  // ... some other pseudo code\n}\n</code></pre>\n... which codifies the same condition as shown in the previous pseudo code? I haven't found a way as of yet. It's cosmetic, sure, but it still would be nice to be able to make this sort of adjustment.\nVersion of IDA 7.7 with matching decompiler.\n",
