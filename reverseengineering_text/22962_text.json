An extending\n  operator is of the form kxtw, where k is the kind of integer we want\n  to widen and w is the width of the narrow value. For the former, the\n  kind of integer can be U (unsigned) or S (signed, i.e. two’s\n  complement). For the latter the width can be B, H or W which means\n  respectively byte (least 8 significant bits of the register),\n  half-word (least 16 significant bits of the register) or word (least\n  significant 32 bits of the register).\nThis means that the extending operators are uxtb, sxtb, uxth, sxth,\n  uxtw, sxtw.\nThese operators exist because sometimes we have to lift the range of\n  the source value from a smaller bit width to a bigger one. In later\n  chapters we will see many cases where this happens. For instance, it\n  may happen that we need to add a 32-bit register to a 64-bit register.\n  If both registers represent two’s complement integers then\nadd x0, x1, w2, sxtw  // x0 ← x1 + ExtendSigned32To64(w2)\nThere is some kind of context that has to be taken into account when\n  using these extension operators. For instance, the two instructions\n  below have slight different meanings:\nadd x0, x1, w2, sxtb // x0 ← x1 + ExtendSigned8To64(w2) add w0, w1,\n  w2, sxtb // w0 ← w1 + ExtendSigned8To32(w2)\nIn both cases the least significant 8 bits of w2 are extended but in\n  the first case they are extended to 64 bit and in the second case to\n  32-bit. Extension and shift\nIt is possible to extend a value and then shift it left 1, 2, 3 or 4\n  bits by specifying an amount after the extension operator. For\n  instance\nmov x0, #0                // x0 ← 0 mov x1, #0x1234           // x0 ←\n  0x1234 add x2, x0, x1, sxtw #1   // x2 ← x0 + (ExtendSigned16To64(x1)\n  << 1)\n                            // this sets x2 to 0x2468 add x2, x0, x1, sxtw #2   // x2 ← x0 + (ExtendSigned16To64(x1) << 2)\n                            // this sets x2 to 0x48d0 add x2, x0, x1, sxtw #3   // x2 ← x0 + (ExtendSigned16To64(x1) << 3)\n                            // this sets x2 to 0x91a0 add x2, x0, x1, sxtw #4   // x2 ← x0 + (ExtendSigned16To64(x1) << 4)\n                            // this sets x2 to 0x12340\nThis may seem a bit odd and arbitrary at this point but in later\n  chapters we will see that this is actually useful in many cases.\nThis is all for today.\n\nhere is a sample unicorn python emulation\n<pre><code>#code modified from unicorn sample\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nfrom unicorn import *\nfrom unicorn.arm64_const import *\nprint (\n\"Register X30 on start = 0x10\n\"\n\"Register W0  on start = 0x02\n\"\n\"Emulate 5 ARM64 instructions that follows\n\"\n\"ADD X30, X30, W0,UXTW#0\n\"\n\"ADD X30, X30, W0,UXTW#1\n\"\n\"ADD X30, X30, W0,UXTW#2\n\"\n\"ADD X30, X30, W0,UXTW#3\n\"\n\"ADD X30, X30, W0,UXTW#4\n\"\n\"Register X30 on end = 0x10+0x2+0x4+0x8+0x10+0x20 == 0x4e\"\n)\nCODE =  b\"\\xDE\\x43\\x20\\x8B\\xDE\\x47\\x20\\x8B\\xDE\\x4b\\x20\\x8B\\xDE\\x4f\\x20\\x8B\\xDE\\x53\\x20\\x8B\"\nADDRESS    = 0x10000\ndef test_arm64():\n    try:\n        mu = Uc(UC_ARCH_ARM64, UC_MODE_ARM)\n        mu.mem_map(ADDRESS, 2 * 1024 * 1024)\n        mu.mem_write(ADDRESS, CODE)\n        mu.reg_write(UC_ARM64_REG_X30, 0x10)\n        mu.reg_write(UC_ARM64_REG_W0, 2)\n        for i in range (ADDRESS,ADDRESS + len(CODE),4):\n            mu.emu_start(i, i + 4)\n            x30 = mu.reg_read(UC_ARM64_REG_X30)\n            w0  =  mu.reg_read(UC_ARM64_REG_W0) \n            print(\">>> x30  = 0x%x w0 = 0x%x\" %(x30,w0))\n    except UcError as e:\n        print(\"ERROR: %s\" % e)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    test_arm64()\n</code></pre>\nemulation results\n<pre><code>:\\>python uniaarch64.py\nRegister X30 on start = 0x10\nRegister W0  on start = 0x02\nEmulate 5 ARM64 instructions that follows\nADD X30, X30, W0,UXTW#0\nADD X30, X30, W0,UXTW#1\nADD X30, X30, W0,UXTW#2\nADD X30, X30, W0,UXTW#3\nADD X30, X30, W0,UXTW#4\nRegister X30 on end = 0x10+0x2+0x4+0x8+0x10+0x20 == 0x4e\n>>> x30  = 0x12 w0 = 0x2\n>>> x30  = 0x16 w0 = 0x2\n>>> x30  = 0x1e w0 = 0x2\n>>> x30  = 0x2e w0 = 0x2\n>>> x30  = 0x4e w0 = 0x2\n</code></pre>\nwhen you start with -0x2 in W0 see the extended results\n<pre><code>>>> x30  = 0x10000000e w0 = 0xfffffffe\n>>> x30  = 0x30000000a w0 = 0xfffffffe\n>>> x30  = 0x700000002 w0 = 0xfffffffe\n>>> x30  = 0xefffffff2 w0 = 0xfffffffe\n>>> x30  = 0x1effffffd2 w0 = 0xfffffffe\n</code></pre>\nSXTW and -2\n<pre><code>>>> x30  = 0xe w0 = 0xfffffffe\n>>> x30  = 0xa w0 = 0xfffffffe\n>>> x30  = 0x2 w0 = 0xfffffffe\n>>> x30  = 0xfffffffffffffff2 w0 = 0xfffffffe\n>>> x30  = 0xfffffffffffffff0 w0 = 0xfffffffe\n</code></pre>\nSXTW and 2\n<pre><code>>>> x30  = 0x12 w0 = 0x2\n>>> x30  = 0x16 w0 = 0x2\n>>> x30  = 0x1e w0 = 0x2\n>>> x30  = 0x2e w0 = 0x2\n>>> x30  = 0x30 w0 = 0x2\n</code></pre>\n",
