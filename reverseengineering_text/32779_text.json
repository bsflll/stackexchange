    "content": "So, I'm attempting to create a mod for an older game, Fable: The Lost Chapters.  I was able to find the MacOS release of the game, which contains symbols, and I was also able to find a leaked debug build for windows, which also contains symbols.  Both have made the modding process far easier, however this function specifically I have been unable to call or hook.\nHere's what the function looks like within IDA when demangled.\nMacOS\n<pre><code>CThingCreatureBase::SetCurrentAction(CCreatureActionBase const&)</code></pre>\nWindows Debug Build\n<pre><code>bool __thiscall CThingCreatureBase::SetCurrentAction(CThingCreatureBase *this, const CCreatureActionBase *action)</code></pre>\nAnd here's how I'm hooking the function.\n<pre><code>typedef bool (__thiscall* tSetCurrentAction)(CThingCreatureBase*, CCreatureActionBase const &);\n\ntSetCurrentAction oSetCurrentAction;\n\nbool __fastcall hSetCurrentAction(CThingCreatureBase* This, CCreatureActionBase const & action)\n{\n    return oSetCurrentAction(This, action);\n}\n\nif (MH_Initialize() == MH_OK)\n    std::cout << \"MinHook Initialized\" << std::endl; \n\nif(MH_CreateHook((LPVOID)0x6644F0, &hSetCurrentAction, reinterpret_cast<void**>(&oSetCurrentAction)) == MH_OK)\n        std::cout << \"SetCurrentAction Hooked\" << std::endl;\n\n    if (MH_EnableHook((LPVOID)0x6644F0) == MH_OK)\n        std::cout << \"SetCurrentAction Enabled\" << std::endl;\n</code></pre>\nThough for some reason, the game crashes whenever <pre><code>oSetCurrentAction</code></pre> is called.\nHere's the exception when debugging <pre><code>Exception thrown at 0x00692F03 in Fable.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0xCCCCCCD0.</code></pre>\nI'm hopeful that I'm just missing something obvious, what someone will easily spot, but that's probably not the case.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n",
