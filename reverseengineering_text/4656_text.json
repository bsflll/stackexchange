    "content": "I have the following question: Could it be that OR EAX, EAX represents a if statement?\nThe reason why I ask is, I have read the following in an assembly code:\n<pre><code>....\nOR EAX, EAX\nJNZ funct.A\n.....\n</code></pre>\nBefore the line OR EAX, EAX comes, the function strcmp is called which has the return value 00000001 stored in EAX. \nSo I have found out that: if the return value is greater than zero indicates that the first character that does not match has a greater value in string1 than in string2.\nSo, my first question would be: What does that mean \"if the return value is greater than zero indicates that the first character that does not match has a greater value in string1 than in string2.\"\nAnd the second question would be: Can I translate the assembly code in pseudo C-Code like the following:\n<pre><code>if(EAX == 1){\n   funct.A;\n}\n</code></pre>\nIs that ok? Or completely wrong? If yes, then what would your suggestions?\n",

If the appropriate flag(s) are set they'll take the action, hence any instructions that affect the flag(s) can be used, not only <pre><code>CMP</code></pre>. For example to check if the high bits in rax are zero <pre><code>SHR rax, 32; JZ RAX_IS_0</code></pre> can be used which saves a <pre><code>CMP</code></pre>. As a result, shorter instructions are generally preferred\nThe most commonly used one is <pre><code>TEST</code></pre>. <pre><code>AND eax, eax</code></pre> can also be used, since it's exactly the same as <pre><code>TEST</code></pre> except it destroys the destination (but that's irrelevant in cases where source and dest are the same register like this). However sometimes <pre><code>OR</code></pre> is also used (most likely emitted by the Delphi compiler) because <pre><code>OR reg, reg</code></pre> gives the same results as <pre><code>AND reg, reg</code></pre>. If you check the disassembly you'll notice that <pre><code>CMP</code></pre> is one byte longer:\n<pre><code>83 F8 00  cmp  eax, 0\n09 C0     or   eax, eax\n21 C0     and  eax, eax\n85 C0     test eax, eax\n</code></pre>\nAfter the above instructions the SF, ZF, PF, CF, OF (and AH with <pre><code>cmp</code></pre>) will be modified. <pre><code>JNZ</code></pre> will check <pre><code>ZF</code></pre> and jump if it's not set, i.e. eax is non zero\nPerformance-wise <pre><code>TEST</code></pre> should always be used because <pre><code>TEST</code></pre> can macro-fuse with <pre><code>Jcc</code></pre> but not <pre><code>AND</code></pre> and <pre><code>OR</code></pre>\n\nDoes a JE must follow directly to an CMP?\nDifference between <pre><code>or eax, eax</code></pre> and <pre><code>test eax, eax</code></pre>\nTest whether a register is zero with <pre><code>CMP reg, 0</code></pre> vs <pre><code>OR reg, reg</code></pre>?\n<pre><code>testl</code></pre> eax against eax? \nWhat does the <pre><code>test</code></pre> instruction do? \nuse of <pre><code>TEST</code></pre> instruction with same register\n",

(And <code>ana a</code> to AND with itself, but unfortunately for macro-fusion on Sandybridge-family which <i>can</i> macro-fuse <code>and</code> but not <code>or</code>, people settled on <code>ora</code> and kept using it when moving to 8086).  My answer on <a href=\"//stackoverflow.com/a/33724806\">Test whether a register is zero with CMP reg,0 vs OR reg,reg?</a> explains why it's inefficient and mentions history.  You still see that idiom in SO Q&amp;As; people keep learning from old bad examples</span>",

In order to do conditional jump, you need to set the conditional flags based on the value, and <pre><code>OR EAX, EAX</code></pre> has the nice property that it sets the conditional flags (particularly <pre><code>ZF</code></pre>, which is tested by the subsequent jump) without modifying the value in <pre><code>EAX</code></pre>.\nNot quite sure why <pre><code>OR</code></pre> would be used instead of <pre><code>TEST</code></pre> here; the function seems to be identical for the purpose of the code.\n",
