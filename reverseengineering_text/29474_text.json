    "content": "I'm using frida-trace to log some methods and I've come across the following.\n<pre><code> onEnter(log, args, state) {\n    log(`-[Somefunction somefield64:${args[2]}]`)\n }\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>somefield64</code></pre> returns what I believe to be an int64 like <pre><code>0x81008d000101e7</code></pre>.\nI'm not sure how to see the value behind this, all read methods (readU64/S64) complain it's not a valid address (access violation), so I assume I need to change the format.\nLooking at the method in a disassembler and its references show it just takes a string like\n<pre><code>extern _some_field_constant\n</code></pre>\nwith the call as\n<pre><code>[Somefunction somefield64:**_some_field_constant]\n</code></pre>\nSo I know how to get to the constant with\n<pre><code>Module.getExportByName('SomeModule',\"_some_field_constant\") \n</code></pre>\nAnd I can see the address.\nI'm just not seeing the reference to how to retrieve the field from <pre><code>args[2]</code></pre> via frida-trace.\nI had a similar method with similar functionality (no int64) returned a <pre><code>__NSCFConstantString</code></pre> and just managed to do\n<pre><code>onEnter(log, args, state) {\n    log(`-[SomeOther someField:${args[2]}]`);\n    log(ObjC.classes.NSString.stringWithString_(args[2]))                                                                                           \n}\n</code></pre>\nWhat do I need to do (or read in terms of technical documentation, excuse my incomplete understanding/explanation for experienced reverse engineering folks out there) to parse the int64 into a <pre><code>NativePointer</code></pre> so I can get the address in memory.\n",

The similar method was just super easier it seemed to be the same but it wasn't at all  ðŸ™ˆ had to follow the internal assembly which pointed to a function via br x4 and loads another function from another framework the int64 field matches some conditionals there, so it seems I never was meant to parse it? ðŸ™ˆ . Thank you again and please vote to close this question as I am satisfied :)\n",
