Since then I heard nothing new about this topic.\nSo I would like to know whether anybody knows what the current state of this potential killer poke find is or whether anybody has tried out his sandsifter tool (https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/sandsifter) and could reproduce the killer poke on their processor?\n",
