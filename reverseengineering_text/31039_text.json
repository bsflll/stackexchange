    "content": "I've been looking for a capturebat alternative that will function on Windows 10 and 64 bit.\nI'm not interested in capturbat's network capabilities; rather, I'm interested in its capacity to capture file changes and save a duplicate of all files that were created, edited, or deleted.\nI know you can manually copy all files or set permissions on a certain folder to avoid deletion, but isn't there something like to capturebat?\nthanks a lot,\n",

But the way you describe it it sounds as if a file system filter driver is involved. All links on the above site were dead, but someone put it on GitHub. A cursory look shows that this is an FS mini-filter, something that is supported to this day. So if you revive the project and overcome the hard code-signing requirements on modern Windows, you could arguably get it to work.\n",
