    "content": "I am trying to follow the write-up about hackercalc (a challenge for DEFCON 2015 quals). First, by loading the challenge into gdb, I observe that:\n<pre><code>(gdb) info files\n...\nEntry point: 0xcf8\n...\n</code></pre>\nSo I set a breakpoint at the <pre><code>entry point</code></pre> and run the program:\n<pre><code>(gdb) break *0xcf8\nBreakpoint 1 at 0xcf8\n(gdb) run\nStarting program: /home/tathanhdinh/CTFs/hackercalc\nError in re-setting breakpoint 1: Warning:\nCannot insert breakpoint 1.\nCannot access memory at address 0xcf8\n\nWarning:\nCannot insert breakpoint 1.\nCannot access memory at address 0xcf8\n</code></pre>\nThat seems this breakpoint does not work. I do not understand why it says <pre><code>Cannot access memory at address 0xcf8</code></pre> but I guess that there was some code which runs before has made some interference (so the program cannot reach this entry point), as far as I know, this code must be the <pre><code>elf interpreter</code></pre> of the program.\nSo, I look into segments of the program to check this interpreter, all seems to be normal (except that <pre><code>readelf</code></pre> says the program is a <pre><code>shared object file</code></pre>, but I think that is not important):\n<pre><code>readelf --segments hackercalc\n\nElf file type is DYN (Shared object file)\nEntry point 0xcf8\nThere are 8 program headers, starting at offset 52\n\nProgram Headers:\n  Type           Offset   VirtAddr   PhysAddr   FileSiz MemSiz  Flg Align\n  PHDR           0x000034 0x00000034 0x00000034 0x00100 0x00100 R E 0x4\n  INTERP         0x000154 0x00000154 0x00000154 0x00013 0x00013 R   0x1\n      [Requesting program interpreter: /lib/ld-linux.so.2]\n  LOAD           0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x16b4a 0x16b4a R E 0x1000\n  LOAD           0x016eac 0x00017eac 0x00017eac 0x001e4 0x001ec RW  0x1000\n</code></pre>\nNow, I try to get again information about this process:\n<pre><code>(gdb) info files\nSymbols from \"/home/tathanhdinh/CTFs/hackercalc\".\nNative process:\n        Using the running image of child process 10545.\n        While running this, GDB does not access memory from...\nLocal exec file:\n        `/home/tathanhdinh/CTFs/hackercalc', file type elf32-i386.\n        Entry point: 0x56555cf8\n</code></pre>\nAnd I am totally lost here, why the <pre><code>elf interpreter</code></pre> (which is <pre><code>ld-linux.so.2</code></pre>) can create a new process in this case?\nI try another approach by loading the challenge into IDA, set a breakpoint at the entry point, then run but IDA simply hangs up!!!\nSo my question is: how can this happen? Am I totally wrong about the code executed before the entry point? Does the challenge use some special tricks to bypass debugging?\nNB1. Thanks to @Igor, I finally find out how to debug this challenge. In summary, I disable ALSR to get a stable address of the entry point. Then I load it into gdbserver, use IDA to attach this debug session, set a breakpoint at the entry point (whose address is stable by disabling ALSR).\n",
