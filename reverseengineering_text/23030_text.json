    "content": "I'm sorry for such as questions where answer would seem to be easily searched in google...\nSome time ago I have seen table/list of ARMv8 instructions with opcodes and it was perfect, but I lost link. Now I'm trying to find at least some sources where opcodes of instructions listed and can't.\nThere're some C headers, where opcodes defined in non-readable form, lot of different scientific publications with 1k+ pages (containing no opcodes), etc., but I can't find simple list.\nCould somebody point me?\n",
