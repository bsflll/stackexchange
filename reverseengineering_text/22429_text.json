    "content": "While reversing some J2ME games like Spyro or Tekken 5 Mobile I have encountered a weird obfuscation where all fields, methods and classes have names like A, a, B, b, Aa, Bb etc.\nIt's really hard to read source code like that. Example method can look like this:\n<pre><code>     public static void a(final boolean b) {\n        f.b = b;\n        if (!b && f.a != null) {\n            try {\n                f.a.stop();\n            }\n            catch (Exception ex) {}\n            f.a = null;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIs there a way to restore original names or at least make this code more readable? I would be grateful for any tips.\n",

The only thing that you can do for that is renaming the fields and methods with unique names to make the code more readable.\n",
