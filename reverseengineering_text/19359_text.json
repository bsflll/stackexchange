For example for the 0x16 messages I can calculate 0x6A and 0x6C. If they were the same you could just assume a hidden constant and fix it but it's odd. Xor seems to perform worse. I don't think it's a complex algorithm but I can't figure it out.\n",

That's not the correct method (sometimes it's off by 1), but consider the values of <pre><code>(D1+D2+D3+D4+D5+D6+D7)-D0</code></pre>: for the given data, it has the values <pre><code>['-0xa8', '0x57', '0x156', '0x255', '0x354']</code></pre>.\nWhat's the common property? Yes, they're all divisible by <pre><code>0xFF</code></pre> when subtracted by <pre><code>0x57</code></pre>.\nTherefore, the checksum byte is the sum of all bytes, subtract <pre><code>0x57</code></pre>, modulo <pre><code>0xFF</code></pre>, then if the result is <pre><code>0</code></pre> then replace it with <pre><code>0xFF</code></pre>. (alternatively this can be written as <pre><code>(sum - 0x58) % 0xFF + 1</code></pre>)\nIt is impossible for the checksum byte to be 0.\n",
