    "content": "I have found the command <pre><code>r2 -c 'pi $s'</code></pre> to dump a binary with radare2. I have tried this redirecting the output to a file: <pre><code>r2 -c 'pi $s' binary > dump.txt</code></pre>. The dump is created but radare2 gets unresponsive. Is this a bug, or am I doing something wrong?\n",

But if you hit <pre><code>q</code></pre> (as in <pre><code>q</code></pre>uit) and Enter, radare2 will exit.\nThis is the command that you should use: <pre><code>r2 -q -c 'pi $s' ./a.out > out.txt</code></pre> if you want radare2 to dump the entire binary, then exit.\n",
