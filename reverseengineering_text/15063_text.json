    "content": "I found JTAG header for ARM (OMAP3x). It's a Cortex 10-pin 0.05\" JTAG/SWD Connector.\n(See here)\nI think it's JTAG because PIN#3 and 5 are on GND and it's close of CPU\nWhen I follow the wires, TCK, TDO, TDI goes on missing componant (red circle).\nHere is a picture :\n\nFirst I was thinking an resistor array of 10K for pull up or pull down signals. \nBut first, the left side pads doesn't seem to be wired to GND or Vcc\nSecondly it would be a 6 resistors array witch is not very common\nA last, array resistors have their pads wider on the ends (as the one of 100K*4 on the right bottom of the picture), witch isn't the case here.\n\nSo what it could be ?\nDo you think there is a missing resistor on TMS ? as we can see (perhaps) a pad for resistor (go to GND)\n\nRegards\n",
