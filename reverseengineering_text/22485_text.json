After googling, I try with <pre><code>LD_PRELOAD</code></pre>, <pre><code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code></pre> but no luck. I'm using LUbuntu 18.04.\nSo can you guys help me with this case?\n",

Because on a system for which GLIBC was built, you can execute it as a standalone binary and it will output version and copyright information and some other stuff. Could you perhaps give us the output of running <pre><code>file</code></pre> on both your specific <pre><code>libc.so.6</code></pre> and the ELF file you were given?\n",
