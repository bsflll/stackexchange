    "content": "I've made some Ghidra Loaders and I'm now looking into making some FileSytems but first I have to understand some Ghidra's architecture.\nIn looking what other FileSystems do I've just noticed that there are actually two similarly named classes:\n\n<pre><code>ghidra/Ghidra/Features/Base/src/main/java/ghidra/formats/gfilesystem/GFileSystem.java</code></pre>\n<pre><code>ghidra/Ghidra/Framework/FileSystem/src/main/java/ghidra/framework/store/FileSystem.java</code></pre>\n\nAre these two related in some way I need to understand or is it just a naming coincidence and should I therefore ignore the latter and concentrate on understanding the former?\n",
