    "content": "According to documentation, the LDRD instruction works, as follows\n<pre><code>LDRD    R8, R9, [R3, #0x20];  load r8 from a word 32 bytes above the address in R3, and load r9 from  a word 36 bytes above the address in R3\n</code></pre>\nI understand the first part, R8 loads from a word 32 bytes(0x20) above R3. Its the second part I don't understand. Why is it 36 bytes instead of 32?\n",
