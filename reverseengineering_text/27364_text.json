    "content": "I have a USB device that when connected into the computer ends up showing up as 4 Virtual COM ports in the device manager. As far as I know, two of these are never used. One of them is seldom used and one is mostly used. This is from the perspective of the application that is used with this device. I want to see the traffic on these COM ports and find out how this device works. I have Windows 10 64-bits.\nI just need to monitor the traffic and no read or write anything myself. I think this is called a \"man in the middle\" approach. How do this using software on PC?\n",

For example, several applications can share data\nfrom one GPS device;\nuse real serial ports of remote computer like if they exist on the local\ncomputer.\n",
