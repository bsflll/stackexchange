    "content": "I have found the following lines in a sample which I try to analyze. Here, are the lines:\n<pre><code>   ....\n   push  afg.00401189       \"ntdll.dll\" \n   call  GetmoduleHandleW\n   neg   eax\n   sbb   eax, eax\n   neg   eax\n   RETN\n</code></pre>\nSo, I do not understand the lines after the call instruction. We have sbb instruction between two neg-operations, but what can be the purpose of that. Can somebody explain that ? \nPS: Intuitively, I would say that at the end I have the handle to ntdll.dll in EAX...but the operations between the call and retn are very strange. I am confused.\n",
