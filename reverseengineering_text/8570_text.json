    "content": "IDA Pro's <pre><code>idaapi.BasicBlock</code></pre> objects returned by <pre><code>idaapi.FlowChart()</code></pre> can be of the following types (see <pre><code>gdl.hpp</code></pre> in the SDK sources):\n<pre><code>// flow chart block types\nenum fc_block_type_t\n{\n  fcb_normal,    // normal block\n  fcb_indjump,   // block ends with indirect jump\n  fcb_ret,       // return block\n  fcb_cndret,    // conditional return block\n  fcb_noret,     // noreturn block\n  fcb_enoret,    // external noreturn block (does not belong to the function)\n  fcb_extern,    // external normal block\n  fcb_error,     // block passes execution past the function end\n};\n</code></pre>\nI was able to find examples for all types except <pre><code>fcb_cndret</code></pre>. What does \n\nconditional return block\n\nmean? Could somebody give an example?\n",
