    "content": "Apple developer network site has a small guide about setting up debugging symbols server for Safari browser on Windows.  But it doesn't work. First, the link to actual symbols server \ngets redirected from http to https, but then it just 404s. \nNow, I know that Safari isn't supported on Windows any longer, but I wanted to play with existing version. Any idea if the symbols are actually available somewhere?\n",
