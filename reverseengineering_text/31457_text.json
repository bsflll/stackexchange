I'm guessing some kind of global table or something, but I can't make heads or tails of what it is. What would this be in regular C code?\n",

But to the best of my knowledge IDA and Hex-Rays do not yet offer this sort of functionality. Either way, what I typically do is to try and find code that acts on (i.e. reads or writes) the data.
