    "content": "I'm using IDA (free) 8.4. Each time I open a function (Windows x64) I get a possibly huge block of \"Additional Parent Function\" list on the right.\nIt's useless to me and I'd like to know if I can get rid of it completely. I know I can hide the block (right click menu) but the space taken is still taken when hidden, and I would like to never see it anyway.\n\nIs there any option in IDA to do this? I kinda remember this \"block\" wasn't shown like few years ago.\n",

Simple confirmation is that if it's properly disabled, you won't see the \"unwind\" or \"try\" posterior/anterior comments in the disassembly. If you xref that basic-block (0x1800EF166), and then xref the labels for that ref'd data (then repeat it a few times for those refs), you should be able to detect what is referencing it and adding it as a function chunk for each of those functions. If you hit <pre><code>RUNTIME_FUNCTION</code></pre>, it's EH. However..\n",

You can remove these as documented at hex-rays.com/blog/igors-tip-of-the-week-86-function-chunks, or you can even undef the code at that address if lazy. If all else fails, and it does turn out to be EH related (despite your doubt), you can zero out the address of the <pre><code>IMAGE_EXCEPTION_DIRECTORY</code></pre> in the origin binary. To script removing chunks with IDC, (which I am no expert at), you can likely use <pre><code>remove_fchunk</code></pre> from hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/.idadoc/1077.shtml. Either way, if it's not marked as code, it won't be displayed.\n",
