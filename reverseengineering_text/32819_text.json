    "content": "I have a PE executable (32 bit) GUI program and I tried to reverse engineer it. I opened it in Ghidra and discovered the <pre><code>entry</code></pre> calls <pre><code>wWinMainCRTStartup</code></pre>. However, when I checked <pre><code>wWinMainCRTStartup</code></pre> all the bytes are filed with <pre><code>??</code></pre> and when I tried to disassemble it Ghidra says <pre><code>Can't disassemble uninitialized memory</code></pre>. I'm confused... if the memory is uninitialized then how can the program run at all? But the program does run.\n",
