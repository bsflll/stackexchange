    "content": "I'm working on a buffer overflow CTF challenge. The binary for this challenge includes a <pre><code>give_shell</code></pre> function (they cover shellcode in the next challenge)\nI can successfully overwrite the saved EIP on the stack to redirect execution to the 'give_shell' function:\n<pre><code>080484cb  push    ebp\n080484cc  mov     ebp, esp\n080484ce  sub     esp, 0x8\n080484d1  sub     esp, 0xc\n080484d4  push    0x80485f0 {var_1c}  {\"/bin/sh\"}\n080484d9  call    system\n080484de  add     esp, 0x10\n080484e1  nop     \n080484e2  leave    {__saved_ebp}\n080484e3  retn\n</code></pre>\nHowever, even though I can confirm in GDB that the program is stepping through the <pre><code>give_shell</code></pre> function - no shell launches, either in GDB, locally or using Netcat to the actual CTF server.\nI'm unsure what I am missing here. Is this a case where I need to bind or reverse the shell in order to be able to use it interactively? I've seen that discussed in shellcode examples, but not sure how to do it in this case. \nThank you!\n",

Problem is that the challenge in this case is to point execution to a <code>give_shell</code> function that calls <code>system</code> and supplies the correct argument to open a shell. Calling the <code>system</code> function directly would leave it without the correct argument, correct? Thank you!</span>",
