            "content": "Note: this answer corresponds to the original question.\nI am new to assembly as well so I can see where you are coming from. With that being said, there seem to be quite a few issues with the contrived code that you have posted. \n\nDoes the order of the operands matter? If yes why?\n\nThere are two different styles of human-readable mnemonics used to represent CPU instruction codes: AT&T and Intel. While the order the operands are shown in is different between Intel and AT&T syntax, the order of instruction code bytes in memory is constant.\nIntel syntax:\n<pre><code>08048074 <main>:\n 8048074:       55                      push   ebp\n 8048075:       89 e5                   mov    ebp,esp\n 8048077:       b8 00 00 00 00          mov    eax,0x0\n 804807c:       5d                      pop    ebp\n 804807d:       c3                      ret    \n</code></pre>\nAT&T syntax:\n<pre><code>08048074 <main>:\n 8048074:       55                      push   %ebp\n 8048075:       89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp\n 8048077:       b8 00 00 00 00          mov    $0x0,%eax\n 804807c:       5d                      pop    %ebp\n 804807d:       c3                      ret  \n</code></pre>\nThe (little-endian) byte sequence <pre><code>89 e5</code></pre> is represented as <pre><code>mov ebp,esp</code></pre> in Intel syntax and as <pre><code>mov %esp,%ebp</code></pre> in AT&T syntax. Though the mnemonic representations of the operands are opposite of each other, they represent the same byte sequence. The order of the opcode mnemonics matters in that it is determined by the syntax used to represent the instruction codes.\nThe code\n\nWhat happens to the result after each step of code has been run?\n\nEvery line of the code posted in the question except the last contains at least one illegal operand so only that line could feasibly run.\nAT&T syntax is assumed.\n<pre><code>0x2000: cs cs cs</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code>%cs</code></pre> is a segment register and, being a register, must be prefixed with the <pre><code>%</code></pre> symbol. There are 3 operands here that are all the same register and no instruction. This is illegal. I am not sure what you envisioned would happen here.\n\n<pre><code>0x2001: xor x20,(eax)</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code>x20</code></pre> is an illegal operand. Constants are immediate operands which must be prefixed with the <pre><code>$</code></pre> symbol, so this operand should be <pre><code>$0x20</code></pre>. <pre><code>%eax</code></pre> is a register, hence the <pre><code>%</code></pre> prefix is required. <pre><code>(eax)</code></pre> should instead be <pre><code>(%eax)</code></pre>.\n\n<pre><code>0x2002: and x20,%ah</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code>x20</code></pre> should be <pre><code>$0x20</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code>0x2003: or x20, %dh</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code>x20</code></pre> should be <pre><code>$0x20</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code>0x2004: dec (ebi)</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code>ebi</code></pre> looks like it is supposed to be a register. Did you mean <pre><code>%edi</code></pre> or <pre><code>%ebx</code></pre>? Either way, it lacks the <pre><code>%</code></pre> prefix\n\n<pre><code>0x2005: dec %si</code></pre>\n\nThe <pre><code>dec</code></pre> instruction decrements the contents of its operand by one. So the value stored in <pre><code>%si</code></pre> will be decremented.\n\nFixed up, the code would look like this:\n<pre><code>xor $0x20, (%eax)\nand $0x20, %ah\nor  $0x20, %dh\ndec (%edi)\ndec %si\n</code></pre>\n\nHow do you construct some equivalent code (e.g. c++) from this assembly code?\n\nAssuming that the corrected code is actually correct, someone with sufficient understanding could simply look at this snippet and create a roughly equivalent statement or sequence of statements in a high level language. For mere mortals, there are tools called decompilers.\nResources\nProgramming from the Ground Up by Jonathan Bartlett and\n\"Professional Assembly Language\" by Richard Blum are pretty good IMO. A more technical resource is the System V Application Binary Interface Intel386 Architecture Processor Supplement, which sheds light on some of the mysteries of the processor and virtual memory. SO's x86 wiki has a list of many resources. Of course, there are also the Intel manuals.\n",

            "content": "To answer your third question, from a computer science aspect c++ or any other highlevel language that isn't one to one mnemonic map of machine opcodes; soul purpose is to mitigate complexity. That being said c++ we can infer isn't or shouldn't be a 1 to 1 map to assembly. Some c syntax can't be exactly mapped. \nFor example a jump statement progresses the code to any other byte. So a jump can act like a conditional branch or a function call, etc. All very different statements in c++ yet they use the key part, jump instruction. \nI think a better approach would be to ask how a c++ basic statements compile to assembly. If you understand and know thoughs it then is a simple thing to find those blocks in assembly.\nnote In modern setting most high level languages don't compile to x86 assembly but byte code or some operating specific format, often not far from assembly, however different enough that it requires the operating system to run. This is to abstract the underlying hardware so software doesn't have to get recompiled.\n",
