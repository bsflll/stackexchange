    "content": "I have nearly ruined my Ghidra layout, and was wondering if there is an equivalent to IDA-Pro's Windows->Reset Desktop, which would reset the code browser's layout to its default form.\nI am aware that I can drag the floating windows back into position.\n",

Specifically:\n\nFrom the Ghidra Project window, right click on the code browser tool and click <pre><code>Delete...</code></pre>\n<pre><code>Tools -> Import Default Tools...</code></pre>\nSelect <pre><code>defaultsTools/CodeBrowser.tool</code></pre>, then <pre><code>OK</code></pre>\n\nWorth noting, while in your case it makes sense to delete the current (i.e. broken) tool, that's not a strict requirement. If you import the default tool with a <pre><code>CodeBrowser</code></pre> tool already there, it'll just be imported as <pre><code>CodeBrowser_1</code></pre> and leave the original tool as-is.\n",
