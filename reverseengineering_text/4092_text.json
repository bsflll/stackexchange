    "content": "The code of the functions is still valid but now the <pre><code>_data</code></pre> segment keeps losing 6 bytes everytime I fix it by pressing <pre><code>G</code></pre> going to <pre><code>42A000</code></pre> fixing what it undoes then I scroll down a bit and scroll back up and I'll notice <pre><code>42A000</code></pre> is completely gone when I go into Hex View I'll notice it doesn't show the 6 bytes.\nAlso going bit lower I noticed my string started to get lost too when I started I had a bunch more strings then I have now the first string is cut half way with a bunch of fake assembly code.\nMy strings keep disappearing one by one each time I work on re-factoring it.\nIs there a way to re-position / move this string / constants information or maybe keep it blocked from being de-synced.\nWhats the cause of it? I checked all the functions I've edited they all start and end with the same addresses as a fresh original none re-factored load of the same file.\nHere's a few pictures of the problems.\nThere are the errors in the output that get generated as I scroll down.\n\n\nThis is how it looks good when I use <pre><code>G</code></pre> + <pre><code>42A000</code></pre>\n\nThis is what happens when I scroll a full screen view away from <pre><code>42A000</code></pre> then come back 6 bytes are lost. I'd like to add that <pre><code>align 800</code></pre> I've added it only had <pre><code>align 1000</code></pre> but that's because there was a bunch of zero bytes there so I guess the <pre><code>align</code></pre> just hides em for now I'll use them if I need to later.\n\nHere is the Hex-View after a screw up, you can see the first 6 are not in use.\n\nHere you can see the first String is <pre><code>Player leaving game %s',0AH, 0</code></pre> which isn't even on the strings of the Hex-View above that's how much strings are lost so far.\n\nWhen you scroll down far enough then scroll back up it even makes more of a mess.\n\nAny advise what I should do? I'll probably start from a fresh revision of the exe and slowly start fixing things up and looking at the bottom each time to see if anything messes up. Or is there a way to find out what screwed it up? or maybe a way to prevent further screws up in the future? to be honest I recall it screwed up on a fresh project as well just the first time it messed up it just kept undoing my changes with Keys <pre><code>A</code></pre>'s and <pre><code>O</code></pre>'s and <pre><code>D</code></pre>'s\n",

Do you have unexpected computer crashes?  faulty memory?  corrupted disc structure?\nIf none of those, and in the absence of any better advice I would reinstall IDA, check your hard drives, make sure you have sufficient RAM that is correctly configured in BIOS and check your IDA against a different project.\n",

You should get scared haha. I am almost done renaming from the screwed up project back to a fresh version. Might work better.</span>",
