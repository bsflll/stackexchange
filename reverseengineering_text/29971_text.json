I don't think I'm violating any sort of important confidentiality considerations by simply copying and pasting the response here; I apologize in advance to Hex-Rays if I misjudged that:\n\nWe will try to combine these two type systems into one. However, it is not a simple task:\n\nC types can not express everything that asm level types can (e.g. member comments or representation)\nC types in general cannot be used to represent data items in the assembler listing\nIt is impossible to refer to a member of a C type by its \"id\"\nasm types are used to represent stack frames; I doubt that C types can do this job nicely\n\nThese are just a few things, there are probably many other obstacles on our way. However, the idea is to combine them, or at least hide the struct/enum types from the user and let him work only with local types.\n",

For example, the fact that it's impossible to refer to a member of a C type by its id is irrelevant: it's just a problem in their C-type system. There's nothing preventing them to make a single type system that supports both ways: and has the ability to refer to members of a type by id. You already can import C-type to the Structures and edit either of those 2, and the other one will update accordingly.</span>",
