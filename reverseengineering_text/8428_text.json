            "content": "Roughly three years have passed and this relatively simple question still lacks a proper answer. Encountering the same issue today using IDA 7.0, I might as well spend the time providing a proper answer.\n\nQuoting from IDA's help file\n\n<pre><code>-S###</code></pre>\nExecute a script file when the database is opened.\n  The script file extension is used to determine which extlang will run the script.\nIt is possible to pass command line arguments after the script name.\nFor example: <pre><code>-S\"myscript.idc argument1 \\\"argument 2\\\" argument3\"</code></pre>\nThe passed parameters are stored in the <pre><code>ARGV</code></pre> global IDC variable. Use <pre><code>ARGV.count</code></pre> to determine the number of arguments. The first argument <pre><code>ARGV[0]</code></pre> contains the script name\n\nThe documentation quoted above provides an explicit example for the IDC scripting language but leaves us to interpolate / guess what would be the IDAPython equivalent.\nNaturally, one might assume idc's <pre><code>ARGV</code></pre> parameter will be translated to python's well known <pre><code>sys.argv</code></pre>, which is used precisely for that in most python files as is well-documented to hold the command line arguments provided when a script is run.\nThe name resemblance fooled me too, however because of how python scripts are executed in IDA the documentation above should be treated literally in python as well. The <pre><code>ARGV</code></pre> is the only place arguments are accessible to IDA python scrips executed using the <pre><code>-S</code></pre> flag.\nIn IDA python, however, it is not available as a global paramter but should be accessed through the <pre><code>idc</code></pre> module.\n\nHere's a simple example;\ngiven the followingf <pre><code>myscript.py</code></pre> file:\n<pre><code>import sys, idc\n\nprint(\"Sys args: \" + str(sys.argv))\nprint(\"Idc args: \" + str(idc.ARGV))\n</code></pre>\nExecuting the following command (ignoring the usual IDA banner):\n<pre><code>ida64 -A -S\"myscript.py\" arg1 \"arg one and a half\" arg2 -L/some/other/flags/logfile.txt -t\n</code></pre>\nWill result in the following output:\n<pre><code>Sys args: []\nIdc args: [\"arg1\", \"arg one and a half\", \"arg2\"]\n</code></pre>\n",
