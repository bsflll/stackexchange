    "content": "I used IDA Pro and got the following expression from a produced C file:\n<pre><code>v25 = (*(int (**)(void))(v22 + 464))();\n</code></pre>\nI am trying to figure out the meaning of the above expression with the following links:\nhttp://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/reading-cdecl.html\n\nhttp://www.codeproject.com/Articles/7042/How-to-interpret-complex-C-C-declarations\nI start with <pre><code>(v22 + 464)</code></pre> and then go out of the parenthesis and to the left to the following <pre><code>*(int (**)(void))</code></pre>.\nBut, still can't understand. Any hints?\nEDIT: I guess this expression is not a declaration but a function call.\n(v22+464) is then cast to a pointer to a pointer to a function that takes void as an argument and returns an int. Then that pointer is dereference and the () operator is applied - the function is called.\n",
