    "content": "I'm looking to pull the images off of the game \"Summoners War\" to use for wallpapers and such. I have access to the images themselves, but they seem to be encrypted and cannot be viewed. Looking at the image in a hex viewer shows that the png headers are missing and have been replaced.\nI do have access to the sourcecode after decompiling with APKTool, but I am not entirely sure what I am looking for in order to decrypt the images. Ive looked around for anything relating to 'decrypt' but a lot of it has been dead ends with network decryption, not decryption of the asset files.\n",
