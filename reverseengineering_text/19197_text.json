    "content": "I ran de4dot on a Xamarin app obfuscated using Dotfuscator Professional. However, there's still the random switches and strange ints everywhere. Can de4dot decode this? If not, is there another tool that can?\nI've opened it with dotPeek and dnSpy as well to the same result.\nHere's an example. Most of the logic I need is in chains of these tasks. O6.K does not even exist.\n",
