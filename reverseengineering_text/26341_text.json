    "content": "I am reverse engineering a Windows device driver. My main previous experience was with drivers I had written before, or toy drivers from tutorials.\nI started reversing the driver by searching for IOCTL handlers. However, in the initial driver entry the Driver Object struct lines up such that the function that appears to contain IOCTLs aligns with the \"FasIODispatch\" member. I am on the fence as to whether this is a mistake on my part, or whether it makes sense to define IOCTLs in a Fast I/O dispatch table.\nHere is what I mean:\n\nNow deep nested within that function, there are many comments directly describing the contents as IOCTL handling code.\nFor instance note the following debug string in the driver:\n\nNow, the help here is to help me understand whether this is:\na) Me misinterpreting the driver object struct offsets such that a MAJOR_FUNCTION is missed and place of FastIoDispatch\nb) A sensible interpretation where a fastIo Dispatch table includes definitions of IO Controls.\nI am leaning towards B, but I do not have the experience with FastIO file driver development to know what a fastio file driver dispatch table would look like. The reason I am concerned I have something wrong is that all of the data I have seen so far makes it seem like one would IRP handling structures and FastIO separately. Mixing the two would seem to me as if it were against the point of using FastIO, but who knows what driver developers do in practice.\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can do to help device this. Note this is a 3rd party device driver I am RE'ing in my spare time. I'm not sure what the policy is here, but I'm not sure I should post the name if you want to RE it yourself.\n",
