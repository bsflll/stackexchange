    "content": "I am working on a reverse engineering task, in which I need to recover function prototype (including number of parameters, type of each parameter) from the input binary (<pre><code>ELF</code></pre> binary on <pre><code>64-bit</code></pre> Linux).\nWhile <pre><code>IDA-Pro</code></pre> can be guided to recover function prototype for functions defined inside the binary code, I am trapped in recovering library functions invoked inside the binary code. \nFor example:\n<pre><code>mov str_pointer, %rdi\ncall puts  <---- Library function \n</code></pre>\nSo here is my question: \n\ncan I use IDA-Pro to somehow recover the library function's prototype? \nIf notï¼Œit seems to me that I can benefit from some database on this info? Could anyone shed some lights on this? \n\nThanks\n",

Often you will need to fix things manually. However, I can assure these ways work because I actually use them almost daily.\n",
