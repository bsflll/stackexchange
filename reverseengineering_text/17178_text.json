    "content": "I'm trying to disassembly x64 executable (dll) using Capstone. But operand address returned by it doesn't match disassembly from IDA/HIEW.\nHere is the machine code:\n<pre><code>0x48, 0x8D, 0x0D, 0xED, 0x44, 0x01, 0x00\n</code></pre>\nIn IDA/HIEW the disassembly is:\n<pre><code>lea  rcx,[0000148F8]\n</code></pre>\nBut by using Capstone (with PowerShell bindings) I get different address <pre><code>0x144ed</code></pre>:\n<pre><code>Get-CapstoneDisassembly -Architecture CS_ARCH_X86 -Mode CS_MODE_64 -Bytes (\n    0x48, 0x8D, 0x0D, 0xED, 0x44, 0x01, 0x00\n) -Address 0x1800000004096 -Detailed\n\nSize     : 7\nAddress  : 0x180001000\nMnemonic : lea\nOperands : rcx, qword ptr [rip + 0x144ed]\nBytes    : {72, 141, 13, 237, 68, 1, 0, 148, 204, 148, 0, 17, 0, 128, 0, 0}\nRegRead  :\nRegWrite :\n</code></pre>\nYou can verify this online by using Capstone.js and <pre><code>488D0DED440100</code></pre> as input.\nI've also tried SharpDisasm, but result is the same:\n<pre><code>lea rcx, [rip+0x144ed]\n</code></pre>\nCould somebody help me to understand what's happening here?\n",

            "content": "This is RIP-relative addressing. Basically, it is adding 0x144ed to the address of the very next instruction - i.e. rcx = <pre><code>rip</code></pre> + 7 (since this instruction is 7 bytes) + 0x144ed. In IDA, that instruction is located at 0x404 so it is adding 0x144ed to (0x404+7) = 0x148f8\n",
