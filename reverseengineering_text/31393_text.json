    "content": "As per this recent blog article one can set the PE loader to default to loading all sections. I even knew that. So setting the following setting in <pre><code>cfg\\pe.cfg</code></pre> does the trick:\n<pre><code>PE_LOAD_ALL_SECTIONS = YES\n</code></pre>\nI often find myself needing to load at least the file header (sometimes in hindsight) but there is no explicit option for the file header on the load dialog:\n\nInstead we have the \"Load resources\" checkbox, which -- if checked -- avoids having to do a full manual load, but seems to load both the resources (<pre><code>.rsrc</code></pre> \"segment\") and the file header (<pre><code>HEADER</code></pre> \"segment\").\n\nThat also seems to be the effect of configuring <pre><code>PE_LOAD_ALL_SECTIONS = YES</code></pre>. Alas, if you set the configuration inside the <pre><code>cfg\\pe.cfg</code></pre>, the \"Load resources\" checkbox doesn't get default-checked or so.\nSo my question is: are these two methods to load the file header and resources synonymous? If not, are they overlapping? What are the differences?\n\nExperiment: trying all combinations on handle46.exe from SysInternals\nHere's the outcome of the various settings on a PE file with IDA Pro 8.2.221215:\n\n<pre><code>PE_LOAD_ALL_SECTIONS = NO</code></pre> (default) and no changes on the load dialog:\n\n<pre><code>PE_LOAD_ALL_SECTIONS = NO</code></pre> (default) and \"[✔] Load resources\" on the load dialog:\n\n<pre><code>PE_LOAD_ALL_SECTIONS = YES</code></pre> and no changes on the load dialog:\n\n<pre><code>PE_LOAD_ALL_SECTIONS = YES</code></pre> and \"[✔] Load resources\" on the load dialog:\n\n\nThe odd outcome is 3., because it loads the <pre><code>.rsrc</code></pre> section although it hadn't been asked for it. That's also the reason why I asked this question in the first place.\n",
