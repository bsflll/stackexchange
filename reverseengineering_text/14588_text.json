    "content": "I had bookmarked woodman.com/crackz a couple years back because it looked like it had some good content for learning how to reverse engineer, but I never had the time/vested interest to dig in deep and really start learning. I finally have the time and interest now but I just tried to go to the site and it seems like it's gone. Does anyone know of a mirror/archive of the site or what happened to it? Also if there isn't a mirror/archive what is another good site similar to its content?\n",
