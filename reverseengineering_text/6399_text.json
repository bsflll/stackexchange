    "content": "I am using IDA pro to decompile a series of applications.  These applications share a common feature and what I have found is that in each decompilation each application shares the same set of functions.  If the binary is stripped how does IDA pro work out the function names ?  \nThe functions that I am seeing in common between the applications are all very abstract, for example <pre><code>v404()</code></pre>, and as far as I can work out don't come from any open source library set of functions.\n",
