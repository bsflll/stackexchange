    "content": "This is my first program i am trying to reverse and my intro to this field.\nThe C program will test if two strings match, and it will printf() a message for each occasion.\nThis is what the reversed code snippet looks like:\n<pre><code>call strcmp //compares the strings\ntest eax,eax\njne 1706\n</code></pre>\nI know that jne will jump, if ZF=0.\nWhat i do not understand is what's up with this line:\n<pre><code>test eax,eax\n</code></pre>\nWhat caused this line?\nHow does it relate with strcmp?\nI know that if the result of test is not zero, ZF=0, so jne will jump.\nBut what does it compare exactly, and how does it relate to strcmp?\n",

Anding a value with itself gives the same value, so <code>test eax, eax</code> sets the flags based on whatever eax contains. ZF is set when the result of an operation is zero. jne jumps when ZF is not set. So the jump will be taken when strcmp returns nonzero, meaning the strings are unequal.</span>",
