            "content": "Section information is not used at all when the kernel loads a program into memory to create its process image. In other words, execution in no way depends on section information. \nStripping section information from a binary is not in and of itself necessarily an indicator of dangerous/criminal functionality, although it can serve to make analysis more difficult. \nAccording to VirusTotal, the example binary you linked to contains 29 sections, so I am not sure what that is supposed to be an example of. Perhaps one of the fields in the ELF header having to do with sections has been edited/corrupted to slow down automatic analysis, since section information cannot be displayed.\n\n\nif the section header table is still present in the binary, the ELF header can be repaired so that this information is properly parsed. See here for an example\nrun <pre><code>readelf -h</code></pre> against the binary to see if the ELF header has been corrupted\n\nA number of tools can parse such a binary, including radare2, Cutter, IDA, and Ghidra\n",
