    "content": "I have the following assembly code :\n<pre><code>.....\nlea eax, [ebp+ThreadID]\npush eax              ; lpThreadID\npush 0                ; dwCreationFlags\npush 0                ; lpParameter\npush offset StartAddress  ; lpStartAddress\npush 0                ; dwStackSize\ncall CreateThread\n....\n</code></pre>\nSo, I try to translate it in a C-like pseudocode:\n<pre><code>DWORD* LPWORD eax_lpThreadID = NULL;\nDWORD dwCreationFlags;\nvoid *LPVOID lpParameter;\nSIZE_T dwStackSize;\nLPSECURITY ATTRIBUTES lpThreadAttributes;\n\nHANDLE handle_to_new_Thread = CreateThread(lpThreadAttributes, dwStackSize, ..., lpParameter, dwCreationFlags, eax_lpThreadID );\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see, I do not include the 3rd parameter, namely the parameter <pre><code>LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE lpStartAddress</code></pre>, because I have problems understanding it.\nIn this SO thread i have read that a <pre><code>LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE</code></pre> is a function pointer defined as:\n<pre><code>typedef DWORD (__stdcall *LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE) (\n  [in] LPVOID lpThreadParameter\n);\n</code></pre>\nThat would mean that the 4th parameter <pre><code>lpThreadParameter</code></pre> is a parameter of this. \nBut how can I integrate that information into my pseudo C code program ?\nI am little bit confused about that. Can someone explain it to me? The other attributes/parameters are clear....\n",

            "content": "From MSDN\n\nlpStartAddress is a pointer to the application-defined function to be\n  executed by the thread. This pointer represents the starting address\n  of the thread.\n\nBasically <pre><code>lpStartAddress</code></pre> is the entry point of the thread. This is a callback function. It will be called when the thread is created and executed.\nMore on this,\n\nThe CreateThread function creates a new thread for a process. The\n  creating thread must specify the starting address of the code that the\n  new thread is to execute. Typically, the starting address is the name\n  of a function defined in the program code (for more information, see\n  ThreadProc). This function takes a single parameter and returns a\n  DWORD value. A process can have multiple threads simultaneously\n  executing the same function.\n\nSee this page, for an example on creating threads.\n",
