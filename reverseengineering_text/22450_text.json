            "content": "In fact, this is a fairly recent mitigation mechanism introduced to avoid to leak information about the stack of the crashed application.\nThe \"<pre><code><unknown></code></pre>\" (which is a static string added by <pre><code>-fstack-protector</code></pre>) that you see was previously <pre><code>argv[0]</code></pre>. But, some attackers started to exploit the fact that you could overflow the stack, reach the <pre><code>argv[0]</code></pre> and overwrite it with an address that you choose. Indeed, if you can control the address at <pre><code>argv[0]</code></pre> and crash the application, you can leak the whole stack outside of the application.\nThis technique was mainly used in servers where <pre><code>fork()</code></pre> was used to respawn an instance. As <pre><code>fork()</code></pre> is cloning the memory of the initial process, the ASLR was useless because the same starting memory image was used and, then, the same memory mapping was used again and again.\nIf a secret key or some confidential data were stored in the stack, then an attacker can access it through this feature.\nThat is why, sometime last year, some developers decided to avoid to use <pre><code>argv[0]</code></pre> when displaying information about the stack-smashing and replaced it by <pre><code><unknown></code></pre>.\nHere is an answer on Unix/Linux Stack-Exchange site that pinpoint the part of the code of <pre><code>glibc</code></pre> that is responsible for that.\n<pre><code>void\n__attribute__ ((noreturn))\n__fortify_fail_abort (_Bool need_backtrace, const char *msg)\n{\n  /* The loop is added only to keep gcc happy.  Don't pass down\n     __libc_argv[0] if we aren't doing backtrace since __libc_argv[0]\n     may point to the corrupted stack.  */\n  while (1)\n    __libc_message (need_backtrace ? (do_abort | do_backtrace) : do_abort,\n            \"*** %s ***: %s terminated\n\",\n            msg,\n            (need_backtrace && __libc_argv[0] != NULL\n             ? __libc_argv[0] : \"<unknown>\"));\n}\n</code></pre>\nAnd, here is the comment attached to the original commit introducing the patch:\n\nAvoid backtrace from <pre><code>__stack_chk_fail</code></pre> [BZ #12189]\n<pre><code>__stack_chk_fail</code></pre> is called on corrupted stack. Stack backtrace is very\n  unreliable against corrupted stack. <pre><code>__libc_message</code></pre> is changed to accept\n  <pre><code>enum __libc_message_action</code></pre> and call <pre><code>BEFORE_ABORT</code></pre> only if action includes\n  <pre><code>do_backtrace</code></pre>.  <pre><code>__fortify_fail_abort</code></pre> is added to avoid backtrace from\n  <pre><code>__stack_chk_fail</code></pre>.\n\nI would have liked to give more references and articles in english about this flaw but nobody seemed have write about this thing... Sorry. \nHere is an article explaining it (in French):\n\nStack Smashing Protector : fuite d'informations\n",
