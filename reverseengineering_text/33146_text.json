    "content": "im quite new in this theme and im looking for a way how to extract .jar file from exe file ( upd. its graalvm native image ). If i open this exe as archive (7zip) i can see only .rdata and others ( https://i.postimg.cc/FRXJc92D/image.png , in .rsrc only icons), tried to check with ida pro but i cant extract jar. I think there must be a jar file cuz it opens with java and in hex i saw MANIFEST, COM.CLIENT.LAUNCHER (java path). So can anyone help me with it? If requires i can upload file\n",
