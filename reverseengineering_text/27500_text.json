    "content": "There is function:\n<pre><code>push    65h\npush    edi\ncall    sub_5D8750\n</code></pre>\nIn this case, function takes 65 bytes to be filled with zeros, and edi is memory address starting from which to fill these 65 bytes with zeros. I put breakpoint, this function is called before the WinMain, and immediately at the beginning of the WinMain. What kind of function could it be if IDA didn't recognize it? Maybe ZeroMemory? But why IDA not recognize it? Thanks in advance.\n",

And if you know it's effectively a zero-filling then simply rename it. The reason why IDA may not have recognized it is probably because no signature matched.

I already have issues with the present level of FLIRT in IDA mis-detecting functions as library functions, but it's worth it for all the times it gets the really complex ones right.  You really wouldn't want it to be any more aggressive.\n",
