A jailbroken device can access an iOS device's root file system from a shell or any application (such as iFile).  As of iOS 8, the Applications directory has changed to <pre><code>/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application</code></pre>.\n\nBut from this, I shouldn't?\n\nWell, not necessarily.  If the application is running as root (think iFile or Filza), you can have read and write access to any directory on the device.\n\nMaybe I should write a App to scan the FileSystem on a normal iPhone and a jailbreak one.\n\nIn theory, any application can ask to read or write a file to any directory.  This is frequently how jailbreak checks are done in production apps.  If the file manager does not return an error when trying to read from <pre><code>/var/mobile</code></pre>, then you know the application is being run as root on a jailbroken device.\n",
