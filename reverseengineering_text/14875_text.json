See hex-rays.com/products/decompiler for more details.\nRegarding other news and features see decompiler news page.\nUpdate (12/3/2020):\nThe original answer was written ~2017, and since then IDA added MIPS decompiler support. AFAIK it was added in version 7.5.2.\nSee here for comparison between decompilation and disassembly for various MIPS variants.\n",
