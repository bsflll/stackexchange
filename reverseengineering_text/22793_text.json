    "content": "I am working on a CTF where I need to pass an address as input to a program. This address contains the value 0x09 (the tab character). This is causing me problems, because it seems that bash is interpreting the tab before it is input to the actual program.\nSay I have a simple bash script:\n<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\necho $1\n</code></pre>\nI would then like to pass e.g. \"1\"+\"\\x09\"+\"2\" and have the output from the program be: \"1\\x092\".\nHowever the tab character moves the \"2\" to the second argument and it is then not echoed.\nCurrently if I do\n<pre><code>./script.sh $(python -c 'print \"1\"+\"\\x09\"+\"2\"')\n</code></pre>\nIt just echos \"1\". Is there a way to keep the three characters tied together?\nThanks in advance\n",
