    "content": "Is it possible to see a kind of statistics in IDA about functions and how often they are referenced? When analyzing a program, I find it helpfull.\nFunctions that are referenced very often typically are common functionality. An example would be stuff like <pre><code>strcmp()</code></pre>, <pre><code>malloc()/free()</code></pre>, <pre><code>strlen()</code></pre>, etc..\nSome of those are quite easy to identfiy (like  a <pre><code>strcmp()</code></pre> implementation), and giving a name to those functions early on, makes the analysis of the rest more easy.\n",
