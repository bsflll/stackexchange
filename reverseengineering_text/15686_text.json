    "content": "I have been thinking about it lately and was wondering if a Man In The Middle attack could be established physically on a motherboard.\nThe goal would be to intercept the signals between two components and to manipulate the signals as well. I assume this could be done through drilling holes in the circuit, and having a separate device bridge a new connection.\nWould this be possible?\nThanks.\n",

There is also a device out there for breaking BIOS passwords on certain thinkpads by connecting to an IC of some sort but I can't find the article.\nAlthough those methods probably differ in some aspects from a MITM attack, the way you describe would seem perfectly valid based on those devices.\n",
