    "content": "I am having a problem using a statically compiled QEMU arm version. I am trying to debug an application from an embedded device. Everything seems to work fine except breakpoints on other threads. I am using IDAs remote gdb function to debug. Instead of breaking here \nit gives me a SIGTRAP and goes to here \nUsing hardware breakpoints also doesn't do the trick.\nEdit: The problem doesn't seem to be IDA itself.\nI was using qemu-arm-static version 2.0.0. IDA seems to have the bug I mentioned above. Using commandline gdb-multiarch to try and debug it I get the following error after hitting the breakpoint:\n<pre><code>Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.\n0xf67c523c in ?? ()\n(gdb) info registers\n/build/buildd/gdb-7.7.1/gdb/findvar.c:292: internal-error: value_of_register_lazy: Assertion `frame_id_p (get_frame_id (frame))' failed.\nA problem internal to GDB has been detected,\nfurther debugging may prove unreliable.\nQuit this debugging session? (y or n) y\n\n/build/buildd/gdb-7.7.1/gdb/findvar.c:292: internal-error: value_of_register_lazy: Assertion `frame_id_p (get_frame_id (frame))' failed.\nA problem internal to GDB has been detected,\nfurther debugging may prove unreliable.\n</code></pre>\nThis happens with the 2.0.0 qemu version as well as the 2.8.0 version I got from here\n",

I recommend updating:\n\nQEMU / <pre><code>qemu-static</code></pre>.  The latest version is <pre><code>2.10.1</code></pre>.  QEMU 2.0.0 is over three years old.\n<pre><code>gdb</code></pre> / <pre><code>gdb-multiarch</code></pre> / <pre><code>gdbserver</code></pre>.  The latest version is <pre><code>8.0.1</code></pre>.  GDB 7.7 is over three years old.\n\nFinally, if you do not need to debug multiple threads simultaneously, you can attach to the \"appropriate\" thread by using\n\n<pre><code>set detach-on-fork off</code></pre>\n<pre><code>set follow-fork-mode [parent|child]</code></pre> as appropriate\n",
