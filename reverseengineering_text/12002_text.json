            "content": "Based on http://pastebin.com/qDMP0yz0, you have enough space to make this work.\nThe easiest solution is to patch your target executable such that the data from Virtual Address <pre><code>0x004BAC10</code></pre> through <pre><code>0x004BAC1E</code></pre> is all <pre><code>nop</code></pre>s (<pre><code>0x90</code></pre> bytes), and patch in a <pre><code>retn</code></pre> (<pre><code>0xC3</code></pre> byte) at Virtual Address <pre><code>0x004BAC1F</code></pre>.\nYou'll then be able to detour the function with Microsoft Detours.\nIf patching the EXE isn't an option, let us know and I can look at Detours to suggest what needs to be changed in the Detours library itself.\n",
