I'm looking at the following code at the end of a loop\n<pre><code>0040A3D1   A9 00010181           TEST EAX,81010100\n0040A3D6   74 E8                 JE SHORT JinKu_ke.0040A3C0\n</code></pre>\nI understand how it works TEST AL,AL or TEXT EAX,EAX,but I do not know how it works with numbers Because the JE instruction does not jump when I use 0x810100FE and also even when we use 0x81010102, but when I use 0x60E0FEFC and below JE instruction jump.\n",

            "content": "1. TEST\nAccording to the x86 Instruction Set Reference entry for TEST found at http://x86.renejeschke.de/,\n\n\n[TEST] computes the bit-wise logical AND of first operand (source 1 operand) and the second operand (source 2 operand) and sets the SF, ZF, and PF status flags according to the result. The result is then discarded.\n\nMore succinctly:\n\nAND imm32 with EAX; set SF, ZF, PF according to result.\n\nEven more succinctly:\n\nthe AND instruction without storing the result\n\nSo for\n\n<pre><code>0040A3D1   A9 00010181           TEST EAX,81010100</code></pre>\n\nthe value in <pre><code>EAX</code></pre> and <pre><code>81010100</code></pre> are ANDed together.\nIf the value in <pre><code>EAX</code></pre> is <pre><code>0x810100FE</code></pre>, the operation looks like this:\n<pre><code>EAX:                    10000001000000010000000011111110\n0x81010100:         AND 10000001000000010000000100000000\n                    ------------------------------------\n0x81010000:             10000001000000010000000000000000\n</code></pre>\nThe result, <pre><code>81010000</code></pre>, is not 0, so the zero flag is not set.\nIf the value in <pre><code>EAX</code></pre> is <pre><code>0x60E0FEFC</code></pre> the operation looks like this:\n<pre><code>EAX:                    01100000111000001111111011111100\n0x81010100:         AND 10000001000000010000000100000000\n                    ------------------------------------\n                        00000000000000000000000000000000\n</code></pre>\nHere the result is 0, so the zero flag (ZF) is set to 1.\n2. JE\nAccording to the  x86 Instruction Set Reference entry for JE found at http://x86.renejeschke.de/,\n\n\n[JCC] checks the state of one or more of the status flags in the EFLAGS register (CF, OF, PF, SF, and ZF) and, if the flags are in the specified state (condition), performs a jump to the target instruction specified by the destination operand. A condition code (cc) is associated with each instruction to indicate the condition being tested for. If the condition is not satisfied, the jump is not performed and execution continues with the instruction following the Jcc instruction.\n\nIn the case of 'JE' specifically,\n\nJump short if equal (ZF=1).\n\nFor the operation\n\n<pre><code>0040A3D1   A9 00010181           TEST EAX,81010100</code></pre>\n\n\nif the value in <pre><code>EAX</code></pre> is <pre><code>0x81010102</code></pre>, the zero flag (ZF) does not get set (see above), so flow of control does not branch here.\n\nif the value in <pre><code>EAX</code></pre> is <pre><code>0x60E0FEFC</code></pre>, the zero flag (ZF) is set to 1 (see above). As a result, flow of control branches at this point.\n\n\nSummary\n\n<pre><code>TEST</code></pre> is like <pre><code>AND</code></pre>, but the results of the operation are not saved. Only the PF, SF and ZF flags are set.\nthe zero flag (ZF) is set to 1 if the results of an arithmetic or logical operation (like <pre><code>TEST</code></pre>) are 0.\n<pre><code>JE</code></pre> causes <pre><code>EIP</code></pre> to be updated if ZF = 1.\nif the value in <pre><code>EAX</code></pre> is <pre><code>0x81010102</code></pre>, the zero flag (ZF) does not get set, so flow of control does not branch here.\nif the value in <pre><code>EAX</code></pre> is <pre><code>0x60E0FEFC</code></pre>, the zero flag (ZF) is set to 1. As a result, flow of control branches at this point.\n",
