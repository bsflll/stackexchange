Because basically I am working a assembly code analysis tool, and these instruction sequences annoying the coding much.\n",

            "content": "What's these instruction sequences for? \n\nThey are for code optimization.\nCPU cache\nTo optimize memory accesses, the CPU uses its own (small) internal memory called cache. It usually consists of several levels named L1, L2 etc. A lower suffix number means that the memory is located closer to the CPU core, thus is faster to access, but it's smaller as well. An illustration of this concept taken from link is given below:\n\nAccessing the CPU cache is critically faster than reading RAM memory (see this question for more information) and that's why it is better to have data in cache instead of reading it each time from RAM (or even worse - hard disk).\nBut the CPU doesn't cache only data - it caches instructions as well. And for instructions to be cached effectively, they have to be properly aligned. Following cite comes from here:\n\nMost microprocessors fetch code in aligned 16-byte or 32-byte blocks. If an important subroutine entry or jump label happens to be near the end of a 16-byte block then the microprocessor will only get a few useful bytes of code when fetching that block of code. It may have to fetch the next 16 bytes too before it can decode the first instructions after the label. \nThis can be avoided by aligning important subroutine entries and loop entries by 16. [...] We may align subroutine entries by the cache line size (typically 64 bytes) if the subroutine is part of a critical hot spot and the preceding code is unlikely to be executed in the same context.\n\nSo, it may be the case that under <pre><code>foo1:</code></pre> there is some short loop and compiler decided to align this block to put it in the CPU cache so it is executed faster.\nAs @user45891 already stated in the comment, such an optimization in gcc is turned on with the option <pre><code>-O2</code></pre>, so don't use it when you don't want such optimizations.\nBut why the difference between the two outputs?\nBecause the first result comes from just two first states of compilation performed by gcc (link):\n\nCompilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.\n<pre><code>-S</code></pre>\nStop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.\n\nWhile the second one is \"entirely compiled\" and linked.\n",
