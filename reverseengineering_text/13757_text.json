            "content": "Guntram Blohm seems to be right. But in the spirit of \"give a man a fish and he has food for one day\", magic mime is an easy way to figure out most formats. The <pre><code>file</code></pre> command detects filetypes by their \"magic\" mime, i.e. markers left in the file (like you see <pre><code>%PDF</code></pre> in PDFs and <pre><code>PK</code></pre> in zip files).\n<pre><code>file</code></pre> accepts as argument a filename, like <pre><code>file /tmp/unknown-file</code></pre>. It can also read from STDIN if you use <pre><code>-</code></pre> as the \"file\" argument. This makes it easy to just figure out an encoding you're seeing without having to store the file:\n<pre><code>cat | file -\n</code></pre>\nNow paste the data and end with Ctrl+D (which signals 'end of input'). In your case, the result is this:\n<pre><code>/dev/stdin: uuencoded or xxencoded, ASCII text\n</code></pre>\nFor some formats it can give a lot of information, like for gzip compressed data:\n<pre><code>echo test | gzip | file -\n/dev/stdin: gzip compressed data, last modified: Wed Oct 19 01:36:02 2016, from Unix\n</code></pre>\n",
