            "content": "The main built-in way I see to do this is to use <pre><code>gdbserver --multi</code></pre> without attaching to a process at that time. Then, you connect with <pre><code>target extended-remote</code></pre> in gdb, and then run the <pre><code>attach <pid></code></pre> in gdb.\nYou could also instead use a wrapper on the debugee to not start <pre><code>gdbserver</code></pre> until a connection is made:\n<pre><code>$ socat tcp-l:<port>,reuseaddr,fork exec:\"gdbserver --once --attach <pid>\"\n</code></pre>\nStatically compiled builds of <pre><code>socat</code></pre> can be made by you or often found online.\n",
