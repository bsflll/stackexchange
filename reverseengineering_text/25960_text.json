    "content": "We all know that reversing STL code is no fun. To make it easier, I usually create some of the strucutres so I can reference the created STL structures in another custom structure.\nFor example, msvc - std::string structure:\n<pre><code>00000000 std::string     struc ; (sizeof=0x1C)\n00000000 alloc           dd ?                    ; void *\n00000004 Buffer          db 16 dup(?)            ; string(C)\n00000014 Length          dd ?                    ; int\n00000018 LengthMax       dd ?                    ; int\n0000001C std::string     ends\n</code></pre>\nor std::vector:\n<pre><code>00000000 std::vector     struc ; (sizeof=0x10)\n00000000 alloc           dd ?                    ; void *\n00000004 NumberOfItems   dd ?                    ; int\n00000008 MaxSize         dd ?                    ; int\n0000000C Data            dd ?                    ; \n00000010 std::vector     ends\n</code></pre>\nDoing this and then in decompilation using these structures, makes the code much more readable.\nI sometimes find it difficult figuring out other structures, i.e. <pre><code>std::queue</code></pre>, looking in the implementation I can see its container type is actually a typedef to <pre><code>std::deque</code></pre>, which has the content of <pre><code>std::_Compressed_pair</code></pre>.\nIs there a way to recreate these STL types, with proper naming as I did for vector and string, so I can reference to them in other structures in order to a have cleaner decompilation? What would a <pre><code>std::queue</code></pre> structure look like?\nThanks a lot in advance.\n",

Note that neither <pre><code>std::string</code></pre> nor <pre><code>std::vector</code></pre> have a <pre><code>vTable</code></pre> field -- you should delete them from both structure declarations. Anyway, I have a specific answer to the substance of your question, but I will eventually write a blog entry about it rather than go into it now.\n",

Im planning to install the IDE and compile lots of different templated versions with the same (I'll try to mimic them) compile setting. Then I'll be at the point where I'm not sure what to do next, create a DLL with debug symbols and try to force load them into my idb? (That wont' resolve the functions addresses properly, pretty sure, thus I'm just gonna end up with the useless templated classes definitions). Other option seems to generate the flirt\n",

I should have probably mentioned the compiler version is msvc-9, so the STL structures changed over time of course. On older compilers, i.e. VC6 they didn't even reserve 16 bytes on the stack for the string buffer, it was just a pointer to the buffer. I'm aware that they are template classes, but they help constructing a structure after all, which what makes it difficult on some scenarios to RE, depending on the data structure of course.</span>",
