Find this and you find what's getting passed in.\nKeep in mind the reason the code is using virtual functions is likely to take advantage of inheritance, so there could be multiple classes that get passed to this. If you have RTTI information in the binary you can use this to give you clues â€“ these should include the class name, function names and function signatures.\n",
