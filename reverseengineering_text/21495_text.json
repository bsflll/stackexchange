    "content": "I often have some code like this on the beginning of every function of a decompiled program:\n<pre><code>iVar1 = 0x42;\n  puVar2 = local_10c;\n  while (iVar1 != 0) {\n    iVar1 = iVar1 + -1;\n    *puVar2 = 0xcccccccc;\n    puVar2 = puVar2 + 1;\n  }\n</code></pre>\n0xcccccccc in web search seems related to \"uninitialized memory\" but I don't see the link with this blanket code.\nWhat is it? What purpose does it have?\nWhy is it there as \"template\" for every function?\n",

Imagine that the code accidentally jumps to some random location. If some garbage bytes are there, the behaviour is undefined. \nHowever, in case where such a jump accesses <pre><code>int 3</code></pre> instruction, it will just cause <pre><code>software breakpoint</code></pre> in the debugger thus preventing udefined behaviour from happening and showing you that some strange jump happened and stopping the execution at this point, exectly as in the case you set a breakpoint there.\nNote: Moving <pre><code>0xCCCCCCCC</code></pre> just sets <pre><code>4</code></pre> contiguous bytes to <pre><code>0xCC</code></pre>.\n",

In such case, the compiler generates code which fills all stack variables with the byte 0xCC, so that any uninitialized value is clearly visible during debugging. \nSee also https://stackoverflow.com/a/11865164\n",
