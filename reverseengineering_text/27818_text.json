    "content": "After a lot of time, I found an address in the memory that has the target value but there is something unusual in that address! that address changes every millisecond.\nScreenShot:\n\nI did a hardware breakpoint on that line <pre><code>MOV ecx, [DOSBox.exe+210BF4]</code></pre>.\nWhen the turn comes to that line, this memory address <pre><code>DOSBox.exe+210BF4</code></pre> becomes holder to the target value and then the <pre><code>ECX</code></pre> register takes that value from it.\nI am sure that the target value comes from this address but I don't know how can I get the value from that strange address. Is there a solution?\n",
