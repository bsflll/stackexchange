    "content": "I know it's not a bug, but a feature. Hex Rays found that there's a variable which is set to specific value, thus there's no need to display the branches where the code will never be run, so it warns me about the optimizations:\n<pre><code>conditional instruction was optimized away because of '%var_8.1==0'\n</code></pre>\nIs there any way to make it show all the code branches and stop optimizing it?\n",

See the image bellow:\n\nEither <pre><code>code_compress_magic</code></pre> or <pre><code>Signature</code></pre> must be set as a <pre><code>volatile</code></pre> type. This will make Hexrays decompiler happy.\n",
