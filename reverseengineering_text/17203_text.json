            "content": "Right now it is not possible to label instructions in the disassembly as structure members. It is however possible to define structs and visit them in memory (similar to 010 editor). The main sources of information about this are here and here.\nAs an example if you have the following code:\n<pre><code>#pragma pack(1)\nstruct MyStruct\n{\n    int a;\n    bool b;\n    const char* c;\n};\n\nvoid test(MyStruct* p)\n{\n    MyStruct* s = p;\n    s->a = 0x1234;\n    s->b = true;\n    s->c = \"Hello world\";\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    MyStruct s;\n    test(&s);\n    return s.a;\n}\n</code></pre>\nYou use the <pre><code>Parse header</code></pre> option in the <pre><code>Struct</code></pre> tab to parse the following header:\n<pre><code>struct MyStruct\n{\n    int a;\n    bool b;\n    const char* c;\n};\n</code></pre>\nThis will load the structure (use the command <pre><code>EnumTypes</code></pre> to see a list of types). Now when you're paused at the disassembly of the <pre><code>test</code></pre> function you can use the <pre><code>Visit type</code></pre> option from the <pre><code>Struct</code></pre> tab to show the contents of the memory at <pre><code>ecx</code></pre> in a structural way:\n\nThe addresses of the structure members will also be added as temporary labels so you can see what an instruction refers to in the info box:\n\nThis feature has not been further developed because there was a lack of interest from the community.\n",
