    "content": "I am debugging Challenge 6 from the 2014 FlareOn challenges.\nFor incorrect imput it displays the \"bad\" message.\nRunning <pre><code>/i bad</code></pre> returns <pre><code>0x004f3bf2 hit0_0 \"bad\"</code></pre>.\n<pre><code>ps @ 0x004f3bf2</code></pre> returns <pre><code>bad</code></pre> as expected.\nMy problem is that if I try to find reference to this memory address, <pre><code>axt @ 0x004f3bf2</code></pre>, <pre><code>radare2</code></pre> does not return anything, but the address is surely referenced:\n<pre><code>pd 1 @ 0x43710c\n0x0043710c      bff23b4f00     movl $0x4f3bf2, %edi        ; \"bad\" @ 0x4f3bf2\n</code></pre>\nI have written a simple application containig <pre><code>const char* bad=\"bad\"; printf(\"%s\n\", bad);</code></pre>. In this case using the steps from above <pre><code>radare2</code></pre> correctly identifies the line calling <pre><code>printf</code></pre>.\n",

The reason why (beside the lack of time/interest/contributors of course) is explained in the previous link.\nAlso, please note that the string isn't referenced: during the disassembly, radare2 will detect strings and tell you about them, but this doesn't mean that it will add them to its internal database.\n",

What I do not understand, why I get no result for <code>axt @ 0x004f3bf2</code> in the challenge (www.flare-on.com/files/C6.zip), while doing the same steps in a simple helloworld applocation I get back the instruction which prepares the <code>printf</code>, with other words uses the address where the string is.</span>",
