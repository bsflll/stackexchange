Many of the training's are videos, while others are slide decks and related class materials (scripts, malware samples and so on). The course-ware comes under 3 categories and features the following items (Which I have edited to include the RE related material):\nBeginner:\n\nIntroductory Intel x86: Architecture, Assembly, Applications, & Alliteration \nIntroduction to ARM \nThe Life of Binaries \nMalware Dynamic Analysis\nIntroduction to Trusted Computing\n\nIntermediate:\n\nIntermediate Intel x86: Architecture, Assembly, Applications, & Alliteration \nIntroduction to Software Exploits\nExploits 2: Exploitation in the Windows Environment\n\nAdvanced:\n\nRootkits: What they are, and how to find them \nIntroduction to Reverse Engineering Software \nReverse Engineering Malware\nAdvanced x86: Virtualization with Intel VT-x\n\nDisclosure: I am not associated with OpenSecurityTraining in any way and have only worked through a small portion of their total offerings. Seems like a great resource though.\n",

This answer assumes that you want to learn how to reverse engineer in a software environment.\nUnder this assumption, and assuming you have a base understanding of a programming or scripting language, such as C/C++ or Python respectively, there are many, many topics to begin with to learn how to \"reverse engineer\" in a software environment.  A good first task for a beginner is to obtain a working knowledge of the Assembly Language.  A good resource for this (at least for me) was the Windows Debugging: Practical Foundations book by Dmitry Vostokov.  The book costs $14.\nThe objective of the book is to teach you how to use WinDbg to debug Windows Applications; however, along the way you will get an excellent, hands on introduction to the Assembly Language.\nPlease Note: I am in no way associated with Dmitry; however, I did buy the e-book.\n",
