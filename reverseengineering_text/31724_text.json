    "content": "I have a small spectrometer that measures in the spectral range of 740-1070nm. The device is commercial, and used to send the raw data to the manufacturer's server for decoding, but that does not seem to work any more, so I'm hoping to decode the raw data.\nI have managed to make the device scan and output bytes, which it returns as follows:\n\nsample: 1800 bytes\nsampleDark: 1800 bytes\nsampleGradient: 1656 bytes\n\nThe server used to return 331 floats between 0 and 1 representing the reflectance spectrum. I expect the calculation to be something along the lines of:\nAt this point, I'm unable to decode the bytes to any kind of numeric values that make sense and have 331 values. Below, I'm attaching an example as Base64, with the expected reflectance output (From an old scan). Based on a discussion, it appears that the data is encrypted and compressed. Maybe the metadata can help decode it? How do we test encryption methods and compression in order to extract the image data?\nHere are a number of example scans with the device, along with some metadata: https://github.com/kebasaa/SCIO-read/tree/master/01_rawdata/scan_json\nHere are a some example scans with expected output: https://github.com/kebasaa/SCIO-read/tree/master/01_rawdata/log_extracted\nCan someone help and/or point me in a direction that could help me decode this? Thanks!\nEDIT: Added multiple example scans and some with expected outputs\nEDIT: Made problem description more precise\n",
