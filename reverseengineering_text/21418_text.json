    "content": "I have an encrypted file that I was able to step through the code until that specific DLL file was decrypted in memory and I was able to list all of its strings. It has a ton of them that I would like to export all of them to a text file or even a CSV file if possible but I can't find any way to do so. \nAm I missing a command or a button somewhere or is this something I would need to try and write a script to accomplish?\n",
