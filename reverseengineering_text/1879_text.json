PatchDiff2 is free and fully integrates with the latest version of IDA (6.1) on Windows and Linux. The plugin can perform the following tasks :\n\nDisplay the list of identical functions\nDisplay the list of matched functions\nDisplay the list of unmatched functions (with the CRC)\nDisplay a flow graph for identical and matched functions\n\nThe main purpose of this plugin is to be fast and give accurate results when working on a security patch or a hotfix. Therefore this tool is not made to find similar functions between two different programs. Patchdiff2 supports all processors that IDA can handle and is available in two versions: 32 bit and a 64 bit.\nTo use all you need to do is:\nUnzip the two patch2diff zip and in it will be two folders holding two files for Linux and Windows just copy the patchdiff2.p64 and patchdiff2.plw to your plugins directory located in C:\\Program Files\\IDA Pro Directory\\plugins\\ \n\nOpen your executables you want to be diffed and save them as .idb(default).\nOpen the .idb of the file (I noticed it fails when just diffing an exe) and in the IDA View-A tab go to Edit down to plugins and you should see PatchDiff2 just click on it and choose the secondary .idb you want to compare.\n\nWarning this takes a while and IDA will become unresponsive. In the end you'll have a few tabs, Matched functions, Unmatched Functions, Identical Functions.\n",

It matches functions between two Windows binaries and gives you a list of all equal, modified, removed and added functions, along with a percentage difference value so you can see how heavily modified any two matched functions are.\nThe GUI displays the matched functions via interactive graphs so you can navigate them and see the changes. The two graphs can be synced as you navigate so clicking on an instruction in one graph will select the matched instruction, if any, in the other graph.\n",
