    "content": "So I have a few files from a game on my pc, most of which are <pre><code>.toc</code></pre> files\nI believe this means they are a \"table of contents\" as the ending suggests, but my attempts to read them have been unsuccessful.\nThe contents of the files aren't inherently human-readable, and I haven't been able to really \"read\" them, as I am not very good at this sort of thing.\n<pre><code>weapons.toc</code></pre> - one of the files in the game\nThis game uses a \"developmental\" Frostbite engine, I dunno how that could affect the game itself / its encryption of these files.\nI am curious as to how I could possibly extract data from these files\n",
