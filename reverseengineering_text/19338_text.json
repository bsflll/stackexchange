I write some IDC script for time-consuming work.\nNow, I want to get the execution time of my script, but I can not find appropriate IDC function. Are there anyone to tell me how to write script get execution time?\nThanks in advance.\n",

This might help. In the \"Exec\" bracktes you enter a command in much the same way as typing it on the command line.\nThe following is an idc script file \n\nWriting the date and time with some comment into the file\nC:\\tmp\\mytime.tim. \nReading this file and displying its contents to    Ida's output\nwindow.\n<pre><code>static main()\n{\n    writeTime();\n}\n\nstatic writeTime()\n{\n    Exec (\"echo Date of script run #1234 was %date% >> c:\\\\tmp\\\\mytime.tim\");\n    Exec (\"echo Time of script run #1234 %time% >> c:\\\\tmp\\\\mytime.tim\");\n    print(\"Time written into C:\\\\tmp\\\\mytime.tim\");\n\n    auto h = fopen(\"c:\\\\tmp\\\\mytime.tim\", \"r\");\n    auto date = readstr(h);\n    auto time = readstr(h);\n    if (date != -1 && time != -1)\n    {   \n        Message(\"%s\", date);\n        Message(\"%s\", time);\n    }\n    else\n        Message(\"error\n\");\n    fclose(h);\n}\n</code></pre>\nIda's output window shows the following:\n",
