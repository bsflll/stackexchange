    "content": "I'm having trouble getting GHIDRA to load symbols for a Microsoft EXE from an accompanying DBG file.  Perhaps I'm just overlooking some obvious documentation in which case a focussed link would be much appreciated.\nThings I've tried:\n\nHaving both \"foo.exe\" and \"foo.dbg\" in the same directory and importing \"foo.exe\" and auto-analyzing it with defaults.\nAfter importing \"foo.exe\", using \"Add to Program\" in the CodeBrowser and added \"foo.dbg\" explicitly.  That suceeds with no errors, but I still can't find the symbols in the \"Symbol Tree\".\n\nBackground:\n\nUsing GHIDRA 9.0.4 installed on Fedora-30 (via ZIP file).\nThe EXE is a Delphi-7 EXE built under WinXP (32 bit) with a MAP file and full TD32\ndebug in the EXE itself.  I created the DBG file using map2dbg.  This\nis very old, very crusty stuff.  I'm going to create a separate\nquestion on how to load symbols from a custom file (I've seen\nreferences but sadly cannot find those menu action in my IDE).\n\nIn case this really is a dead end I added a related question.\n",
