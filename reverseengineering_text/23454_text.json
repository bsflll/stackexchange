    "content": "I'm writing an Autohotkey script to toggle <pre><code>Listen to this device</code></pre> for my microphone, without interacting with a GUI.\n\nI thought it would be a simple registry key being modified so I used RegShot to find the key:\n<pre><code>Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\MMDevices\\Audio\\Capture\\{My-Microphone's-UUID}\\Properties\n</code></pre>\nThe key is called <pre><code>{24dbb0fc-9311-4b3d-9cf0-18ff155639d4},1</code></pre> (On all computers).\nAnd the value when toggling the <pre><code>Listen to this device</code></pre> changes like this: (The 0's change to f's)\n<pre><code>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx0000xxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxffffxxxx\n</code></pre>\nBut when I check the GUI, I see that the <pre><code>Listen to this device</code></pre> tick-box has been ticked but I can't actually hear anything from my mic, when I un-tick it, click apply, re-tick it and apply again, I hear my mic. So I thought I might need DllCall or PostMessage here, like what message was sent or what dll was called when I click <pre><code>apply</code></pre> but I couldn't find anything on it on the Internet. I don't know how to make Windows understand that this setting has changed.\nPlease teach me how to reverse engineer this with x64dbg.\n",

Then use a debugger (<pre><code>x64Dbg</code></pre> would work) and set a breakpoint on <pre><code>ntdll.ZwSetValueKey</code></pre> in that proc (before that UI is shown). You may want to make a conditional bp to catch when your registry value is written. It will be in a 2nd parameter as <pre><code>UNICODE_STRING*</code></pre>. 3. Run the proc until bp triggers. 4. After then just walk thru the code with your debugger and see what they are doing there. No guesswork needed.\n",

What I am wondering is whether you are actually interested in achieving that functionality or whether it's important to you how to reverse engineer such stuff?! Given we're on RE.SE I'd assume it's the latter, but I'd like to know as I think that in this case it might be possible to substitute reverse engineering with knowledge about Win32 programming. It would be normal, at least, for that configuration change to be broadcast somehow.\n",

            "content": "AFAIK, knowing what registry keys are used is not always enough, because the registry is just a place to store things like preferences. Setting a registry value may not have any immediate effect on a device. The real source of truth of how a device is configured is the device itself.\nFrom my experience control panels tend to be lightweight GUIs hosted by the OS, and the process that does any real work is the daemon that the GUI talks to over IPC. \nLooking over the recorded API calls in API Monitor we can see that the control panel sends RPC messages to the AudioSrv service. Using <pre><code>sc queryex</code></pre> in Command Prompt, you can find the PID of the svchost (service host) that's hosting the instance of this service.\nFrom there, doing a string search in IDA, we find the string \"ListenTo\" being used by some of the AudioSrv code. It could be a string used for debugging, but that would be my first place to do some static analysis in IDA or set a breakpoint on with my debugger.\nThere are some tools that can help with figuring out which code is run when you perform some action. Ultimap in CheatEngine comes to mind, you can find tutorials for it online. You can also perform tracing of the process in x64dbg and look for any syscalls, which is generally interesting because it indicates that the process is asking the kernel for something (e.g. control a device).\nUltimately, this is probably a lot of work just to get to a hacky solution, so you might explore alternatives e.g. creating a virtual device driver.\n",
