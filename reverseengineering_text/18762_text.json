    "content": "I have a program which uses ODBC to access an accdb database. I can open it in access but it asks for a password.\n\nThe application accesses it through a DSN string. I have found the string using ODBC Data Source Administrator. However, I cant find the password! (even in the registry)\nIs it possible to record the incoming connections to ODBC and snoop the password from the connection attempt? I have tried tracing, but I cant see it in the log.\nAlso would the program access the db using the connection string or does it decrypt the database first of all. I have tried using IDA to pull out the strings/ trace but cant see anything meaningful.\nIs there a password cache location that I'm missing.\n",
