After <pre><code>0x83e4</code></pre>, r2 is loaded up as <pre><code>0x55555556</code></pre>. My doubts are as follows :-\n\nIs this a common way of performing division without the <pre><code>div</code></pre> instruction?\nWhat are the other ways you have encountered in which division is performed without using an instruction that performs division?\n",
