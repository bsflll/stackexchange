Does it implement the x86-64 instruction set?\nThis is only a problem if your machine's Intel processor does not support 64-bit architecture and/or does not does not implement the same instruction set as AMD64 processors.\nHowever, AMD64 processors and most 64-bit Intel processors (other than Itanium-family processors, for example) implement the same instruction set: x86-64. \nIn other words, PE binaries compiled to target the x86-64 instruction set architecture will execute on Windows boxes regardless of whether they utilize an AMD64 processor or a 64-bit Intel processor.\nSee also:\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/1109569/do-intel-and-amd-processor-have-the-same-assembler\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/54296/difference-between-the-i386-download-and-the-amd64\n",
