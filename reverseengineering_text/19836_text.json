It takes more work than I'd like to spend to test to see if the binary has changed as I muck with the compile options. I'm trying to optimize for fewer instructions.\n",

When you are using <pre><code>r2pipe</code></pre> (a python API for radare2), you may execute radare2 commands \"aaa\" and \"aflj\" to get details for every function (including number of instructions). I suppose, these commands are available in radare2 cli, without API calls.\n",
