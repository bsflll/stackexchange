This might allow you to alter the stack and thus alter the flow of the program. \nLeading into a security vulnerability.\n",

Another one is to write a fuzzer and do fault injection, hoping the program will crash after which you try to find a way to use this crash to gain code execution.  Fuzzing however is done so much that it yields way worse results than hand analysis. For training materials have a look at <a href=\"http://www.binary-auditing.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">binary-auditing.com</a></span>",

It gives you the ability to check registers values, asm code, set breakpoints, look up stack, and much more.\n(AFL) American Luzzy Lop - It's a very popular tool used to fuzzing binaries with genetic algorithms, It helps you find bugs and strange behavior which can be used in exploitation. For example when AFL detects that when you send a specific message to the fuzzed app then it will crash. And this information can be used to DoS attack.\nLtrace - linux debugging utility used to display calls to shared libraries (for example libc).\nPtrace - linux debugging system call that allows you to get control the execution of another process and debug it.\nx64dbg - 64 bit debugger with many extensions like scyllahide\nCheat Engine - mostly used in game hacking offer debugging, memory scanning, and code injection.\nWindbg - advanced windows debugger works in user and kernel space\nLldb - high-performance debugger that is part of LLVM project\n\nWhere to learn:\nI learned a lot from LiveOverflow and Gynvael Coldwind videos on YouTube and participants in CTF-s and read write-ups.\nYou can practice at: HackTheBox, Crackmes, CTF-s competitions, applications that allow you to do RE without breaking their ToS/license.\n",
