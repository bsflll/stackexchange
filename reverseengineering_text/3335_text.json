    "content": "Still on my way to understand how to prevent the usage of the <pre><code>-d</code></pre> (decompress) option of UPX (see this question), I try to identify the header file of UPX in ELF executable files.\nLooking at the code, all the sources seems to be in the files <pre><code>lx_elf.h</code></pre> and <pre><code>lx_elf.cpp</code></pre> (stands for Linux Elf). I tried to follow the code but I got lost in it...\nI also did take a look at the beginning of an UPX compressed executable file (amd64), visualized in 8-bytes per line mode for more clarity (and thanks to Corkami ELF-101):\n<pre><code>00000000: 7f45 4c46 0201 0103  .ELF....\n00000008: 0000 0000 0000 0000  ........\n00000010: 0200 3e00 0100 0000  ..>.....\n00000018: 0831 4200 0000 0000  .1B.....

And indeed, when looking at the original ELF header of the executable (before applying <pre><code>upx</code></pre>) we find:\n<pre><code>00000000: 7f45 4c46 0201 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000  .ELF............\n00000010: 0200 3e00 0100 0000 7028 4000 0000 0000  ..>.....p(@.....\n00000020: 4000 0000 0000 0000 e86d 0500 0000 0000  @........m......\n00000030: 0000 0000 4000 3800 0800 4000 1c00 1b00  ....@.8...@.....\n00000040: 0600 0000 0500 0000 4000 0000 0000 0000  ........@.......\n00000050: 4000 4000 0000 0000 4000 4000 0000 0000  @.@.....@.@.....\n00000060: c001 0000 0000 0000 c001 0000 0000 0000  ................\n00000070: 0800 0000 0000 0000 0300 0000 0400 0000  ................\n00000080: 0002 0000 0000 0000 0002 4000 0000 0000  ..........@.....\n</code></pre>\nA few fields have been omitted in the compressed version but the header is mainly preserved. So, lets assume this is just a short version of the original ELF header.\nBut, what I would like to understand are the fields of the first header:\n<pre><code>00000080: 487d 0500 0000 0000  H}......\n00000088: 487d 6500 0000 0000  H}e.....\n00000090: 487d 6500 0000 0000  H}e.....\n00000098: 0000 0000 0000 0000  ........\n000000a0: 0000 0000 0000 0000  ........

If somebody knows about UPX internals any hint would be appreciated.\n",
