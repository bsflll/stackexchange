            "content": "Resources are just a standard structure with defined constants, but in the end, it's just a recursive structure to a buffer, no matter what it contains (here is the standard layout).\nIt can theoretically contain anything - any depth, loops, invalid types, etc... but then standard APIs will not work with them.\nSo, you need to make sure that, if you encrypt or compress resources, they need to be restored (both the resource directory structure, and their content) before any of these APIs is used, which might not be obvious.\nIn particular, some resources will be used by the OS even before the file is executed, such as first icons, manifest and version information - so you probably want to keep these intact.\nA simple way to prevent trivial resource editing would be to run a stream cipher on selected resources, on the final binary (after the linker put them in place and generated the resource entry in the DataDirectory), and to restore these resources on demand or on program initialization.\nIf you're looking for a ready-made solution, many good packers such as PECompact support resource compression, thus preventing external resource editing.\n",

Even if someone patches your signature check, the signature will still be invalid which makes clear that the exe is not the same one you delivered.\nMy other thoughts would be to use an exe packer or to take a checksum on the resources (both were already suggested in @angealbertine answer).\n",

For example, Some editors assume the resource section name must always be <pre><code>.rsrc</code></pre>. Examples:\n\nResource Hacker\n\nInserting a special resource to cause Resource Hacker to go into an infinite loop. Demo here : http://code.google.com/p/ollytlscatch/downloads/detail?name=antiResHacker.exe\nInserting a special <pre><code>RT_STRING</code></pre> resource to cause Resource Hacker to crash.\nIt assumes the size of the <pre><code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER</code></pre> structure is assumed to be <pre><code>sizeof(IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER)</code></pre>, currently <pre><code>0xE0</code></pre> in hex, while it can even be greater. Having the size to be of a greater value causes Resource Hacker to discard the whole PE file.\n\nRestorator\n\nSame as 1c.\nUses the <pre><code>NumberOfRvaAndSizes</code></pre> field, which can easily be forged to be <pre><code>0xFFFFFFFF</code></pre>. This causes Restorator to discard the whole PE file.\nAssumes the resource section name must be <pre><code>.rsrc</code></pre>. Change it anything else. This causes Restorator to discard the whole PE.\nAny resource Section with the <pre><code>Characteristics</code></pre> field set to <pre><code>IMAGE_SCN_CNT_UNINITIALIZED_DATA</code></pre> among other characteristics will be discarded by Restorator. \n\nDemos here : http://pastebin.com/ezsDCaud\n",

The only variation in behaviors was back when the win9x kernel was in use, and it varied from the NT kernel. Microsoft is well aware that linkers of all types generate such differing interpretations of the PE file format, that I'm sure they know not to touch anything. In fact, the PE file format is so surprisingly varied, the only constant is compatibility with Window's code. Of course, test well after making mods like these.</span>",
