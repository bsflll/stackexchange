New user. I am working on a personal computer science project that involves research on loop statements such as the <pre><code>for</code></pre> and <pre><code>while</code></pre> loops in C - these loops can apply to other programming and scripting languages but, to keep things simple I want to focus primarily on C.\n\nIssue\nI would like to know how developers of programming and scripting languages are able to create <pre><code>for</code></pre> and <pre><code>while</code></pre> loops for those same languages. How can I achieve this for experimentation purposes? Do I have to learn assembly? If so, can anyone provide me with guidance?\nApologies if my original question was too vague.\nCheers!\n",

Are you asking about specific scripting languages and their implementation of <pre><code>for</code></pre> and <pre><code>while</code></pre> loops? If so, you'd have to give the language at least some reference to find a sample and an interpreter for said language. Are you asking conceptually how one would implement such a thing? In that case it's not reverse engineering at all. Please edit the details into your question and then vote to Reopen (link right under your question)\n",

            "content": "I'll assume you're slightly familiar with machine code / assembly language. The high-level statement\n<pre><code>while (x >= 0) {\n    print(x);\n    --x;\n}\n/* rest of code */\n</code></pre>\nneeds to be translated down to simple machine code instructions like <pre><code>add</code></pre>, <pre><code>compare</code></pre>, <pre><code>call</code></pre>, and -- specifically for the loop, <pre><code>jump</code></pre> and <pre><code>branch</code></pre> instructions. Every processor has a different instruction repertoire, but similar instructions tend to be present in most modern CPU architectures\nHere is one possible translation of the <pre><code>while</code></pre> loop for the Intel x86 architecture (in 64-bit mode):\n<pre><code>    jmp    loop_test\nloop_body:\n    mov rcx,rsi\n    call print\n    dec rsi\nloop_test:\n    test  rsi,rsi\n    jns loop_body\n; rest of code\n</code></pre>\nThe very first instruction is a <pre><code>jmp</code></pre> instruction that jumps past the loop body directly to <pre><code>loop_test</code></pre>. The reason for doing this has to do with efficiency, and is worth a separate question. Here, we'll content ourselves with knowing that the next instruction will be the one after the label <pre><code>loop_test</code></pre>.\nThe instructions between the labels <pre><code>loop_body</code></pre> and <pre><code>loop_test</code></pre> correspond to the body of the loop. The compiler has decided to put the high-level language variable <pre><code>x</code></pre> in the <pre><code>rsi</code></pre> register. Because calling the procedure <pre><code>print</code></pre> requires its parameter to be in the <pre><code>rcx</code></pre> register, the <pre><code>mov rcx,rsi</code></pre> copies the value of <pre><code>rsi</code></pre> into <pre><code>rcx</code></pre>. Then the procedure <pre><code>print</code></pre> is called. Finally the value in the <pre><code>rsi</code></pre> instruction is decremented by one.\nControl then falls into the <pre><code>loop_test</code></pre> block. Here, the statement <pre><code>test rsi,rsi</code></pre> compares <pre><code>rsi</code></pre> with itself. As a side effect, it happens to set or clear the processor's <pre><code>S</code></pre> flag, which indicates whether the value in <pre><code>rsi</code></pre> was negative or not -- that is, whether the highest order bit 63 was set or not. On the x86 architecture, signed numbers are represented in two's complement, so negative numbers will have their high order bit set.\nIf the high order bit of <pre><code>rsi</code></pre> is not set, then the <pre><code>S</code></pre> flag will be cleared by the <pre><code>test</code></pre> instruction. The next instruction <pre><code>jns</code></pre> jumps back to <pre><code>loop_body</code></pre> if the <pre><code>S</code></pre> flag is not set (hence the <pre><code>jns</code></pre> - \"jump if not signed\" if you want). The <pre><code>jns</code></pre> instruction is a conditional jump; the jump is either taken back to <pre><code>loop_body</code></pre> or it falls through to the code following the loop.\nFor-loops are basically while-loops with extra chrome. With some exceptions, a for-loop\n<pre><code>for (x = 0; x < 42; ++x) {\n    /* loop body */\n}\n</code></pre>\nis transformed into\n<pre><code>x = 0;\nwhile (x < 42) {\n    /* loop body */\n    ++x;\n}\n</code></pre>\nand then the compiler will translate that into something similar to the while-loop above.\n",
