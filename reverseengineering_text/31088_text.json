    "content": "I would love some help on working with this file format.\nI have this archived file from this abandonware game that I like to mess around with, and I have tried all sorts to try and expand it to extract the files from inside (They are .vag audio files).\nI am lost on what to do from now on. I have tried using TrID but no result from it. I have also tried using software like WinRAR, 7-zip etc, which cannot recognise the file.\nI do not think this is a known file extension since I have never seen it anywhere before, and the internet has no idea what it is when I try to search about it.\nI'd also love to ideally create an extraction tool so I can extract content from other file types ending in this .xbd format.\nI will really appreciate any help given, thank you :)\n.xbd file download (OneDrive)\n",

This is the link to the assets [link] (mega.nz/file/â€¦) The xbd file is located in audio. If this still isn't enough info let me know,\n",
