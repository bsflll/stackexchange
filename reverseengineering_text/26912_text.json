    "content": "When trying to compare the difference between two minified javascript files with random identifier names, about 95% of the changes are identifiers being renamed. I would like to use a tool that ignores these renames and just shows actual code addition and deletion.\nSuch a tool would be very useful to easily see what an app has changed in an update.\n",
