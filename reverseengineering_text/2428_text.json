Is the identity, or some of the background, of that person known?\n",

See http://www.home.aone.net.au/~byzantium/found/found4.html\nAs for +ORC himself, there's some more info at http://www.woodmann.com/crackz/Orc.htm\nThe last time I spoke with Fravia+ about +ORC, Fravia+ said that +ORC became obsessed with the pyramids in Egypt and went there to study them. He contracted some kind of illness while there and died rather suddenly. If I remember correctly, Fravia+ learned of +ORC's death through +ORC's son.\n",

But it seems that no one will ever know for sure. Certainly not if +ORC is dead now. Him having a son (which is old enough to contact Fravia+, I guess) means that he's probably older than suggseted in CrackZ's page.</span>",
