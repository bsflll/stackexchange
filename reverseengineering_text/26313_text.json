            "content": "See this answer for details on how branch instructions are encoded on ARM. Here's what you should do:\n\nSet <pre><code>Options->General->Number of opcode bytes</code></pre> to 4 (if it was 0 initially)\nFind any <pre><code>B</code></pre> instruction.\nJust to make sure you understand it, work out the displacement from <pre><code>pc+8</code></pre> at the <pre><code>B</code></pre> instruction to the destination, and verify that the displacement in the instruction matches what you expect.\nCalculate the displacement to the target to which you wish to branch instead.\nUse <pre><code>Edit->Patch program->Change byte</code></pre> to modify the current instruction. IDA will update the display, so you can tell whether you've succeeded or not. If you haven't, keep messing with it until you get the bytes you want.\nTo generate a patch file, you can use <pre><code>File->Produce file->Create .DIF file</code></pre>.\n",
