    "content": "I'm new with reversing and I did the following experiment just intent to help my understanding. I created a very simple 64-bit c++ program.\n<pre><code>#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\n    string s1{ \"test\" };\n    cout << s1 << endl;\n    cout << &s1 << endl;\n\n    cout << \"============\" << endl;\n\n    int i{ 10 };\n    cout << i << endl;\n    cout << &i << endl;\n\n    getchar();\n}\n</code></pre>\nI then compiled it and started it. The output is:\n\nNow I know the addresses of these two variables and I want to check it in x64dbg. In x64dbg, I attached to the running process and it seems it's not the variables at the aforementioned addresses:\n",

As you can see in your picture content of this window (CPU) is automaticly trying to disassemble data in memory as code. If you want to see values it is better to look up adresses in dump window (bottom left) or in stack window (bottom right).\n",
