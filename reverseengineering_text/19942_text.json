    "content": "Hello!\nI'm working on reversing one library (shared object) written for ARM architecture. It's obfuscated or packed with something pretty strong what makes debugging much harder and almost impossible on \"long distance\".\nThere is function which provides encryption with some strange algorithm (at least for me).\nWhat I've researched for now:\n\nSize of input and output is same;\nAlgorithm works with 4 memory regions, which affects on result (tested):\n\n\nSize - 256 bytes. This is SBOX, but with custom values (values are different from AES SBox);\nSize - 256 bytes. This is inverted SBOX;\nSize - 16 bytes. Probably, initialization vector, but I'm not sure;\nSize - 128 bytes. Unknown region.\n\nDecryption function also works with same memory regions.\n\nFor now I know only first operations in data in algorithm:\n\nReverse bits in each byte (<pre><code>0x30 (00110000b) => 0xC (00001100b)</code></pre>);\nReverse bytes (<pre><code>01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 => 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01</code></pre>)\n\nSome additional information:\n\nIf input length < 15 it's just reverse bits and bytes.\nExample (bytes in hex):\n01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 => 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80\nIf input length is 15 it reverse bits in all bytes except 4th. Then reverse bytes.\nExample (bytes in hex): \n01 01 01 02 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 => \n80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 02 80 80 80\nIf input length is 16 it reverse bits and bytes, encrypts data with this \"unknown\" algorithm;\nIf input length is 17-32 it'll reverse bits and bytes in first 16 bytes, encrypts first 16 bytes with this algorithm and just reverse bits and bytes in rest data.\nExample: (bytes in hex, bold bytes contains result of encryption):\n01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 02 03 04 05 => \n50 D4 51 BD 59 42 30 A1 B3 5F 77 BD B3 BF A1 9A A0 20 C0 40 \n\nI have opportunity to launch encryption on any data and change all variables. Also I have opportunity to launch built-in decrypt function.\nMaybe someone know what it can be or can recommend me some additional steps to clarify name of this algorithm.\nP.S. Sorry for my bad English, hope I've described everything clear.\n",

Creating code or pseudo code for the algorithm, etc. Additionally, have you tried collecting magic values from the library and seaching for them online?\n",

In sentence \"For now I know only first operations in data in algorithm\" I've meant that I've started \"tracing\" through code and for now I found next data transformations. I need to implement this algorithm (write external code which will do same encryption). About \"googling\" constants - it's the first what I've done (no results).\n",
