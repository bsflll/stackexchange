    "content": "Is there any way to get the image base of an <pre><code>.exe</code></pre> without calling WinAPI functions (i.e. imported functions) so that it can't be easily viewed in a disassembler/debugger?\nI've been thinking of declaring a global variable anywhere in code and reading its address in a loop backwards until e.g.<pre><code>MZ</code></pre> is found (obviously checking for <pre><code>NULL</code></pre> in the meantime). However, there may be a section which isn't readable, a string in <pre><code>.rdata</code></pre> which contains the <pre><code>MZ</code></pre> characters or some value (especially a function address or generally pointers) that contains the <pre><code>MZ</code></pre> bytes (<pre><code>0x4D</code></pre>, <pre><code>0x5A</code></pre>) (and probably a few more \"situations\").\nHave you any idea how to achieve that? Is it even possible?\n",

            "content": "I can think of a couple of ways of doing that\nScanning memory from EIP\nYou could easily get the <pre><code>EIP</code></pre> of your own code without calling any APIs. There are a few ways to achieve that using inline assembly, but the most common one is to include the following two instructions:\n<pre><code>call $+5\npop eax\n</code></pre>\nThis works because <pre><code>call</code></pre> will push the next address (where <pre><code>pop eax</code></pre> is onto the stack) and then execute the instruction right after it (again, our <pre><code>pop eax</code></pre>). When <pre><code>pop eax</code></pre> is executed, it'll pop the address just pushed by <pre><code>call $+5</code></pre> into a register.\nAfter you got your <pre><code>EIP</code></pre> value you can easily scan backwards as you thought of doing, but this time starting at a position a lot closer to your image base.\nKeeping in mind image bases are aligned to page boundaries, you can scan in <pre><code>PAGE_SIZE</code></pre> (4096 bytes) intervals.\nReading loaded modules from PEB\nThe Process Environment Block (also here) structure is accessible using a designated segment register (<pre><code>fs</code></pre> on 32 bit systems and <pre><code>gs</code></pre> on 64 bit systems) which stores the address of the Thread Information Block from which the PEB is reachable. Although most of the PEB is undocumented, in it is a lot of data relating to the operational aspects of the currently running process.\nOne such piece of information is the <pre><code>ImageBaseAddress</code></pre>, an undocumented (but consistent) field that holds the process's image base. If you're interested in the <pre><code>.exe</code></pre>'s image base (opposed to a loaded DLLs image base), this will do.\nIf you want something more reliable you could use the <pre><code>Ldr</code></pre> member, which points to a <pre><code>PEB_LDR_DATA</code></pre> structure which points to a linked list of <pre><code>LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY</code></pre>s, which lists all loaded modules, their addresses and a lot of other information about each loaded module. Your executable's image base is the <pre><code>DllBase</code></pre> field.\n",
