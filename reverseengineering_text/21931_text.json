    "content": "I've made a custom loader and processor. As I use segment to separate something, now I want my name automatically shows in the following form\n<pre><code>9     dseg_1234      the same as 2, but without data type specifier</code></pre>,\nwhich is described in https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/609.shtml\nThe Java processor and loader can change the name representation to number 9 without any additional settings. However I failed to find any code relating to changing the name representation :(\nSo how does the Java processor change this option?\n",
