    "content": "I have an ASUS RP-AC51. It doesn't broadcast any WiFi network when powered on, the management interface cannot be accessed over Ethernet, and the reset button seemingly does nothing.\nI decided to try and get a shell on the device with UART. I'm following the instructions from this video. Here are photos of my setup.\nI use <pre><code>screen</code></pre> on the Pi to connect to the device:\n<pre><code>pi@desk:~ $ lsusb\nBus 001 Device 004: ID 0b95:772a ASIX Electronics Corp. AX88772A Fast Ethernet\nBus 001 Device 003: ID 1a86:7523 QinHeng Electronics CH340 serial converter\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 1a40:0101 Terminus Technology Inc. Hub\nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\npi@desk:~ $ ls /dev | grep USB\nttyUSB0\npi@desk:~ $ screen /dev/ttyUSB0 300\n</code></pre>\nI tried every single one of the common baud rates listed in the video. I never got any readable text. As an example, here's a snippet of what I get at 115200:\n<pre><code>E�I�L)rNS:9\n            4�\"�*.W PFd���QN'S�Jj\nPS� ��3Z�Y L    rr$j             �HR\n                    -B����Y\":j\n                              0�VH. ��)j\n                                        ath_!�J��+,W+�5��e��)�BHL��*W   \"2J���WHa�5幮e�VVՕ�k�'�,յ�M\"�J l9\n          ��R��p@ ₂����RT� Plk  B��+E |         �6      ��2FJ!U�څ(es�'B�1       �L      ��L   ��1S�1` R�AU1b��J��\n                  j\nPS:��              ARU*R\n</code></pre>\nDoes anyone know what baud rate I should be using? Or am I doing something else wrong?\n(I don't have an oscilloscope.)\n",
