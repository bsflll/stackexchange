    "content": "i am learning to detouring functions, but i run into one that i cannot be resolved.\nI use the Detour lib from microsoft, and a custom method. \nBoth cause the same problem, the function is hooked and returns to the original, but continuing the program crashes with error.\nMy code using Detours lib:\nFunction definition:\n<pre><code>typedef int(__stdcall* itemPos) ( int param_1, float param_2, float param_3, float param_4, float param_5, float param_6, float param_7);\nitemPos originalItemPos;\nint __stdcall hkItemPos(int param_1, float param_2, float param_3, float param_4, float param_5, float param_6, float param_7) {\n    return originalItemPos(param_1, param_2, param_3, param_4, param_5, param_6, param_7);\n}\n</code></pre>\nInitialice detours to hook:\n<pre><code>DetourTransactionBegin();\nDetourUpdateThread(GetCurrentThread());\nDWORD offset = Scanner.FindPattern(\"program.exe\", \"\\x55\\x8B\\xEC\\x83\\xE4\", \"xxxxx\");\noriginalItemPos = (itemPos)offset;\nDetourAttach(&(LPVOID&)originalItemPos, &hkItemPos);\nif (DetourTransactionCommit() != NO_ERROR)\n    printf(\"Detoured error in sub_CCD440\n\");\n</code></pre>\nThe function looks like this in IDA\nThe way it is called\nError image\nI have code to hook the function without using a library, but the error i get is the same, so i guess something is being overlooked.\nIf necessary i will add it.\nThank you very much in advance.\n",

Do you have prints in the hkItemPos() or anything to verify?   Does the offset value make sense for the binary? That looks like a very very common search string I would guess you're hooking something else and when that gets called you crash\n",
