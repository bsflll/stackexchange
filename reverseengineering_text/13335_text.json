    "content": "I am using ProxyDroid to proxy everything to Charles Proxy. But by default Charles proxy (or any other similar programs like Fiddler, mitmproxy, etc..) only capture traffic on common ports such as 80, 8080, 443, 8443.\nIf an app is using a different port then the traffic would not show up in Charles proxy. \nIs there anyway to know which port the app is using? Or any way around the issue?\n",

Then in android wifi options you can configure the proxy settings ip and port:\n\nConnect to WIFI network\nSettings->WIFI\nLong tap on connected network's name\nModify network config-> Show advanced options\nSet proxy settings\n\nAfter that configure Brup proxy options under the proxy tab to stop all requests and responses. After that you don't need to know the port that you app is using, all traffic from you smartphone will be shown in Brup.\nhttps://support.portswigger.net/customer/en/portal/topics/718317-installing-and-configuring-burp/articles\nApart from that Burp have lots of features and plugins for fuzzing and other stuff, I don't know what are you trying to accomplish here but anyway this way should work for you!\n",
