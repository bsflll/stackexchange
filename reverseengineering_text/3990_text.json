Misaligned section pointers are used by some obfuscation utilities in an attempt to break PE analysis tools that fail to deal with them properly. IDA tends to not fall in that category.\n",

Therefore it is possible that some data wont be shown or interpreted properly.  Check out <a href=\"http://www.phreedom.org/research/tinype/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">TinyPE</a> for one example of a file that runs fine (until XP) but ignores the usual PE structure.</span>",
