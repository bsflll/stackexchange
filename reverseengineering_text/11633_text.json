    "content": "Is there a way for plugin to understand that function flags were changed (e.g. through function-edit menu, by setting 'library' or 'static' flag)? There is idb_event::func_noret_changed, but seems it doesn't issued. Nevertheless, I can't find any event which issued when other flags change in SDK. Is it impossible?\n",
