            "content": "I experienced this error when function body contained some embedded data; it is normal for assembler code, but I never saw such technique with high level language, so code packers/obfuscators embed data pieces in code segment as anti-disassembling measure.\nWhen unused random data appears in code, IDA can not detect function borders automatically. \nSo, in such obfuscated code, instead of <pre><code>Create function</code></pre> (or press <pre><code>P</code></pre>) at the function start you can use <pre><code>Set function end</code></pre> (or press <pre><code>E</code></pre>) at function end, and IDA will create function from last \"non-function\" code start to current function. From my experience, this way may work with <pre><code>P</code></pre> at the beginning of obfuscated function doesn't work.\n",
