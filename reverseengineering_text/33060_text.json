    "content": "Say, I have the following x64 assembly code that runs on Windows:\n<pre><code>MOV        EDX ,dword ptr [RSI ]                    ; 2nd param\nTEST       EDX ,EDX\nJZ         lbl_out_1                                ; Skip the call below if 2nd param is 0\n\nMOV        RAX ,qword ptr [RBX ]                    ; Address of vtable in a class\nXOR        R8D ,R8D                                 ; 3rd param (always 0)\nMOV        RCX ,RBX                                 ; 1st param\nMOV        RAX ,qword ptr [RAX  + 0x28 ]            ; address of a virtual function, or a later  JMP rax inside CFG shim\nCALL       qword ptr [->_guard_dispatch_icall ]     ; CFG shim\n\nlbl_out_1:\n</code></pre>\nit invokes a virtual function, but before doing so it passes it through the Control Flow Guard (CFG) shim, or <pre><code>_guard_dispatch_icall</code></pre>.\nThe source code for the code above is invoking a (virtual) function in a class, at index 5 (because of the <pre><code>RAX  + 0x28</code></pre> part), with the class pointer being in <pre><code>RBX</code></pre>.\nI'm trying to make it more readable in the Ghidra's C-decompiler, but it looks like the CFG shim is messing it up. Here's what I did:\nI created a custom <pre><code>Struct</code></pre> in Ghidra, let's call it <pre><code>MyClass</code></pre>, and set up a member at its offset 0x28, as my custom function, let's call it <pre><code>MyFunc</code></pre>.\n<pre><code>MyFunc</code></pre> was defined as such:\n<pre><code>NTSTATUS MyFunc(MyClass * this, DWORD wnf_paraM1, bool bUpdateUI)\n</code></pre>\n\nAnd even though it made the Assembly code above more readable, the call through the CFG shim still wasn't showing the function parameters:\n<pre><code>if ((pVars->paraM1 == 0) ||\n   (lVar9 = (*(pMyClass)->\n              MyFunc)(), -1 < lVar9)) goto LAB_18001be80;\n</code></pre>\nAny idea how to make it work with the CFG shims?\n",
