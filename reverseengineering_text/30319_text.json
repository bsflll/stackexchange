    "content": "I am trying to recreate a segment of assembly back into the C code.  Below is the progress I've made so far, but I'm getting stumped on a specific section.\n<pre><code>00000000000010049 <mysteryFunc>:\n    10049:  f3 0f 1e fa             endbr64 \n    1004d:  55                      push   rbp\n    1004e:  48 89 e5                mov    rbp,rsp\n    10051:  48 89 7d d8             mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x28],rdi     ; This is the function call with a unsigned char ptr as input s\n    \n    10055:  66 c7 45 e8 00 00       mov    WORD PTR [rbp-0x18],0x0      ; Declaring h -- unsigned short h = 0;\n    \n    1005b:  c7 45 ec 00 00 00 00    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x14],0x0     ; Declaring length -- unsigned long length = 0;\n    10062:  48 8b 45 d8             mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x28]     ; Declaring a temp char pointer -- unsigned char *temp = s;\n    10066:  48 89 45 f0             mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x10],rax\n    1006a:  eb 5f                   jmp    100cb <mysteryFunc+0x82>     ; This seems to be a goto call to the end of a do-while loop\n\n    1006c:  48 8b 45 f0             mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x10]     \n    10070:  48 89 45 f8             mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],rax\n\n    10074:  8b 45 ec                mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x14]     ; if(!(length & 1)) {\n    10077:  83 e0 01                and    eax,0x1\n    1007a:  85 c0                   test   eax,eax\n    1007c:  75 22                   jne    100a0 <mysteryFunc+0x57>\n</code></pre>\nI don't know what instructions in C would cause this kind of repositioning.\n<pre><code>1006c:  48 8b 45 f0             mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x10]     ; What's happening here?\n10070:  48 89 45 f8             mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],rax\n</code></pre>\nThe function does some processing of a string and checks for null within a do-while loop.  I get the feeling it's shifting to a next character, but a lot of the ways I can think to do something like that in C don't produce an assembly instruction like that.\nThe function does some things in less than conventional ways, like a goto call to the end of a do-while loop to check if the input string is null, instead of just using a regular while loop.\n",
