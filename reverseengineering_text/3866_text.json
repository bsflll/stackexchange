    "content": "I'm in the IDA View-A within a subroutine. I've identified the subroutine, and now I want to navigate to the subroutine in the functions window so that I can jump around some of the other subroutines in the vicinity rather quickly.\nI know that I can search the functions window with Alt + T, but I was wondering if there was a shortcut to automatically jump to the currently selected subroutine.\nThere are more than 200,000 subroutines in the functions window, so searching is slow.\nIs it possible to navigate directly to the current subroutine, or to navigate directly to a subroutine based on address? If so, how?\n",
