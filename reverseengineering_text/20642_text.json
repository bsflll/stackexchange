    "content": "I work late nights and a dark theme like this would be nice with IDAPro.\nI followed the installation steps and copied the contents of 'plugins' from the github page to the 'plugins' directory in my IDAPro folder in C:/\nThen, I went to <pre><code>options</code></pre> > <pre><code>colors</code></pre> > <pre><code>import</code></pre> and imported the <pre><code>.clr</code></pre> file. But it only changes the color scheme for the disassembly window. Everything else is still the default theme (see image attached). I searched the web looking for if there's something I'm missing but no luck. Seems like I'm doing everything correctly.\nIs there anything I'm missing? How can I get the theme to propagate all over IDAPro 7.0?\n",

You have to build it yourself and you need IDA Python installed.   But you can still use ida consonance on 7.0+ and that portion still works fine.\nFor IDA 7.3 IDASkins is deprecated, 7.3 has built in theme support\n",
