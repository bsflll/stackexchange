    "content": "I was taking a look at the OSX-Crisis sample obtained from this site and trying to analyze it for fun and learning. Choosing to disassemble as a Mac binary causes the start function to be discovered wrongly and hence affect the rest of the disassembly. I was reading the analysis of the malware here, and am curious about how I can go about finding the correct entry point address.\nI believe it can be figured out using the <pre><code>LC_UNIXTHREAD</code></pre> command eip value. In this case, should my approach be to disassemble the file within IDA as a \"binary\"(rather than a mach-o binary), navigate to 0x409c and press \"C\" ?\n",
