    "content": "There are many tutorials which show how to detect injected code into process memory. However, this generally requires using a debugger. \nIs it possible for a process to somehow detect if it has been injected by another process using winapi? If so, how?\nMore specifically, are there any \"fixed/likely\" characteristics of injected code? For instance, from this question it appears that injected code can be characterized by always appearing in pages that have the following protection flags set: PAGE_READWRITE_EXECUTE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY and possibly (but unlikely) PAGE_EXECUTE. Can you point out other characteristics of injected code?\n",

Injected code could be triggered by some patch inside current process.\nMonitor APC creating API (<pre><code>KiUserApcDispatcher</code></pre>) if the target code belongs to current process. OS's APC also could be filtered out.\n\nThere are other ways to inject code, even before the legit process will start to run and place its protections - using combination of <pre><code>WriteProcessMemory</code></pre>/<pre><code>GetThreadContext</code></pre>/<pre><code>SetThreadContext</code></pre> which theoretically could bypass all your implemented protections. When your code and injected one are only running in the same ring (user mode), it all goes down to who is gaining control first. Look for code cave method and think for example when malcode is injected into explorer.exe and you are starting your program :-).\nOf cause, you can load your driver into kernel, which will give you more solid control over the code injection to your process and a good protection, but that of cause depends on the skills and what you are trying to protect.\n",

            "content": "One way that a process can detect the presence of injected threads is by the use of Thread Local Storage.  When a thread is injected, the host's Thread Local Storage callbacks will be called unless the injector takes care to disable that.  If the callbacks are called, then the host can query the start address of the new thread and determine if it is within the host's defined code region (which only the host would know)  See the Thread Local Storage section in my \"Ultimate\" Anti-Debugging Tricks paper (http://pferrie.host22.com/papers/antidebug.pdf) for an example of that.\nWhile this does not detect everything (some malware use cavities within the host's existing code section in order to perform the injection), it will certainly catch some things.\nHowever, the short answer to your question is actually \"no\".  There isn't a way for a process to \"know\" in all cases that something has been injected.  It is \"yes\" for most cases, but not all of them.\n",
