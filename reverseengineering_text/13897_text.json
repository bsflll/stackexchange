    "content": "When I use WinDbg and there's some long operation, I can press CtrlBreak to cancel the current operation (for instance, but not limited to, cancel PDB loading). Or use this:\n\nHowever, whenever I use WinDbg as a backend to IDA, it simply hangs until the current operation has finished. Is there any shortcut for sending a CtrlBreak to the WinDbg backend or I just have to wait for it to complete?\n",
