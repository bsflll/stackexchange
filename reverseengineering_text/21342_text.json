I don't think that the developers built their own file system.\n\nThe firmware file is from <pre><code>http://update.wifiradiofrontier.com/Update.aspx?c=ir-mmi-FS2026-0500-0052&m=1122334455&v=2.6.17.EX53300-2RC3&t=Cust-File&n=2.11.12.EX65933-4RC2&f=/updates/ir-mmi-FS2026-0500-0052.2.11.12.EX65933-4RC2.isu.bin</code></pre>\n<pre><code>binwalk</code></pre> does not detect the filesystem.\nThe file system I mean starts at <pre><code>0x1dc1e6</code></pre>. I already wrote a working parser for that file system, but I'd like to know if that is a known fs type.\n",
