            "content": "It's certainly not a well known format. A quick glance at the file with a hex viewer shows that it mainly consists of records that all have similar, but not identical, size and layout; the very end of the file seems to be something different.\nThe first 2 Bytes - 047E - seem to be the number of records (1150).\nEach of the records seems to start with 7 strings that, in most cases, denote a country, adjective for the country, capital, and team name - i'd guess the save file is from a soccer game or similar.\nFor example, one of the record starts at <pre><code>1B85</code></pre> is <pre><code>07 00 Algeria 07 00 Algeria 07 00 Algeria 07 00 Algeria 08 00 Algerian 07 00 Algiers 0F 00 Stade Olympique</code></pre>. Obviously, these are 2-bytes integers denoting a string length; the fact they are written as <pre><code>07 00</code></pre>, not <pre><code>00 07</code></pre>, tells you the file has a little endian structure, which may help identifying other numbers in the file.\nUnfortunately, the records have different sizes, but if you take the different string lengths into account, they work out nicely. This is a list of the first record positions, their sizes, and the combined length if strings in them:\n<pre><code>pos.  size  strings  size w/o strings\n0002  0597  005b     053C\n0599  0582  0046     053C\n0b1b  0582  0046     053C\n109D  056D  0031     053C\n160A  057B  003F     053C\n1B85  0576  003A     053C\n20FB  0569  002D     053C\n2664  0570  0034     053C\n2BD4  ........\n</code></pre>\nSubtracting 0E for the 7 2-byte length markers results in 0x52E bytes that each record has behind the strings.\nNext, i noticed that many of these bytes seem to be the same in many of the records. So i wrote a small perl program to read the file, and create a histogram to show which byte in which position occurs how often in the records:\n<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl\n\nopen(IN, \"<$ARGV[0]\") or die \"can't open $ARGV[0]: $!\";\nsysread(IN, $buffer, 2);\n$nclubs=unpack(\"v\", $buffer);\n\nfor (my $i=0; $i<$nclubs; $i++) {\n    printf(\"%3d  \", $i);\n    # read strings\n    for (my $j=0; $j<7; $j++) {\n        sysread(IN, $buffer, 2);\n        my $length=unpack(\"v\", $buffer);\n        sysread(IN, $buffer, $length);\n        print \"|$buffer\";\n    }\n    print \"\n\";\n    sysread(IN, $buffer, 0x52E);\n\n    for (my $j=0; $j<0x52E; $j++) {\n        my $byte=ord(substr($buffer, $j, 1));\n        $count[$j][$byte]++;\n    }\n}\n\nfor (my $i=0; $i<0x52E; $i++) {\n    my $flag=0;\n    printf(\"%03x:\", $i) unless $flag;\n    for (my $j=0; $j<256; $j++) {\n        if ($count[$i][$j]>0) {\n            $flag=1;\n            printf \" 0x%02x(%dx)\", $j, $count[$i][$j];\n        }\n    }\n    print \"\n\";\n}\n</code></pre>\nThis results in (small extract):\n<pre><code>314: 0x00(1150x)\n315: 0x00(1150x)\n316: 0x00(1134x) 0x6b(16x)\n317: 0x00(1150x)\n318: 0x00(1134x) 0x2c(16x)\n319: 0x00(1100x) 0x6b(50x)\n31a: 0x00(1150x)\n31b: 0x00(1150x)\n31c: 0x00(1083x) 0x6b(67x)\n31d: 0x00(1150x)\n31e: 0x00(1150x)\n31f: 0x00(1100x) 0x6b(50x)\n320: 0x00(1150x)\n</code></pre>\nwhich means that bytes <pre><code>314</code></pre> and <pre><code>315</code></pre> are always zero, and byte <pre><code>316</code></pre> is <pre><code>0</code></pre> in most cases, but <pre><code>0x6b</code></pre> (107) 16 times, i.e. for 16 teams. Byte <pre><code>31c</code></pre> is <pre><code>0x6b</code></pre> for 67 teams. You could now proceed to compare this to what happens when you load the save file into the game; is there anything that's special for exactly 16, or 67, of these 1150 teams? You could also look for the teams that have these values, and check what's special for these exact teams.\nInvesting a lot of time into this will possibly allow you to identify most bytes without actually decompiling the application. However, i'd expect you can identify only a few of the values this way, and you will need to do what Jason suggested if you really want to understand everything. On the other hand, if the team/capital/country names are the only thing you're interested in, my program will already output them for you.\n",
