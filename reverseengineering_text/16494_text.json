    "content": "I am not sure if I am understanding the raw output of <pre><code>dds esp</code></pre> or its 64-bit counterpart <pre><code>dqs rsp</code></pre> properly. When I see a list of entries in the stack, I tend to assume that wherever I see return addresses, those are calls made by code that have not returned yet. IOW, stringing them together should form a nice call stack. (let's not bother with <pre><code>k*</code></pre> group of Windbg commands for now.) Is that not the case always?\nBecause there are some third party extensions, that operate on the <pre><code>esp/rsp</code></pre> output and strings together the entries into something that appear to look like a call stack but I can't seem to match that order with what I see in the source (well, whatever source I have.) There are even entries of functions that have returned long ago.\nWhat am I missing?\nUPDATE:\nOK -- the third party extension I use does say:\n<pre><code>Dumps (dps) from the stack limit the base only showing items that include the ! followed by +0x</code></pre>\nSo, the question then becomes what is that entry? I thought it was the return address of some function that is fixing to make a call into another function?\n",
