In fact, and only a few people knows about it, it gives access to all the usual libc functions.\nFor example, in your case, you may find interesting to set up a conditional on a breakpoint like that (by using <pre><code>strcmp()</code></pre>):\n<pre><code>break *0xdeadbeef if strcmp(*($eax+8), \"haxxor\") == 0\n</code></pre>\nThis line will stop if you are executing the instruction located at <pre><code>0xdeadbeef</code></pre> and that the value of the string located at <pre><code>$eax+8</code></pre> is <pre><code>\"haxxor\"</code></pre>.\nIf you want to break whenever the value of the string is '\"haxxor\"', then it will be a bit more difficult. Personally, I would set a watchpoint to each character with a condition such as:\n<pre><code>watch *0xdeadbeef if *0xdeadbeef == 'h'\n</code></pre>\nAnd thus, for each character of the string.\n",

This may or may not matter to particular debugging session. Also, this can result in spurious signals like <code>SIGSEGV</code> on *nix/Access Violation on Windows, unless you <code>set unwindonsignal on</code> (e.g. when <code>EAX</code> has bad pointer in your first breakpoint example).</span>",
