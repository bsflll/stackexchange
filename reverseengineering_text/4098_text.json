    "content": "I have a number of shared libraries calling each other (<pre><code>.so</code></pre>, ARM, Android), binary-only.\nI want to add logging to some functions, <pre><code>funcA()</code></pre>, ..., <pre><code>funcZ()</code></pre> defined in <pre><code>libsomething.so</code></pre>.\nThe functions are called from <pre><code>libstuff1.so</code></pre>, ..., <pre><code>libstuffN.so</code></pre>.\nI can rename a function in the original library (keeping the name in the same bucket is a bit tricky, but possible).\nI want to either:\n\nAdd an extra library to the dependency list of the calling library, that is, <pre><code>libstuff1.so</code></pre> originally referenced only <pre><code>libsomething.so</code></pre>, and I want it to reference both <pre><code>libsomething.so</code></pre> and <pre><code>libOneMoreLib.so</code></pre>.\nOr, add an extra function to existing library, e.g. in <pre><code>libsomething.so</code></pre>, I rename <pre><code>funcA()</code></pre> to <pre><code>funbQ()</code></pre> and define (that is, add) <pre><code>funcA()</code></pre> to print logs and call <pre><code>funbQ()</code></pre>.\n\nHow can I do any of these?\n",

            "content": "The required shared libraries are stored as <pre><code>DT_NEEDED</code></pre> entries in the dynamic section of the executable. This entry, in turn, points into the dynamic string table. So, to add another library, you will need to do something like this:\n\nParse the list of program headers and find the <pre><code>PT_DYNAMIC</code></pre> entry\nMap its <pre><code>p_vaddr</code></pre> back to a file offset using the other <pre><code>PT_LOAD</code></pre> entries. (you could use the <pre><code>p_offset</code></pre> field of the <pre><code>PT_DYNAMIC</code></pre> entry itself but it's not guaranteed to be correct.)\nRead and parse the dynamic section entries until you hit <pre><code>DT_NULL</code></pre>.\nRemember address and size of the string table (<pre><code>DT_STRTAB</code></pre>/<pre><code>DT_STRSZ</code></pre>). Note that it is a virtual address and needs to be mapped back to file offset using the <pre><code>PT_LOAD</code></pre> entries.\nExtend the string table with your library's name. You will probably need to find some other place for it since there's unlikely to be enough space at the table's end. If so, you may need to add another <pre><code>PT_LOAD</code></pre> entry to make sure it ends up in the process memory. This will mean shifting all file offsets of other entries. But let's assume you've done it.\nGo through the dynamic section again, and update all entries that point into the string table with the new addresses. Also update <pre><code>DT_STRTAB</code></pre>/<pre><code>DT_STRSZ</code></pre>.\nNow you can finally add a new <pre><code>DT_NEEDED</code></pre> entry for your lib, and another <pre><code>DT_NULL</code></pre> terminator after it. And hope the new <pre><code>DT_NULL</code></pre> did not overwrite anything important :)\n",
