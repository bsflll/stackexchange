    "content": "I decided to start learning Reverse Engineering and picked Ollydbg to start my path. Figured out how to install plugins, but I want to run a script for specific program to help me with the reverse. It seems like I need script loader. Tried installing Ollyscript, but that came up with error for missing .dlls\nMy question is: Can you please recommend any other script loader for Olly and if possible with installation guide for it.\nThanks in advanced.\n",
