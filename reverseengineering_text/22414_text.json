    "content": "I'm currently playing with buffer overflow and ROP-chains, and I'm facing a weird behavior that I don't know how to deal with.\nI don't know why, but i cannot correctly push the address of my first ROP gadget into the stack.\nWith the specific binary that i am trying to exploit, I have to fill a 28 bytes buffer before overwriting the instruction pointer.\nIf I do the following test, everything seems in order:\n<pre><code>gdb-peda$ run < <(python -c 'print(\"A\"*28 + \"BBBB\")')\n[...]\n> Stopped reason: SIGSEGV\n> 0x42424242 in ?? ()\n</code></pre>\nMy first gadget is at the address \"0x0806ee6b\".\nBut when I try the following test, there is a difference between my input and what's pushed on the stack:\n<pre><code>gdb-peda$ run < <(python -c 'print(\"A\"*28 + \"\\x6b\\xee\\x06\\x08\")')\n[...]\n> Stopped reason: SIGSEGV\n> 0x06aec36b in ?? ()\n</code></pre>\nIf I take a look at the stack before the retn instruction that trigger the buffer-overflow, my little-indian formatted address is not the same anymore:\n<pre><code>gdb-peda$ x/50x $esp\n0xffffdaec: 0x06aec36b  0x00000008  0x0804f02b  0x080da000\n</code></pre>\nIf I try to push an arbitrary address, like \"0x08064141\", everything is ok:\n<pre><code>gdb-peda$ run < <(python -c 'print(\"A\"*28 + \"\\x41\\x41\\x06\\x08\")')\n[...]\ngdb-peda$ x/50x $esp\n0xffffdaec: 0x08064141  0x00000000  0x0804f02b  0x080da000\n</code></pre>\nI tried with some twists, to see how it goes, but the result is still the same. The \"\\xee\" is always translated into \"\\xae\\xc3\" when pushed on the stack. And that's the same for some other specific address.\nI really don't get it, I can push the address 0x08065e6b without any issue:\n<pre><code>gdb-peda$ run < <(python -c 'print(\"A\"*28 + \"\\x6b\\x5e\\x06\\x08\")')\n[...]\ngdb-peda$ x/10x $esp\n0xffffdaec: 0x08065e6b  0x00000000  0x0804f02b  0x080da000\n</code></pre>\nBut not the address 0x0806ee6b:\n<pre><code>gdb-peda$ run < <(python -c 'print(\"A\"*28 + \"\\x6b\\xee\\x06\\x08\")')\n[...]\ngdb-peda$ x/10x $esp\n0xffffdaec: 0x06aec36b  0x00000008  0x0804f02b  0x080da000\n</code></pre>\nWhat am I missing here ?\n",

What you should do first is look for bad characters and when youre done, you have an idea of what gadget you can and cannot use. \nIf that is THE only gadget, I would look into alternatives that do the same thing. So pop a random number into eax, add an offset and then eax will have what you want if its some type of call. Something of the like\n",

It's a binary related to a past CTF, but the server are still online for a few time. When I check for bad characters in my local machine, I can generate a precise list (including the \\xee byte). But on the remote server, those bad chars are not an issue, and I can push my previous problematic value \"0x0806ee6b\". The target binary is the same in my local machine and on the remote server.
