    "content": "IDA pro is able to display the data contained in the read only data section of ELF files, but the section is defined as type SHT_PROGBITS. \nTo my knowledge, we cannot parse sections of this type to resolve information such as constant data/variable names.\nSo my question is how do tools such as IDA actually get the information in .rodata or other SHT_PROGBITS sections such as .PLT.\nThanks\n",
