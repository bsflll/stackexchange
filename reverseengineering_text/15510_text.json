            "content": "You can recursively follow dependencies to figure out which DLLs were loaded directly by the Windows loader. You may create an <pre><code>imported modules list</code></pre>. Fill <pre><code>imported module list</code></pre> with every module you find in the main PE's import table. Then recursively parse the import tables of all DLLs you found that way. You'll have a list with all DLLs imported. Then, just compare it to the list of loaded modules.\nDiscrepancies you find might be either injected DLLs or dynamically loaded DLLs.\nIdentifying dynamically loaded DLLs might be a bit more challenging, but one way to identify those is to disassemble the executable and search for calls to <pre><code>LoadLibrary</code></pre>, <pre><code>LoadLibraryEx</code></pre> etc.\n",
