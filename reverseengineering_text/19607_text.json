How can I get the address of the function being called in a situation like this when Ida has inserted a pink comment with funcName?\n<pre><code>mov eax, funcName\n...\ncall eax ; funcName\n</code></pre>\n",

That mechanism works whenever IDA successfully resolves a reference, which may not always be the case (think of <pre><code>call eax</code></pre> where <pre><code>eax</code></pre> is not easily resolved staticly). You should use that interface for all types of calls.\nThe function that best suits your use case is probably <pre><code>idautils.CodeRefsFrom</code></pre> which accepts two parameters <pre><code>ea</code></pre> and <pre><code>flow</code></pre> and returns a generator for all code references from given <pre><code>ea</code></pre>. <pre><code>flow</code></pre> is a boolean used to control whether you wish the next instruction included.\nThere are a bunch of other related functions, such as <pre><code>CodeRefsTo</code></pre>, <pre><code>DataRefsFrom</code></pre>, <pre><code>XrefsTo</code></pre>, etc...\n",
