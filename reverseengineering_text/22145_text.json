    "content": "I am learning about various flag states for the cmp instruction. From reading, the cmp instruction is really just a sub instruction that sets the various flags (OF, CF, ZF) accordingly depending on the result of the sub.\nAs I understand it, there is no pure \"subtraction (sub)\" instruction implementation in x86, rather, the second operand is negated, and then the two numbers are added; i.e. 8-4 becomes 8+(-4).\nIf this is true, then how is subtraction implemented for unsigned numbers? For example, if we are limited to 8 bits and want to subtract 255-254, the 2's compliment representation of 254 is well outside of the range of 8 bits.\n",

The only difference is how you interpret the result. See link and link.\nWhen you subtract two <pre><code>8</code></pre> bit numbers, say <pre><code>a - b</code></pre>, it's like you were adding <pre><code>256 - b = 0b11111111 - b + 1 = NOT(b) + 1</code></pre> to <pre><code>a</code></pre>. In case of <pre><code>a = 255</code></pre>, <pre><code>b = 254</code></pre>, <pre><code>a - b = 255 + NOT(0b11111110) + 1</code></pre>.\nFor any <pre><code>8</code></pre> bit number <pre><code>n</code></pre>: <pre><code>n + NOT(n) + 1 = 0</code></pre>, so <pre><code>NOT(n) + 1</code></pre> is the inverse of <pre><code>n</code></pre> (in additive group) modulo <pre><code>256</code></pre> no matter if you interpret it as signed or unsigned.\n",
