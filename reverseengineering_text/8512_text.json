    "content": "I'm trying understand how some parts of a closed source program distributed as a stripped binary implemented. When I run <pre><code>ldd</code></pre> on the program, it prints only 4-5 most basic C libraries as dynamic dependencies. (e.g. <pre><code>libc</code></pre>, <pre><code>glib</code></pre>, <pre><code>gobject</code></pre> etc.) However, when I run it in gdb or attach gdb to it and run <pre><code>info sharedlibrary</code></pre>, it prints a huge list of libraries. Indeed, that program clearly uses GTK for GUI, for example, but gtk libraries are missing in <pre><code>ldd</code></pre> output and shown in <pre><code>info sharedlibrary</code></pre> output.\nI was wondering does it work and how did they achieve this. Any ideas?\nThanks.\n",
