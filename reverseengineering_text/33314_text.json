    "content": "I'm trying to understand how Ghidra's GDTs are supposed to be used, particularly the case of builtin data types.\nWhen I create a data type library in Data Type Manager (-> Create File Archive) and import function prototypes to it from a binary with debug information—testing with <pre><code>libm.so.6</code></pre>—that library gets copies of the builtin data types like bool, float, int16 etc. in addition to the ones specific to the binary:\n<pre><code>├── BuiltinTypes\n│   ├── double\n│   ├── float\n├── test_library\n│   ├── _CAPTURED_FROM_libm.so.6\n│   │   ├── __acosf: float __stdcall __acosf(float __x)\n│   │   ├── ...\n│   ├── double\n│   ├── float\n</code></pre>\nWhen I use these libraries to import signatures into programs without full debug symbols, the function definitions often end up containing types like float.conflict. I assume this happens because of the multiple copies of float.\nNow, I think I can be fairly sure that all my floats are the same float, which makes me think I would want to make all floats always refer to BuiltinTypes::float.\nHere my first attempt was to right click test_library::float, select Replace... and replace it with the float in BuiltinTypes. Unfortunately, doing that changes the __acosf prototype from\n<pre><code>float __stdcall __acosf(float __x)</code></pre>\nto\n<pre><code>undefined __stdcall __acosf(undefined __x)</code></pre>\n, which obviously defeats the purpose.\nQuestions:\n\nIs the intended way of using this to have duplicates of the standard data types in the GDT libraries?\nIf the answer to (1) is \"yes\", should I just ignore the .conflict renames? Or get rid of them some other way? How?\nIf the answer to (1) is \"no\", how should I get the function prototypes imported so that the types refer to the builtin types?\n",
