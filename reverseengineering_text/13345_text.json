    "content": "I am using a C disassembler and I need to identify compiler-intrinsic functions (i.e. SEH_prolog, SEH_epilog etc.) within my C program.\nRight now, the only way I can do that is to use IDA's FLIRT (Fast Library Identification and Recognition Technology) engine to mark the RVA of these functions and use this database as reference in my program.\nMy question is whether there are any open-source/free equivalents engines that can be embedded inside my C program in order to recognize known-functions using heuristics?\n",
