    "content": "I have created a pintool that outputs in a json file all the basic blocks executed by a program. The problem is that the instrumented program runs slow so I am trying to optimize my pintool.\nI was thinking I could remove the calls to the instrumentation function from a block after it's called once, but i haven't been able to find how to do that. In the official PIN documentation there is only the function <pre><code>PIN_RemoveInstrumentation()</code></pre> which seems to disable all the intrumentation.\nCan anyone tell me how to do that or if it is even possible to do it using PIN?\n",

            "content": "PIN does not provide a direct API to remove a basic block instrumentation call on a particular address.What you could do is keep track of basic blocks which have been executed at least once. \nYou would insert instrumentation calls only for those basic blocks which have not been executed previously. \nHere is a crude example based on the official documentation.\n<pre><code>// The running count of instructions is kept here\n// make it static to help the compiler optimize docount\nstatic UINT64 icount = 0;\n\n// Count the number of instructions in this basic block\nVOID docount(UINT32 c) { icount += c; }\n\nVOID Trace(TRACE trace, VOID *v)\n{    \n    for (BBL bbl = TRACE_BblHead(trace); BBL_Valid(bbl); bbl = BBL_Next(bbl))\n    {   \n        ADDRINT addr = BBL_Address(bbl);\n        if (alreadyVistited(addr) == false) \n        {\n            // Add instrumentation call for this basic block\n            BBL_InsertCall(bbl, IPOINT_ANYWHERE, (AFUNPTR)docount, IARG_UINT32, BBL_NumIns(bbl), IARG_END);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            addToVisitedList(addr);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char * argv[])\n{\n...\nTRACE_AddInstrumentFunction(Trace, 0);\n...\n}\n</code></pre>\nThe overhead of this entirely depends on the complexity of the instrumentation code added. \nIn general to speed things up, you should turn on maximum compiler optimizations. If possible you may also use a better compiler such as the Intel Compiler which is capable of generating extremely fast code.\n\nUPDATE\nIf you use dynamoRIO instead of PIN, you can more easily achieve what you want to do. Here is a sample code which logs all basic blocks executed by the program in the main module.\n<pre><code>#define WINDOWS\n#define X86_32\n#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE\n#include \"dr_api.h\"\n#pragma comment(lib, \"dynamorio.lib\")\n\nstatic file_t logFile;\nstatic LPBYTE mainModStartAddr, mainModEndAddr;\n\n// This is called once for each basic block as it's discovered\nstatic dr_emit_flags_t event_basic_block(void *drcontext, void *tag, instrlist_t *ilist, bool for_trace, bool translating)\n{\n    // The IP of the basoc block\n    LPBYTE addr = dr_fragment_app_pc(tag);\n\n    // Basic Block must be within the main module\n    if (addr >= mainModStartAddr && addr <= mainModEndAddr) \n        dr_fprintf(logFile, \"0x%08X\", addr);\n    return DR_EMIT_DEFAULT;\n}\n\n\nstatic void event_exit()\n{\n    dr_close_file(logFile);\n}\n\n\nDR_EXPORT void dr_init(client_id_t id)\n{\n    module_data_t *data  = dr_get_main_module();\n    mainModStartAddr = data->start;\n    mainModEndAddr = data->end;\n    dr_free_module_data(data);\n\n    logFile = dr_open_file(\"logfile.txt\", DR_FILE_WRITE_OVERWRITE);\n\n    dr_register_bb_event(event_basic_block);    \n    dr_register_exit_event(event_exit);\n}\n</code></pre>\nNote that there is no analysis function needed at all. The instrumentation function <pre><code>event_basic_block</code></pre> will be called once per basic block. It will not be called more than once, as from second time onwards, the code will be executed from the code cache.\nThe difference between dynamoRIO and PIN is that the former directly allows to register a callback for basic block generation. PIN on the other hand allows a callback for trace generation. A trace a collection of basic blocks. Also since not all basic blocks may be executed in a trace, using PIN in this situation is comparatively difficult.\n",
