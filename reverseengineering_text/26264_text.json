If you mean you want to set a breakpoint at a particular address that only fires when <pre><code>eax</code></pre> is <pre><code>1</code></pre>, that's doable.\n\nSet a breakpoint on some instruction with <pre><code>F2</code></pre>.\nRight-click on the instruction and choose <pre><code>Edit breakpoint...</code></pre>.\nWrite <pre><code>EAX == 1</code></pre> in the <pre><code>Condition</code></pre> field on the dialog box.\n\nThe <pre><code>Edit breakpoint</code></pre> dialog is described in great detail in the IDA manual. Search for \"Edit breakpoint\"; there are several pages describing it.\n",
