    "content": "I'm wondering whether it is possible to write a plugin for IDA and/or Hex-Rays which would  use Python callbacks to perform certain tasks.\nIn particular I am wondering if there is an official way to reuse the loaded Python version and IDAPython in light of the Python GIL (global interpreter lock), because obviously attempting anything like that outside of the trodden path could easily to hard-to-debug deadlock situations.\nSo the question is: how would I go about to write a C/C++-based plugin for IDA, which is able to (re)use the Python interpreter used by IDA for IDAPython -- and if possible even tap into IDAPython?\n",

See the <pre><code>%IDADIR%\\python\\examples\\core\\extend_idc.py</code></pre> for the following snippet:\n<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function\n\nimport ida_expr\n\nif ida_expr.add_idc_func(\n        \"pow\",\n        lambda n, e: n ** e,\n        (ida_expr.VT_LONG, ida_expr.VT_LONG)):\n    print(\"The pow() function is now available in IDC\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Failed to register pow() IDC function\")\n</code></pre>\nNext, your C/C++ plugin code can invoke IDC functions.

Thanks, this sounds like it could be doable. Not quite what I had in mind, but it may get me closer.</span>",

There's a variety of ways to think about and approach your question; this is just one of them. I have a feeling that <code>expr.hpp</code> probably holds a more direct solution to your problem; you can probably run an IDAPython script directly somehow, but I couldn't tell you exactly how.</span>",
