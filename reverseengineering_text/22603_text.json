    "content": "I was practicing some reverse engineering crack-mes as part of our university curriculum, and I have a question around the arrangement of variables on the stack. \nI have a very basic C++ code, like so:\n<pre><code>void foo(int x){\n    int a=0;\n    int b=x;\n    int c=3;\n    int z=a+b+c;\n    return;\n}\n\nint main(){\n     foo(5);\n     return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\nI compile the program, like so:\n<pre><code>g++ program.cpp -o program -ggdb \n</code></pre>\nI run gdb with \n<pre><code>gdb -q program\n</code></pre>\nAnd inside gdb\n<pre><code>set disassembly-flavor intel\ndisass foo\n</code></pre>\nI expect the stack frame layout of <pre><code>foo</code></pre> to have the variable <pre><code>a</code></pre> on top of <pre><code>b</code></pre>, followed by <pre><code>c</code></pre> and then <pre><code>z</code></pre>. But that does not seem to be the case. \nI have stumbled across this answer in which the explanation shows a similar layout of how variables are arranged. I'd expect that <pre><code>x</code></pre> would be at the highest address in the frame, right below <pre><code>ebp</code></pre>. But the answer clearly shows <pre><code>z</code></pre> being the closest to <pre><code>ebp</code></pre>, given that it is at <pre><code>ebp - 4</code></pre> but <pre><code>x</code></pre> is at <pre><code>ebp - 12</code></pre>, which seems counter intuitive to me.\nI have read a bunch of books, and have seen a couple of online videos on buffer overflows where it is said that the first variable the compiler encounters is the first to be placed on the stack; and order of variable declaration can effect what variables are overwritten in case there is a buffer next to them that's overflown. Is this still a valid statement to make?\nWhy do I see variables arranged in such an order? Kindly help me out, I'm not sure if my facts are outdated or am I missing something fundamental.\nPS: I am using Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop, with the latest version of GCC/G++\nEdit 1: Adding disassembly of function <pre><code>foo</code></pre>\n<pre><code>ubuntu@Ubuntu:~$ gdb -q program \nReading symbols from program... \n(gdb) set disassembly intel \n(gdb) disass foo \nDump of assembler code for function foo(int): \n    0x0000000000001125 <+0>:    push rbp    \n    0x0000000000001126 <+1>:    mov rbp,rsp \n    0x0000000000001129 <+4>:    mov DWORD PTR [rbp-0x14],edi \n    0x000000000000112c <+7>:    mov DWORD PTR [rbp-0x10],0x0 \n    0x0000000000001133 <+14>:   mov eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x14]\n    0x0000000000001136 <+17>:   mov DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc],eax\n    0x0000000000001139 <+20>:   mov DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x3\n    0x0000000000001140 <+27>:   mov edx,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x10]\n    0x0000000000001143 <+30>:   mov eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc]\n    0x0000000000001146 <+33>:   add edx,eax \n    0x0000000000001148 <+35>:   mov eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]\n    0x000000000000114b <+38>:   add eax,edx \n    0x000000000000114d <+40>:   mov DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],eax  \n    0x0000000000001150 <+43>:   nop \n    0x0000000000001151 <+44>:   pop rbp \n    0x0000000000001152 <+45>:   ret \nEnd of assembler dump. \n(gdb) b *foo+43 \nBreakpoint 1 at 0x1150: file program.cpp, line 6. \n(gdb) r Starting program: /home/ubuntu/program Breakpoint 1, foo (x=5) at program.cpp:6 \n6    return; \n(gdb) p &a \n$1 = (int *) 0x7fffffffdfb0 \n(gdb) p $rbp-0x10 \n$2 = (void *) 0x7fffffffdfb0 \n\n(gdb) p &b \n$3 = (int *) 0x7fffffffdfb4 \n(gdb) p $rbp-0xc \n$4 = (void *) 0x7fffffffdfb4 \n\n(gdb) p &c \n$5 = (int *) 0x7fffffffdfb8 \n(gdb) p $rbp-0x8 \n$6 = (void *) 0x7fffffffdfb8 \n\n(gdb) p &z \n$7 = (int *) 0x7fffffffdfbc \n(gdb) p $rbp-0x4 \n$8 = (void *) 0x7fffffffdfbc \n(gdb)\n</code></pre>\n",
