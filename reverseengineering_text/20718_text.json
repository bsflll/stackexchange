My best guess is that it's some kind of primitive pseudo-random number generator.  Can anyone confirm this or if not, tell me what it's actually meant to do?\nEDIT:\nI've tried dry-running the code, and as far as I can tell, the following is the end result of the registers (can anyone confirm I've got this right and tell me what useful mathematical function it might be doing?):\n<pre><code>ax: ( ax * bx )\nbx: bx\ncx: cx\ndx: ax + ( (bx * dx) + (ax * cx) )\n</code></pre>\n",

The reason is that multiplying the upper parts overflows 32 bit so the first multiplicant is dropped in the above code silently.\nThat leaves us\n<pre><code>(dx:ax * cx:bx) = (dx << 16)*bx + ax*(cx << 16) + ax*bx\n</code></pre>\nNow if you think about bitshifts and multiplications in this case every case, as a bitshift is nothing more than a multiplication by powers of 2, they commute meaning this is equivalent to:\n<pre><code>(dx:ax * cx:bx) = (dx*bx << 16) + (ax*cx << 16) + ax*bx\n</code></pre>\nand then we can split it back into 16 bit easily:\n<pre><code>dx = dx*bx + ax*cx\nax = ax*bx\n</code></pre>\nand there you have it, the result of the multiplication of two 32 bit numbers given as 16 bit words.\nAnd this seems to match what the code is doing (safe for bx cx swapped possibly, you may want to have a closer look on that), so it just seems to multiply numbers.\nEdit: Armed with that knowledge and the response to your previous question by Igor I found this source code:\nhttps://github.com/gandrewstone/GameMaker/blob/master/tools/BORLANDC/CRTL/CLIB/F_LXMUL.ASM\nwhich confirms the finding.\n",
