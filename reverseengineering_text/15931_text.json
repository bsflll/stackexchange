    "content": "This might be a bit difficult to follow without context, but the gist of it is the following; I'm trying to reverse a certain application, and part of what I\"m attempting to reverse in the app generates 3 unique colors based on a string passed via API requests. I know that I've successfully reversed the API properly as the other data I receive works perfectly and I've built out a clone of the client that properly interacts with the API. What I'm stuck on is three color codes that are generated every day, based on a specific key passed by the API.\nToday, 7/26/17, the color codes are <pre><code>[#c698c8, #72555f, #2f1021]</code></pre>, created from the string that the API passed - <pre><code>87gs4</code></pre>. \nI've disassembled the Java code and traced the generation of these colors to the following set of functions. I've verified that it is indeed the string I grabbed from the API responsible for generating these. The <pre><code>SALT</code></pre> mentioned in the functions is generated from a datetime formatted as <pre><code>yyyyMd</code></pre> - in the case of today's colors, the salt is <pre><code>20170727</code></pre>, or as the HMAC signature function generates it, <pre><code>20170727</code></pre> is the input with <pre><code>87gs4</code></pre> as the key.\nThe resulting signature is then taken (64 hex characters), and only the first 18 are saved, then split up into 3 to form the color codes. Therefore, I know the signature I'm looking for (for today) begins with <pre><code>c698c872555f2f1021</code></pre> - but for some reason, my results do not achieve this. I've checked to make sure I\"m using the right key/input order (even reversed it just in case), and I'm getitng <pre><code>9a0ca25fff8eeccdbaf741436ddacf364f517adcb28299f0544c72a67dca2089</code></pre> or <pre><code>30c21ae7995415220e427588e451cbdd58d84785bcd58f8e3f0db2ca0fc104c4</code></pre>. I've also checked lettercase to no avail.\nI don't have tomorrow's colors, but I have the data from the API and know the salt - tomorrow it will be <pre><code>20170728</code></pre> and <pre><code>kRG86</code></pre>.\nI have verified that there's no external manipulation via <pre><code>getColorBand()</code></pre> or <pre><code>getSalt()</code></pre> before the values are passed to create the signature, and I've even had another pair of eyes take a look at this - someone who is fairly experienced with this kind of stuff - he thinks that maybe we're missing something in the byte to hex (and vice versa) conversation that is causing incorrect results, but that we're on the right track and that an HMAC-SHA256 hash generator using the yyyyMd salt and the data I received is correct in that it should be generating the right data.\nCode for the actual string manipulation and generation:\n<pre><code>        String color = this.hexFortmat.substring(0, 6);\n        ImageView colorBand1 = ((ImageView) DecompiledFile.this.findViewById(R.id.image_view1));\n        ImageView colorBand2 = ((ImageView) DecompiledFile.this.findViewById(R.id.image_view2));\n        ImageView colorBand3 = ((ImageView) DecompiledFile.this.findViewById(R.id.image_view3));\n        String hexFortmat = DecompiledFile.bin2hex(this.mdbytes);\n        byte[] mdbytes = DecompiledFile.generateHmacSHA256Signature(DecompiledFile.this.getSalt(), DecompiledFile.this.getColorBand());\n        boolean performAllTimerFunctions = true;\n        TextView specialInstruction = ((TextView) DecompiledFile.this.findViewById(R.id.textView9));\n        boolean visibleColorBand = false;\n        boolean visibleSpecialInstruction = false;\n</code></pre>\nRelevant signature code:\n<pre><code>public static byte[] generateHmacSHA256Signature(String data, String key) throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException {\n    try {\n        SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(key.getBytes(StringEncodings.UTF8), HMAC_SHA_256);\n        Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(HMAC_SHA_256);\n        mac.init(secretKey);\n        return mac.doFinal(data.getBytes(StringEncodings.UTF8));\n    } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {\n        throw new GeneralSecurityException(e);\n    }\n}\n\nstatic String bin2hex(byte[] data) {\n    return String.format(\"%0\" + (data.length * 2) + \"X\", new Object[]{new BigInteger(1, data)});\n}\n</code></pre>\n",
