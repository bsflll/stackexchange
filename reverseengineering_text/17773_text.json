    "content": "There seems to be a (relatively) easy way to remove the markings on a chip via laser. When reverse engineering a device with such a chip, what would be some methods of identifying it.\nIt seems that package type and number of pins can help, are there any other methods that can be used?\nIs it possible to image the chip in some way that would reveal what was erased?\n",
