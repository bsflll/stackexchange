    "content": "Im trying to recognise where is my targeted function <pre><code>int64 __fastcall sub_1400CE4F0(__int64 a1, const char *a2)</code></pre>executed. When stepping through this function, after <pre><code>return</code></pre> it's redirecting me here:\n<pre><code>if ( *(_QWORD *)(v9 + v8 + 8) || *(_QWORD *)(v9 + v8 + 16) )\n  (*(void (__fastcall **)(_QWORD, __int64))(v9 + v8 + 16))(*(_QWORD *)(v9 + v8 + 8), v4);\nif ( v5 == 0xFFFFFFF ) //Here..\n  v5 = *((_DWORD *)v2 + 9);\n</code></pre>\n\nWhere is this function executed? Am I in the right place?\nIs it hidden in those cast's? How can I understand them? (Maybe it's hidden in those casts?)\n",
