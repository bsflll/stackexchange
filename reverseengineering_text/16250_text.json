    "content": "I have the following shellcode:\n<pre><code>xor  eax, eax   ; eax = 0\npush eax        ; 0 (end of the string)\npush 0x68732f2f ; //sh\npush 0x6e69622f ; /bin\nmov  ebx, esp   ; ebx = &(/bin//sh)\nxor  ecx, ecx   ; ecx = 0\nmov  al, 0xb    ; execve\nint  0x80\n</code></pre>\nWhich, converted into hex is used in the following C program:\n<pre><code>const char shellcode[] =\n     \"\\x31\\xc0\\x50\\x68\\x2f\\x2f\\x73\\x68\\x68\\x2f\\x62\\x69\\x6e\\x89\\xe3\\x31\\xc9\\xb0\\x0b\\xcd\\x80\";\n\nint main(){\n    (*(void(*)()) shellcode)();\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\nThis works just fine, but when I step through the payload with <pre><code>gdb</code></pre> I see an extra instruction added to the shellcode:\n<pre><code>$ gdb shellcode\n(gdb) disass main\nDump of assembler code for function main:\n   0x080483ed <+0>:     push   %ebp\n   0x080483ee <+1>:     mov    %esp,%ebp\n   0x080483f0 <+3>:     and    $0xfffffff0,%esp\n   0x080483f3 <+6>:     mov    $0x80484a0,%eax\n   0x080483f8 <+11>:    call   *%eax\n   0x080483fa <+13>:    mov    $0x0,%eax\n   0x080483ff <+18>:    leave\n   0x08048400 <+19>:    ret\nEnd of assembler dump.\n(gdb)  x/14i 0x80484a0\n   0x80484a0 <shellcode>:       xor    %eax,%eax\n   0x80484a2 <shellcode+2>:     push   %eax\n   0x80484a3 <shellcode+3>:     push   $0x68732f2f\n   0x80484a8 <shellcode+8>:     push   $0x6e69622f\n   0x80484ad <shellcode+13>:    mov    %esp,%ebx\n   0x80484af <shellcode+15>:    xor    %ecx,%ecx\n   0x80484b1 <shellcode+17>:    mov    $0xb,%al\n   0x80484b3 <shellcode+19>:    int    $0x80\n   0x80484b7 <shellcode+21>:    add    %al,(%ecx)\n   ... (gibberish)\n</code></pre>\nYou can see the <pre><code>shellcode+23</code></pre> is an extra line, added to the shellcode.\nWhile searching for an answer here I discovered that it was making the shellcode to crash, and I had to clear the <pre><code>ecx</code></pre> register before calling the interrupt.\nDo you know what is this extra command?\n",

Since you asked to disassemble more than there actually are, it disassembled whatever bytes happened to be present after the variable (likely zero padding but maybe also other parts of the executable).\nSo no instructions were \"added\", you're just disassembling some junk that happens to be in the memory after it.\n",

The thing is that when you ask <pre><code>gdb</code></pre> to disassemble 14 instructions, it disassembles 14 instructions interpreting the content of the memory as if it was instructions.\nAs a proof of what I say, here is a disassembly of the instruction <pre><code>add %al,(%ecx)</code></pre>:\n<pre><code>$ rasm2 -a x86 -C 'add %al,(%ecx)'\n\"\\xc0\\x00\"\n</code></pre>\nWhich is, in fact, <pre><code>\"\\x00\\xc0\"</code></pre> (because of the endianness) and where the first <pre><code>\"\\x00\"</code></pre> is, in fact, the final character of the shellcode string.\nThe following characters are very likely the code of the <pre><code>main</code></pre> function or whatever is in the memory at this place.\nAnyway, reread more carefully the answer of Igor (he's right!).\n",
