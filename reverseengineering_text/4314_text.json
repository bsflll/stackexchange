    "content": "I see that the virtual method table (VMT, a.k.a.

It is reasonable to suggest that sometimes it may be not 0, as it happened in the dump above, but what is it then? See here.\n\nthere is typeinfo. What does it allow to do? See here.\n\nthere are two destructors, <pre><code>_ZN13QSystemLocaleD2Ev</code></pre> and <pre><code>_ZN13QSystemLocaleD0Ev</code></pre>. See why.\nand, finally:\n\ncan I be sure that VMT is not initialized/modified at run-time? If it is written to, what gets written?\n\n\nThe <pre><code>typeinfo</code></pre> is:\n<pre><code>             EXPORT _ZTI13QSystemLocale\n             EXPORT typeinfo for QSystemLocale\n\n _ZTI13QSystemLocale DCD _ZTVN10__cxxabiv117__class_type_infoE+8, _ZTS13QSystemLocale\n typeinfo for QSystemLocale DCD vtable for __cxxabiv1::__class_type_info+8, typeinfo name for QSystemLocale\n</code></pre>\n",

            "content": "Why do you think these values are \"odd\"? Odd in the sense of \"strange\", or \"not divisible by 2\"?\nThe values in the vmt are pointers to the functions (or methods, thus vmt vs. vft) of the class object. These seem quite ok, because the vmt's address <pre><code>0x611f77f8</code></pre> is slightly above the methods <pre><code>60986309</code></pre>, <pre><code>60986325</code></pre>. As the compiler compiles all class methods first, then creates the vmt, a vmt at a memory address a bit higher than the methods seems quite normal.\nNow, instructions on an ARM are 4-byte-aligned, and in THUMB mode, they're 2-byte-aligned, but the addresses your function pointers point to aren't. This is because, when executing an indirect branch, the ARM processor uses the lowest bit to switch between THUMB and ARM mode. So, an address of <pre><code>0x60986309</code></pre> actually means \"switch the processor to THUMB mode, then begin executing at <pre><code>0x60986308</code></pre>. When calling one of the vmt functions, the compiler generates an instruction to put the vmt reference into a register, then does a <pre><code>BLX</code></pre> on that register, so the lowest bit will have its meaning to switch the instruction type.\nFrom this ARM reference:\n<pre><code>Rm is a register containing an address to branch to.\n....\nThe BX and BLX instructions can change the processor state from ARM to Thumb, or from Thumb to ARM.\nBLX label always changes the state.\nBX Rm and BLX Rm derive the target state from bit[0] of Rm:\n    if bit[0] of Rm is 0, the processor changes to, or remains in, ARM state\n    if bit[0] of Rm is 1, the processor changes to, or remains in, Thumb state.\n</code></pre>\n",
