How can I best find the secret using tools on Linux or MacOS?\n",

            "content": "Self-contained executable are usually an executable part and attached inside the executable the DotNet assembly dll files. Decompiling using Ghidra/Radare first will get you into the executable part which is not application-specific, but the DotNet runtime.\nTherefore I recommend using a DotNet decompiler like ILSpy. It is capable of loading the assembly DLL files included in the executable and decompile e.g. the Main method of the DotNet application (see assembly <pre><code>dotnetproject</code></pre>).\nUnfortunately ILSpy is a Windows program and not available for MacOS. Homebrew has an ilspy cask, but that only installs an old  Avalonia, an old and discontinued port of ILSpy. I am not sure if that port is already able to open and decompile the packed DotNet executable.\n",
