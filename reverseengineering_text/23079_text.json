    "content": "i have been trying to use IDA to make a breakpoints on a 4 byte memory address \nto find out what arm op code writes to it . yet it fails to set a breakpoint and gives me this message \" Xscale support only 1 byte length hardware breakpoints\"\nam using it on rooted mobile Samsung galaxy S6 , Armv8 \nserver connection is fine i can live edit values and functions also set a break point on functions ( 1 byte op code ) it works fine  .\nso i guess that either am doing something wrong or debugger is limited . \nplease note that am new to arm debugging o just want to find the op code that writes to this address for an android game . \nthank you much appreciated .\n",
