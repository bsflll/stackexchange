This is because one of these DLLs (<pre><code>ole32.dll</code></pre>) exports functions that are forwarded to the other DLL (<pre><code>combase.dll</code></pre>).\nImport REConstructor needs all adjacent thunks (without a <pre><code>0x00000000</code></pre> in between them) to be from the same DLL, so to fix this problem, you'll need to double-click on each of those <pre><code>combase.dll</code></pre> thunks and specify the forwarding function from <pre><code>ole32.dll</code></pre>.\nFor example, double-click on the <pre><code>combase.dll!CLSIDFromString</code></pre> entry and tell Import REConstructor that its Import Table entry should actually be <pre><code>ole32.dll!CLSIDFromString</code></pre>, then double-click on the <pre><code>combase.dll!CLSIDFromProgID</code></pre> entry and tell Import REConstructor that its Import Table entry should actually be <pre><code>ole32.dll!CLSIDFromProgID</code></pre>, then the same for <pre><code>CoTaskMemFree</code></pre>, <pre><code>CreateStreamOnHGlobal</code></pre>, etc. Note that you'll need to do this for all <pre><code>combase.dll</code></pre> thunks in this block, not just the ones that are currently highlighted as invalid.\n",
