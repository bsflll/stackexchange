    "content": "I tried to analyze a program in assembly using ollydbg. In the first line I have the following:\n<pre><code>MOV EAX, DWORD PTR FS:[0]\n</code></pre>\nIn the register window, I've got the information:\n\nEAX 7570EE0A kernel32.BaseThreadInitThunk\n\nand in another window about FS the following:\n\nFS:[00000000]=[7FFDF000]=0012FFC4\n\nSo, my questions would be:\n\nWhat is the difference between <pre><code>DWORD PTR FS</code></pre> and <pre><code>DWORD PTR DS</code></pre>? Normally, I always see <pre><code>DWORD PTR DS</code></pre> and not <pre><code>DWORD PTR FS</code></pre>.\n\nWhat is <pre><code>kernel32.BaseThreadInitThunk</code></pre>? It is a function?\n\n\nI hope that someone can help me.\n",

            "content": "Segment registers were historically used to allow 16-bit code to address more than 16 bits (64KB) of address space. Code could be pointed to with the CS segment, data with DS, etc. FS was an \"extra\" segment that could be used however necessary. You can read more about segmentation on wikipedia. Modern architectures don't use segment registers, with the exception of FS and GS.\n",
