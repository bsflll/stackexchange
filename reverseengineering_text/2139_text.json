    "content": "I have a binary with lots of indirect calls (<pre><code>call dword ptr [register + offset ]</code></pre>) the register is calculated with a simple math which I manage to statically calculate on my own (the call itself lead to some winapi calculated from the current offset)\nwhenever I try to use <pre><code>AddCodeRefs (ins, winapi, XREF_USER | fl_CN/f)</code></pre> to this data my graph turns out wrong and all the basic blocks become one instruction per basic block; when I try to do the reverse, IDA (logically :/) thinks that the data is really code and reinterprets all of the section to be garbage code.\nMy question is - Is it possible to create data xrefs from code manually ? <pre><code>AddCodeRefs</code></pre> seem to spoil the graph and I couldn't find any <pre><code>AddDataRefs</code></pre>, I'm using IDA 6.4.\n",
