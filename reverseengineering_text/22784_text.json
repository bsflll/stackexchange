    "content": "I'm trying to bypass (crack) a very old software that require license in order to unlock all the features\ni was digging in the lines with a little bit of knowledge in assembly\nand i found the line where it compare the hash of the request code with the hash of the license i entered\nthis is the line ( not %100 sure )\n\narrow1 where the random request code generated and the entered license saved to a param (not sure)\narrow2 where the compare happen ( same not sure)\nThe software compare a hash with the hash of the key code you entered, if it's the same, it will work\na random license request code generated everytime you run the .exe\nusing GenerateRandomNumber\n\nand hashed by using HkdfHashAlgorithm\n\nmy question is\nwhen i change <pre><code>je 0x7C1AEF1F</code></pre> to <pre><code>jne 0x7C1AEF1F</code></pre>\n\nthe software stopped working and when i execute it i got the command prompt for 1second and disappear\n\nso what i need to change in order to compare the hash of the request code with the same hash or to say if not equal so activated...\nAppreciate any help\n",
