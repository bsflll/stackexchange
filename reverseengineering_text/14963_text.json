    "content": "I have a small exe program that runs in a system32/cmd window, and when it is finished  running its small script it prompts the user to press enter to close.\n I want to simply have the application close once the process is finished wihtout having to enter a keystroke.  How can I edit .exe file to do this?\nIs there some line in HEX i can edit? What am I looking for?\n",

In the end, it will return.\nBasically you can try to alter branch conditions through binary patching or you could try to do a hard binary patch. In the later case, you can just try to patch a return-statement instead of the input-waiting-function or insert a jump.\n\nNOP-ing out the highlighted call did the trick.\nedit\nSpecial regards to w s for in-chat guidance!\n",
