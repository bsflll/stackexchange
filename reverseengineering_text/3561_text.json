    "content": "I have been unable to get IDA pro to do a simple disassembly of a flat 16-bit binary (bootloader) file. I'm just getting started, and it seems to be harder than it should be.\nThere's a simple set of instructions, that do\n<pre><code>seg000:7C5D                 push    7C0h\nseg000:7C60                 pop     ds\nseg000:7C61                 assume ds:nothing\nseg000:7C61                 push    ds\nseg000:7C62                 push    (offset unk_7C66 - offset loc_7C00)\nseg000:7C65                 retf\nseg000:7C65 ; --------------------------------------------------------------------------\nseg000:7C66 unk_7C66        db  88h ; Ãª             ; DATA XREF: seg000:7C62\u0018o\n</code></pre>\nRight under <pre><code>push 7c0h; pop ds</code></pre> it says <pre><code>assume ds:nothing</code></pre>. <pre><code>retf</code></pre> actually uses the values in the stack to set the segment and offset. Is there a way to manually enable such analysis? Are there more intelligent disassemblers out there? I'm having trouble following the flow and IDA isn't helping at ALL.\n",

The script would:\n\nMatch the push/pop/push/push/retf instruction sequence;\nSet up a code cross-reference from the retf instruction to the calculated address;\nPlace a comment;\nMark the destination for analysis by IDA (optional, I think IDA should automatically start exploring after xref creation).\n\nThis should solve the issue at hand. Unfortunately, IDA is not as smart as we would like it to be.\n",
