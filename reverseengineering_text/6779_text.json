I'm referring to structure that you create via right-click on variable and choosing \"Create new struct type\".\nI don't see new structure in <pre><code>View / Open Subviews / Structures</code></pre> but I'd like to modify it afterwards.\n\nI'm using IDA Pro 6.5\n",

To jump directly to the specific type, choose \"Jump to local type...\" from the context menu on a variable of that type.\nYou can import any structure from Local Types to the Structures list by double-clicking it or selecting \"Syncronize to idb\" from the context menu.\nAdditionally, the structure gets imported automatically if you select \"Jump to structure definition\" (Z) on any of its fields in the pseudocode.\n",

After I deleted local type my Decompiled got botched and I'm no longer able to use it (<a href=\"http://i.snag.gy/40Teb.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">i.snag.gy/40Teb.jpg</a>). How can I fix it ?</span>",
