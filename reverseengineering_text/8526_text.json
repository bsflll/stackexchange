    "content": "I'm a newbie to reverse engineering, so pardon my ignorance. I am trying to extract the complete filesystem from a Netgear router's firmware. Using <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre>, I was able to extract the kernel and a <pre><code>squashfs</code></pre> file system. So far so good. The issue is that the file system is incomplete. Many directories (e.g. /etc, /mnt, /var, /www) are only symbolic links to non-existent directories in /tmp, which itself is empty. \nI'm guessing that (as I've seen on other routers) the contents of /tmp will be another filesystem that is created on startup and stored in RAM. Am I correct? And is there some way of determining the contents of the temporary filesystem from the firmware?\n",

The tmp folder is generally a ramfs, which is mounted from rc with the following line:\n<pre><code>mount(\"ramfs\", \"/tmp\", \"ramfs\", MS_MGC_VAL, NULL);\n</code></pre>\n",

Although I'm happy to have been shown a new tool (with seems to have some features that I'd like to play with) the firmware mod kit got me essentially the same result as binwalk. I've already extracted the firmware and a filesystem. What I need is to know how to get the temp filesystem that's written at startup.</span>",
