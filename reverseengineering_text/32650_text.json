            "text": "@Smm Welcome to RE.SE. Android can hardly be described as a GNU/Linux distro. Because the GNU part is missing. Sure, you can skip the fact that conventionally Linux distros are defined by kernel+userland and insist on it being purely about the Linux kernel, but even then the relationship to other Linux package formats is distant. APKs are an extension of JARs which themselves are glorified ZIP files. apktool can do what you want. That's the only relation I see to reverse engineering (!= RCE). As it stands I have to agree with sudhackar.\n",

Cool & complicated project, but I can atleast point you out to a direction.\nAll android apks are assembled & compiled through gradle.\nWhile compiling an android app on Android Studio, you'll see gradle in action helping to compile the app.\nYou can compile the entire app from source through command line using gradlew.bat/sh scripts that android studio generates.\nEssentially, the script downloads the compatible gradle version defined in configuration files & uses android SDK & JDK present in the environment.\nThat gradlew script is where you should start digging.\nUseful links:\nhttps://developer.android.com/build/building-cmdline\nSimilar Project that's been running for a while:\nhttps://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE\n",
