    "content": "We are unit testing with Vectorcast, which uses the MinGW tool chain on Windows.\nIt launches the command line <pre><code>gdb</code></pre>, but some of the newer engineers are having problems getting to grips with something without a GUI.\nI am looking for a GUI for the MinGW gdb, which\n\nruns on Windows\nis free for commercial use\ndoes not require admin rights \ndoes not write to the registry (preferably fully portable)\ndoes not run in the browser\n\nThe latter point rules out x64dbg and, I believe OllyDbg. What are our options? We just want to point it at an .EXE, possibly set the source code path, if not in the .EXE, visually set breakpoints, step through code, examine variables, etc.\n",
