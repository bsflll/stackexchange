For your specific question, you'd do the following:\n\nSelect the instruction you want to change\nGo to <pre><code>Edit -> Patch Program -> Assemble</code></pre>\nReplace the instruction in the text box with the instruction you'd like it to be.\nClick OK\n\nThe original instruction will now have been replaced with the new one.\nThis article has more info and examples of using the other options in the <pre><code>Patch Program</code></pre> submenu.\n",

It's also possible that the error message is accurate and that feature really isn't available for iOS binaries; I'm not sure. Regardless, here are two examples of people using alternative methods to patch iOS binaries; maybe one of them will help. <a href=\"https://www.zdziarski.com/blog/?p=2172\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">zdziarski.com/blog/?p=2172</a> <a href=\"https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/ios-application-security-part-26-patching-ios-applications-using-ida-pro-hex-fiend\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">resources.infosecinstitute.com/â€¦</a></span>",
