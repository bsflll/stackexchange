    "content": "I am trying to analyze lua functions of game but dll is packed and I can't see them. I tried to dump dll with scylla https://github.com/NtQuery/Scylla but I still didn't get lua functions. Can someone please help me to dump dll?\nDll is part of Watch Dogs game(It's called Disrupt_b64.dll) and it has VMProtector.\nWhen I opened dll in IDA I first got error:\nCan't find translation for relative virtual address 03ACF000, continue?\nAfter that I got error:\nThe imports segment seems to be destroyed. This MAY mean that the file was packed or otherwise modified in order to make it more difficult to analyze.\nWhen I opened dumped dll from Scylla I only got second error\nSomeone on I read on this site https://blog.lms-dev.com/category/watch-dogs/ successfully got that lua functions(collectgarbage, dofile, error, gcinfo). He said on site to unpack dll attach IDA to the process and dump the loader segments.\nDisrupt_b64.dll looked like this\n\nDumped Disrupt_b64.dll looked like this\n",
