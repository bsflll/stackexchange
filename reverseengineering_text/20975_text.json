            "content": "Frida was split into two PIP packages.  \nThe package <pre><code>frida</code></pre> only contains the python bindings, while <pre><code>frida-tools</code></pre> also contains the familiar command line tools from earlier releases.\nThis is explained in the news post for the 12.0 release:\n\nCLI tools\nOne thing that caused a bit of confusion in the past was the fact that\n  our Python bindings also came with some CLI tools. Frida is a toolkit\n  for building tools, and even though we provide a few sample tools it\n  should be up to you if you want to have them installed.\nUp until now this meant anyone building a tool using our Python\n  bindings would end up depending on colorama, prompt-toolkit, and\n  pygments, because our CLI tools happen to depend on those.\nWell, that changes now. If you do:\n<pre><code>$ pip install frida</code></pre>\nYou will now only get our Python bindings. Nothing more. And this\n  package has zero dependencies.\nThe CLI tools might still be useful to you, though, so to install\n  those do:\n<pre><code>$ pip install frida-tools</code></pre>\n",
