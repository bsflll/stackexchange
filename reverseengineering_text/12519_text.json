I was abled to embed my dll but everytime I create a new control via CreateWindowEx it is being shown as a white box for a split second and removed instantly. Here's how I'm creating the window:\n<pre><code>HWND newButton = CreateWindowEx(NULL, \"BUTTON\", \"New button\", WS_VISIBLE | WS_CHILD, 100, 100, 150, 200, mainWnd, NULL, 0, 0);\n</code></pre>\n",
