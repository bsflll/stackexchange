            "content": "First, there are many algorithms used to disassemble a binary stream. The two most used ones are : linear sweep and recursive traversal (sometimes a hybrid), which present different performance and precision/reliability issues (how much code isn't disassembled properly : bad opcode, data interpreted as code, ...).\nSo before you tackle implementation related performance issues you should check the computational complexity of the disassembler you're using.\nSecond, more RAM and faster I/O is - almost - always a performance enhancer. If you are disassembling a +100MB binary file, you'll need all the help you can from the hardware. Therefore, having a fast SSD could reduce the I/O overhead experienced with a traditional HDD. For RAM, the larger the size the better, but keep in mind that the differences in performance between DDR, DDR2, DDR3, ECC, ... are quite substantial. \nNow with regard to the CPU core count and frequency's effects on disassembly performance, it is pretty hard to evaluate. Why? Well, you must ask yourself the following set of questions :\n\nDoes the disassembler you're using implement a parallel disassembly algorithm ?\nIf yes, how does the performance of the disassembler relate/scale with the core count ? If no, then one core will suffice.\n\nFYI, a high core frequency (each core can have a frequency domain of its own separate from his neighbor's) could lead to disastrous performance if RAM is too slow. In the industry we usually settle for a core frequency of at most 1.8x the frequency of RAM. Otherwise, some serious performance bottlenecks (bandwidth, memory access latency, ...) start to tighten up and choke the running stream of instructions.\nFrom what I know, IDA doesn't perform any parallel disassembly - I might be wrong, always check. Therefore, the first two points you cited in your question don't really matter.\nThe simplest way to answer your question would be to say that : the complexity of the disassembly algorithm and the way the implementation takes advantage of the underlying hardware are the key factors for performance. \nEdit :\n[Bonus]\nIf you wish to program a parallel disassembler you can do so this way :\n\nChoose a disassembler library (Udis86 for example)\nExtract the sections and add them to a hashtab which contains a boolean variable - for each section - referring to its state (disassembled '1', not disassembled '0')\nWrite a threadable function which task is to pick a section in the hashtab and disassemble it (you'll have to manage the sections order, ...). Once the task is done, update the state (you'll have to use a lock : a mutex) and pick another one if there are any left.\n\nThis might look easy to do, but in fact it is a bit challenging for that it depends on the flexibility of the disassembly library. Honestly, +100MB binaries are quite rare and commercial/available tools aren't usually designed to handle that much code/data optimally. \nIf you need any additional/more technical details let me know, I'll be glad to develop some points.\n",
