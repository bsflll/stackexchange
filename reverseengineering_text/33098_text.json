    "content": "About 15 years ago Sandisk released their \"Sansa SlotRadio\" thing. Basically, it's a regular mp3 player with an sdcard preloaded with music.\nWell, the music mafia being the music mafia, there's DRM involved, which would make an interesting project to try and defeat.\nOn the sdcard is a sticker. And behind the sticker is... A grid of pins!\nInfact, it looks SUSPICIOUSLY similar to the ones data recovery centers use when doing low level stuff on physically broken cards.\nAnyone have any info on this? It's three rows and seven columns, with (2,2) missing and (2,5) much smaller.\n",
