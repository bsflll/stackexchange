    "content": "I analyzed a binary, and lots of functions weren't detected as such - the bytes weren't detected as assembly. I read about the Aggressive Instruction Finder analysis and used it. Now the instructions are detected, but the functions (at least some) aren't.\nFor a single function, I know that I can press F to define it. Is there any way to do that automatically for all/most undefined functions?\nExample for an undefined function:\n",

You can basically iterate through the code and define undefined functions.\nExampleScipts: IDA MakeFunction\nHowever If you ask this question specifically for Ghidra then I believe there's a plugin to run idapython scipts in Ghidra.\nRun IDAPython scripts in Ghidra\nHope this helps.\n",
