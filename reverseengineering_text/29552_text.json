    "content": "I am a bit of a starter, so bear with me as I can't find the answer through Google (a common thing in Ghidra work I noticed so far).\nI have a function that seems to read like it is a Constructor.\nBut I am having trouble what it is doing, mainly because I think I don't understand the C language that well.\nThe code I am confused about is this:\nThe code as C:\n\nThe code as ASM:\n\nSorry for using screenshots, I couldn't get the ASM to reasonably copy and paste into here.\n<pre><code>*param_1</code></pre>, is set to a specific address. What this * in front of the variable means, I can't really find besides people saying \"You shouldn't do that in C code!\"\nWhat it then starts doing is nulling out some variables in an array or struct that <pre><code>param_1</code></pre> apparently is now (going by the ASM, <pre><code>param_1 == ECX</code></pre> and so probably <pre><code>_this_</code></pre>?) the rest seems irrelevant for now.\nWhat is at <pre><code>0x497e68</code></pre>? It is an address, that then points towards another bit of code at <pre><code>0x438170</code></pre>. And while this <pre><code>0x497e68</code></pre> address is references 4 times, all of them do so in a similar manner, and thus I never see a direct \"CALL\" to this indirect method. The method itself is simply calling _free on ECX. It's not special.\nSo what is going on here? Is there a reasonable explanation as to why this is happening? And what should I actually be reading here?\nAnd if so, is there then a way I can convince Ghidra to present this in a more sensible way?\n",
