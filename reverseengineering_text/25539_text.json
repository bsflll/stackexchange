But I do not have any idea how they do that.\nSome random dude made like a copy of My executable but with more strings (Files Names) on an [x] offset that falls into the <pre><code>.rdata</code></pre> section, which caused the Executable to map more files in the memory ...\nHow is that even possible ?\n",
