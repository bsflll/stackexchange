    "content": "Im a newbe in radare and while I tried to patch a crackme binary, I opened it the first time in debug mode (-d), while debugging I used oo+ to reopen it with write mode, when I modify an instruction using wx, it works but when I quit it gives me two confirmation messages with yes no I press enter two times, then it get back to the original stat, and loose the modification, \nHow could I keep changes even after quitting ???\n",

I just tried myself and I couldn't patch binaries and save them (if anyone can give a more accurate explaination is welcome).\n",
