    "content": "When disassembling ARM binaries in Ghidra, I often see these warnings:\n<pre><code>                /* WARNING: Could not recover jumptable at 0x0747c198. Too many branches */\n                /* WARNING: Treating indirect jump as call */\n</code></pre>\nWhat do they mean? What's the underlying architectural concept I should learn about to understand the cause of these issues?\nHere's an example from a real program, seen in Ghidra's disassembly:\n<pre><code>    if (param_2 == 0x78) {\n                /* WARNING: Could not recover jumptable at 0x0747c198. Too many branches */\n                /* WARNING: Treating indirect jump as call */\n      uVar3 = (*DAT_0747c19c)();\n      return uVar3;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n",

            "content": "From Ghidra.re:\n\nSometimes you will see warnings in the decompiler view stating that there are too many branches to recover a jumptable.\nOne reason for this is that there actually is a jump table, but the decompiler can’t determine bounds on the switch variable\n\nFor your example, this is saying there may a jump table (which is really just an array of pointers), but the decompiler can't figure out what the different possibilities for <pre><code>param2</code></pre> are.\nGhidra recommends:\n\nIn such cases, you can add the jump targets manually and then run the script SwitchOverride.java.\nNote: To ﬁnd such locations in a program, run the script FindUnrecoveredSwitchesScript.java.\n",

                    "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">I tried that but makes no difference. In my case, the template for at least some switches is (segmented Intel code): switch_table: array of (16b value, 16b code offset) switch_code: MOV SI,(#cases-1)*4 next_case: CMP AX, word ptr CS:[SI+switch_table] JNZ no_match JMP word ptr CS:[SI+switch_table+2] no_match: SUB SI,4 JNS next_case I selected the JMP instruction in disassembler, added the switch addresses manually with RE, ran the SwitchOverride.java code, recompiled the function. No difference. Well one difference, I do see the switch addresses in the function graph, so it does seem to have pi</span>",
