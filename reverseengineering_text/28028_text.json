    "content": "I'm trying to correct the following instructions in IDA using a script:\n<pre><code>jnb     short near ptr loc_1C61B1+3\n</code></pre>\nIt order to do this I'm running a snippet like this in a script:\n<pre><code>ida_bytes.del_value(loc_1C61B1)\nidc.create_insn(loc_1C61B1+3)\n</code></pre>\nI've tried many variations on this including trying to auto wait for the analyzer using <pre><code>ida_auto.*_wait()</code></pre> functions, <pre><code>ida_auto.*_plan</code></pre> functions, deleting multiples bytes (<pre><code>ida_bytes.del_items</code></pre>), etc. but no matter what I do I cannot get the same analyzer outcome as if I ran the 2 functions above manually in the command bar. My guess is there's some race conditions happening with the analyzer.\nHow do I properly achieve the following in a script:\n\nUndefine code at location <pre><code>x</code></pre>.\nGive the analyzer enough time to do its things.\nMake code at location <pre><code>x + y</code></pre>.\nGet the same outcome as if I have done the steps manually.\n",
