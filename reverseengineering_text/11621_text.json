There is no difference in Windows 32-bit code (either stdcall or cdecl), but in x64 float's and integers are passed in different registers.\nIt's possible that those macro may make no difference to compilation of a 32-bit target, and are just there to ensure (or inform the reader/compiler) of the expected type, but that's pure conjecture on my part.\n",
