    "content": "When using IDA, I can press x on any subroutine to see where it is called from. Eventually I end up in the <pre><code>.data</code></pre> section. \nBut, what am I looking at when I get to this point ? \nAre these exports offered by the <pre><code>.dll</code></pre> that I'm looking at ? And, if I get to this point, is it safe to assume that there are no other calls to my function (with the exception of dynamically-generated and/or external calls) ? See reference image below for context.\n",
