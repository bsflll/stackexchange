    "content": "By checking the human-readable strings in my target application, I found several interesting function names:\n<pre><code>...\nDataIntegrityError\nGetObjectIdsOfDuplicateLinksErrors\nGetInvalidClusterIdsExists\nMain\nIsCommandLineInvalid\nShowDebugOnlyOptions\nDoDecrypt\nIStorageLogger\nDoExport\nDoImport\nIsDebugOptionActive\nGetRootPath\n...\n</code></pre>\nUsing Immunity Debugger (or any other free debugger, IDA doesn't appear to be compatible with my target application), how can I jump to one of these functions, say <pre><code>DoDecrypt</code></pre>?\nI can only find commands to jump to an address, so how can I find a function's address from it's name?\n",
