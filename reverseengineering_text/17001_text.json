    "content": "I have a proprietary binary (firmware), and I'd like to check whether it contains opensource components. I'm thinking about extracting what it contains - probably binaries - and use <pre><code>strings</code></pre>, <pre><code>grep</code></pre> and a couple of automated github/bitbucket/etc. searches to identify potential GPL violations.\nI know this approach is very limited, that's why I'm looking for advices and/or existing tools that could be relevant?\n",

It can allow you to analyze an embedded device for bugs, vulnerabilities, or GPL violations without ever having access to the device.
