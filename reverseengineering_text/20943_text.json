            "content": "I would suggest using Frida framework for that purpose - link. In short, it will enable you to hook native/Dalvik routines on rooted/non-rooted devices and write hook logic in JS. The framework also has python bindings which can provide means for automation. Following is a short explanation about the usage flow for analysis of APK file:\n\nRooted device:\n\n\nthere is a great quick start guide on the Frida's site - link\nhere is an example of hooking native function for a running APK file, but you can also use the framework to analyze arbitrary native executable which you can attach to or spawn a new process.\n\nNot-rooted device:\n\n\nin that case you will need to re-package APK and include server library to it. Here is a good example how to do it.\n\n\nThe framework is in active development and cross-platform/arch supported. If more granular control is needed, you can even develop lower-level apps (e.g. in C) against it's API library.\n",
