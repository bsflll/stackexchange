    "content": "I need some tip to undrestand what is the best way to execute external code from DLL or command line.\nI like to add the force feedback support to different games that not support it.\nI can write a DLL or a commnad line exe that execute the FFB. The problem is how I call these function from the game.\nFor the moment I have disassebled one game with IDA and found the point to put the call.\nI don't have any experience in assembly. So I'am not sure if I'am in the right way.\nThere are some tool like: wininject so I was think to use it to add the dll dependency to my exe game.\nAfter I need to do the call of my function inside the DLL in assembly (ex. exectute_ffb(par1) ), but I don't known the code to do the call.\nHere the screenshot about the call.\n\n\n<pre><code>int __cdecl sub_43AC70(char *a1, int a2)\n{\n  call my_function(a1) from mylibrary.dll\n\n  int i; // [esp+0h] [ebp-4h]\n\n  for ( i = sub_43BC50(); i; i = *(_DWORD *)i )\n  {\n    if ( *(_DWORD *)(i + 88) == a2 && (!a1 || !stricmp((const char *)(i + 4), a1)) )\n      return i;\n  }\n  return 0;\n</code></pre>\nCan you help me please ?\n",

            "content": "It is indeed possible, and not that hard to do - providing the game doesn't have any anti-cheat nor integrity checks.\nThe thing you are looking for is called function hooking. If you don't want to mess with assembly there are few good libs that can do the most important and tedious part of work for you.\n\nDetours - developed by Microsoft\nFrida\nPolyHook\n\nTake a look into examples, for example that one in PolyHook`s repository. Here they hook (intercept) printf function, but there is no problem to intercept game function at <pre><code>43AC70</code></pre> to call your function from <pre><code>mylibrary.dll</code></pre>.\nIf you want to write your own detour you can take a look at my other reply on that site: here\n",
