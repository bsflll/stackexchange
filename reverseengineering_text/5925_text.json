    "content": "I have this kind of code:\n\nI have reversed the struct entirely, and when I try to cast to ClientGame*, instead of:\n<pre><code>if(mainStruct->something & 2)\n</code></pre>\nI see:\n\nThe offsets 0x364, 0x370, and 0x374 are also reversed and each one has the size that IDA wants (0x374 is a <pre><code>db</code></pre>, 0x364 and 0x370 are <pre><code>dd</code></pre>)\nIs there any way to fix it? Thanks!\n",
