Obviously such a change would mess up the offsets.\ne.g. Say I have the byte sequence <pre><code>4F 3E 23</code></pre> and wish to change it to <pre><code>23 56 7E 74 21</code></pre>\n",

            "content": "I suppose you have two options:\n\nsearch for some free, unused space in the executable, put your code\nthere, and put a JMP wherever you originally wanted to insert more\ninstructions. (this would probably involve changing the permissions so the code can be executed without access violations)\ninstead of static patching, inject a DLL and put a JMP to your code contained in the DLL.\n\nIn both cases, you'd need to preserve the program state\n   (probably a PUSHAD then POPAD when you're done), then JMP back\n   and resume execution.\nAn example (second approach, assuming MSVC):\n<pre><code>void __declspec(naked) MyCode()\n{\n    __asm PUSHAD\n    //your code here\n    __asm POPAD\n    __asm PUSH returnAddress\n    __asm RETN\n}\n</code></pre>\nand to patch it:\n<pre><code>DWORD AddrToPatch = 0xC0DE;\n\nDWORD RelAddr = (DWORD)(MyCode - (DWORD)AddrToPatch) - 5;\n*AddrToPatch = 0xE9;\n*((DWORD *)(AddrToPatch + 0x1)) = RelAddr;  \n</code></pre>\n\nHonestly, I think you're better off doing it like that - the first method is a lot more hassle, and injecting a DLL is fairly easy, you can automate that by playing around with the IAT or TLS callbacks.\n",
