    "content": "I was trying to figure out if there is a way I can get the address for a function name that has random characters in it.\nFor example the function name is \"Player_GetStats_m29275\" here the \"m292755\"\nis random characters. So I want to search the name of the function by just \"Player_GetStats\" so it gives me the address of the function.\nget_name_ea is not good for doing this. I can search the function with find_text but it's too slow and takes a lot of time even if I mention the segment.\n",

            "content": "As far as I know, IDA doesn't have a <pre><code>function_name_to_address()</code></pre> that gets a pattern and returns an address. You can iterate over all the functions and check if their name matches the one you want. It should not take too long.  \n<pre><code>from idautils import *\nfrom idaapi import *\nfrom idc import *\n\nea = BeginEA()\nfor funcAddr in Functions(SegStart(ea), SegEnd(ea)):\n    funcName = GetFunctionName(funcAddr)\n    # Check if the function name starts with \"Player_GetStats\"\n    if funcName.startswith(\"Player_GetStats\"):\n        print \"Function %s is at 0x%x\" % (funcName, funcAddr)\n</code></pre>\nAlternatively you can use regular expression to match the name you want:\n<pre><code>import re\n\nfuncName = \"Player_GetStats_m29275\"\nre.compile(\"^Player_GetStats_\\w\\d{5}$\")\nif pattern.match(funcName):\n   \"%s match the pattern\" % funcName\n</code></pre>\nExplanation:\n\n<pre><code>^</code></pre> is for \"begins with\"\n<pre><code>\\w</code></pre> matches one word character (\"m\" in this case)\n<pre><code>\\d</code></pre> matches a digit\n<pre><code>{5}</code></pre> checks that the previous expression (<pre><code>\\d</code></pre>) is repeating 5 times\n<pre><code>$</code></pre> is for \"end of line\"\n",
