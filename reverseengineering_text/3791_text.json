    "content": "I'm looking for the maximum sampling rate of the Wii Balance Board for studying statokinesiograms (2D path of the ground projection of the center of pressure). Some source indicates a sampling rate of 100Hz. Another mentions 60Hz, and a serious reference is using the WBB at 40Hz !\nThe related patent does not provide this information but mention 60Hz \"as an example\" (page 13). I suppose the bottleneck in frequency would be the microprocessor speed, as several pressure acquisitions could be transmitted at once with the bluetooth module.\n",
