    "content": "For some drivers I can use the following WinDBG command:\n<pre><code>bu driver!DriverEntry\n</code></pre>\nHowever there are some drivers that cannot be debugged this way. IDA output window displays the following error message:\n<pre><code>WaitForEvent() failed; please make sure that all unresolved bpts/expressions could be evaluated before continuing\n</code></pre>\nor breakpoint is completely ignored. This command does not help either:\n<pre><code>sxe ld:driver\n</code></pre>\nI tried to replace the first byte of driver's DriverEntry code with CC opcode (int 3). After that virtual machine window silently closes.\nDoes anybody know how to break on DriverEntry of such driver? Thanks.\n",
