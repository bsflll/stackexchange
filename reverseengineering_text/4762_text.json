    "content": "Basically here's what I want to know, if you have a disassembled instruction say:\n<pre><code>jz 0x8048e1a\n</code></pre>\nAnd, you also have the source code. How do you go about figuring out what this instruction relates to in the source code ? At the very least, would it be possible to figure out the basic block that this instruction comes from ?\nBasically I have an application that spits out a disassembled instruction for an ELF binary that I have compiled myself (source available), and now I have to find out what/where this disassembled instruction maps to in the source code. \nLet's also assume that I do not use any of the optimization flags while compiling. \nI should probably mention that I am using Intel's PIN as the application that spits out these disassembled instructions. So, I know which function/routine these instructions belong to. But, I just want to be a bit more precise at the assembly level.\nThanks for any help/hints !\n",

Given the high-level overview from the source code, one could spot the function and possibly the line where the instruction belongs, but so far I know no program that could do the same. Having debug info certainly helps a lot, but is not a panacea, and in general, not always available.\n\nAt the very least, would it be possible to figure out the basic block that this instruction comes from?\n\nIn general, no. In certain cases, yes. Modern compilers tend to optimize code too aggressively. Even having all the debug info the compiler produces is sometimes not enough to map the precise location of the given insn, which can be demonstrated by trying to do source-level debugging on such an application.\nEDIT: Didn't properly notice you build the binary by yourself. Then yes, it should be possible to at least map the instruction to a function given the debug info.\n",

Detail on how to do that is here.\nPrimarily involves:\n\nDisabling C++ exceptions\nDebug information format set to Program Database (/Zi)\nTurning off buffer security check (/GS-)\nTurn off incremental linking (/NCREMENTAL:NO)\n\n\nEmbarcadero C++ Builder and Delphi (formerly Borland) offer the same functionality as well.
