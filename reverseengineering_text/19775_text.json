    "content": "I'm trying to modify the FPGA firmware for the Blackmagic Pocket Camera. The camera's 60fps function is disabled. The sensor can handle 100fps. Blackmagic only provides Max. 30fps. So there is more to it than offered by Blackmagic.\nThe <pre><code>*.bin</code></pre> files can be found in the Blackmagic Camera Setup and only there. In all other versions the <pre><code>*.bin</code></pre> files are not to be found. It concerns the following files: \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1VBD7E-E-8eVjextm0Z2AjaX7u3NKRPEF/view\nThe FPGA chip is Spartan 6 from Xilinx\nIs it possible to extract the firmware, then modify it and pack it back as firmware?\nI hope for some tips.\n",
