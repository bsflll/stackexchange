            "content": "The issue is that address <pre><code>0x7ff5a7183210</code></pre> is not part of your binary but rather part of the kernel code that will run your code. So running <pre><code>aaa</code></pre> will not create any functions there. What you need to create a breakpoint in your code (i.e running <pre><code>db main</code></pre>) and only when your breakpoint is hit you could run <pre><code>pdf</code></pre> and it should should show you the disassembly.\n",
