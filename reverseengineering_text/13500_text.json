    "content": "I'm quite new to COM object reversing (Windows Platform). I'm trying to reverse Internet Explorer on Windows 8.1, where child IE process communicates with Parent IE process via com (Due to Protected Mode). \nThis is an ASM snippet of a virtual function from ieframe.dll ( Part of class CShellUIHelper) which responsible for a COM operation (I've MS public symbol.)\n<pre><code>CShellUIHelper::XX_XX{\n\n..\n..\n    mov     eax, [ebp+var_2BC]\n    lea     edx, [ebp+Filename]\n    mov     edi, esp\n    push    edx\n    push    [ebp+var_2AC]\n    mov     esi, [eax]\n    push    ecx             ; _DWORD\n    push    eax             ; _DWORD\n    mov     esi, [esi+25Ch]\n    mov     ecx, esi        ; _DWORD\n    call    ds:___guard_check_icall_fptr\n    call    esi             ; call {combase!ObjectStublessClient30+0x5c0\n\n}\n</code></pre>\nHere its calling a COM interface method at last line using <pre><code>call esi</code></pre> instruction which is actually <pre><code>call [esi+025Ch]</code></pre>. Runtime i've found its actually calling combase!ObjectStublessClient30(x,x)\nHere I want to find the interface method name its calling using combase!ObjectStublessClient30(). \nTo find the method name I'm follwing this RE.SE Answer, which looks pretty similar.\nBut the problem is, in this answer the interface name was known which is IShellWindows, but in my case the I dont know the interface name.\nI'm stuck at this point. So my questions is what path I should follow to find out the interface name and method name.?\n",
