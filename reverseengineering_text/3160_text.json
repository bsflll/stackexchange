    "content": "I have a quite old C corporate parser / compiler code that was generated from an ancient Yacc and the original grammar source is lost (as the intermediate files) the only result the <pre><code>ytab.c</code></pre> parser generated file. That legacy piece of code need revamping but I cannot afford to recode it from scratch.\nBy \"ancient Yacc\", I mean that the parser is using tables named <pre><code>yyact</code></pre>, <pre><code>yypact</code></pre>, <pre><code>yypgo</code></pre>, <pre><code>yyr1</code></pre>, <pre><code>yyr2</code></pre>, <pre><code>yytoks</code></pre>, <pre><code>yyexca</code></pre>, <pre><code>yychk</code></pre>, <pre><code>yydef</code></pre>.\nCould it be possible to mechanically retrieve / regenerate the parsing rules by deduction of the parsing tables in order to reconstruct the grammar?\nExample with a little sample of an expression parser that I can process with the same ancient Yacc:\n<pre><code>yytabelem yyexca[] ={\n-1, 1,\n    0, -1,\n    -2, 0,\n-1, 21,\n    261, 0,\n    -2, 8,\n    };\nyytabelem yyact[]={\n\n    13,     9,    10,    11,    12,    23,     8,    22,    13,     9,\n    10,    11,    12,     9,    10,    11,    12,     1,     2,    11,\n    12,     6,     7,     4,     3,     0,    16,     5,     0,    14,\n    15,     0,     0,     0,    17,    18,    19,    20,    21,     0,\n     0,    24 };\nyytabelem yypact[]={\n\n  -248, -1000,  -236,  -261,  -236,  -236, -1000, -1000,  -248,  -236,\n  -236,  -236,  -236,  -236,  -253, -1000,  -263,  -245,  -245, -1000,\n -1000,  -249, -1000,  -248, -1000 };\nyytabelem yypgo[]={\n\n     0,    17,    24 };\nyytabelem yyr1[]={\n\n     0,     1,     1,     1,     2,     2,     2,     2,     2,     2,\n     2,     2,     2 };\nyytabelem yyr2[]={\n\n     0,     8,    12,     0,     6,     6,     6,     6,     6,     6,\n     4,     2,     2 };\nyytabelem yychk[]={\n\n -1000,    -1,   266,    -2,   259,   263,   257,   258,   267,   262,\n   263,   264,   265,   261,    -2,    -2,    -1,    -2,    -2,    -2,\n    -2,    -2,   260,   268,    -1 };\nyytabelem yydef[]={\n\n     3,    -2,     0,     0,     0,     0,    11,    12,     3,     0,\n     0,     0,     0,     0,     0,    10,     1,     4,     5,     6,\n     7,    -2,     9,     3,     2 };\n\nyytoktype yytoks[] =\n{\n    \"NAME\", 257,\n    \"NUMBER\",   258,\n    \"LPAREN\",   259,\n    \"RPAREN\",   260,\n    \"EQUAL\",    261,\n    \"PLUS\", 262,\n    \"MINUS\",    263,\n    \"TIMES\",    264,\n    \"DIVIDE\",   265,\n    \"IF\",   266,\n    \"THEN\", 267,\n    \"ELSE\", 268,\n    \"LOW\",  269,\n    \"UMINUS\",   270,\n    \"-unknown-\",    -1  /* ends search */\n};\n</code></pre>\nI am looking to retrieve \n<pre><code>stmt    : IF exp THEN stmt\n        | IF exp THEN stmt ELSE stmt\n        | /*others*/\n        ;\n\nexp     : exp PLUS exp\n        | exp MINUS exp\n        | exp TIMES exp\n        | exp DIVIDE exp\n        | exp EQUAL exp\n        | LPAREN exp RPAREN\n        | MINUS exp\n        | NAME\n        | NUMBER\n        ;\n</code></pre>\nThe full parser for this example is available as a gist, it is showing a <pre><code>yyreds</code></pre> table containing the rules as a debug info that is not in the parser that I am trying to reverse.\nNote : I have asked this formerly on SO, and was suggested to ask it in RE. Any help?\nPS: i am not familiar with the RE question tags, feel free to correct this.\n",

I have, however, found a page which should be pretty helpful:\n\nUnderstanding C parsers generated by GNU Bison\nThis document is an attempt to describe the implementation of an\n  LALR(1) parser in C as generated by Bison 2.3. I used a simple grammar\n  to demonstrate the working of the parser and the nature of parsing\n  tables. You will also find a comparison of these tables to the\n  uncompressed tabular scheme given in the popular book \"Compilers -\n  Principles, Techniques and Tools\" by Aho, Sethi and Ullman, also\n  called as the \"Dragon Book\" and many other books on compiler design.\n\nSee it here.\nEDIT: found a script that claims to do it!\nhttp://nah6.com/~itsme/cvs-xdadevtools/perlutils/yydecode.pl\nHowever it seems it's intended to be used with another set of tables. Still, it might be useful for a start.\n",
