    "content": "I have a 3D driver from the early 90's for Solaris 2.5-2.6 Sparc that uses flexlm to handle license management. How would I go about either circumventing or removing it for computer archeology/hobby development purposes. Also note that the original company probably doesn't even know this software exists anymore (unless you think there might be a market for OpenGL 1.1 CAD running on 50Mhz hardware ;) ).\nI understand there are SDKs avaiable for flexlm that somehow allow you to circumvent things but I don't think I follow how it works well. Also I have noticed that there are hostname modification tools that allow you to spoof your hostname... preferably I wouldn't want to do something like that but rather circumvent it entirely as I undestand it isn't all that strong of a protection anyway. It would be nice if this work work for other period software as well...\n",
