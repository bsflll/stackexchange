    "content": "I have been asked to recover data from a Nintendo DSi device that has some critical pictures and audio on it. \nAfter looking closely at the system, it appears that the memory must be integraded onto the board and will require some effort to attach it to something like a Serial Converter.\nAny ideas on what kind of a process to follow in order to access such a memory device as is found on a DSi?\n",
