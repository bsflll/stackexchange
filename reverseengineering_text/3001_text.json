            "content": "There are several approaches to locating strings in an unknown file. One you already tried: <pre><code>strings</code></pre>. This looks for plain, unencoded ASCII text:\n\nStrings  looks  for  ASCII  strings in a binary file [..] A  string is any sequence of 4 (the default) or more printing characters ending with a newline or a  null. (<pre><code>man strings</code></pre>)\n\nBut there are many reasons why this naive approach may fail. First off: not every text in the world is ASCII encoded. In fact, examining your file with a binary editor, you can find graphic images for the font used in the game at offset 0x20010 -- monochrome bitmaps of 8x16 pixels. If you assume the first character (a '0') is numbered zero, then 'A' is at position 31 -- definitely not ASCII text. Of course, it's possible the text drawing routine knows this, and re-orders characters to be printed according to this scheme; but, given the age of this particular game (1987) it is more likely that the textual data is stored according to this weird encoding.\nIn itself, however, this should not be a problem.\nGoogling for this game provides a number of screen shots, and you can read some of the texts that may appear -- \"The last thing you remember\", \"Word of your historic quest\", etc. --, and a noteworthy point is that all text appears to be in ALL CAPS.\nHow does that help? Well, if the encoding is remotely 'normal', the character code of an 'A' might be anything, but you can safely assume that <pre><code>code+1</code></pre> is 'B', <pre><code>code+2</code></pre> is 'C', and so on. Now let's assume the text \"THE\" occurs anywhere (a safe assumption). Subtract 'T' from the first byte in the data and note the difference. Subtract this difference from the next byte and test if it is an 'H'; if so, test the same difference on the next byte and see if it is an 'E'. Three times is a charm (in this case), and since the string \"THE\" ought to come up very frequent, you should see lots of hits with the same difference. Then you can write a custom routine to 'convert' all data bytes according to this scheme, and check again if you find useful strings.\nThat didn't work for Shadowgate.\nAnother option is that the text has been deliberately obfuscated. A popular (because fast) option was to XOR text with a constant. That way the text was not readily visible when inspected with a hex viewer, yet could easily be displayed. So I did the same as above, only now with a XOR operation instead of a constant subtraction. It didn't work either.\nNext: given that SG is a text adventure, it stands to reason the writers tried to stuff as much as possible text into the poor NES memory. To find real world compression (ZIP, LZW) in such an old game is fairly rare, the compression schemes tended to be quite simple. After all, not only RAM was limited but CPU speed as well. What if every character is stored as a 5-bit sequence? That would save lots of memory -- every 8 characters of text could be stored in just 5 bytes, a compression rate of 62.5%.\nWhy \"5-bit\"? We're talking English text here, plus a handful of punctuation characters, plus (maybe) digits '0' to '9'. The alphabet itself is 26 characters long, which leaves another 6 values for anything else -- and, hey, one of the extra codes could mean \"for the next character use all 8 bits\".\nChecking every 5 bits against my test string (which in cryptography is called a \"crib\"), I found the following:\n<pre><code>candidate at 0570, delta is 41 H_A\\`THE[TROLL[\ncandidate at 0670, delta is 41 _H\\`ATHE[TROLL[\ncandidate at 0878, delta is 41 `AN`QTHE[TROLL[\ncandidate at 09E3, delta is 41 FROM^THE[DEPTHS\ncandidate at 1380, delta is 41 E[OF[THEM_A[THI\ncandidate at 13F0, delta is 41 ]NX_ATHE[WORDS[\ncandidate at 14C0, delta is 41 PD^`QTHE[FLAME[\ncandidate at 1BBA, delta is 41 UDGE[THEM[BY_A_\ncandidate at 22E0, delta is 41 ]BX_ATHE[GLASS[\ncandidate at 230D, delta is 41 ID_A[THE^SIGN[O\ncandidate at 2375, delta is 41 S[ON[THEM_A\\`AB\ncandidate at 2390, delta is 41 LLOW[THE^VISCOU\ncandidate at 2528, delta is 41 F]PX_THE[STONE[\ncandidate at 25E6, delta is 36 @CP=KTHE@?OFHBS\ncandidate at 27F8, delta is 41 YDP]ATHE[BARK[O\ncandidate at 2B1E, delta is 41 D_H\\]THE[WATER[\n</code></pre>\n.. and many more. You can see it works, because I also decoded a few bytes before and after the test string, and that's recognizable as 'something' as well. The 'delta' shown is the difference between the five-bit code (0..31) and ASCII, and you can see it's <pre><code>41</code></pre> for the majority of strings (the only exception seems a false positive).\nTo assure that this is correct, I tried with another crib: <pre><code>KING</code></pre> (it's a fantasy game):\n<pre><code>candidate at 0661, delta is 41 Y[LOOKING[SPEAR\ncandidate at 23B4, delta is 41 [DRINKING[TAR_A\ncandidate at 2B5D, delta is 41 [DRINKING_A\\`AA\ncandidate at 8E1B, delta is 43 \\XVFDKINGDHEEVE\ncandidate at 146F9, delta is 34 JL54HKING48A4:D\n</code></pre>\nThat seems to work out as well: not the 'king' I was expecting, but nevertheless good results with a delta of 41, random stuff with another delta.\nBut finding useful strings this way is rather fortunate, because of course there is no guarantee that reading every 5 bits starting at the first byte should display anything useful. There may be lots of other strings in between the ones shown, but they didn't happen to start on a multiple of 5*8 bits. Suppose there was no text at position #0, but there was at position #1, then I cannot see it:\n<pre><code> bits for byte 0,1\n 0000.0000 TTTT.T000 (T = Text character bits)\n ---\n reading 1st 5 bits\n 1111.1??? ????.????\n 2nd 5 bits -- the wrong ones!\n .... .111 11??.????\n</code></pre>\nTo properly decode all strings, you'd now take the following route:\n\nmy list of results contain readable text, but some garbage as well. Find out what the 'garbage' is (<pre><code>[</code></pre> appears to be a simple space, but <pre><code>THEM_A\\'AB</code></pre> needs a closer look).\nfind as much as possible string starts and note down their addresses\nsearch the binary for these addresses. After all, if they are 'used', there needs to be some reference to them.\nBefore and after these addresses, there will be more. These are addresses of strings the search algorithm did not find, but still may be valid.\nUsually, a list of this kind is a contiguous one (although there may be some data associated with each string). Scan the binary up and down for similar addresses, until you found what's sure to be the start and the end.\nLoop over the list and display everything you can according to the decoding scheme.\nSit back and enjoy a job well done.\n",
