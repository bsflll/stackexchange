This works. But how can i create them by myself?\n(this is a crosspost from stackoverflow)\n",

However, I'm not sure if it will work in ollydbg since its assembler is mainly intended for assembling instructions, not data. I would suggest instead to use the hex dump window for that. (I think it can be used for editing text)\n",
