    "content": "Hopefully I'm asking this at the right place. League of legends recently added the option to join a club. Clubs still use the XMPP protocol just like before for their public chat rooms: XMPP for public rooms.\nFor public chat rooms, you connect through the \"lvl.pvp.net\" server.\nFor the private clubs' chat rooms, the server is now \"pgc.pvp.net\".\nMy problem is that I can't figure out how to find the room address to connect to a club. The clubs are private rooms. Only someone that is part of the club can view and chat in the club. Unlike for a public chat room, where the address is simply: pu~\"Channel name hashed and no capital letters\", a club address is a UUID and therefore, unlike public rooms, it's impossible to figure out the room address from the club name. \nRiot is fine with people connecting to the XMPP server from outside apps, but they haven't provided an easy way to find the UUID for a club room.\nHow do I find what it is for my club?\n",

With the old private chat rooms you were able to get the id by sending an invite to the room. But now even the invites to the clubs are handled by the rtmp server of Riot (afaik but def. not from xmpp) and most clients/libs/apis to connect to this server were discontinued from development in 2014 when Riot introduced their API and planned to ban the accounts used for this.\nOne option you could try is to search in the logs of the client. At least the public chatrooms are saved in a file if you tick them as open on startup. \nI miss the really extensive logs of everything they produced in 2011. It included everything from chatroom names to names of pre/postmatch chat room names etc. \nIf you find a solution I would be interested in it.\n",
