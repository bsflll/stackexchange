One of the latest projects is this:\nhttps://github.com/Mysterie/uncompyle2\nIt runs on Python 2.7 but supports decompiling 2.5 to 2.7.\nNote that some commercial projects has been known to use modified Python interpreters. Modifications can include:\n\nbytecode files encryption\nchanged opcode values or additional opcodes\na heavily customized runtime (e.g. Stackless Python)\n\nIf you need to handle this, one approach is to convert non-standard bytecode to standard one and then use the usual decompilers (this apparently was used by the people from above project to decompile Dropbox code). Another is to change the decompiler to directly support the variations.\n",
