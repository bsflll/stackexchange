    "content": "I'm trying to find the JTAG header for an Intel X Scale (ArmV5) PXA270 board. I found and populated a 20-pin header:\n\nbut JTAGulator doesn't think it has a valid combination of TDI/TDO/TMS/TCK on either a IDCode or bypass scan. I put a logic analyzer on it and don't really see a steady clock:\n\nIs it possible the clock is elsewhere and some of the header pins are still TDI/TDO etc., or do any of the logic analyzer data seem they could be from JTAG?\n",
