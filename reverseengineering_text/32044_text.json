However, I created a plugin with a huge help from pancake, that allows just that:\nhttps://github.com/satk0/r2-afen-plugin\nInstallation is as simple as running:\n<pre><code>r2pm -i r2afen\n</code></pre>\nAfter installing, you must run radare2 with <pre><code>-e asm.parser=afen -e asm.pseudo=true</code></pre> arguments for the plugin to actually work:\n<pre><code>r2 -e asm.parser=afen -e asm.pseudo=true <file>\n</code></pre>\nThen, using this plugin, the command that renames <pre><code>rbp + rax - 0x1020</code></pre> expression to <pre><code>cwd[i]</code></pre> would be the following:\n<pre><code>> afen cmd[i] \"rbp + rax - 0x1020\"\n</code></pre>\n",
