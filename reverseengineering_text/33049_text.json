    "content": "I'm trying to get my PPPoE password from my router but as I have partial/locked down configuration Ui I cant download the configuration file from my router. Is it possible to get the password decrypted from the hash I get from just changing the password field to plain text by right-clicking and inspecting its properties ?\nThis the text I get when I do this :  edd47ac152ff0f979aa4eabd19239fe680b42f6550c0e367c282b08d7400cbd2\nOr is there a way I can still download the config file with the locked down ui ?\n",
