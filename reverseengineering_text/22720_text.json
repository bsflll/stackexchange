    "content": "I'm interested in reversing a UWP program made using React Native for Windows. Once such applications are compiled, the logic is contained in one dll. After opening this dll into IDA, it appears pretty clear that the file contains a .NET part (located in the section <pre><code>.rdata</code></pre>) and generic stub as native code in the <pre><code>.text</code></pre> section.\nDid anyone already succeed to extract the .NET code in the <pre><code>.rdata</code></pre> section and open it in a standard decompiler?\nCheers!\n",
