    "content": "I have an executable without debug symbols, and I want to get to its' <pre><code>main()</code></pre> function.\nWhat I do is putting breakpoint at <pre><code>$exentry</code></pre> address, but this address of some CRT-initialization. To get to the <pre><code>main()</code></pre> I need to single-step until I see some changes in working application. \nIs there any other procedure to skip CRT code?\n",
