            "content": "If a binary uses deflate or gzip (which uses deflate), the code is generally linked in as a library and thus easy to detect based on string artifacts. This can certainly be automated, e.g., you could simply search for the respective strings. Manually matching functions against the source code is a somewhat tedious process, but it usually works nicely. The process is much more difficult for less common algorithms or when you don't have any artifacts. In that case you have to identify the algorithm by its semantics (things like word size, constants, data structures may provide hints).\nIn addition to the already mentioned FLIRT signatures: If you use IDA Pro with the Hex-Rays plugin and you are lucky, you may be able to find an algorithm on http://crowd.re. There are a few annotations for compression algorithms available. Apart from that, I am not aware of any tools or scripts that do what you want.\n",
