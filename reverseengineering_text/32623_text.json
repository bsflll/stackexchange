    "content": "I tried posting this on stack overflow with no luck, hoping I can get some more answers here.\nhave an app running on my iPhone via XCode by way of USBC -> Lightning cable. I would like to analyze the USB packets that go between XCode and the device when I install an app from Xcode to the device. I open up wireshark, and I see a few interfaces that seem like an obvious choice:\n\niPhone USB: en6\nen12, en13 (these only showed up when I plugged the phone in, they disappeared when unplugging, so I figured they're related)\nThunderbolt 1-4: en1-4 (I have it plugged into one of my thunderbolt ports, so maybe?)\n\nI've tried running wireshark as sudo, I've also tried turning the interfaces off and then on again using <pre><code>sudo ifconfig <interface> off/on</code></pre>\nWhen I run Wireshark on en6, en12, and en13, I see traffic that looks like it correlates with when I build in XCode and the app starts running, but I don't see anything that looks like it's big enough traffic to copy the code from XCode to the phone, and then run it. All I see are some DHCP discover packets, and some MDSN packets.\n",
