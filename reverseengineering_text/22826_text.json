    "content": "I'm trying to extract some binary blobs from a unknown archive format. (*.pakz).\nI know this archive contains some <pre><code>.xtreme</code></pre> binary files that are the files I'm looking for. My goal is to extract those files from the archive.\nBy doing some research I've came across <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre>. So I've tried to extract some signature info from it. It returned me several blobs of LZMA compressed data. \nf.ex, this is the first entries in the output of <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre>\n<pre><code>    DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n12            0xC             LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 65536 bytes, uncompressed size: 1130064 bytes\n1079006       0x1076DE        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 65536 bytes, uncompressed size: 669520 bytes\n1718248       0x1A37E8        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 65536 bytes, uncompressed size: 807872 bytes\n</code></pre>\nI assume these are parts of a single compressed file I should combine? So I tried extracting each individual files/blob with <pre><code>carve</code></pre> option. This outputs me several .7z files however many are missing. I don't know why, by using verbose and log command line options, it doens't output any errors but outputs LZMA blob addresses that are not extracted. \nIf I extract files I get several .xml files that give me useful information, f.ex, the path of the files I'm looking for but I still don't know from the path the start/end bytes of that file. \nDoes anyone has any clue?\nThanks in advance.\n",
