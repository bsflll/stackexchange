    "content": "I like security as a hobby and I not so often I read and play with a few simple KeyGen games and I enjoy it.\nReversing and KeyGen is very interesting but I'm a beginner and my questions are probably very dumb but I will be very thankful if you could help me.\nUntil the moment I have reversed simple keygen applications using techniques such as:\n\nLook for string text reference to find the interesting code area.\nKeygen fishing.\nAnd bypass <pre><code>IsDebuggerPresent</code></pre> check.\n\nYeah, I know, really basic stuff. Here is a video similar to what I do in general:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJY_Tv7o5bE\n\nJust for learning sometimes I try to reverse a few small and medium application that I buy for Windows and looks like simple products without many protections.\nThis is a software that I acquired 2 months ago and the whole installation is around 50MB. One of the motivations to try apply my basic knowledge here is because I like to see if what I learned in keygens really work in real-life, my experience that medium softwares are much harder since keygens are very small and easy to find the routines that you want. :)\n** Just to make it very clear, I have a license for this program and my intention is only learn and increase my knowledge. Since I have no commercial intention in break it or create any damage I will not disclosure the application - I hope you understand. **\nOK, let's go. The application consist of one main executable (~33MB), 6 DLLs (very small ones and some of them are <pre><code>libeay32.dll</code></pre>, etc) and around 90 <pre><code>.xsd</code></pre> files (XML format). My first step was try to identify the programming language used and if a packer was present, please, see screen shots below:\n\n\nIt really appears to be developed in Delphi, with CFF I confirmed it. Also, there is no section that points for an packer looking at CFF information and EXE Information and RDG also say it's clean. However, RDG found <pre><code>IsDebuggerPresent</code></pre> and pointed for an protection software as you may see. However, I'm not sure if it's a false-positive.\nOn my application the serial is entered in a field like that:\n\nAnd once I enter a wrong serial number (30 chars long) I get a message like that:\n\nI guess it's not a <pre><code>MessageBox</code></pre>, or at least it's very custom one. For this kind of messages should I keep breakpoints at <pre><code>MessageBoxA</code></pre>, etc? Or there is a different API?\nBelow is a screenshot once I attach to the application running:\n\nWhen I press \"run\" at OllyDbg it's what I get:\n\nHere is a list of SEH chain:\n\nHere are the \"Windows\" available, including the one that I would like to disassemble, examine and put a breakpoint:\n\nHowever it fails to debug, see below, please:\n\nIs it some kind of protection? How to disable this part of code, put breakpoints, etc?\nLooking at \"Text String References\" I'm able to see just partial messages and not the one displayed on my custom \"<pre><code>MessageBox</code></pre>\".\n\nAlso, There are many parts that looks like an message that will be completed on the fly, for example \"A chave informata esta\" which means \"They key entered is\" or \"Chave incorrecta n\" which means \"Wrong key at\".\n[img]http://img5.imageshack.us/img5/3382/11ionlyseetextstringsre.png[/img]\nAdditionally, I noted that are parts of the application when some texts are not stored as a \"TextString\", instead I see \"char by char\" in sequence at OllyDbg creating a few strings (also not very useful to me).\nIf I define a breakpoint in any of these TextStrings it's what happen - an exception:\n\nIs it a protection? Any idea how to bypass it?\nFrom here the only thing that I'm able to do it pass control to the application and all is over. :(\nAlso, if I refuse to pass control to the application and I continue with F7/F8 I get something like that:\n\nIt ends with an instruction not recognized by OllyDbg. Any idea?\nI also tried to set breakpoints in Names from <pre><code>user32.dll</code></pre> such as <pre><code>GetDlgItemTextA</code></pre> and <pre><code>GetDlgItemTextW</code></pre> since I believe they are the APIs used to read my entered serial number. The strange thing is that they are exported and not imported as demonstrated below. Is it normal?\n\nOnce I created the breakpoint and stated stepping into I got this exception again and I was forced to pass control to application and game over again. :(\n\nI was thinking it could be some basic Anti-debugging protections, so I enabled \"aadp4olly\" and \"Olly Advanced\" with many options but it was unable to solve the issues, so, I'm not so sure anymore about what is issue is.\nAll help and answers are very appreciated, but please, keep in mind that I'm a beginner.\n** UPDATED **\nHi All,\nThanks for your answer, but it doesn't solve the whole issue. Please, see details below.\nFirst I updated my PEid database from this link:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/reverse-engineering-scripts/downloads/detail?name=UserDB.TXT\nThe following screenshot demonstrates PE details:\nhttp://img444.imageshack.us/img444/8295/16pedetails.png\nHere are details about PE sections:\nLooks a bit strange for a not packed binary, right? But I can't figure out the correct packer.\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/5764/17pesections.png\nEntropy and and Fast Check say \"not packed\", but EP check points as packed:\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/6251/18epappearstobepacked.png\nHere is the original EP found:\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/990/19originalep.png\nRDG Packer Detector pointed that Obsidium protection was present, however I guess it's a false positive. See the unpacker failing to recognize the format:\nThe unpacker is available here: http://down.52pojie.cn/Tools/Unpackers/\nhttp://img29.imageshack.us/img29/7/20obsidiumunpackingfail.png\nAlso, the great Ferrit Anti-Anti-Debuggin script for OllyDB was not enough to allow me to debug it. Please, see below:\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/4352/21ferritantiantidebugis.png\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/8721/22ferritantiantidebugis.png\nFrom here I'm forced to pass control to application and I lost control of if as demonstrated on my first post. I tried to freeze all threads and just keep the main thread running but it continues to fail.\nResource Hacker is unable to read Delphi resources:\nhttp://img812.imageshack.us/img812/9861/23resourcehackerfailsto.png\nEven Resource Hacker FX fails because it says a new version Delphi was used to compile.\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/7538/24resourcehackerfxfails.png\nDelphi Decompiler also failed. First I tried attach to my target:\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/89/25dedeattachingtotarget.png\nOnce the analysis finished it found the Classes Info:\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/5935/26dedeloadedtarget.png\nBut the important thing are the \"Forms\" and \"Procedures\" and nothing was found:\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/986/27dedeisunabletofindany.png\nIDR (Interactive Delphi Reconstructor) also appears to be useless since the target application was compiled with Delphi 2011 or 2012 and no definition file is available for this version.\nIdeas? Suggestions?\nThanks again for your help and effort.\n** UPDATE **\n",

After DeDe completes its analysis, click on the \"Forms\" tab and you will see all event handlers associated with that form (OnClick  is likely what you are looking for here). With the name of the event handler, click on \"Procedures\" and find the event and you will see its address.\n\nFrom there, load your application in OllyDbg and set a breakpoint on the address of the event handler that you are interested in. This should put you near where the registration dialog is prompting you. The R4ndom tutorial can describe any necessary next steps from there.\n",

This way if an int3 is patched in at initial load, a reload will re-initialize the text section and remove your breakpoint.  \nIt has more intense applications, but this would be a simple one.\n",
