    "content": "I'm trying to call a function in a game that makes my character sending a message.\nI already called a few functions in this game but this one has a tricky parameter.\nThe function signature should be similar to this:\n<pre><code>void Game::talkChannel(Otc::MessageMode mode, int channelId, const std::string& message)\n</code></pre>\nThis is how I define it:\n<pre><code>typedef DWORD(__thiscall* _talkChannel)(DWORD localplayer, uintptr_t mode, uintptr_t channelId, const std::string& message);\n_talkChannel talkChannel;\ntalkChannel = (_talkChannel)(moduleBase + 0x79340);\n</code></pre>\nThis is how I call it:\n<pre><code>talkChannel(LocalPlayer, 1, 0, \"test\");\n</code></pre>\nHere's how the function looks normally:\n\nAnd this is how it looks if I call it from my dll:\n\nAs you can see it doesn't looks the same, and the result in game is my character sending this message:\n`ï¶test\nSo as I can see it will fill the message until 8 characters, and if I send more than 8 characters it won't send any message.\nTrying to send as a <pre><code>const char *</code></pre> made me explode my brain because it looks exactly the same as the original function call:\n\nBut nothing happens ingame, no message is sent, even the call looks identical to me in debugger...\nHow should I call that function with this tricky parameter?\nEDIT:\nCalling as const wchar_t* didn't work, but it's fun to see how it differs in debugger:\n",
