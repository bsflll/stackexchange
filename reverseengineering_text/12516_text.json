            "content": "The allocation for most executive objects (like semaphores) is done inside the <pre><code>ObCreateObject()</code></pre> function. As you can see in <pre><code>ObCreateObject()</code></pre>'s prototype, one of the parameters is <pre><code>ObjectSizeToAllocate</code></pre>.\nWhen a function like <pre><code>NtCreateSemaphore()</code></pre> is called, it calls <pre><code>ObCreateObject()</code></pre> with the size of the kernel object to be created (for example, <pre><code>sizeof(KSEMAPHORE)</code></pre>) as the value for <pre><code>ObjectSizeToAllocate</code></pre>.\nSo the easiest way to answer your question is to set a breakpoint on <pre><code>ObCreateObject()</code></pre> and examine the value of <pre><code>ObjectSizeToAllocate</code></pre> when it's called to create your object of interest.\n",
