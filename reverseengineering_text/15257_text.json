    "content": "I have a program written in c++, it's compiled with Visual Studio.\nI have a mini dump file of a running process (process generates it using winapi MiniDumpWriteDump function).\nI also have several memory addresses - they should correspond to addresses of my c++ functions/methods.\nI also have *.pdb file - debug information generated by Visual Studio during compilation of my program.\nNow I need to find out which functions correspond to the addresses.\nQuestion 1: Do I have enough data? Is minidump, *.pdb file and address is enough to find out function name (and it's location in source code)?\nQuestion 2: I need to automate this process. I will have to write a script (hope it will be a python script) which will do the job. Can anyone suggest appropriate python tools?\n(Originally I posted this question on stackoverflow, but looks like it's better suited here)\n",

If you only need to automate it but no particular requirements for programming it on your own, I would suggest just using windbg with some scripts (maybe PyKd framework).\n",
