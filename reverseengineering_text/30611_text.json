    "content": "I am trying to make a bot for a game. But when I open the game in debugger like Ollydbg or in x64dbg the game simply closes and also it doesn't appears in the Attach to the process list in File menu of debugger.\nI have a source code for a client that if is not the same is almost the same. Can it help?\nAnd if you guys can tell me steps to create a dll to inject on the client it would be awesome.\nhttps://joguewydbr.com/WYDBR2022.msi - this is the application I want to reverse.\nNote: Link will start download immediately.
