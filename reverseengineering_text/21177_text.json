Someone on stackoverflow has already asked about how to use pintool to print all executed instructions\nPANDA. This framework includes a plugin called <pre><code>PANDA_CB_INSN_TRANSLATE</code></pre> which is triggered prior to instruction translation and can be paired with <pre><code>PANDA_CB_INSN_EXEC</code></pre>\nThe DynamoRIO-based tool instrace. \"instrace\" is short for \"instruction trace\".\n",
