We expect answers to be supported by facts, references, or expertise, but this question will likely solicit debate, arguments, polling, or extended discussion. If you feel that this question can be improved and possibly reopened, visit the help center for guidance.\n                                \n                            \n\n\n\nClosed 12 years ago.\n\n\n\nI myself am a static analysis guy; I mostly gave up dynamic reverse engineering ten years ago.  So these days, my process is usually to locate where my input enters the module that I am interested in, and then perform heavy static analysis to determine how my input manipulates the state of the program.  I have found some neat bugs such as information disclosure this way; however, I am undoubtedly a lot slower than my counterparts who employ a lot of dynamic analysis and dynamic input generation (e.g., randomized fuzzing).  \nWhat steps do you usually take to discover vulnerabilities in closed-source programs?\n",

            "content": "This is how I typically do it, although it largely depends on the target/project and it's only how I like to do it myself:\n\nStart (probably dumb) fuzzing the application as soon as you have the target.\nMeanwhile, statically analyse the application in order to understand how it works and, maybe, to find low hanging fruit vulnerabilities.\nTry to understand if you can make any smarter your fuzzer once you have enough structures and functions discovered in IDA.\nIf you have a hit in your fuzzer, discover the root cause of the problem and if it could be exploitable. If it isn't, nevertheless, it's worth checking in deep the area where the crash happened as that crash is a probable indicator of an interesting area to focus on.\nIf you have a hit while doing static analysis, try to write a simple trigger for it.\nFocus on the part where the bug exists to continue statically analysing.\nOnce you have 1 true vulnerability found via either by fuzzing or statically analysis, write rules/scripts to find similar vulnerabilities.\nPossibly write an exploit for it and go back to 2.\nWhen tired of finding such vulnerabilities and after understanding the inner workings of the application, try to find logical flaws.\n\nPS: Reading documentation is also a good way to find some vulnerabilities, as well as reading change logs, diff patches, commit messages, etc... if you have access to source code (sometimes you can have partial access to the target's source code, even for closed source applications).\nJust my 2 cents.\n",
