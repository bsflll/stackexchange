    "content": "I am trying out following technique:\nhttps://github.com/CMUSTRUDEL/DIRTY\nThis is a deep learning approach for type and name recovery. It uses ida scripts to generate and preprocess the dataset.\nIt first requires me use IDA to generate the dataset.\n<pre><code>python3 generate.py --ida /path/to/idat64 -b BINARIES_DIR -o OUTPUT_DIR_Step1\n</code></pre>\nThis extracts function information from the dataset. After that, I have to run preprocessing scripts as follows (the instruction on their GitHub are incomplete).\n<pre><code># Inside the dirty directory.\n\npython -m utils.preprocess OUTPUT_PATH PATH_TO_DATASET_FILENAMES OUTPUT_DIR_Step1\n</code></pre>\nBut, the problem is that, the scripts don't take IDA path and they use <pre><code>idapython</code></pre> libraries such as <pre><code>ida_typeinf</code></pre>\nCheck - https://github.com/CMUSTRUDEL/DIRTY/blob/main/binary/dire_types.py\nHowever, if I run the above python script, as it lies outside the ida environment, gives me lib not found errors (because it can't see <pre><code>ida_typeinf</code></pre>).\nIs there any way to run this script within ida environment (that's what I believe is the issue, but I could be wrong). It is also possible that the above command <pre><code>python -m utils.preprocess OUTPUT_PATH PATH_TO_DATASET_FILENAMES OUTPUT_DIR_Step1</code></pre> may not be accurate and I need Ida command line to run that command. Note that I know how to run idat on individual binaries.\n",

Afaik, those libraries are meant to be used from inside since they're calling into the disassembler/decompiler API. Hence, it's sorta weird to run the python interpreter to use them directly.  You can run scripts from the UI with Alt+F7 (File -> Script File), or use the -S parameter from the commandline to explicitly run a script in IDA once it has loaded the database.\n",
