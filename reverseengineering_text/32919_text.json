    "content": "I'm trying to make some changes to an android app and to do so i decided to use smalisca to understand the code flow via graph, a function of said tool, but i can't make it work!\nI used a blackarch linux OVA since it comes preinstalled but everytime i try to analize an apk smali code extracted via apktool the sqlite DB created is empty (fixed size of 49152 byte but the tables are devoid of any data).\nTrying to search for any pattern is pointless since the tool always return \"no result\"\nBelow i show the instructions i use:\n\n<pre><code>smalisca parser -l /root/gmail/smali -s smali -f sqlite -o apk.sqlite</code></pre> using either <pre><code>/root/gmail/smali</code></pre> or <pre><code>/root/gmail</code></pre> doesn't change the output neither\n<pre><code>smalisca analyzer -i /root/apk.sqlite -f sqlite</code></pre>\n<pre><code>sc -c class_name -p a</code></pre> (most class are named alfter alphabet letters)\n\nThe tool didn't work neither when using a new apk or an old gmail apk (version 2.9.3 from apkmirror).\nSo i don't know what to do:\n\nAre my instruction correct or is there some error that impair the tool functions?\nIs the tool too old so is unusable now? If so, what alternative are there to help understand how the application works?\n",
