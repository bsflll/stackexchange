    "content": "Is it possible to use BinDiff to get the comparison score between two specific functions from the databases? By default BinDiff will automagically match functions, and then only output the comparison score between the function matches that it finds.\nI have an a priora candidate function match <pre><code>[func_i from database A, func_j from database B]</code></pre> and I want to get the BinDiff comparison score of this pair.\nBonus points if this can be batched and run from the command line, where I can provide a list of function pairs and get the BinDiff comparison score for each pair.\n",
