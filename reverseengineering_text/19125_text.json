    "content": "I've been trying for a while now to get my head around V-Tables, V-Table patching, etc, i understand what V-Tables are and why they are used (At least i think i do).\nBut how do i find them in IDA? I'm using IDA Pro 7.0, and i created a test program with two classes.\n<pre><code>class ClassA\n{\npublic:\n    ClassA();\n    ~ClassA();\n    virtual void Test();\n};\n</code></pre>\nAnd..\n<pre><code>class ClassB : public ClassA\n{\npublic:\n    ClassB();\n    ~ClassB();\n    void Test() override;\n};\n</code></pre>\nThe definition for the <pre><code>Test</code></pre> function in both cases is a simple <pre><code>cout</code></pre> to the console.\nAnd in <pre><code>main.cpp</code></pre>\n<pre><code>int main()\n{\n    ClassB* BClass = new ClassB();\n    while (1)\n    {\n        BClass->Test();\n        Sleep(1000);\n    }\n    delete BClass;\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\nI was trying to follow this explanation, but it seems as if the data isn't structured the same way in his version of IDA.\nAfter clicking on the class in the Class Informer window, i'm taken to IDA View-A, and this is what i see.\n\nAt this point i'm a bit lost, as i'm not really sure how to find or follow pointers in IDA.\n",

As you know, a VTable is a table of function pointers and as you can see, at address <pre><code>0x19B64</code></pre> you actually see a single function address (this looks like <pre><code>dd offset sub_XXXX</code></pre>). That is actually a virtual function table of a size of one. Since you only have one virtual function in your demo class. That offset points to one implementation of <pre><code>Test</code></pre>. Double-clicking the function name (which defaults to the function's address prefixed with <pre><code>sub_</code></pre> to indicate it is a subroutine) will set the cursor it it's address (and make it visible).\nSomewhat below that, at address <pre><code>0x19B8C</code></pre>, you can see the second class's vtable, as you have two classes with differing functions. That offset is the second implementation of <pre><code>Test</code></pre>\n",
