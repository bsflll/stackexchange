    "content": "Example file: https://imagej.net/nih-image/download/user-macros/Inclusion%20Counter/Inclusion%20Counter%20Manual%20v1.0.html\nNeedless to say, it is not an HTML file.\nFirst byte is 0x04, which it shares with several other files I have in this format. Otherwise there appears to be no common signature other than perhaps <pre><code>0039 0039 0039 0039 0039 0039</code></pre> at offset 22 and <pre><code>0002001C58B1000A</code></pre> at offset 88.\nIt appears to be a composite or container format that can include data in blocks, for example it can include plain text or image data in a variety of formats, such as GIF.\nI see many four-byte human-readable tags such as <pre><code>MLIP</code></pre>, <pre><code>DSET</code></pre>, <pre><code>FNTM</code></pre>, <pre><code>CUTS</code></pre>, <pre><code>DSUM</code></pre>, <pre><code>HDNI</code></pre>, <pre><code>STYL</code></pre>, <pre><code>8BIM</code></pre>, <pre><code>HASH</code></pre>, <pre><code>LKUP</code></pre>, <pre><code>NAME</code></pre>, <pre><code>CELL</code></pre>, <pre><code>RULR</code></pre>, <pre><code>GRPH</code></pre>, but I am unsure of their purpose, as they do not all seem to introduce blocks of embedded data. At the end of the file are two font names in plain text, <pre><code>Helvetica</code></pre> and <pre><code>Geneva</code></pre>.\nThe files are from a Macintosh environment in 2001 and 2002. Unfortunately their resource forks have not survived. I found them alongside Microsoft Excel files (Compound Documents format) and FileMaker Pro 5.x (or 6) files.\nI tried opening these files in Excel (also Word and PowerPoint) from MS Office 98 for Mac on a G3 running OS 9.2. No luck - \"unknown file format\" or something like that.\n",

            "content": "matja's answer cracked the case for me. My other files in this format replace the <pre><code>BOBO</code></pre> string with <pre><code>CWKJ</code></pre> which threw me off. Maybe I should have known that <pre><code>CWKJ</code></pre> stands for the Japanese version of ClarisWorks. I was able to open these <pre><code>CWKJ</code></pre> files in the Japanese version of AppleWorks 6 (running under the Japanese version of Mac OS 9.2 in a SheepShaver VM) and save them as AppleWorks 6 documents, then open them in LibreOffice as suggested by matja.\n",
