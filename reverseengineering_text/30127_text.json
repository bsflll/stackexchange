    "content": "I am trying to tell apart the following two instructions:\n<pre><code>8D 02      lea     eax, [rdx]  // auxfix = 0x1810\n67 8D 02   lea     eax, [edx]  // auxfix = 0x810\n</code></pre>\nThe only difference is in the insn_t.auxfix field, which seems to hold some operand size flag related to modr/m.\nAs you can see bit 1 << 12 seems to tell me something ... but how exactly can I interpret this field for x86 and x64?\n",
