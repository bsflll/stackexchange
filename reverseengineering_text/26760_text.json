    "content": "I am learning about parsing and editing mach-o files and I am stuck on particular issue.\nI am able to read the segments and sections within a binary which is a test iOS app written in Objective-C. I am looking for a way to replace the load method in a class with a stub method e.g my_load in another class within the same binary. Is there a way to do this? Any help would be much appreciated.\n",
