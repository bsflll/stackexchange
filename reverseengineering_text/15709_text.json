    "content": "Background\nIn my endeavor to RE my router, I'm trying to emulate a router's firmware inside a QEMU MIPS system. I have debian-mips installed to a virtual disk that runs just fine. Its a MIPS32 Big Endian system. I don't have any issue with the debian system. I have extracted the root file-system and uploaded it to the debian-mips system.\nIssue\nMy issue is when I attempt to run any of the binaries from the router firmware:\n<pre><code>root@debian-mips:~/firm# chroot . ./bin/busybox.old \n./bin/busybox.old: can't load library 'libcms_boardctl.so'\n</code></pre>\nHowever, I know it's there:\n<pre><code>root@debian-mips:~/firm# ls -l ./lib/public/\ntotal 1512\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root    7280 Jun 28 18:27 libcms_boardctl.so\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root   11320 Jun 28 18:27 libcms_msg.so\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root  148944 Jun 28 18:27 libcms_util.so\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 1083432 Jun 28 18:27 libcrypto.so.0.9.8\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root  275712 Jun 28 18:27 libssl.so.0.9.8\n</code></pre>\nMaybe my google-fu is lacking, but there is not much information on the internet about chrooting MIPS environments. Thank you for your time.\nEdit add'l file info:\n<pre><code>root@debian-mips:~/firm# file public/libcms_boardctl.so \npublic/libcms_boardctl.so: ELF 32-bit MSB shared object, MIPS, MIPS32 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, corrupted section header size\n</code></pre>\n",

If someone has more information why this happens please leave me a comment :)\n",
