    "content": "I'm trying to wire a Winbond W25Q128FV to my Rasberry Pi Model 1B so that I can dump the firmware. I'll be using an SOIC8 clip and probe cables.\nHere is what I'm thinking:\nFlash ----- rPi\nCS ----- CS0\nDO ----- MISO\nWP ----- ??\nGND ----- GND\nVCC ----- 3V3\nHOLD ----- ??\nCLK ----- SCLK\nDI ----- MOSI\nI've read that WP and HOLD/RESET should also be connected to 3V3, but there's only 2 3V3 pins on my pi?\n",
