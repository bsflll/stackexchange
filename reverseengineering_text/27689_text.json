    "content": "I've been trying to solve a crackme challenge by examining it's decompiled version by Ghidra.\nSo I figured the code where the <pre><code>strcmp</code></pre> is done as shown in the figure below. Now I need to to patch the program to make it print the password if <pre><code>strcmp</code></pre> fails.\n\nThe password is stored in <pre><code>local_40</code></pre>\n\nBut I don't know how to patch the instruction to print out the value at local_40\nInstead of <pre><code>MOV dword ptr [ESP],0x4b1050</code></pre> what variable in this instruction should be edited? If my understanding is correct then the above instruction is loading the ESP register with the value at <pre><code>0x4b1050</code></pre>\nso how will I get the address of <pre><code>local_40</code></pre>?\n",

You'll need to override some instructions before <pre><code>0x40151a</code></pre> as well, and therefore to point the <pre><code>JNZ</code></pre> accordingly.\n",
