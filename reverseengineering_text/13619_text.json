    "content": "We are trying to examine a firmware download for a product we have running on our local network.  Using the command\n<pre><code>binwalk -Me filename\n</code></pre>\nwe generated a folder that contains the following content:\n<pre><code>184A46C.cramfs\n276466C.cramfs\n6C.cramfs\nC2426C.cramfs\ncramfs-root/\ncramfs-root-0/\ncramfs-root-1/\ncramfs-root-2/\n</code></pre>\nBinwalk appears to have opened the CramFS just fine.  So navigating into cramfs-root and running the file command, we see the following:\n<pre><code>app.tar.lzma:    data\ncopy_logo:       data\ncramfs.img:      empty\ndvrCmd.tar.gz:   data\nhicore.tar.lzma: data\nhisi.tar.lzma:   data\nlogo.tar.lzma:   data\nmisc.tar.lzma:   data\nnew_10.bin:      data\nplayer.bin:      PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows, UPX compressed\nstart.sh:        data\nuImage:          u-boot legacy uImage, Linux-3.0.8, Linux/ARM, OS Kernel     Image (Not compressed), 2854980 bytes, Tue Apr 14 10:16:02 2015, Load Address: 0x80008000, Entry Point: 0x80008000, Header CRC: 0x6C502F38, Data     CRC: 0xE9307D6E\nversion:         ASCII text\nwebs.tar.lzma:   data\n</code></pre>\nOther than the uImage file, which apparently contains a linux kernel, most of the files here are apparently .tar.lzma files.  Attempting to open one of them as a normal .tar.lzma is not working for us.\n<pre><code>tar --lzma -xvf logo.tar.lzma\nxz: (stdin): File format not recognized\ntar: Child returned status 1\ntar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now\n</code></pre>\nTrying something else:\n<pre><code>unlzma logo.tar.lzma\nunlzma: Decoder error\n</code></pre>\nlzmainfo seems to think it is valid, however, but it is calculating it as a laughably large, multi-petabyte file.  I am quite sure it is not.\n<pre><code>lzmainfo logo.tar.lzma\n\nlogo.tar.lzma\nUncompressed size:             8351652399384 MB (8757342266336797407 bytes)\nDictionary size:               525 MB (2^29 bytes)\nLiteral context bits (lc):     0\nLiteral pos bits (lp):         2\nNumber of pos bits (pb):       4\n</code></pre>\nI've uploaded the file here if you care to look at it.\n",

Wouldn't it be possible to run the linux kernel in an emulator, and use the emulator to read the file system?  I opened the chassis, looked at the board, and googled the part numbers for chips I saw.  I didn't see any crypto devices on the board, so I'm going to assume that the decryption is implemented in the firmware image itself, in the plaintext portion.\n",
