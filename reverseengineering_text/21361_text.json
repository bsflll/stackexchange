    "content": "For a long time now, I've been struggling with some functions generated with IDA HexRays plugin that seem to be corrupted.\nSome of the decompiled generated plain C code, show as ASM code :/\ni.e:\n<pre><code>  sqrt(v4);\n  __asm\n  {\n    fstp    [esp+24h+var_C]\n    fld     [esp+24h+var_C]\n    fstp    [esp+24h+var_14]\n    fldz\n  }\n</code></pre>\nWhat could be the cause for this? possibly wrong stack pointers? I must admit that sometimes I also get the famous <pre><code>sp</code></pre> issue that I always fix by <pre><code>ALT + K</code></pre> and adjust the negative stack pointer, but the generated ASM code issue has happened to some functions before I even did that.\nNote that when I load the same executable into another IDA instance and go to that same function memory, the decompiled code looks fine, so I'm guessing some how the database instance I'm working on due to one of my changes(probably structures layout) made that function failed?\nIs there a way also fixing that so the generated code will look as plain C again?\nI already tried to <pre><code>undefine</code></pre> the corrupted function and re-analyze it, but the output code will still be as ASM.\nThanks in advance!\n",
