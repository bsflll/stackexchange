    "content": "I'm trying to RE an Android app that detects root on a system.\nUsing frida to backtrace 'access' calls I found out that the root check happens natively:\n<pre><code>access(/system/xbin/su, 0x0)\n\nInterceptor Backtrace: 0x7a9d8b12dc libnoncnliheopp.so!0x2a72dc\n    0x7a9d8b12dc libnoncnliheopp.so!0x2a72dc\n    0x7a9d8bd608 libnoncnliheopp.so!0x2b3608\n    0x7a9d8bf29c libnoncnliheopp.so!0x2b529c\n    0x7a9d7a66bc libnoncnliheopp.so!0x19c6bc\n    0x7a9d9a7aa4 libnoncnliheopp.so!0x39daa4\n    0x7a9d9aa1d0 libnoncnliheopp.so!JNI_OnLoad+0x24\n    0x7ab198a17c libart.so!_ZN3art9JavaVMExt17LoadNativeLibraryEP7_JNIEnvRKNSt3__112basic_stringIcNS3_11char_traitsIcEENS3_9allocatorIcEEEEP8_jobjectP7_jclassPS9_+0xd18\n    0x7aa7231170 libopenjdkjvm.so!JVM_NativeLoad+0x1a4\n    0x70c16a28 boot.oat!0x81a28\n    0x70c16a28 boot.oat!0x81a28\n\nretval: 0xffffffffffffffff\n</code></pre>\nI've looked into to the libnoncnliheopp.so and it looks scrambled, the address from the backtrace (0x2a72dc + ghidra base 0x100000) doesn't point to a function but something like a data block (see below). Since the app runs the root checks at startup it's difficult to hook it.\n\nFrida code\nWhat's the best way to continue?\n",

Although frida is so nice to calculate the non-ASLR address there is still a base address included. I would first check if Ghidra uses the same base address (here called image base). If the so file is compressed/packed you could try to dump the library from memory\n",
