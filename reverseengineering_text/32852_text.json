    "content": "I've been attempting to dive into mediaserverd which runs on iOS.  Pulling the binary and running <pre><code>otool -L</code></pre> on it reveals, unsurprisingly, that it's linked against <pre><code>/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreMedia.framework/CoreMedia</code></pre>.  However, that directory on the phone doesn't have any file called <pre><code>CoreMedia</code></pre>.  In fact, all it has are two <pre><code>.plist</code></pre> files and some text file called <pre><code>CodeResources</code></pre>.\nWhere is the actual Mach-O file for the CoreMedia framework?\n",
