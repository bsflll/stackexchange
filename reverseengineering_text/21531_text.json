In general there are only a handful of practical ways to implement the handling of hotkeys. But depending on whether this is dialog-based or not, details can differ. Possible ways (from the top of my head): <pre><code>SetWindowsHookEx</code></pre>, <pre><code>GetAsyncKeyState</code></pre>, <pre><code>RegisterHotKey</code></pre>\n",

I can see the window in resource editor (I use Restorator app) and my friend pretty sure this window activates by some combination on keyboard.

After finding it, just look at the subsequent functions calls and you will probably find the function responsible for handling the information provided by <pre><code>GetKeyboardState</code></pre> function, thus checking whether the keys being pressed match one of the program keyboard shortcuts.\nNote:\n<pre><code>OllyDbg</code></pre> uses this method, as shown on the picture below (yes, it's a picture of <pre><code>OllyDbg</code></pre> debugging itself ;) ):\n\nAs you may notice, it firstly converts it to <pre><code>ASCII</code></pre> code and then performs some checks.\n",
