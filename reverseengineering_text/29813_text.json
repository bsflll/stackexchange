    "content": "I don't want to get too much into detail, but a disastrous chain of events that began with a boolean of incorrect size forced the IDA analyzer to discard a lot of instruction sections of many functions.\nHere is what I mean:\n\nI'm slowly fixing everything up and so there is no problem with that. My question is: Is there a way to list every instruction not inside of a function in IDA? Just so I don't leave some of them without a fix.\n",
