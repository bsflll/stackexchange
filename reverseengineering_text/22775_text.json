    "content": "i am looking to expand my knowledge so i can someday(hopefully within few months) be able to join the reverse engineering community, probably in the anti-virus/defense field.\ni was wondering, since it is not easy to find information regarding those topics: is there a book(preferably modern) or a course that teaches important and vital subjects such as detour and code injections? i am really enthusiastic with this field and i really eager to study as much as possible to improve and be efficient so i could help a lot of people in this important field.\nhowever, sadly, after many searches, i found it to be extremely hard to locate information on those subjects, let alone modern information. so i'd like to request your help with it.\np.s: if no book/course available, even resources on the web will be gems to me.\n",

            "content": "Detouring is more or less a patching of the <pre><code>.text</code></pre> section inside of a program. It's practically more or less hacking, you're rerouting a program to do what you want it to do with your own function. Usually by placing the opcode <pre><code>0xE9</code></pre> (known as <pre><code>JMP</code></pre>, also added with some <pre><code>0x90</code></pre> which is <pre><code>NOP</code></pre>, for alignment) inside of the memory address you're detouring, that <pre><code>JMP</code></pre>s to your personal function you wrote.\nI recommend reading up on x86 Assembly, along with detouring itself. It's a pretty basic topic once you get it down, but it's definitely a struggle to start learning.\nResources to get you started:\nDetour Video by Guide\nVirginia EDU for x86 Assembly\n",
