My friend found some zlib data (see 1), but I could not find these zlib data items (see 2).\nI don't understand what is wrong, however I use <pre><code>binwak -e</code></pre> in the same way. I'm so confuse. \nMy question is: how can I find the zlib data?\nThanks.\n",

            "content": "The differences between the binwalk results may be caused by the different version of the binwalk you use. So, check the version of your binwalk by simply running binwalk without any parameter.\nRegarding to the firmware, you cannot unpack the content using binwalk. To see why, check the start of the firmware. You will find a <pre><code>0x20</code></pre> bytes header starting with the <pre><code>DLA50</code></pre> string. This magic string and the header is repeated at offset <pre><code>0x4020</code></pre>, <pre><code>0x8040</code></pre> and so on. To see the structure of the header, check the following one from the middle of the firmware file:\n\nI marked the magic string (DLA50) with yellow, the position of the fragment with green and the size of the fragment with blue.\nThe following script can follow the headers and extract the parts from the image:\n<pre><code>import struct\nimport binascii\nimport sys\n\nif (len(sys.argv) < 2):\n    print 'firm.py filename'\n    sys.exit(0)\n\nid = 0\nlast = 0\nidh = None\n\nbf = open(sys.argv[1], 'rb')\nwhile(True):\n    h = bf.read(0x20)\n    if (len(h) < 0x20 or h[0:5] != 'DLA50'):\n        break\n    dpos = struct.unpack('L', h[0x14:0x18])[0]\n    dsize = struct.unpack('L', h[0x18:0x1c])[0]\n    print '%s, pos: %x, size: %x'%(binascii.hexlify(h), dpos, dsize)\n    d = bf.read(dsize)\n\n    if (last != 0x4000):\n        if (idh != None):\n            idh.close()\n        idh = open('%d.bin'%(id), 'wb')\n        id += 1\n\n    idh.write(d)\n    last = dsize\n\nidh.close()\n</code></pre>\nThe above script will extract the following parts:\n\n<pre><code>0-0x2865b</code></pre>: Executable code, may be compressed with LZMA, LZO or something similar\n<pre><code>0x286d7-0x56f60</code></pre>: File system, the individual files are also compressed\n<pre><code>0x56f60-0x5bdc0</code></pre>: Possibly a configuration area\n\nThe first part is starting with a <pre><code>0x10</code></pre> bytes header followed by a high entropy data. The header contains some flags or magic bytes and a data size, which I marked with blue in the next image. I can identify the size data item based on the size of the first part, which is <pre><code>0x28555 = header size + 0x28545</code></pre>.\n\nThe next part starts with the following bytes:\n\nThe area started at <pre><code>0x60</code></pre> seems to contain file names, such as <pre><code>501h1_uk.js</code></pre> and so on, along with other binary data. So, this area may contain file entries. If it is true, the previous data (<pre><code>0x00</code></pre>-<pre><code>0x60</code></pre>) is a directory entry or a header. In this header area, you can found some interesting value in little-endian byte order. The <pre><code>0x0002e709</code></pre> (marked with blue) is equal with the file size. The <pre><code>0x00000060</code></pre> (marked with yellow) may point to the start of the file entries. The <pre><code>0x00000d48</code></pre> (marked with red) after the file entry offset may be another offset inside the file. So, after checking that offset in the file, it see that it points right after the directory entries, so it may by the starting offset of the data area.\nWe have some guesses about the structure of the header, so let's check the file entries. If we suppose, that file names are started at the same position always inside a file entry, then we can calculate the size of one entry by subtracting the offset of two consecutive file names. Based on this calculation the file entry size will be <pre><code>0x16</code></pre> bytes.\nSimilarly to the previous steps, after a little more research, we can conclude that the file entry area starts with the count of the files and every file entry contains the file name, file flags, relative position of the file data and the file size.\nPutting all together, the following script can extract the files from the second part of the firmware file:\n<pre><code>import struct\nimport sys\n\nif (len(sys.argv) < 2):\n    print 'parse_fs.py filename'\n    sys.exit(0)\n\nfh = open(sys.argv[1],'rb')\nh = fh.read(0x60)\nfs_size = struct.unpack('L', h[0x08:0x0c])[0]\noffset = struct.unpack('L', h[0x20:0x24])[0]\ndata_start = struct.unpack('L', h[0x24:0x28])[0]\n\nprint 'fs size: %x, dir offset: %x, data start: %x'%(fs_size, offset, data_start)\n\nfh.seek(offset)\nds = data_start-offset\nd = fh.read(ds)\ncount = struct.unpack('H', d[0:2])[0]\nfor i in xrange(count):\n    o = i*0x16+2\n    unk1 = struct.unpack('H', d[o+0x00:o+0x02])[0]\n    fname = d[o+0x02:o+0x0e]+'\\x00'\n    fname = fname[0:fname.find('\\x00')]\n    unk2 = struct.unpack('H', d[o+0x0e:o+0x10])[0]\n    pos = struct.unpack('L', d[o+0x10:o+0x14])[0]+data_start\n    size = struct.unpack('H', d[o+0x14:o+0x16])[0]\n    print '  %s, pos: %x, size: %x, unk1: %x, unk2: %x'%(fname, pos, size, unk1, unk2)\n\n    fh.seek(pos)\n    open('fs_%s'%(fname), 'wb').write(fh.read(size))\n</code></pre>\n",
