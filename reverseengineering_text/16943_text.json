Is this correct or am i way off?\n",

            "content": "Yes, that seems correct. The equivalent C code would look something like:\n<pre><code>int func(int *arg1, int *arg2)\n{\n    int temp = *arg1;\n    *arg1 = *arg2;\n    *arg2 = temp;\n    return *arg1 + *arg2;\n}\n</code></pre>\nThe use of stack-based storage indexed off of <pre><code>rbp</code></pre> is what we called local storage. We can give each use a name to make it easier to see what is going on. Let's call the value at <pre><code>rbp-0x18</code></pre> local_arg1, <pre><code>rbp-0x20</code></pre> local_arg2 and <pre><code>rbp-0x4</code></pre> local_temp. By calling convention, <pre><code>rdi</code></pre> is the first argument to the function and <pre><code>rsi</code></pre> is the second.\nAdding comments where pointer dereferencing is occurring, the disassembly is then\n<pre><code>push   %rbp\nmov    %rsp,%rbp         \nmov    %rdi,local_arg1\nmov    %rsi,local_arg2\nmov    local_arg1,%rax\nmov    (%rax),%eax        ; dereference the pointer i.e. eax = *arg1\nmov    %eax,local_temp\nmov    local_arg2,%rax\nmov    (%rax),%edx        ; edx = *arg2\nmov    local_arg1,%rax\nmov    %edx,(%rax)        ; *arg1 = edx\nmov    local_arg2,%rax\nmov    local_temp,%edx\nmov    %edx,(%rax)        ; *arg2 = edx\nmov    local_arg1,%rax\nmov    (%rax),%edx        ; edx = *arg1\nmov    local_arg2,%rax\nmov    (%rax),%eax        ; eax = *arg2\nadd    %edx,%eax\npop    %rbp\nretq  \n</code></pre>\n",
