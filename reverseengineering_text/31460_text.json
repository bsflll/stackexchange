    "content": "I'm reversing engineering an app and after analyzing with man-in-the-middle, I find that it obfuscates its messages to the server so it looks like a gibberish.\n<pre><code>String stc = (\"msg=\" + URLEncoder.encode(m20b.m60c(C22d.f54b), \"UTF-8\"));\n</code></pre>\nthe fuction which obfuscates the messages is m20b.m60c and I need to log the string to the console without it. The problem is that the editable code is in Smali, a very difficult lower level language. Everything I tried so far made the app crash.\n...\n<pre><code>invoke-direct {v1}, Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;-><init>()V\n\n    const-string v2, \"msg=\"\n    invoke-virtual {v1, v2}, Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;->append(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;\n\n    sget-object v2, Lc/b/a/a;->b:Ljava/lang/String;\n\n    invoke-static {v2}, Lc/b/a;->c(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;\n\n    move-result-object v2\n\n    const-string v3, \"UTF-8\"\n\n    invoke-static {v2, v3}, Ljava/net/URLEncoder;->encode(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;\n\n    move-result-object v2\n\n    invoke-virtual {v1, v2}, Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;->append(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;\n\n    invoke-virtual {v1}, Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;->toString()Ljava/lang/String;\n\n    move-result-object v1\n\n    new-instance v2, Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;\n\n    invoke-direct {v2}, Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;-><init>()V\n\n    invoke-virtual {v2, v1}, Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;->append(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;\n</code></pre>\n",

            "text": "If you want to continue using apktool/Smali my recommendation is to use AndroidStudio to create a dummy app that contains a static method like <pre><code>myLog(String)</code></pre> that logs the argument to logcat. Compile the app and decompile it using apktool and you can copy the method into the class you modify. Then you only have to add an <pre><code>invoke-static</code></pre> to call this method using the desired argument you want to log.\n",
