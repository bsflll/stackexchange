    "content": "I wanted to debug an executable but I always receive one of the errors 'last or first chance' exception. The 'last error' label shows me this error : <pre><code>00000008 (ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY)</code></pre>. When I run the executable without any debugger I always have enough memory.\nOllydbg breaks before I can even debug.\nx64dbg breaks while debugging.\nWith ollydbg I have used the 32bit executable of the program.\nThe OPc looks like this:\n<pre><code>00007FF6A179B097 | int3                                    |\n00007FF6A179B098 | sub rsp,48                              |\n00007FF6A179B09C | lea rcx,qword ptr ss:[rsp+20]           |\n00007FF6A179B0A1 | call <executable>.7FF6A0C58980          |\n00007FF6A179B0A6 | lea rdx,qword ptr ds:[7FF6A230CE80]     |\n00007FF6A179B0AD | lea rcx,qword ptr ss:[rsp+20]           |\n00007FF6A179B0B2 | call <executable>.7FF6A17CC4EC          |\n00007FF6A179B0B7 | int3                                    | <-\n</code></pre>\nBut I guess this isn't any help. We just know that the last call produces this error ?!\nEDIT: I have 12 gb of ram.\nRegards\n",

You have a few options to deal with it:\n\nFind and disable (NOP / jump-over / etc.) the anti-debugging code.\nTry to hide your debugger (manually or by using a stealthing plugin).\nRun your program without a debugger, and then after it's up and running, attach to it with your debugger.\n\nOption #1 requires the most effort, but is guaranteed to work.\nOption #2 can save time over Option #1, but can involve a lot of trial-and-error.\nOption #3 is the easiest option, IMHO, as long as you don't need to debug your target from its entry point. It assumes that the anti-debugging code only executes at the very beginning of the program, which is typically a safe assumption.\n",
