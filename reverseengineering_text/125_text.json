            "content": "I'll answer this in two parts, #1 is relatively easy, #2 impossible to the level which I'm assuming you want.\n1. Extracting the hex code from the Uno:\nWhile the specifics will depend on the revision of the Uno that you have, you'll want to use avrdude (available for linux, bundled with the OS X Arduino software) and a command similar to the following that would extract the information from an ATmega168:\n<pre><code>avrdude -F -v -pm168 -cstk500v1 -P/dev/ttyUSB0 -b19200 -D -Uflash:r:program.bin:r\n</code></pre>\nLook at the avrdude documentation to match the part parameter <pre><code>-p</code></pre> specific to your device (or post them and we can go from there).\nSince it appears that you have the Uno Rev3, that board has an ATmega328 (<pre><code>-pm328</code></pre>).  The programmer \"communicates using the original STK500 protocol\" thus the communication protocol flag <pre><code>-c</code></pre> should be <pre><code>-cstk500v1</code></pre> the command you would need (assuming the Uno is connected to /dev/ttyUSB0) follows:\n<pre><code>avrdude -F -v -pm328p -cstk500v1 -P/dev/ttyUSB0 -b19200 -D -Uflash:r:program.bin:r\n</code></pre>\nNext up your second question.\n2. Converting Hex code to original source:\nSorry, but that's not possible. While you can get some hex to c \"decompilers\" the gibberish returned, while functionally correct, will not be human readable (some commercial ones, like Hex-Rays, might give you some level of human-readability).\nWith that said, you're best bet would be a hex to assembly translator/converter - which will still only give you a better picture of what's happening, but will still be (by definition) very low level. All variable names, comments etc would be stripped and you're still going to be left with not knowing the original source program contents - just the compiled result.\nSince you're dealing with an Atmel device you could try to use the avr specific gcc toolchain <pre><code>avr-gcc</code></pre>. Specifically, you'll need <pre><code>avr-objdump</code></pre> using the needed MCU type flag <pre><code>-m atmega328</code></pre> (avr5) architecture (Full List of Available Architectures, MCU types)\n<pre><code>avr-objdump -s -m atmega328 program.hex > program.dump\n</code></pre>\nIt is also possible, depending on your configuration, that providing the architecture type itself (avr5) would be sufficient:\n<pre><code>avr-objdump -s -m avr5 program.hex > program.dump\n</code></pre>\n",
