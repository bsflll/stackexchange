    "content": "I've been trying to modify a data file within an app which has random lines of readable text but is mostly incomprehensible, it has no file extension.\nI think its compressed because I was able to find an older version of the same data file [same name, same location in game files] which has a much larger file size and is in plain text.\nBy default in the game files, the encrypted/compressed version is used but if I replace it with the older version it still works[all changes between them are however not present], this makes me think that the game does some sort of check to see if the file is compressed then decompresses it if appropriate.\nWhat can potentially be done to decompress the current data file, or if its not compressed to convert it to plain text.\nThanks.\nEdit 1:\nHere are links to the original data files:\ncompressed\nuncompressed older version\nThanks Gordon Freeman.\n",
