    "content": "It's something that puzzle me for a long time. I can observe that there is a difference between the real execution of a program and the <pre><code>gdb</code></pre>-controlled one.\nBut, here is an example:\n\nFirst, here is the example code (we use an automatic variable to get the location of the stack):\n<pre><code>#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main ()\n{\n  char c = 0;\n\n  printf (\"Stack address: %p\n\", &c);\n\n  return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n</code></pre>\nThen, we disable the ASLR (we use the personality flags of the process and not the system-wide method through <pre><code>/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space</code></pre>):\n<pre><code>$> setarch `uname -m` -R /bin/bash\n</code></pre>\nThen, get a run in the real memory environment:\n<pre><code>Stack address: 0x7fffffffe1df\n</code></pre>\nAnd, the same through <pre><code>gdb</code></pre>:\n<pre><code> (gdb) r\n Starting program: ./gdb-against-reality\n Stack address: 0x7fffffffe17f\n [Inferior 1 (process 5374) exited normally]\n (gdb) \n</code></pre>\n\nSo, here we have a difference of 96 bytes between the two runs. But, how can I predict this difference for a given program without having it running in the real memory layout (just by knowing the <pre><code>gdb</code></pre> memory layout) ?\nAnd, also, from where/what is coming this difference ?\n",

            "content": "There could be other factors involved, but my guess would be that changes in the process environment variables, which are stored on the stack, are what's causing this issue.\nRunning a small program that just prints out the environment variables reveals a couple variations in environment variables when run inside vs outside gdb on my system.\n<pre><code>int main(int argc, char **argv, char** envp)\n{\n  char** env;\n  for (env = envp; *env != 0; env++)\n  {\n    char* thisEnv = *env;\n    printf(\"%s\n\", thisEnv);    \n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\nFirst, when running under gdb, there is a LINES variable that isn't present when the process is started outside of gdb:\n<pre><code>LINES=83\n</code></pre>\nSecondly, the underscore environment variable is different. When running outside of gdb, it is set to the name of the executable:\n<pre><code>_=./gdbtest\n</code></pre>\nBut when started from inside gdb, it is set to the path of the gdb binary:\n<pre><code>_=/usr/bin/gdb\n</code></pre>\nYou can try to run the program normally, then attach to it with gdb/gdbserver, which should avoid these variations in environment variables (assuming that is in fact what is causing your problem).\nIf your process is short-lived, it can be hard to pause the process before it exits. Maybe someone else has some good suggestions on starting a process in a paused state; I usually use a second program like this one to catch the process as it is starting and pause it so I can attach a debugger to it.\n",

Note that you still have to take care of the <pre><code>_</code></pre> variable.\nOne can also generate a memory core of the vulnerable program and analyze it with <pre><code>gdb</code></pre>:\n<pre><code>$> gdb vuln_program core\n</code></pre>\nYou should just look at the memory and never <pre><code>run</code></pre>, <pre><code>next</code></pre>, <pre><code>step</code></pre>, ... because doing so will force you to restart the program with a fresh memory (with the shift).\n\nThat was two methods you can use with <pre><code>gdb</code></pre> to follow a program without too much differences with the real execution.
