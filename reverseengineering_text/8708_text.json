    "content": "I am reversing a few modules which share many c++ classes.  I am currently maintaining a single header file which contains every struct definition from each database.  I update this using a produced header file after working on a module.  I then import it when I begin working on a separate module.  This approach is error prone, and I have lost some progress by mistakenly overwriting modified structs in different databases.\nIs it possible to configure IDA Pro to read and write to a single struct definition file across multiple databases?    If not, what would be a best practice for this type of situation?\n",
