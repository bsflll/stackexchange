    "content": "I have thousands of old backup files from EaseUs Todo Backup. They are incremental backups saved inside a \".pbd\" file (EaseUs's proprietary backup format). I've tried to get my files out using their official tools, but they dont work due to the amount of files I have. I want to write my own program to take these files out and extract them to a more common format like .zip.\nI figure I'd start by using their software to backup a simple text file (with contents \"hello world\"), then change that text file to \"hello world123\" and run another incremental backup. This way I can compare the two initial files to see where the file names/contents are stored within the binary.\nHere are the two test files: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/6fhqrkodz68vgv0/backups.zip\nScreenshot of files: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/a4pui0hugym10xq/explorer_sWDcZaogNa.png\nWhen I compare the two files in a hex editor, I can't seem to find where the names/contents are, and how I can parse these files in software. This is the first time I've reverse engineered anything native (I've decompiled java/c# a bunch) so any tips/advice are appreciated.\n",
