    "content": "I have come across the following x86 (Built with some version of Visual Studio AFAIK) switch statement:\n<pre><code>0x1009E476  cmp edx, 0x3B\n0x1009E479  jnz switch_statement\n\nswitch_statement:\n0x1009E591  movzx ecx, byte [indirect_table+edx]\n0x1009E598  jmp dword [table1+ecx*4]\n\nindirect_table:\n0x1009E7AB  db 0x07, 0x07, 0x07, 0x07, 0x07, 0x07, 0x07, 0x07\n            db 0x07, 0x07, 0x06, 0x8B, 0xFF\n\ntable1:\n0x1009E7B8  dd ptr code1\n            dd ptr code2\n            dd ptr code3\n            dd ptr code4\n            dd ptr code5\n            dd ptr code6\n            dd 0x00000000 \n0x1009E7D4  dd 0x01060600, 0x06020606, 0x06060306, 0x06060606 ; Note: nothing directly references this data.\n            dd 0x06040606, 0x06060606, 0x06060606, 0x06060606\n            dd 0x06060606, 0x06060606, 0x06060606, 0x06060606\n            dd 0x06060606, 0x06060606, 0x06060606, 0x06060606\n            dd 0x06060606\n</code></pre>\nNo index in the <pre><code>indirect_table</code></pre> will end up referencing any of the 6 pointers in <pre><code>table1</code></pre>. Index 6 will dereference a null pointer, index 7 will dereference <pre><code>0x01060600</code></pre> and indexes <pre><code>0x8B</code></pre> and <pre><code>0xFF</code></pre> will end up dereferencing garbage. So everything will end up access violating.\nSo perhaps this is a compiler optimization, the data at table1 following the 6 code pointers and 1 null pointer looks like an indirect table, and coincidentally all indexes are suitable for this switch statement (0-6). While the binary has no references to this data, if <pre><code>EBX</code></pre> was known to be <pre><code>0x29</code></pre> or upwards, it would reference into this. The compiler may have decided <pre><code>EBX</code></pre> will not be <pre><code>0</code></pre>-<pre><code>0x29</code></pre> so moved the indirect table location backwards to line things up correctly. What then is the role of <pre><code>cmp edx, 0x3B</code></pre> in this?\nIs this a compiler code gen issue, a compiler optimization, or have I grossly misunderstood the code? \nIf an optimization, any supporting reading material would be greatly appreciated.\n",

            "content": "Either there is a check somewhere before, or the compiler knows otherwise that <pre><code>edx</code></pre> is not less than 41 (0x29). 0x3B is probably handled by a single switch label, so the compiler added this check to avoid the double memory lookup (or maybe there's an actual <pre><code>if</code></pre> before <pre><code>switch</code></pre> in the source).\nThe table at 0x1009E7D4 is used to retrieve the jump table entry index - Visual C++ compiler always puts the indirect table after the jumps. 0x1009E7AB is likely a part of the previous switch's indirect table. And <pre><code>8B FF</code></pre> is <pre><code>mov edi, edi</code></pre>, used here for alignment.\nThis specific optimization (no subtraction for zero-indexing) seems to be pretty rare; I think I've only seen it in Windows DLLs which often use PGO and other tricks to achieve the last few percents of performance.\n",
