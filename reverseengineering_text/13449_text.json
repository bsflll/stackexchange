    "content": "I need to determine whether an IDA's item is code or data.\nSometimes, data resides in an executable's code section (virtual functions tables, switch tables and stuff).\nSo in IDA, you can sometimes see this stuff in the code section:\n<pre><code>.text:100A1424     aInternetfreepr db 'InternetFreeProxyInfoList',0\n.text:100A1424                                             ; DATA XREF: .text:10038688o\n.text:100A143E                     align 10h\n.text:100A1440     aInternetfreeco db 'InternetFreeCookies',0 ; DATA XREF: .text:10038680o\n.text:100A1454     aInternetfortez db 'InternetFortezzaCommand',0\n.text:100A1454                                             ; DATA XREF: .text:10038678o\n</code></pre>\nis there a method I can call to defer between code and data using only the EA?\nThanks in advance.\n",

A small excerpt:\n<pre><code>#define isCode(F)       ((F & MS_CLS) == FF_CODE) // is code byte?\n#define isData(F)       ((F & MS_CLS) == FF_DATA) // is data byte?\n#define isTail(F)       ((F & MS_CLS) == FF_TAIL) // is tail byte?\n#define isUnknown(F)    ((F & MS_CLS) == FF_UNK)  // is unexplored byte?\n#define isHead(F)       ((F & FF_DATA) != 0)      // is start of code/data?\n</code></pre>\nYou can use this from Python like so:\n<pre><code>ea = ScreenEA()\nflags = GetFlags(ea)\n\nif isData(flags):\n    print(\"It's data!\")\n\nelif isCode(flags):\n    print(\"It's code!\")\n</code></pre>\n",
