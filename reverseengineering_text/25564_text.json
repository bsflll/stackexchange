    "content": "So I got this app loaded in x64, there is a function, let's say\n\"HeatGainedPerShot\", which is basically the value which an object gains everytime it fires,\nSuch a value would normally exist in the code, but as this is C++, it is simply impossible to revert to source code, thus leading me to a debugger,\nSo I found it, well.. the debugger displays many leading to the same adress, but that's for later.\n<pre><code>0000000140201A9D | 48:8D0D FC7FFF02       | lea rcx,qword ptr ds:[1431F9AA0]      |00000001431F9AA0:\"FireMode.HeatPerShot\"\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see\nrcx is what contains it,\nIs there a way to do math on it? or change it to a zero,\n\nproof of concept:::\nlea 0,qword ptr ds:[1431F9AA0]\nor\nlea rcx*0,qword ptr ds:[1431F9AA0]\n\nI know it doesn't work, but would it not be possible to do something like that?\n( https://i.sstatic.net/Glihs.png )\n",

In the latter case you can try patching the instruction with something like <pre><code>4831c9 xor rcx, rcx</code></pre> that will zero the value of <pre><code>rcx</code></pre> register which will be used later in the code.\n",
