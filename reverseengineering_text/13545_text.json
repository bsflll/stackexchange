Of course you can do it in one step also.\nEDIT\nYou can send files via netcat with 2 easy steps.\n\nStart netcat in your PC in listening mode to receive data and save\nthe data to a file \n<pre><code>nc -l -p 1337 >mtd0.bin</code></pre>\nStart netcat in the embedded device to send the data to your PC \n<pre><code>nc ip_address 1337 </tmp/mtd0</code></pre>\n",

We use it together with <pre><code>lsz</code></pre> command from <pre><code>lrzsz</code></pre> package, to update the bootloader.\nI cannot see any support for sending files, but with good understanding of the *modem protocol, you could emulate proper string to activate minicom's file transfer and send whole file to your computer.\n<pre><code>u-boot => help loady\nloady - load binary file over serial line (ymodem mode)\n\nUsage:\nloady [ off ] [ baud ]\n- load binary file over serial line with offset 'off' and baudrate 'baud'\n</code></pre>\nThe second solution might be enabling minicom's logging to file, print the whole memory region with u-boot's <pre><code>md</code></pre> command, and then parse the log file with a script to convert from ascii to real bytes.\n",
