However, it gives me the following error: <pre><code>This type of output files is not supported.</code></pre>\nWhat is this option for? What is possible usage of it?\n",

In a nutshell, it doesn't work for most file types...\n-- The IDA Pro Book, Chapter 14\n\nThat chapter goes into more detail why this option is not very useful. For starters, IDA doesn't parse and save contents of sections such as <pre><code>.rsrc</code></pre>, and doesn't have a way to rebuild import/export tables back into their original format.\nRead this book. Not just for this question, it's a good and useful read.\n",
