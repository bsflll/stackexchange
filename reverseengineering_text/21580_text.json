    "content": "How can I get the same behavior as in gdb when using disassemble-next-line on?\nWhen I step in radare2, I just see:\n<pre><code>[0x7fea91263220]> ds\n[0x7fea91263220]> ds\n[0x7fea91263220]> ds\n</code></pre>\nWhy doesn't it increment? How do I get it to show what instruction it is at?\n",
