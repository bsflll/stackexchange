    "content": "I am trying to dump a hasp dongle on a popular arcade machine. I can only get a portion with the game not running. If I ctrl alt del while game is already running I get a memory crash. What is the best way to proceed? Is there a way to get my dumper or even a cmd window forced to the front? Arcade game uses windows XP sp3.\n",

It will allow you to change the z-order of the application automatically, by calling SetWindowPos with HWND_BOTTOM as the parameter. \nThis will send the topmost window to the bottom of the z-order and you should be able to place new windows above it.\nYou need to identify the window handle of the topmost application (if you know the title of the application window, you can use FindWindow), or you can find the window handle by using EnumWindows and GetWindowModuleFileName\nThis will require you to be able to execute an application on startup. However since you said you are able to edit the registry you could put this executable on the system and set it to run at user logon, shortly after the launch of the application you are interested in.\n",

Then compare it to the known path to the executable you are expecting. If you have a match, then you know you have the correct Window handle. Then you can pass it to SetWindowsPos with HWND_BOTTOM parameter. You'll have to modify the linked C# example (or write your own application) to accomplish this.</span>",

The particular dumper that is working for me is GUI only as far as I can tell. I looked for command line options but did not find any. That would be too easy lol. I will check out this Autoit. If its capable of selecting drop down menus, entering text fields (for keys) and hitting the dump button that would be nice</span>",
