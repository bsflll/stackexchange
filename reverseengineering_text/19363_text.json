            "content": "The difference is that the first address, <pre><code>0x00602090</code></pre> is the location from where the value will be loaded into the <pre><code>rax</code></pre> register. The second one, <pre><code>0x400c60</code></pre> is what is located in that memory location. r2 is giving you hints about the actual result might be in the comments. It also informs you that 8 byte will be used for the operation with the <pre><code>:8</code></pre> suffix.\nSo it looks like that at address <pre><code>0x602090</code></pre> there's a 8-byte value stored that constitutes as an address <pre><code>0x400c60</code></pre>.\n",
