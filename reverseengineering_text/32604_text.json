    "content": "I want to play with reverse engineering the Apple Neural Engine driver, which is a kernel extensions (<pre><code>com.apple.driver.AppleH11ANEInterface</code></pre>). These used to be in <pre><code>/System/Library/Extensions/</code></pre>, but on my M1 MacBook Pro with Sonoma (14.2.1) the <pre><code>Extensions</code></pre> directory doesn't include the binaries themselves, only metadata and resources.\nInstead, all kext binaries are all bundled together in <pre><code>/System/Volumes/Preboot/<...>/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kernelcaches/kernelcache</code></pre>, as verified by <pre><code>kmutil inspect -v --bundle-identifier com.apple.driver.AppleH11ANEInterface</code></pre>.\nHow can I extract the binaries out of <pre><code>kernelcache</code></pre> file? Specifically I'm looking for the <pre><code>AppleH11ANEInterface</code></pre> binary.\nThe kernelcache file seems to be a IMG4 format, but existing tools like pyimg4 are failing to extract it.\nThanks\n",
