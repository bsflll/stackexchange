    "content": "I have a piece a malware to analyze. It is a DLL according to the <pre><code>IMAGE_FILE_HEADER->Characteristics</code></pre>. I was trying to do some dynamic analysis on it. I have done the following:\n\nRun it with <pre><code>rundll32.exe</code></pre>, by calling its exports. Nothing.\nChanged the binary's characteristics to an exe. Nothing.\n\nSo I moved on to static analysis, Loaded on IDA and OllyDbg.\nWhich brings me to my question. :)\nWhat is the main difference between <pre><code>DllMain</code></pre> and <pre><code>DllEntryPoint</code></pre>?\nWhen/How does one get call vs the other?\n[EDIT]\nSo after reading MSDN and a couple of books on MS programming. I understand <pre><code>DllEntryPoint</code></pre>.\n<pre><code>DllEntryPoint</code></pre> is your <pre><code>DllMain</code></pre> when writing your code. Right?!\nSo then why have <pre><code>DllMain</code></pre>. In other words, when opening the binary in IDA you have <pre><code>DllEntryPoint</code></pre> and <pre><code>DllMain</code></pre>.\nI know it is probably something easy but I am visual person, so obviously not seeing something here.\n",

            "content": "Both, <pre><code>DllMain</code></pre> and <pre><code>DllEntryPoint</code></pre> are merely symbolic names of the same concept. They even share the same prototype. But they aren't the same:\n\nThe function must be defined with the <pre><code>__stdcall</code></pre> calling convention.\n  The parameters and return value must be defined as documented in the\n  Win32 API for <pre><code>WinMain</code></pre> (for an .exe file) or <pre><code>DllEntryPoint</code></pre> (for a DLL).\n  It is recommended that you let the linker set the entry point so that\n  the C run-time library is initialized correctly, and C++ constructors\n  for static objects are executed.\n(MSDN Library from Visual Studio 2005)\n\nThe entry point in a DLL is the same as in an EXE technically, but with different semantics and prototype (EXE vs. DLL). Both are to be found at <pre><code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER::AddressOfEntryPoint</code></pre>. However, in a DLL this entry point is optional (although usually supplied by the runtime library). The entry point isn't explicitly exported through the export directory (although IDA for example shows them under \"Exports\"). Most of the time there is no public name attached to this entry point, which is why the documentation refers to it as <pre><code>DllEntryPoint</code></pre>. If you find this name in the export directory of the PE file it's probably not the actual entry point from the PE optional header (this would have to be confirmed by looking at the exact sample, though). The last point, btw, holds for <pre><code>DllMain</code></pre> as well.\n<pre><code>DllMain</code></pre> is the name the runtime library (ATL, MFC ...) implementation expects you to supply. It's a name the linker will see referenced from the default implementation of <pre><code>DllEntryPoint</code></pre> which is named <pre><code>_DllMainCRTStartup</code></pre> in the runtime implementations. See the CRT source files <pre><code>crtdll.c</code></pre> and <pre><code>dllcrt0.c</code></pre> if you have Visual Studio.\nThis means that <pre><code>DllEntryPoint</code></pre> calls <pre><code>DllMain</code></pre> - assuming default behavior. The runtime-implemented entry point function (<pre><code>_DllMainCRTStartup</code></pre>) does other initialization.\nYou can override this name by using the <pre><code>/entry</code></pre> command line switch to the linker. Again, it's just a name and you can choose whatever you fancy. The limitations (not being able to load another DLL using <pre><code>LoadLibrary</code></pre> from within the entry point and so on) are independent of the name you give the function.\n\nSide-note: in an EXE the TLS callbacks run before the entry point code, which can be dangerous in malware research. I don't think this is relevant to DLLs, though, but if someone has more knowledge in that area I'm interested to see pointers to material.\nPeter Ferrie, a distinguished reverser and malware analyst, pointed out in a comment to this answer:\n\nTLS callbacks always run in statically-linked DLLs, and since Vista,\n  they also run in dynamically-linked DLLs! For more information, see my\n  TLS presentations, and of\n  course my \"Ultimate\" Anti-Debugging Reference\n\nThanks Peter.\n",
