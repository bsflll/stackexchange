    "content": "I am trying to batch disassemble and decompile 500 binaries using the IDA Pro 7.5 disassember and Hex rays decompiler. I can get the .i64 output from the disassembler, but I do not have a way to batch decompile this. Does anyone have an easy way to get the .c pseudocode directly from a binary, like one can do with Ghidra?\n",

This script scans through current directory and sub directories to find binaries with \"out\" extension and generates pseudocode if found. You can read the link provided by @Igor Skochinsky for other options available.\n",
