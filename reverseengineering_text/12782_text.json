    "content": "I have a memory dump of a VM running Windows server 2012 R2. The dump is of the entire RAM (4 GB).\nI want to extract as many features as possible from this dump. Mainly I want to extract all stacks of all threads running on the machine and exist in the memory. Alternatively, I want to extract call sequences of all threads.\nAre there any tools / tutorials / books etc. which can help me perform this task?\nI am familiar with both Volatility and Rekall, are there any specific plugins that can help me achieve my goals there?\n",
