            "content": "I'll start with briefly going over the code for completeness's sake even though OP clearly understands what's going on and mostly asks about the reasoning behind it.\nThe first snippet of code can be easily written like the following in C:\n<pre><code>dword var_4 = &func1 - &func2 - 5;\n</code></pre>\nThis piece of code, by itself, raises a few questions we'll answer in a bit but first lets dig a little deeper into the second assembly snippet:\n<pre><code>mov    edx, [ebp+func2]\nmov    [edx], 0E9h         ;E9 is opcode for jmp\n</code></pre>\nThe first byte of <pre><code>func2</code></pre> is set to <pre><code>0xE9</code></pre>, which is the opcode for a \"Jump near, relative, immediate\" jump.\n<pre><code>mov    eax, [ebp+func2]\nmov    ecx, [ebp+var_4]\nmov    [eax+1], ecx\n</code></pre>\nThen, the next four bytes of <pre><code>func</code></pre> (1 through 5) are set to the offset previously calculated in the first snippet.\nNow, this may raise a couple of questions:\n\nwhy is the offset then decreased by <pre><code>5</code></pre>?\n\nThis is done because a relative jump is relative to the next instruction, thus subtracting 5 removes the 5 additional bytes of the jump instruction itself. A more accurate way of looking at it is that the offset should be calculated from <pre><code>&func2 + 5</code></pre>. The original equation (<pre><code>&func1 - &func2 - 5</code></pre>) is obviously identical to <pre><code>&func1 - (&func2 + 5)</code></pre>.\n\nWhy do we care so much about instruction length to begin with?\n\nSo, as some people here already implied, the length of a hook jump is important. That is very much true (although does not tell the whole reason behind the relative jump preference). The length of the hook (or jump sequence) is important because it can create weird edge cases. This isn't just about some minor performance optimization or keeping things simple, as one might assume.\nOne big consideration is that you'll need to replace any instructions you overwrite. Those bytes you use for your jump had a meaning. And they have to be preserved somewhere. Overwriting more bytes means you have to copy more of them elsewhere. With relative instructions on the original instruction sequence fixed, for example. You'll need to make sure you do not leave half-instructions after you. \n\nwhy use a relative jump and not an absolute address?\n\nSorry it took a while to get here ;D\nI think a lot of people overlook or forget that over time, but as carefully reviewing the jump instruction will reveal, the x86 jump opcodes lacks a near, immediate, absolute jump.\nWe've got three different types of jumps in x86:\n\n<pre><code>E9</code></pre> for near immediate offsets (offsets hard coded directly as an integer inside the instruction itself).\n<pre><code>FF /4</code></pre> for near absolute jumps.\nwe've got <pre><code>EA</code></pre> for far immediate absolute jumps.\n\nThe far jump opcode (<pre><code>EA</code></pre>) is slow and mostly used for changing segment registers (which have a completely different use in protected mode), it is therefore rarely used as a normal jump per-se, but as a call-gate, for switching between execution contexts, etc.\nThe absolute address jump opcode (<pre><code>FF /4</code></pre>) does not accept an immediate value. It can only jump to a value stored in a register or stored in memory.Therefore, using it will require you either:\n\nStoring the absolute offset at some reserved memory space, specifically allocated by the hook routine for each hook function for that purpose, or\nHard-coding an register load instruction, which will set a register to the absolute value. Something like <pre><code>mov eax, <absolute value> / jump eax</code></pre> or <pre><code>push <absolute value> / ret</code></pre>.\n\nUnderstanding this, it is clear that using the near, immediate, relative jump is far easier than both of these approaches.\nSo although it is accurate to say using an absolute address will require longer instruction sequence, it does not tell the whole story. \nThis, then raises another question:\n\nWhy, then, isn't there a near, immediate, absolute jump in x86?\n\nSimple answer is that there just isn't one. One can speculate about the reasoning behind the instruction set design decisions but adding instructions is expensive and complex. I assume there was no real need for near absolute immediate jump, as it is indeed a rare occasion where you need to jump to an address known ahead of time and a relative jump won't do.\n",

The distance between <pre><code>func2</code></pre> and <pre><code>func1</code></pre> is therefore <pre><code>0x20</code></pre> bytes.\nIf you want to jump from the beginning of <pre><code>func1</code></pre> to <pre><code>func2</code></pre> you have two options (using pseudo assembly):\n\nusing relative jump (opcode <pre><code>E9</code></pre>):\n<pre><code>0x10 JR +0x20 ; will jump to 0x10 + func2-func1 = 0x10 + 0x30-0x10 = 0x30\n</code></pre>\nusing absolute jump (opcode <pre><code>EA</code></pre>):\n<pre><code>0x10 JP 0x30 ; will jump 0x30 = func2\n</code></pre>\n\nBoth achieve the same in your case. The advantage of a relative jump is that you only have to know how far <pre><code>func2</code></pre> is from <pre><code>func1</code></pre>. You don't have to know or care where exactly in the memory the executable loader will load the binary.

If you had an absolute jump, you'd have to jump to <pre><code>0x140</code></pre> but if you have a relative jump the difference between <pre><code>func2</code></pre> and <pre><code>func1</code></pre> remains the same <pre><code>0x20</code></pre>.\nIn your example you already know the actual address of <pre><code>func2</code></pre> so you can just as well jump straight to <pre><code>func2</code></pre>.\nRelative jump opcode takes fewer bytes than the absolute jump but the disadvantage is that if the distance between <pre><code>func2</code></pre> and <pre><code>func1</code></pre> is too big (depending on your addressing mode), you wouldn't be able to use it.\n",

In its realization, the opcode <pre><code>E9</code></pre> is already in place. \nThis is what the compiler generates:\n<pre><code>func1:\n003D1226 E9 B5 0B 00 00       jmp         func1 (03D1DE0h) \n</code></pre>\nFor the real call to <pre><code>func1</code></pre> (written by the programmer in C), it generates the following:\n<pre><code>003D4D6B E8 B6 C4 FF FF       call        func1 (03D1226h)\n</code></pre>\nNow, if you try to replace the compiler's relative jmp with a direct absolute jmp (your question), you must find an assembler statement which is not longer than the relative jmp (5 Bytes), in order not to destroy the subsequent code. I think this will not be easy.\nYou may find a discussion about a similar question here.  \nBTW, if you want to try it out yourself, you must make sure that the code segment is writeable, which it is normally not. In Windows you could use a proper call to \"VirtualProtect\" to achieve it.\n",
