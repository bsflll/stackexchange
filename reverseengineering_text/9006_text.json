            "content": "Immunity Debugger 1.60 and above supports loading of PDB Symbol files both locally or from a symbol server. In order to enable it.\n\nGo to Debug menu -> Debugging Symbol Options.\n\n\n\nProvide the local path to the symbol files or to a symbol server.\n\n\n\nUPDATE\nIf ImmDbg successfully loaded the pdb symbol for the specified file, you would get a message in the logs in the form <pre><code>Debugging Information (DIA Format) available</code></pre> below the dll loading event. See the image below for reference.\n\nIf even after all this, you cannot load the appropriate symbol for a file, then \n\nYou may have misconfigured the symbol path.  \nIn case of local symbol, the PDB file present on the system does not match with the PE.\nIn case of symbol server, appropriate PDB file could not be found.\n\nIn such a case you can run the symcheck tool provided with windbg. Example usage\n<pre><code>C:\\Program Files\\Debugging Tools for Windows (x86)>symchk C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\kernel32.dll /s C:\\WINDOWS\\Symbols\n\nSYMCHK: FAILED files = 0\nSYMCHK: PASSED + IGNORED files = 1\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Debugging Tools for Windows (x86)>symchk C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\mshtml.dll /s C:\\WINDOWS\\Symbols\nSYMCHK: mshtml.dll           FAILED  - mshtml.pdb mismatched or not found\n\nSYMCHK: FAILED files = 1\nSYMCHK: PASSED + IGNORED files = 0\n</code></pre>\n\nUPDATE 2\nScreenshot of Immunity Debugger with symbols for mshtml.dll loaded. This is taken from Windows XP SP3.\n\nOther Info: ImmDbg could not download symbols from the MS Symbol Server, so had to use the symcheck tool to download symbol for mshtml.dll .\n<pre><code>symchk /r c:\\windows\\system32\\mshtml.dll /s SRV*c:\\symbols\\*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols \n</code></pre>\nThe symbol directory should look like this.\n<pre><code>C:\\symbols>dir\n Volume in drive C has no label.\n Volume Serial Number is 042A-A7E6\n\n Directory of C:\\symbols\n\n06/05/2015  12:39 PM    <DIR>          .\n06/05/2015  12:39 PM    <DIR>          ..\n04/15/2008  09:21 AM         7,965,696 mshtml.pdb\n06/05/2015  11:17 AM                 0 pingme.txt\n</code></pre>\nNext, pointed ImmDbg to <pre><code>C:\\symbols\\</code></pre>. Used loaddll to load mshtml.dll and it automatically picked up the symbol on loading. This can also be seen in the logs.\n",
