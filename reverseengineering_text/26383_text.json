    "content": "I am working on reversing a router for which I cannot find downloadable firmware anywhere. I managed to get a root shell on the router. I am now confused as I cannot see any persistent writeable mounts. Most are tmpfs filesystems, one is a sysfs which as far as I understand is not an actual filesystem, and /dev/mtdblock7 which is a squashfs filesystem (and is readonly). Where is the persistent storage that keeps my configurations? What am I missing here?\n<pre><code># mount\n/dev/mtdblock7 on / type squashfs (ro,relatime)\n/proc on /proc type proc (rw,relatime)\ntmpfs on /var type tmpfs (rw,relatime,size=15360k)\ntmpfs on /mnt type tmpfs (rw,relatime,size=16k)\nsysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,relatime)\ntmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,relatime,size=3096k)\nnone on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw,relatime)\n</code></pre>\nUpdate:\nBoard\nThis is a ZTE router, the board has a printed label that says: <pre><code>ZXHN H367N V1.0</code></pre>\nThe default update file that uboot looks for when booting over tftp is called <pre><code>H367N_image.bin</code></pre>\nRunning zcu signature on the config file gives <pre><code>ZXDSL 931VII V3.0</code></pre>\nThe decryption password used to decrypt and encrypt the file is the same as the one used in <pre><code>ZXHN H208N</code></pre> according to this.\nAlso, I remember seeing <pre><code>H368N</code></pre> somewhere, but I'm not sure where.\nFinally I found paths that have the directory <pre><code>H367N_Develop_UGW5.4</code></pre> in them.\nmtdblocks\n(This is a summary of what binwalk found)\nmtdblock0:\n\nList item crc\nuImage header \"u-boot image\"\nlzma\n\nmtdblock1:\n\nUBI erease count header\n\nmtdblock2:\n\nnothing found\n\nmtdblock3:\n\nuImage header \"GPHY Firmware\"\nlzma compression\nuImage header \"GPHY Firmware\"\nlzma compression\nzlib compressed data\nPEM RSA private key\nPEM certificate\nuImage header \"MIPS LTQCPE Linux-2.6.32.42\"\nlzma\nsquashfs\nuImage header \"MIPS LTQCPE Linux-2.6.32.42\"\nlzma\nsquashfs\n\nmtdblock4:\n\nuImage header \"GPHY Firmware\"\nlzma\nuImage header \"GPHY Firmware\"\nlzma\n\nmtdblock5:\n\nzlib compressed data\nPEM RSA private key\nPEM certificate\n\nmtdblock6:\n\nuImage header \"MIPS LTQCPE Linux-2.6.32.42\"\nlzma\n\nmtdblock7:\n\nsquashfs\n\nmtdblock8:\n\nuImage header \"MIPS LTQCPE Linux-2.6.32.42\"\nlzma\n\nmtdblock9:\n\nsquashfs\n\nmtdblock10:\n\nnothing\n\nmtdblock11:\n\nnothing\n\nmtdblock6 and mtdblock8 are identical\nmtdblock7 and mtdblock9 are identical\nmtdblock3 contains the same binary as mtdblocks 6,7,8 and 9, and likely others as well.\nI tried remounting /dev/mtdblock7 but failed. Maybe I did something wrong but my understanding is that squashfs should not be writable in any case.\n",

For starters, if it's small bits of information it may not end up in a different type of device (and specifically who says it has to be in a file system?). Also, in theory, a device could full well remount a certain file system read-write on-demand and then revert back to read only after being done saving data. What other MTD devices are there? What have you tried?\n",

That would give you exactly this result: No writable partitions but some binary is taking care of reading and writing to that NVRAM (wherever that might be). Check if there's anything called nvread, nvconf or something like that.\nIf that's not successful you can always try to find a binary that uses a configurable option, load it into a Disassembler and see what's going on there.\n",
