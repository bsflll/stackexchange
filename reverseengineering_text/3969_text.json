    "content": "VM packers like Code Virtualizer and VMProtect seem challenging to existing reverse engineering work, especially static approach like IDA Pro.\nAccording to this slides\nwww.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/ppt/caro_obfuscation.ppt\nfrom Hex-rays, IDA Pro requires experienced reverse engineer to manually recognize the opcode array and understand the semantic, then decode the bytecode array..\nI myself use IDA Pro to deal with simple quicksort program using Code Virtualizer, and I can share two pics.\n\nSee, I use Code Virtualizer to protect this part and IDA Pro can not go to 0X599050h.\n\nSee, the size of relocation section has a significant growth.\nSo my questions:\n\nCan IDA Pro automatically deal with VM obfuscated binaries?\nAny other interesting materials on the state-of-art in this area?\n\nThank you!\n",

D-810 helps deal with obfu in <b>pseudo-decompiled functions</b>, and isn't going to be a lick of help in decoding VMProtected or other kind of \"decrypt at loadtime\" protection.  All D-810 is going to do is make the psuedo-decompiled functions slightly easier to read.  Not that this isn't <b>awesome</b>, it's just not addressing the OPs concern.</span>",
