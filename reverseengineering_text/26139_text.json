    "content": "I am trying to decrypt HTTPs communications in a binary that I know has been statically linked with cURL. How can I force curl to not verify SSL certificates for fiddler to intercept? I am using the environment variable \"all_proxy\" for cURL to make it use the fiddler proxy, but it won't accept the self-signed cert from fiddler. I have the fiddler cert trusted in my certificate store.\n",
