    "content": "I'm taking my first steps in memory exploitation in Linux. I'm following a tutorial for a practice VM(<pre><code>$ uname -r -> 3.13.0-32-generic</code></pre>)\nThe tutorial makes a call to <pre><code>mprotect</code></pre> to set a certain region of memory executable, then uses <pre><code>read</code></pre> to manually input some shellcode.\nI occurred to me that perhaps I could load my shellcode on the stack using the buffer and use <pre><code>mprotect</code></pre> to set the buffer region on the stack as executable and return to it. But that throws an error for reasons I'm not sure of.\nIn short, this call to <pre><code>mprotect</code></pre> works:\n<pre><code># mprotect: set memory executable\npayload += p(0x080523e0) # mprotect addr\npayload += p(0x08048882) # return to: pop, pop, pop, retn\npayload += p(0xb7ffd000) # arg1: address of 'mapped' region\npayload += p(0x2000)     # arg2: length\npayload += p(0x7)        # arg3: rwx\n</code></pre>\nBut this call fails:\n<pre><code># mprotect: set memory executable\npayload += p(0x080523e0) # mprotect addr\npayload += p(0xbffff6c0) # return to shellcode in buffer on stack\npayload += p(0xbffff6c0) # arg1: beginning of shellcode on stack\npayload += p(0x2000)     # arg2: length\npayload += p(0x7)        # arg3: rwx\n</code></pre>\nStepping through <pre><code>mprotect</code></pre> in that second example shows me that it takes an error jump:\n<pre><code>=> 0x80523fa <mprotect+26>: jae    0x8053870 <__syscall_error>\n</code></pre>\nAs the only difference between the two is the address I want to set executable, I'm wondering if it's simply that <pre><code>mprotect</code></pre> can't set the stack as executable?\n",
