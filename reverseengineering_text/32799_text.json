    "content": "I'm currently debugging a program using x64dbg, and I'm struggling to set up a conditional breakpoint on the <pre><code>CreateFileW</code></pre> function:\n<pre><code>HANDLE CreateFileW(\n  [in]           LPCWSTR               lpFileName,\n  [in]           DWORD                 dwDesiredAccess,\n  [in]           DWORD                 dwShareMode,\n  [in, optional] LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpSecurityAttributes,\n  [in]           DWORD                 dwCreationDisposition,\n  [in]           DWORD                 dwFlagsAndAttributes,\n  [in, optional] HANDLE                hTemplateFile\n);\n</code></pre>\nSpecifically, I need the breakpoint to trigger only when the function is called with a specific filename/path, such as <pre><code>\"C:/my/file/txt.txt\"</code></pre>.\nDespite searching online, I haven't found a clear solution for my scenario. Can anyone guide how to achieve this in x64dbg?\nWhat I tried\nI tried to set a conditional breakpoint with:\n<pre><code>arg.get(0) == \"C:/my/file/\"\n</code></pre>\nHowever, that doesn't work, it seemingly breaks on every file, no matter the path.\n\nHow can I set a conditional breakpoint for when the debugger is accessing the path of <pre><code>C:/my/file/bla.txt</code></pre>?\n",

This makes it easier to debug potential issues (for example using a <pre><code>/</code></pre> as formulated in your question would not work and might be frustrating to find out without doing this).\n",
