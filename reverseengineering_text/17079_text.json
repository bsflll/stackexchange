    "content": "There is a DOS game I want to run through a debugger. I tried using (FreeDos) \nDEBUG.COM over DosBox. But the problem is that this game uses graphics, and this messes up the output of DEBUG.COM.\nIs there some way (it can be by choosing other debugger) to separate the graphical output of the game and the textual output of the debugger?\n",
