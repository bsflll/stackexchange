    "content": "Context: I have a proprietary Tandberg Data RDX QuickStor Internal USB3 drive bay for PC (item number <pre><code>8666-RDX</code></pre>) and some storage cartridges for it.\nEsentially, these are just regular TOSHIBA <pre><code>MK3276GSX</code></pre> 2.5\" SATA drives in some fancy housing and the corresponding SATA-to-USB-3.0 adapter bay.\nThe catch: The SATA Drives are protected with an ATA password and the bay unlocks them when inserted. I cannot use them if i connect them directly to my PC and all of my attempts at triggering an ATA Secure erase or obtaining an OEM master password failed.\nMy question: Is there a sane way to obtain the ATA password, e.g. by soldering a few wires onto the SATA connector in the drive bay and recording some data with an oscilloscope for later analysis?\nI once asked about this on the superuser stack exchange but the answers were limited to software based solutions. I wasn't able to succed with that approach.\n",

Investing in buying a new one sadly would probably not pay off as i'd be cheaper off just buying new drives. Welp.\n",

            "content": "This tutorial (NB: in Italian) covers recovering ATA passwords from the drive itself. Not for the faint of heart, and drive controller firmware dependent. You might also post on forum.hddguru.com as they seem like SMEs.\nHere's another tutorial covering different tools and techniques.\nThere's plenty of additional information about Tandberg RDX here starting on Page 14 which seems germane:\n<pre><code>There are two types of cartridge data protection available:\n• Full Disk AES 256 XTS Encryption – All data stored on the cartridge is encrypted\nusing the XTS-AES 256 encryption standard (recommended).\n• Basic Password Protection – Access to the cartridge and \nits data is protected by a single password.\nIMPORTANT: When using the Basic Password Protection option, data \non the cartridge is NOT encrypted and is only protected by a password.\n</code></pre>\nBased on your question I'm assuming these carts are secured with the 2nd type which is implemented as an ATA Password. I assume you've tried the steps on page 24 of the manual to remove this type of protection.\n",
