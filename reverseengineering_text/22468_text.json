            "content": "Electronics are not really our focus and it's not clear at all what you plan to do with the information but a quick search found this blog post which says:\n\nSignal Diodes\nThe smallest discrete diodes are designed to handle\nabout 100 milliamps of current. These devices are typically packaged\nin tiny glass cylinders with a connecting lead at each end. A stripe\non the cylinder marks the diode’s cathode, making the opposite side\nthe anode. With some diodes, you may need a magnifying glass to see\nthe stripe clearly.\n\n(emphasis mine)\nIF you need more help with the circuit, I'd suggest asking on https://electronics.stackexchange.com/ where there are many more experts on this topic.\n",
