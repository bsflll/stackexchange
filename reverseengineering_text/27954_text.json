    "content": "I am using qemu to emulate a binary like this\n<pre><code>qemu -strace XXXXX</code></pre> .\nI saw that the first 2 system calls of this process were <pre><code>TCGETS</code></pre> to stdin and stdout. From man pages\n<pre><code>Get and set terminal attributes\n      TCGETS Argument: struct termios *argp\n              Equivalent to tcgetattr(fd, argp).\n              Get the current serial port settings.\n</code></pre>\nAnd after those 2 syscall the process got <pre><code>SIGSEGV</code></pre>.\nIs there any simple way to handle those syscall so the process continues without a segfault?\n",
