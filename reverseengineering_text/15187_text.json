    "content": "IDA has the following function <pre><code>idc.MakeNameEx</code></pre> which accepts multiple <pre><code>flags</code></pre> values that set properties about the given name (such as whether it's public, auto-generated, etc).\nSo far all is good and well, but I would like to do the opposite - get those flag values of a name. I'd like to test if a name is public, weak, auto, etc. but I cant seem to find a <pre><code>idc.NameFlags</code></pre> method anywhere.\nAm I missing something or is this functionality unavailable?\nThanks\n",
