    "content": "I have an exe file and a dll file. This exe file uses the dll to decode input file. This exe file is gui based and does not support command line execution. \nSo my requirement is to create a program which loads this dll and use the funciton to decode an input file so that I can use this program in some scripts.\nThe exe expects two inputs. Source file name and destination file name.\n\nWhen I disassembled the exe, only 1 parameter is being passed to the dll function call, which is the source file name. I couldn't find how the destination file name is passed to the function.\n\nDisassembly of dll function shows 2 exported functions.\n\nassembly code for dll function from IDA is as follows\n\nWhile calling the dll function from exe, the stack is as follows\n\nFrom this I understood that the a pointer to the source file name is passed as the argument. The pointer points to the following memory location.\n\n\nFrom this much information, is it possible to identify the function prototype of the dll function.\n",
