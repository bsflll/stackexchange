    "content": "In IDA, is it possible to convert placeholder data into a code segment?\nIn the end of the library I am working with, there is an uninitialized segment starting at 016AAB31.\nThe hex and actual data (which is question mark strings), however, does not allow me to put arm asm instructions into it, using the edit feature. It claims that it cannot convert the \"????\"s to hexadecimal integers. \nIs there a way to extend the code segment to let me add more code, or any other way to do this? Thanks\n",

So there's no space present in your file, and even if there was, your library relies on these bytes being 0, so you can't put anything there.\n",

            "content": "I would recommend against doing this in IDA. IDA is not a patching tool. Although there are plugins for IDA that implement this, there are far better choices for executable format editors, that are better equipped to add additional sections and manupulate data in it, which seems to be what you're after.\nI suspect IDA won't be able to patch in the modified/new section even if you managed to create it. I think you'll have to use another tool for the job.\nSince you're working with ARM assembly, I'll assume you're working on an executable in the elf format. For that, simply using <pre><code>objcopy --add-section</code></pre> would do the trick. You might also want to take a look at <pre><code>--set-section-flags</code></pre> afterwards.\nMore advanced tools include the eresi and radare projects. Both capable and designed to manipulate ELF executables to ease the work of a reverse engineer and/or security researcher.\n",
