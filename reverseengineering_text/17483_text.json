    "content": "I am working on a HEX string, which I figured out is a binary. I would like some pointers on what to do next after I have disassembled from hex to assembly. I'm just assuming that the architecture is possibly x86 and used onlinedisassembler.com to convert to assembly code.\nIs there a way I can run/debug using gdb? It's a challenge, so I would need to either run the assembly, debug it or do a static analysis and find out what's happening! Any help would be appreciated.\nThe disassembled code looks something like this (not sharing the whole thing, just first two lines):\n<pre><code>                       .data:00000000 77 90                            ja     0xffffff92\n                       .data:00000002 97                               xchg   edi,eax\n</code></pre>\n",
