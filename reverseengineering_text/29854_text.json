            "content": "\"Constant\" in this case does not refer to the common programming term \"a value that should not be altered by the program during normal execution\"\nIn this scenario \"constant\" means the memory address is directly holding the value of the variable.\nThe \"value\" term means the memory address is pointing to another memory address, and that 2nd memory address is pointing to the value.\nYou can see this as the memory address for the \"value\" follow is 00 40 2D 30 which is the value shown in the \"constant\" follow 30 2D 40 00\nThe order of numbers is reversed due numbers being stored in little endian format.\nTo fully understand whether this is a \"constant\" or a \"value\" data type would need to see the complete function and how the rcx value gets used.\nFor a simple example let's take this C code:\n<pre><code>int main()\n{\n    int v = 128;\n    int i = v;\n    int *j = &i;\n    \n    i=i+2;\n    *j = i+4;\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\nHere we can think of \"i\" as being the \"constant\" which is when the memory address representing \"i\" contains the actual value.\nHowever, the memory address representing \"j\" is type \"value\" pointing to another memory address that contains the actual value. In real programs these \"value\" types will often point to complicated structures, which can require a detailed analysis of how it is used to work out the original data types.\nIn this simplistic example the assembly is something like this:\n<pre><code>sub     rsp, 24\nmov     DWORD PTR v$[rsp], 128                    ; 00000080H\nmov     eax, DWORD PTR v$[rsp]\nmov     DWORD PTR i$[rsp], eax\nlea     rax, QWORD PTR i$[rsp]\nmov     QWORD PTR j$[rsp], rax\nmov     eax, DWORD PTR i$[rsp]\nadd     eax, 2\nmov     DWORD PTR i$[rsp], eax\nmov     eax, DWORD PTR i$[rsp]\nadd     eax, 4\nmov     rcx, QWORD PTR j$[rsp]\nmov     DWORD PTR [rcx], eax\nxor     eax, eax\nadd     rsp, 24\nret     0\n</code></pre>\nHere we see the example of the \"constant\"\n<pre><code>mov     eax, DWORD PTR i$[rsp]\nadd     eax, 2\nmov     DWORD PTR i$[rsp], eax\n</code></pre>\nWe can see the value at memory address $i[rsp] is loaded into eax, 2 is added to it, then the value is directly stored back in the memory address via\n<pre><code>mov DWORD PTR $i[rsp], eax\n</code></pre>\nIn this case we would use the \"constant\" follow on DWORD PTR $i[rsp] to find the value.\nHowever, with j we are instead getting a memory address held at $j[rsp] which points to the memory location of i. Instead of updating DWORD PTR $j[rsp] this time we are instead setting the value at the memory location held there.\n<pre><code>mov     eax, DWORD PTR i$[rsp]\nadd     eax, 4\nmov     rcx, QWORD PTR j$[rsp]\nmov     DWORD PTR [rcx], eax\n</code></pre>\nIn this scenario we would use the \"value\" follow on $j[RSP] to find the value.\n",
