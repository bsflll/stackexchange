I have a question about the meaning of this line\n<pre><code>Mov dword PTR [ESP] => local_70 , eax\n</code></pre>\nI get we are moving <pre><code>eax</code></pre> into the left side but I'm not sure what the <pre><code>[ESP]=>local_70</code></pre> chunk is as I haven't come across that before. I think the => confuses me the most.\nAny help is much appreciated!\n",
