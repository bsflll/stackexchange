    "content": "Frequently when I use Radare2 I work mostly in hexadecimal. This means I'm constantly having to remember to type <pre><code>0x</code></pre> in front of addresses, which is different from the machine-language monitors I'm used to using. (I'm generally working with binaries for 8-bit systems, where decimal is rarely used when working in machine language.)\nIs there any way to set the default input radix to hexadecimal? I'd like to be able to type <pre><code>s ff00</code></pre> instead of <pre><code>s 0xff00</code></pre> at the command line, and <pre><code>gff00</code></pre> instead of <pre><code>g0xff00</code></pre> in visual mode.\nAnd if I can do this, how does one enter decimal numbers, should that be necessary, in this mode?\nLinks to documentation are appreciated.\n",

To do so, you can modify the <pre><code>libr/core/cmd_seek.c</code></pre> file (which is responsible for handling seek command) as follows:\n\nAnd then use <pre><code>make</code></pre> to compile the project. After this, you will get the feature you want (will also work with <pre><code>g</code></pre> in Visual Mode):\n\nYou can find the patch code below:\n<pre><code>ut64 addr;\nif ((input[1] >= '1' && input[1] <= '9') || (input[1] >= 'a' && input[1] <= 'f'))\n{\n    char inputHex[strlen(input) + 1];\n    inputHex[0] = '0';\n    inputHex[1] = 'x';\n    int i = 2;\n    for (; i < strlen(input) + 1; i++)\n        inputHex[i] = input[i - 1];\n    addr = r_num_math (core->num, inputHex);\n} \nelse\n     addr = r_num_math (core->num, input + 1);\n</code></pre>\n",
