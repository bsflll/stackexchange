OllyDbg seems to correctly load Wine's own dlls. But when I check PE header in OllyDBG it differs from that what I would expect. In all other cases file content is an exact match of PE header in OllyDbg. But in case of Wine libraries even the file signature is different.\nFirst three bytes in file: \n4D 5A 40\nOllyDbg memory dump: \n4D 5A 90\nThen the rest of loaded library differs as well. I did not notice such behaviour with few Windows dlls that I have checked. Googling didn't help either. Does anybody know what's going on?\nmore finds\nExample of differences\nin file - OllyDbg PE header\nDOS_PEOffset 60 - 40\nNumber of Sections 3 - 2\nOllyDbg seems to be able to read exported Wine dll symbols despite of my own file analysis expecting Export Table RVA and Export Table Size to be 0. Please note that my own analysis works correctly on normal Windows dll files.\nAbove differences are from oleaut32.dll, but Iâ€™ve noticed similar when checking other Wine dlls. Location of Wine dlls:\n~/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32 \nI'm using wine-1.4.1 and OllyDbg 2.01.\n",

In this case very beginning of PE header differs from that on file. does Wine's loader have to do anything with it?\n",
