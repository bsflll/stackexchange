    "content": "I have some files that compiled with nuitka. formats are .bin. I could get shell access to running process with pyrasite same as this guide. but I cannot decompile function codes or anything else, and also tried unpyc37.\nshell access to process is all I have. I can print variables and see values but how can I access functions code ?\nor is there another way to extract codes ?\n",
