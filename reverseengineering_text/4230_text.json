It will be all 0s at the execution and won't hold any useful information until the program writes to it. After that, you can use a debugger to dump the memory and explore its content.\nCheck the Wikipedia page for more information.\n",

The <pre><code>.bss</code></pre> section is usually non existing until your program starts executing, this is why you can't retrieve its content statically. It is fairly important to note that this section helps reduce the program's size & makes it quicker to load.\n",
