    "content": "As the title suggests, I am interested in serializing/deserializing xpc_object_t type objects. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be an official or private API that supports this in a robust fashion.\nI came accross the private functions:\n<pre><code>xpc_object_t _CFXPCCreateXPCMessageWithCFObject(CFTypeRef)</code></pre>\n<pre><code>CFTypeRef _CFXPCCreateCFObjectFromXPCMessage(xpc_object_t)</code></pre>\nTo my understanding, these functions should represent exactly what I am looking for. However, the resulting Dictionary is nil, suggesting that the objects can't be serialized. Initially I thought, maybe this does not work for nested Dictionaries. Unfortunatelly, a testcase with a very simple Dictionary resulted in nil as well.\nSince these are private functions, there does not seem to be any (public) useful information available. Is there anything that I am missing?\nThank you.\n",
