    "content": "REing a binary and while its running (using Windbg by the way) my (call)stack gets mangled. So I start to perform a stack trace [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff552143(v=vs.85).aspx].\nHowever, when I'm verifying various symbols/functions in the target, various instructions are paged out so I cant tell if the previous instruction was a ret or a call above it, e.g.\n<pre><code>kd> u fe682ae4-2 l1      //  paged out (all zeroes) unknown\nrdr!_RdrSectionInfo+0x2a:\nfe682ae2 0000             add     [eax],al\n</code></pre>\nI know how to reload symbols via !vad extension [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff552153(v=vs.85).aspx]. However, that requires me to use (live)kd.\nIs there an easier way to ensure the target application doesn't get paged out, short of disabling the pagefile?\nI've searched Google, OSRonline, Woodmann, etc. and haven't found anything helpful.\n",

I took the example output of the unassemble command from the MSDN article about stacktracing (whose author was using kd). In that article it stated a series of '0x00' means its likely paged out.  So I can't use !vtop in windbg. .fnent returns 'no function entry for [virt addr]'  However, .pagein appears to be in play.   How may I find out the address of the EPROCESS block/address of the process that owns the memory for .pagein's  /p [EPROC addr] argument? Im using windbg, so !PROCESS is out of play</span>",

I cant restart my machine for it to allow kernel debugging. '!vtop', '!process' etc. throw 'no export process found' because they're extensions for the ring0 debugger 'kd'. You'll get the same error if you open windbg (no kernel debugging), attach to a process and attempt to run said extensions.</span>",
