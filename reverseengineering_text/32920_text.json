    "content": "I've been poking around with the IDA C++ SDK and I'm writing something to dump all local types into a json file. I have it all working but typedefs. Example <pre><code>typedef int BOOL</code></pre>\nI'm trying to get the original type of the typedef all methods I have tried so far only give me <pre><code>BOOL</code></pre> for the typedef name and the original type. I've tried the <pre><code>get_final_type_name</code></pre> function, <pre><code>get_realtype(true)</code></pre> which caused crashes and some others which gave the same result as <pre><code>get_final_type_name</code></pre>. Is there an easy way to do this?\n",

That'll get you the fields that you can use with <pre><code>tinfo_t.deserialize</code></pre>. If you already have the \"typeref\" that you want as a <pre><code>tinfo_t</code></pre>, you'll need to distinguish whether it's a named-type or ordinal-type and then use <pre><code>get_type_name</code></pre> or <pre><code>get_ordinal</code></pre> (respectively). With that, you can then <pre><code>get_numbered_type</code></pre> or <pre><code>get_named_type</code></pre>. It's also probably worth noting that you can use <pre><code>replace_ordinal_typerefs</code></pre> to replace ordinals in your type with a named type (prolly affecting lookup performance).\n",
