    "content": "I am trying to write a decoder for an old video format used in a DOS game, the Psygnosis SMV video format, but I'm having a hard time understanding the image decoding process, specifically this section:\n<pre><code>Macroblocks drawing\n\nMacroblocks are stored in the following format:\n\n u8 pixels[16 * num_mblocks]\n u4 nibbles[num_mblocks]\n\nSize of pixels[] is equal to ST chunk's nibbles.\nFor each macroblock draw it by indexing its pixels by nibbles.\nFirst nibble stored in top 4 bits of byte.\n</code></pre>\nHere are the properties of the frame I am trying to decode:\n\nimage width = 320\nimage height = 192\nmacroblock width = 16\nmacroblock height = 16\nnibbles = 3840\nframe size in bytes = 34560\n\nSo according these, I computed the following values:\n<pre><code>num_mblocks = nibbles / 16 = 3840 / 16 = 240 macroblocks\n\nfurther checking:\n(image width / macroblock width) * (image height / macroblock height)\n= (320 / 16) * (192 / 16)\n= 20 * 12\n= 240 macroblocks\n</code></pre>\n1st problem:\nThe size of <pre><code>u8 pixels[16 * num_mblocks]</code></pre> is indeed 3840 bytes, but what is the size of <pre><code>u4 nibbles[num_mblocks]</code></pre> supposed to be ? 240 bytes or half that amount since the type is <pre><code>u4</code></pre> ?\n2nd problem:\nWhen I divide the <pre><code>frame size in bytes</code></pre> by the number of <pre><code>macroblocks</code></pre> I end up with only 144 bytes per macroblock (34560 / 240 = 144), but to me this is very far from what it's supposed to be, I guess I'm wrong somewhere.\n3rd problem:\nThe author wrote:\nFor each macroblock draw it by indexing its pixels by nibbles.\nBut what does that mean exactly ?\nQuestion\nCan you explain/shed some light on how one is supposed to decode a frame ?\n",

            "content": "NB: This is an assumption which may or may not be true; I haven't tested that against any real file.\nIt seems like the creators of the file format have been trying to save some space. They want to encode 256 colors (\"to encode 8-bit palettized video\"), so they'd need one byte per pixel. However, a certain smaller area of the screen ise likely to contain the same color pixels repeatedly. So, I'd say that each macroblock can contain only 16 different colors, representable in 4 bits/one nibble.\nFrom <pre><code>u8 pixels[16 * num_mblocks]</code></pre> it seems like each macroblock has 16 pixel definitions, which are indexes into the general palette table, and need 1 byte each. What follows is one nibble per pixel which is an index into <pre><code>pixels</code></pre>.\nSo, for example, the pixels for one macro block would have 16 bytes which are indexes into the palette; which may look like this: (Sorry for some of the color names; i ran out of names that fit in 5 characters ...)\n<pre><code>+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----\n+  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  5  +  6  +  7  +  8  +  9  +  A  +  B  +  C  +  D  +  E  +  F  +\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----\n| red |green|blue |yellw|magnt|cyan |grey |black|orang|gold |aqua |azure|ivory|plum |wheat|\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----\n</code></pre>\nNext, you need one nibble per pixel which is an index into that table. So the bytes CA 53 2D would represent 6 pixels being azure, gold, magenta, blue, green, and ivory.\nSo for a macroblock of 256 pixels you need 16 bytes for the pixel table, and 256/2=128 bytes for the pixels. Which sums up to the 144 that you calculated. The <pre><code>u4 nibbles[num_mblocks]</code></pre> is probably wrong and should be <pre><code>u4 nibbles[num_mblocks*pixels_per_mblock]</code></pre>\n",
