    "content": "I'm disassembling some mpcXXXX microcontroller firmware, and I'm trying to find the vector table and the reset interrupt. \nFor example, I know that in ARM, in some of the microcontrollers, the vector table is stored in 0x0 address, and the reset ISR is pointed as the first entry of the vector table, as shown in the picture below:\n\nDoes anyone know how to find the similar in PPC microcontrollers? I went through the documentation and references, but couldn't find the answer. I suspect it could also be at 0x0 offset, however, the first memory segment in IDA starts at 0x20000 in my case.\n",
