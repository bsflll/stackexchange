    "content": "I'm currently reversing a PowerPC Gekko program and saw a <pre><code>bne</code></pre> instruction that branched on the condition register after a <pre><code>rlwinm</code></pre> function. Perfect. That makes sense. <pre><code>bne</code></pre> is checking the third bit of the <pre><code>CR0</code></pre> bit field in the condition register. I assumed checking <pre><code>CR0</code></pre> was default and that made sense.\nIn the next few lines, there was another <pre><code>bne</code></pre> instruction that followed a <pre><code>cmplwi</code></pre> instruction. Cool, I can probably guess that we're branching after the <pre><code>cmplwi</code></pre> (I'm pretty sure this is a loop, probably a for loop). However, my documentation seems to say that <pre><code>cmplwi</code></pre> modifies the <pre><code>CR3</code></pre> bit field in the condition register.\nBoth instances of <pre><code>bne</code></pre> did not have a <pre><code>CRx</code></pre> argument as I saw in my documentation, so I'm lost as to which bit field it's checking.\nWhich bit field in the condition register does <pre><code>bne</code></pre> check when the condition register is unspecified?\n",
