            "text": "When it comes to python understanding what a code actually does can be pretty hard as Payton has not static types. Therefore the best understanding you can get when using step-by-step debugging on the relevant parts you are interested in. Make very tiny example and process it while you are watching it in the debugger. A nice GUI like PyCharm may be helpful for debugging and inspecting. Load your project into PyCharm and execute it in debug mode and use breakpoints where you don't understand something.\n",
