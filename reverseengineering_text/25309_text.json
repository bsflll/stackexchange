    "content": "I'm currently disassembling some firmware, when I stumbled across the following code snippet produced by Ghidra (the names are already my own ones):\n<pre><code>void memset(byte *addr,byte value,int count)\n                            assume LRset = 0x0\n                            assume TMode = 0x1\n  undefined         r0:1           <RETURN>                                \n  byte *            r0:4           addr                                    \n  byte              r1:1           value\n  int               r2:4           count\n  undefined4        r0:4           iPtr                                    \n\n22 b1           cbz        count,LAB_FIN\n02 44           add        count,addr\n                      LAB_LOOP\n00 f8 01 1b     strb.w     value,[iPtr],#0x1\n90 42           cmp        iPtr,count\nfb d1           bne        LAB_LOOP\n                      LAB_FIN  \n70 47           bx         lr\n00              ??         00h\nbf              ??         BFh\n</code></pre>\nGhidra's decompiler produces the following output (after setting some types):\n<pre><code>void memset(byte *addr,byte value,int count)\n{\n  byte *iPtr;\n\n  if (count != 0) {\n    iPtr = addr;\n    do {\n      iPtr = iPtr + 1;\n      *iPtr = value;                // write to iPtr AFTER the pointer was increased\n      iPtr = iPtr;\n    } while (iPtr != addr + count);\n  }\n  return;\n}\n</code></pre>\nNow, I have two questions:\n\nThe decompiled function suggests that this <pre><code>memset</code></pre> function will not set the given address (addr) to the specified value, but will always start with <pre><code>addr+1</code></pre>. This, however, doesn't feel right and as far as I understand the <pre><code>strb.w</code></pre> instruction it uses post-indexing. Therefore - I think - the order of the pointer-increment and the assignment instruction is wrong. Am I right or do I miss something?\nAfter the bx instruction there are two further bytes. I don't have the slightest idea what they are. Given that they are not \"00\" I don't think that they are (solely) used for alignment purposes.  (The next function definitively starts directly after these two bytes.) Does anyone have an idea?\n",

            "content": "Indeed, it seems to be incorrect. The syntax <pre><code>[R0],#1</code></pre> is called  post-indexed: first the store (or load) is performed, and then the base address is incremented (or decremented) by the value specified. So the assignment and increment should be swapped.\nAs for <pre><code>00 BF</code></pre>, it is the opcode for the <pre><code>NOP</code></pre> instruction, probably inserted to align next function on a 4-byte boundary.\n",
