    "content": "I'm working on an embedded system Coldfire ROM. Currently, I'm trying to reverse engineering it to gain some more in-depth knowledge about its structure. \nROM code quality seems pretty low, and I see a lot of redundancy and dead code lay around, as if the code was compiled with a very low level of optimization. \nI'm telling you that because I do not understand if this fact is somehow related to the question I'm about to pose. \nChecking the code, not infrequently, I'm stepping into jumps inside a single multi byte instruction. I'm new to this technique, so I wonder if someone can put me in the right track to understand this, that I consider a strangeness.\nHere an example of what I'm referring to:\nI have a function which starts at ROM:00005474\n<pre><code>[...]\n.ROM:00005490 30 07             movew %d7,%d0\n.ROM:00005492 4a 80             tstl %d0\n.ROM:00005494 66 0c             bnes 0x0000000c :12 \n.ROM:00005496 70 00             moveq #0,%d0\n.ROM:00005498 60 00 00 a8       braw 0x000000b2\n.ROM:0000549c 4e b9 00 00 36 f8 jsr 0x000036f8  : the jump points inside here\n.ROM:000054a2 32 06             movew %d6,%d1\n.ROM:000054a4 48 c1             extl %d1\n.ROM:000054a6 20 01             movel %d1,%d0\n[...]\n</code></pre>\nIn another area of the  ROM, I have another function which starts at ROM:00012016\n<pre><code>[...]\n.ROM:000120c0 72 00             moveq #0,%d1\n.ROM:000120c2 12 00             moveb %d0,%d1\n.ROM:000120c4 20 3c 00 00 00 ff movel #255,%d0\n.ROM:000120ca b2 80             cmpl %d0,%d1\n.ROM:000120cc 66 00 01 92       bnew 0x00012260\n.ROM:000120d0 4e b9 00 00 54 9e jsr 0x0000549e :here the jump I do not understand\n.ROM:000120d6 72 00             moveq #0,%d1\n.ROM:000120d8 12 00             moveb %d0,%d1\n.ROM:000120da 20 3c 00 00 00 ff movel #255,%d0\n[...]\n</code></pre>\nIf I try to follow the jump and begin to disassemble the function starting from the address ROM:0000549e I get a translation which leads to the following interpretation. I understand it is executable, but I do not get the big picture in this action.\n<pre><code>[...]\n.ROM:0000549e 00 00 36 f8                      orib #-8,%d0\n.ROM:000054a2 32 06                            movew %d6,%d1\n.ROM:000054a4 48 c1                            extl %d1\n.ROM:000054a6 20 01                            movel %d1,%d0\n[...]\n</code></pre>\nIs there, behind this technique, some old practice I should know. Why this ROM developer should have used such a strange technique? To reduce the code size? If so, it is not fit with the rest of the code which is very redundant and has dead code in it which won't be ever executed!\nEDIT.20190214\nAt byte 0xc000 it begins a block of code extends to 0x40000 whose first function appears to be incomplete in its beginning part. \nThe weirdness seems to begin from this point forward and extends to the byte 0x40000 where the second part of the firmware begins. \nIn this code blocks, there are roughly 200 functions of various dimensions and the JSRs with a weird absolute address are not present in all the functions in this block.\nThe functions in this block seem to interact with each other seamlessly, but they occasionally occur to present inconsistent addresses.\n",

So then ** 0x5494 + 0x02 + 0x0c = 0x54a2** which is the instruction the CPU would execute next if the condition is true.

            "content": "It does look like a size optimization employed in some microcontrollers, although I haven't seen it used around subroutine calls. In particular, CodeWarrior compiler for HC08 and HC12 used it to optimize short branches.\nFrom Freescale/NXP's S12(X) Build Tools Reference Manual (section HC(S)12 Backend Optimizations):\n\nShort BRA Optimization (-OnB=a to disable it)\nA branch over one byte is replaced with the opcode of <pre><code>BRN</code></pre>. A branch over two bytes is\nreplaced with the opcode of <pre><code>CPS</code></pre>\nListing 10.19 Short BRA optimization example\n<pre><code>int q(void) {\nif (f()) {\n    return 1;\n  } else {\n    return 0;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\nThe code produced with this optimization:\n<pre><code>0000 160000 JSR f\n0003 044403 TBEQ D,3 ;abs = 0009\n0006 C601 LDAB #1\n0008 21C7 BRN -57 ;abs = FFD1\n000A 87 CLRA\n000B 3D RTS\n</code></pre>\nWith the <pre><code>-OnB=a</code></pre> (disable short BRA optimization) option the Compiler produces one\nmore byte:\n<pre><code>0000 160000 JSR f\n0003 044404 TBEQ D,4 ;abs = 000A\n0006 C601 LDAB #1\n0008 2001 BRA 1 ;abs = 000B\n000A C7 CLRB\n000B 87 CLRA\n000C 3D RTS\n</code></pre>\nThe branch optimizer replaces the BRA 1 in the second example with the opcode of\n“BRN”, 0x21. Then the Decoder joins the BRN with the CLRB to one BRN. Actually the\nDecoder writes something like the following:\n<pre><code>0008 21 “BRA 1”\n000A C7 CLRB\n</code></pre>\nThe <pre><code>CLRB</code></pre> out of the second code disappears in the first listing into the offset of the\n<pre><code>BRN</code></pre> instruction. The same type of optimization is also done with a <pre><code>BRA 2</code></pre>. Then the opcode of a <pre><code>CPS #</code></pre> is taken.\nNOTE <pre><code>BRN</code></pre> and <pre><code>CPS</code></pre> in a Decoder listing are often the result of this optimization. If\nso, one or two additional machine instructions are hidden after the opcode. The\ncompiler writes this as <pre><code>SKIP1</code></pre> or <pre><code>SKIP2</code></pre> pseudo opcode to the listing file.\n\nI haven't found mentions of such optimization used for ColdFire and since you mention that the code does not look optimized it's probably not what is happening here. One theory I have is that the overlapping instructions sequence comes from the compiler's standard library and not developer's code so it has been optimized for size or even written manually in assembly.\nYet another option is that you're looking at data being disassembled which may produce all kinds of weird effects. For example, it could be jump tables embedded in code.\nEDIT yeah, the stuff at 000120c0  does look like some kind of table. For example, when converted to an array of words, it becomes:\n<pre><code>CODE:000120C0  dc.w $7200, $1200, $203C, 0, $FF, $B280, $6600, $192, $4EB9\nCODE:000120C0  dc.w 0, $549E, $7200, $1200, $203C, 0, $FF\n</code></pre>\nSo it's probably not code at all. I suspect it could be the table of initial tasks or similar.\n",

Unfortunately, all the scenarios envisaged do not fit in my case. I feel to exclude a compiler size optimization because the code around is redundant. I think it is not a library, size optimized, included as is, for the same reason. Finally, I think it is not even a  jump table, because the JSR address is valid, and because there are no near PC relative instructions.</span>",

Yours are well-placed comments, I think I would do the same in your place. However, the code block starting at 0x12016 and comprehending the 0x120d0 is, in fact, a function. I added on the original question the starting of that function to show you how I came to that conclusion. The function is also referenced by other snippets of code around the ROM, but at this stage, I'm not able to tell you which is the right call flow. Lastly, I chose these two snippets of code to substantiate my question, but they are not the only.</span>",

The addresses are absolute immediate values, and your CPU doesn't have an MMU, so these addresses must be valid. However the code at those locations may not be what you think it is.\nYou probably assumed that the ROM starts at address 0. If this is not the case then pc-relative code (branch instructions etc.) will still point to the 'correct' addresses, but absolute jumps won't. Another possibility is that the ROM does start at address 0 at power on, but is later swapped for RAM and/or moved to a higher  address by special hardware. Code may also be copied from ROM to RAM (possibly at a different address) for execution. There are several possible reasons for doing this:-\n\nRAM may have a shorter cycle time than ROM, so code which is copied to RAM will execute faster, requiring fewer (or no) wait states.\nThe ROM needs to be at location 0 at startup because code execution starts at location 0. However interrupt vectors also appear in the low memory area, and if they are in ROM then they cannot be changed at run time.   \nAbsolute short addressing (which can only access the first and last 32k of memory) is a little quicker than long addressing, so it may be desirable to have RAM in this area for storing frequently accessed variables.\n\nYou should analyze the code starting from location 0, verifying that it does essential stuff such as loading the stack pointer, clearing RAM and initializing I/O hardware. Then look for anything that copies executable code from ROM to RAM, and I/O operations that might change the memory map. From this you should be able to figure what is really at the locations those jsr instructions are pointing to.\nYou don't say exactly which CPU this code is for, and frankly I can't be bothered trawling through all the Coldfire V2 datasheets to find out what they can do. But you should, because it might have a feature which is relevant to your problem. For a full understanding you should also trace the circuit to determine the locations and functions of I/O pins etc. When reverse-engineering, every bit of information helps!\n",
