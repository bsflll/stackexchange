    "content": "I've download recaf jar file and install JDK 8. When I execute it/start it, it all works fine with <pre><code>java -jar recaf-2.12.0-J8-jar-with-dependencies.jar</code></pre>. I open a class file also no problem. The issue is when I try to edit it is disabled saying:\n<pre><code>// =============================================== //\n// Recompile disabled. Please run Recaf with a JDK //\n// =============================================== //\n\n// Decompiled with: CFR 0.150\n...\n</code></pre>\nAny idea why and how to solve this issue? This is my first time using recaf as well so it might be a newbie question.\n",

Most of Recaf is based on the assembler, which you can find documentation on here: \"Class editing modes\"\n\nThis problem may still persist after a basic installation of Java 8 because the required platform tools are not added to the classpath. There is documentation on what files are required, where they are, and where you need to place them here: \"Java 8 setup\"\n\nAlternatively you can update to Java 11 or higher where none of this configuration is necessary.\n",
