    "content": "I have found problem with finding file offset which actually is program entry point.\nIn case I experience problem, value of AddressOfEntryPoint is 0x1018. Here is a section which maps this address.\n\nI assume entry point should be <pre><code>0x28 = 0x10 + 0x1018 - 0x1000 (PointerToRawData + AddressOfEntryPoint - VirtualAddress)</code></pre>\nHowever tools says it is 0x18 instead. I'm not sure why, made some experiments and came up with another formula. \n<pre><code>0x18 = (0x10 / 0x200) * 0x200 + 0x1018 - 0x1000 ((PointerToRawData / FileAlignment) * FileAlignment + AddressOfEntryPoint - VirtualAddress)\n</code></pre>\nI use FileAlignment from OptionalHeader and it works great, however I don't know if it is a coincidence or somewhere documented, so asking here for confirmation.\n\nAlso, probably not important, but file is packed with UPack(0.399), packer signature BE****AD50FF7634EB7C4801.\n",

So I think there should be something related to FileAlignment and PointerToRawData values, because msdn says PointerToRawData should be multiple of FileAlignment, however it is not.</span>",
