    "content": "I bought a broken Zoom H4n audio recorder, expecting an easy repair. What I got is a little bit over my head. It isn't booting (beyond a certain point) and I can't enter the firmware update tool. I think the firmware update has been interrupted.\n\nSo I have hooked up its flash chip (EN29LV160B) to an Arduino and now I can read the contents. I was hoping to actually see some familiar features in the firmware file and in memory, so that I could align them and just write missing bytes manually. But of course it isn't that easy. In fact I don't even know if I have set up and am reading all the lsb ... msb in the right order.\nIn the firmware.bin file using a hex editor I am occasionally finding things like: \n<pre><code>...M.I.X.E.R. .E.N.A.B.L.E.....O.F.F. . . . . ...O.N. . . . . . ...O.F.F. .\n. . . ...+.4.8.V. . . . ...+.2.4.V. . . . ...O.F.F. . . . . ...C.O.M.P.1. .\n. ...C.O.M.P.2. . . ...C.O.M.P.3. . . ...L.I.M.I.T.1. . ...L.I.M.I.T.2. . .\n...L.I.M.I.T.3. . ...O.F.F. . . . . . . . . . . . . ...C.O.M.P.1.\n(.G.E.N.E.R.A.L.). . ...C.O.M.P.2.(.V.O.C.A.L.)` \n</code></pre>\nBut, not in my chip data.\nIn my Arduino program I have tried many possible bit inversions and rearrangements, and this yielded the best result (as in few unknown, tab and newline symbols)\n<pre><code>void loop() {\n  char reading = 0;\n\n  if (address == 2097152)\n    while(1)\n      delay(1);\n\n   if (address%16==0){\n    Serial.println();\n    Serial.print(address);\n    Serial.print(\" \");\n   }\n\n  for (uint8_t i = 0; i < 21; i++)\n    digitalWrite(adress[i], bitRead(address, i));\n\n  for (uint8_t i = 0; i < 8; i++)\n    bitWrite(reading,i,!digitalRead(inputs[7-i]));\n\n  Serial.print(reading);\n  Serial.print(\" \");\n\n  address++;\n}\n</code></pre>\nBut the output still has no human-recognizable contents. \nAnything else I could try?\n",
