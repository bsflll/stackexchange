    "content": "I'm analyzing a Seagate HDD that provides a serial boot console that allows reading/writing bytes to memory and setting an address pointer.\nThere's a block of memory from <pre><code>0x0</code></pre> to <pre><code>0x20000</code></pre> and then it repeats all the way to <pre><code>0x100000</code></pre>. This isn't just a copy - if I write a byte to <pre><code>0x20000</code></pre> or <pre><code>0x40000</code></pre> the data at location <pre><code>0x0</code></pre> also changes. At <pre><code>0x100000</code></pre> there's another <pre><code>128k</code></pre> block that is mirrored over and over until <pre><code>0x200000</code></pre>. From <pre><code>0x400000</code></pre> the first block of memory is mirrored again and again.\nHere's a map:\n<pre><code>1) 0x000000 - 0x020000\n*) (mirrors of block 1)\n2) 0x100000 - 0x120000\n*) (mirrors of block 2)\n3) 0x200000 - 0x300000\n4) 0x300000 - 0x400000\n*) (mirrors of block 1)\n</code></pre>\nThe <pre><code>MCU</code></pre> is some kind of <pre><code>ARM</code></pre> processor. Is this some hardware memory-mapping feature of <pre><code>ARM</code></pre>, is it setup by the <pre><code>OS</code></pre>, or something else?\n",

            "content": "The block selection logic just looks at the 4 most significant bits of the address, this is easily implemented by a multiplexer whose outputs feed into the enable pin of each memory chip. An 3 bit multiplexer and an OR gate (if active high) is enough to implement this scheme.\nThe mirroring within a block happens by not connecting the next set of significant bits to the memory chip, (likely because it just doesn't have the address space).\ntl;dr it's a hardware memory map based on how the controller and memory chips are connected on the PCB. And it's something that needs a redesign to adjust.\n",
