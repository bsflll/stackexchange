    "content": "I'm trying to modify an openWRT frimware in order to be able to flash it in a router, these are the steps:\n\n\ndownload the latest nbg-419n2-initramfs-kernel.bin use hexedit and\nchange first 4 bytes to “Zyxel-like” u-boot magic number FF A8 30 90\ncount new CRC32 of u-boot header (64 bytes) and write next 4 bytes (7A\nBE 7A CE for\nopenwrt-18.06.5-ramips-rt305x-nbg-419n2-initramfs-kernel.bin)\nstart tftp server IP 192.168.1.82 rename changed image file to NBG419Nv2.bin\nand set to tftp server connect any lan port with server press and hold\nthe WPS key button on device and power on after 20-30 second your\nopenWrt on ip 192.168.1.1 is ready and waiting\n\n\nStep 3 is the problem for me, I can't figure out how to calculate the new CRC32 of the u-boot header. I don't know where does it start and ends, I know it's a 64 bytes however.\nWhat do I use to calculate it? (I tried <pre><code>crc32</code></pre> tool on Linux)\n",
