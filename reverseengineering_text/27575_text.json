    "content": "I'm writing a pin tool (Windows, x64, PIN 3.18), and it starts like this:\n<pre><code>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n    std::cerr << \"Initializing...\" << std::endl;\n</code></pre>\nThis is how I'm calling the tool:\n<pre><code>C:\\pin\\intel64\\bin\\pin -t C:\\pin\\source\\tools\\MyPinTool\\x64\\Release\\MyPinTool.dll -- mspaint.exe</code></pre>\nNothing is ever printed to stderr. <pre><code>fprintf(stderr, ...)</code></pre> also prints nothing. stdout seems to behave in the same way.\nThe tool itself works, and if I instead fprintf to a file, that works as well.\nIt doesn't seem to me like I'm deviating from the docs examples.\nI also searched in the docs for stuff related to output with no luck.\nWhy is nothing getting printed?\n",

            "content": "The pintool is a DLL which is injected into the target process and runs in its context. Since mspaint is a GUI program, it does not have a console to which print output could go. You have the following options:\n\nChange mspaint.exe subsystem to console so that a console window is allocated on startup.\nCall <pre><code>AllocConsole()</code></pre> in your pintool and set up stdout/stderr to go there (not sure about the details here).\nUse an explicitly opened log file for output instead of stderr.\n",
