Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post.\n\n\nClosed 7 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Improve this question\n                    \n\n\n\nI read an article on x64dbg blog(https://x64dbg.com/blog/2016/07/09/introducing-contemporary-reverse-engineering-technique-to-real-world-use.html) which mentions modern techniques of reverse engineering e.g., trace record, back tracing, Parallel debugging.\nWhat else modern techniques of reverse engineering you can tell?\nIs there any place I can learn all about it?(I don't expect too much on this)\nI'm learning reverse only on windows now, If I learn reverse engineering on Linux too will I learn more techniques?\nEdit:\nMore specific, What debug feature you think is useful but windbg don't have?\n",

It may be easier or harder to do some procedure in different systems but, most of the time you can do the same thing in other even if it is not equal semantically.\n",
