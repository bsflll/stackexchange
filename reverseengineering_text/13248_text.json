            "content": "Few things to note here:\n\nThe reason for the overly long output is because firmware-mod-kit automatically compiles itself the first time it is run by the user. Running it again now or manually compiling before execution should yield a relatively short output.\nfirmware-mod-kit did not simply fail with \"No supported filesystem found\". It failed with a python error that caused a premature termination of the tool.\nThe python error was <pre><code>str() takes at most 1 argument (2 given)</code></pre>, which is an error widely known to come from trying to run python3 code with a python2 interpreter.\n",
