    "content": "There is an implant in me, is there a way to identify the frequency it is receiving signals on?\nI don't want to share the evidence and my reasoning for believing there is an implant in me, you can either take my word for it or not.\nI want to find the frequency it is receiving signals on, so far I have used dvb-t dongle to use it as an SDR, and I have manually scanned the entire frequency range provided by it, which is 24MHz to 1700MHz, which was very tiring, but I couldn't identify anything suspicious, it could be possible that as I was tuning, the frequency it was receiving signals on was not the tuned one.\nI want to know if there a way to identify the frequency of the signal? How? And what equipment would I need?\n",
