    "content": "So I am wondering why I cannot do this \n<pre><code>mov eax, ffffffffh\n</code></pre>\nbut I can do this:\n<pre><code>mov eax, 0ffffffffh\n</code></pre>\nCould anybody explain please? In this case, I am using the Flat Assembler but I think this is not assembler-specific.\n",

            "content": "Most assemblers require numeric constants to begin with a digit, this is so they can distinguish between them and labels.  \nYou can see it in FASM Fundamental syntax rules:\n\nNumbers are distinguished from names by the fact that they either\n  begin with a decimal digit, or with the \"$\" character followed by any\n  hexadecimal digit. This means that a token can be considered numeric\n  even when it is not a valid number. To be a correct one it must be one\n  of the following: a decimal number (optionally with the letter \"d\"\n  attached at the end), a binary number followed by the letter \"b\", an\n  octal number followed by the letter \"o\" or \"q\", or a hexadecimal\n  number either prepended with \"$\" or \"0x\", or followed by the character\n  \"h\". Because the first digit of a hexadecimal number can be a letter,\n  it may be needed to prepend it with the digit zero in order to make it\n  recognizable as a number. For example, \"0Ah\" is a valid number, while\n  \"Ah\" is just a name.\n\nand in MASM Manual as well:\n\nHexadecimal numbers must always start with a decimal digit (0â€“9). If\n  necessary, add a leading zero to distinguish between symbols and\n  hexadecimal numbers that start with a letter.\n\nLooking at <pre><code>0ffffffffh</code></pre> you can see 8 significant hex digits, exactly as you'd expect. This is not unique to <pre><code>0ffffffffh</code></pre>, another numeric literals should be written with a leading zero as well --  <pre><code>0d1h</code></pre>, <pre><code>0aah</code></pre>, <pre><code>0b0h</code></pre>.  \nThese days it is common for assemblers to support the <pre><code>0xffffffff</code></pre> syntax. If yours is not (FLAT supports it), make sure to pay attention to the leading zero, otherwise the hexadecimal value would be interpreted as a label or another symbol name.\n",
