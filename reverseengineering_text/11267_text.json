It's an an array of pointers to statically-imported API function addresses. The IAT entries gets populated at runtime.\nThe format of the IAT is typically as follows, with all functions from a particular DLL grouped together, with a null-pointer separating each DLL's list of function addresses:\n<pre><code><pointer to DLL #1's function A>, <pointer to DLL #1's function B>, <pointer to DLL #1's function C>, 0x00000000, <pointer to DLL #2's function D>, <pointer to DLL #2's function E>, ..., 0x00000000</code></pre>\nNote that this format isn't required, but it's the most common format.\n\nNow I don't udnerstand how he know where the end of the IAT just from looking on the dump?\n\nI highlighted each IAT function below (with mspaint), with a different color for each DLL grouping. At virtual address <pre><code>0x0049380C</code></pre> we see the function addresses <pre><code>0x735FE9D0</code></pre>, <pre><code>0x73654AC0</code></pre>, etc. You can tell that they're likely from the same DLL because:\n\nThere's no null-pointer separating them, and\nThey're all in the same address range (<pre><code>0x735F0000</code></pre> - <pre><code>0x7366FFFF</code></pre>)\n\n\nThe DWORD at <pre><code>0x00493850</code></pre> (after the null-pointer at <pre><code>0x0049384C</code></pre>) is <pre><code>0x1000176E</code></pre>, so you can look up that address in your debugger and see if there's DLL code loaded at that address. If not, <pre><code>0x0049384C</code></pre> would mark the end of the IAT. If so, <pre><code>0x00493854</code></pre> would mark the end of the IAT since the data at <pre><code>0x00493858</code></pre> is the beginning of an ASCII string and clearly not a valid function pointer.\n",

Becuase on the names tab I see there is something that called \"ShowUpdateDialog\". It sound like a dll but its an export type not an import.</span>",
