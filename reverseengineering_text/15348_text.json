    "content": "I have a bluetooth LE home automation style device, that connects to a mobile app. There are 2 values which are updated roughly every second. I'm trying to extract these numbers from the payload. I've narrowed the frames down to these examples below.\n<pre><code>00-02-7B-02-9E-00-0F-3B-84-DD-30\n00-02-7C-02-A8-00-0F-3B-84-DD-30\n00-02-7C-02-A9-00-0F-3B-84-DD-30\n00-02-7B-02-A2-00-0F-3B-85-60-42\n00-02-7C-02-AD-00-0F-3B-85-1E-B9\n</code></pre>\nThe 2 numbers I'm trying to extract should be a PSI/bar/other pressure value of around 50psi/339bar and the other should be between 1 and 5ish. \nIt looks like the values are split on the <pre><code>00</code></pre> in the hex.\nI've been using this tool hex to int converter to try and split the hex up, but I can't get the values I'm expecting.\n",
