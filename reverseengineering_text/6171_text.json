If you have an Android phone that can run the executable it's pretty easy; IDA comes with prebuilt debugging servers for ARM that you can stand up and port forward to to use the debugger. I'm assuming this might not be applicable since you jumped straight to QEMU but figured I should at least ask\n",

Just to debug you will probably get stuck using GDB as you can't run the arm binary in your current environment. \nLet me know if you have more questions.\n",
