It's based on Wireshark 1.6.5, and it works with Windows Vista and above. It has been released to the public in December 2012 for research purposes, and I've been using it since then. Not only does it work - you can filter the traffic through the columns - but it's quite fast.\nThe blog post Process Attribution In Network Traffic from their developers explains it in detail.\n",

You can view the trace on another machine using netmon.\n",

For established TCP sockets, this information could potentially be looked up on-the-fly, but there is no way to express a capture filter to limit filtering to a single process.\nSome of the options are:\n\nIf you know that an application contacts certain IP addresses or ports, you could specify a capture filter such as <pre><code>udp port 53</code></pre> or <pre><code>host example.com</code></pre>.\nRun a program in a virtual machine (VM) and capture traffic from within the VM, or from the bridge attached to the outside of the VM.\nOn Linux, create an isolated network namespace and use a virtual Ethernet (veth) pair to connect the new network namespace with the main network namespace. Capture from either end of the veth interface and start your process within the network namespace.\n\nFor the latter approach, I wrote some scripts to automate it, it can be found at https://github.com/Lekensteyn/netns. It was precisely designed for this purpose, create a network capture from a single process (and its children) without leaking other traffic.\nVarious other approaches such as using eBPF and custom dissectors to add process information, as well as potential approaches for Windows and macOS can be found in these issues on the Wireshark issue tracker:\n\nBug 16194 - Allow us to filter traffic by sending or receiving process\nBug 1184 - *Shark should support associating TCP and UDP packets with processes\n",
