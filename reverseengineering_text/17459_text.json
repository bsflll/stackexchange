    "content": "I am analyzing a malware at the moment which scans for a lot of filenames and ClassNames to recognize if it is under supervision or not.\nMy problem is, that all the filenames and ClassNames are stored as Hashes. Therefore i did some kind of dictionary attack (with a list of tools I know). It was very effective - but out of 20 hashes, i am still missing one!\nI am searching for days now... it drives me crazy :D\n\nThe hashed ClassName is: 0x56151B4F\nThe hashing algorithm is: https://repl.it/repls/MaroonIrritatingAchillestang\nMy list of tools (dict) is: \nhttps://gist.github.com/atar-axis/b3e16ccf75852f7cb59a7e169be230b1\n\nAs you can see, there are some tools missing in my list - can you complete it?\nPlease think of your most favourite tools and take a look at the list - are they already in there? :) \nThank you very much in advance!\nIn case you need a list like this one day, feel free to use it.\n",

Extremely easy in Windows with blah.exe/dll/â€¦ name structure, and in Unices just look for alphanumeric space. This is a basic approach in \"cryptanalysis\". OP if you already have your collisions, then you're already half done, not need for Z3.</span>",
