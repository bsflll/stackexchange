    "content": "The only method i know to break on a <pre><code>DriverEntry</code></pre> of a rootkit driver when its loaded is to disassmble <pre><code>nt!IopLoadDriver</code></pre> and find an indirect call in it and break on it. Setting a break point on <pre><code>rootkitDriverName!DriverEntry</code></pre> doesn't work either for some reason.\nIs there any easier way to break on the rootkit driver entry? Why does <pre><code>rootkitDriverName!DriverEntry</code></pre> not work?\n",

(I am loading the driver using OSRloader)</span>",
