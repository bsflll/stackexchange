Perhaps setting the register myself?\nIf so, how would I go about doing this? Is there a guide or tutorial on this?\nI'm new what I'm thinking is that there must be some kind of easy to set the entry point, the registers the function is using, run code until a <pre><code>ret</code></pre> and then see what happened?\n",

            "content": "As you correctly mentioned, this is a pseudo C code which output a C-like code. This code can't be compiled since it's not a valid C code. This output can be shown using the <pre><code>pdc</code></pre> command.\nradare2 contains plugins for decompilers like Snowman and retdec. You can read more about it and my answer here. With these decompilers you have high chances to success with compiling the generated code. In general, it is not recommended to rely on decompilation to achieve 1:1 result compared to the original source code. Decompilation is very complex and has high probability to fail and miss some information.\nRegarding to make changes to registers -- although it is not \"outside of the process\" you can do it internally from radare by using the <pre><code>dr</code></pre> command.\nFor example, to change EAX to 0x20 you can simply execute:\n<pre><code>dr eax=0x20\n</code></pre>\nAnd in case you ask in general whether you can change registers by yourself, the answer is yes. Just insert ASM code to you C program:\n<pre><code>__asm {\n  mov eax, 5\n  add eax, 3\n}\n</code></pre>\n",

It isn't all too known a feature (and it should be!) but IDA makes an effort letting you use functions inside the binary in isolation. Check out the link for usage details.\nUsing a debugger. This may not be what you're asking about but you could easily provide register values and execute a function until a <pre><code>ret</code></pre> instruction using any debugger.\nUsing one of the many dynamic instrumentation and emulators out there, you can simulate an execution of a given function and state (i.e. registers, etc). angr is one such tool.\n",
