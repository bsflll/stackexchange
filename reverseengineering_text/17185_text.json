    "content": "I'd like to reverse engineer a JavaScript program by manually renaming minimified variable, parameter and function names. However, updating my reverse-engineered code to a newer version would be very difficult, because:\n\nThe minimized variable names are randomized every time, which makes it hard to see what changed between two versions\nEven if the variable names were static, I'd have to keep track of which variable means what, which is very difficult because variable names are not globally unique, but rather per-scope\n\nIs there any tool that could:\n\nAutomatically rename variables to unique names keeping track of their scope\nBe able to find difference between two versions by looking at the code structure but ignoring changes in the variable names, and assign names to new variables without conflicting the old ones\nAutomatically rename these variables based on an mapping file, such as <pre><code>var584 -> readPacket, var585 -> writePacket, ...</code></pre>\nAutomatically convert minimified statements such as <pre><code>condition && statement;</code></pre> to <pre><code>if (!condition) { statement; }</code></pre>, and <pre><code>!0</code></pre> to <pre><code>true</code></pre>\n",
