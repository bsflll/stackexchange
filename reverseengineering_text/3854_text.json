    "content": "In tracing how the recv function works on Windows, I observe the following trace:\n<pre><code>...\n0x743817d2  push eax                      C:\\windows\\system32\\WSOCK32.dll recv                     \n0x743817d3  push dword ptr [ebp+0x8]      C:\\windows\\system32\\WSOCK32.dll recv                     \n0x743817d6  call 0x7438193e               C:\\windows\\system32\\WSOCK32.dll recv                     \n0x7438193e  jmp dword ptr [0x74381000]    C:\\windows\\system32\\WSOCK32.dll setsockopt               \n0x77287089  mov edi, edi                  C:\\windows\\syswow64\\WS2_32.dll  WSARecv                  \n0x7728708b  push ebp                      C:\\windows\\syswow64\\WS2_32.dll  WSARecv                  \n0x7728708c  mov ebp, esp                  C:\\windows\\syswow64\\WS2_32.dll  WSARecv  \n...\n</code></pre>\nUnfortunately, once again I found it quite strange. First, there is a direct call: \n<pre><code>call 0x7438193e\n</code></pre>\ninside <pre><code>recv</code></pre>. I still do not understand why that works: since the <pre><code>WSOCK32.dll</code></pre> (containing <pre><code>recv</code></pre>) will be loaded \"arbitrarily\" in the user-space, how does <pre><code>recv</code></pre> guarantee that the <pre><code>setsockopt</code></pre> locates at this address?. \nSecond, I see nowhere in the application (here it is wget) can modify the memory at <pre><code>0x74381000</code></pre> (that is the target of <pre><code>jmp</code></pre> inside <pre><code>setsockopt</code></pre>), so normally the value at this address is always <pre><code>0x77287089</code></pre> and that means <pre><code>recv</code></pre> calls always <pre><code>WSARecv</code></pre>(!!!). I doubt that is not true because there is no official document (i.e. MSDN) saying that. \nMany thanks for any consideration.\n",
