    "content": "I read my process memory with WinHex in order to remove some sensitive text which may running my app into crack/hack.(license data).\nNow , when i open the process Entire memory with in WinHex , i can easily search and find those sensitive data , but when i open each sub-module memory one by one , i can not find them !!\nHow this is possible ?\nIs there any floating memory in each process which does not belong to process itself and it's sub-modules ?\nUpdate :\nThe strange thing is each time this data appear on a completely different offset !\nI appreciate for your answer.\nThank you.\n",

And even inside the address range of modules you'll find cavities which can be (ab)used to store data. A technique that was at some point in fashion for VXers/malware authors.\n",

Note that there can be multiple levels of indirections for a specific memory block. You may be able to use Cheat Engine to discover a pointer chain to the area of interest.\n",
