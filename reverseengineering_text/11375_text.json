    "content": "I'm trying to calculate the check sum of a m-bus data frame. In page 1 of this PDF I'm able to read that the frame's check sum \"is calculated from the arithmetical sum of the data mentioned above, without taking carry digits into account\". The data I have above are the bytes:\n\nStart\nL Field\nL Field\nStart\nC Field\nA Field\nCI Field\nCheck sum\nStop\n\nIn page 2 we can find that one example of a valid data frame is:\n<pre><code>68 03 03 68 53 01 BB 0F 16\n</code></pre>\nIn hexadecimal, being 0F the check sum. Unfortunately I must be doing something wrong because I'm not able to reach that value.\nCould someone explain how this algorithm, to find the check sum, works?\n",
