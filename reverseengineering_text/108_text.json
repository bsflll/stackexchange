    "content": "AMD64 (aka x86-64 or x64) registers can be accessed 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits at a time. When reading a disassembly listing, what register operations are not straightforward?\nFor example, when an instruction accesses part of a register, how does it affect other parts?\nWhat typical instructions or sequences of instructions used by optimizers might encode something that isn't obvious (e.g. xoring a register with itself to set it to zero)?\n",

It should be far more focused, at the very least restricted to a particular topic and preferably to a particular compiler or platform (e.g. stack manipulations in Visual C++). Because there has already been one answer, I've proposed an edit that focuses on that answer's topic: register manipulations.\n",
