    "content": "The sample I try to analyze starts with PUSHAD. It begins with:\n<pre><code>   PUSHAD\n   MOV ESI, unbr002.0109D000\n   LEA EDI, DWORD PTR DS:[ESI+FFEA4000]\n   MOV DWORD PTR DS: [EDI+208C04], 8C1FE\n   PUSH EDI\n   OR EBP, FFFFFFFF\n   JMP SHORT unbr002.0117C2EA\n   NOP\n   NOP\n   ....\n</code></pre>\nWhat I did:\nFirst, I try the ESP trick   (step over PUSHAD, double-click on ESP -> Follow in Dump etc. ) which does not work.\nThen, I search the counterpart of PUSHAD, the POPAD instruction and put a breakpoint on it. After that, I click on F9 to run the program until the BP is hit. Then I saw this:\n<pre><code>  POPAD\n  LEA EAX, DWORD PTR DS:[ESP-80]\n  PUSH 0\n  CMP ESP, EAX\n  JNZ SHORT unbr002.0117C4BC        a)\n  SUB ESP, -80\n  JMP unbr002.01048A05              b) \n  JMP SHORT unbr002.0117C4CC\n  PUSH ESI\n  MOV ESI, unbr002.010961A4\n  CLD\n  LODS DWORD PTR DS:[ESI]\n  TEST EAX, EAX\n  JE SHORT unbr002.0117C4E5\n  PUSH 3\n  POP ECX\n  PUSH DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+10]\n  LOOPD SHORT unbr002.0117C4D3\n  POP ESI\n  RETN 0C\n  DB 00\n  DB 00\n  .....\n  .....\n</code></pre>\nSo, I know that after POPAD, a so called tail jump will come to bring me to the OEP.\nWhen I go to a) nothing happens, I mean the jump is not taken.\nWhen I go to b), (I did not step over/into, only click on ENTER) then it jumps to the following place:\n<pre><code> CALL unbr002.01055C47\n</code></pre>\nHere, I also look into the function at 01055C47 which looks like this(I will only type the relevant part of this because the function is too big):\n<pre><code> .....\n CALL DWORD PTR DS:[109407C]       kernel32.GetSystemTimeAsFileTime\n MOV ESI, DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-4]\n XOR ESI, DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-8]\n CALL DWORD PTR DS:[10940F4]       kernel32.GetCurrentProcessId\n XOR ESI, EAX\n CALL DWORD PTR DS:[10940E0]       kernel32.GetCurrentThreadId\n XOR ESI, EAX \n CALL DWORD PTR DS:[10942BC]       kernel32.GetTickCount\n XOR ESI, EAX\n LEA EAX, DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-10]\n PUSH EAX\n CALL DWORD PTR DS:[109442C0]      kernel32.QueryPerformanceCounter\n ...\n ...\n ...\n</code></pre>\nSo, from other sources I have read that these functions above GetTickCount, etc. are anti-debug tricks. But I could not find a way to defeat them. \nSo, look at b) again. \nNow, when I step over the JMP instruction at b) then the process is terminated.\nmy question:\nWhat must I do to handle that problem?\nPS: \na) I have the ollydbg plugin OllyAdvanced, and I have checked the box TerminateProcess in ollyAdvanced without a success.\nb) I also know that it is packed with UPX, but I try to make my own learn process a little bit harder and for that reason I try to manuelly unpack it\nbest regards,\n",
