    "content": "I have an (ARM) object file that I want to inspect. There are some instructions that load addresses pointing to another area in the object file. I would like to see the contents of the area, but <pre><code>objdump -Ds</code></pre> shows <pre><code>...</code></pre> and skips the whole section. For example:\n<pre><code>000230cc <heap_size_129>:\n   230cc:       00000000        andeq   r0, r0, r0\n\n000230d0 <small_integers>:\n        ...\n\n000231d8 <heap_size_33>:\n   231d8:       00000000        andeq   r0, r0, r0\n</code></pre>\nHere, I need the contents of <pre><code>small_integers</code></pre>. Does <pre><code>...</code></pre> mean it is full of <pre><code>andeq r0,r0,r0</code></pre> (i.e., <pre><code>null</code></pre>)?\nI cannot find other flags beside <pre><code>-Ds</code></pre> in the <pre><code>objdump</code></pre> manpage that may help here.\n",
