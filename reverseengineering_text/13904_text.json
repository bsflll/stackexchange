            "content": "The C compiler handles sign extension automatically for signed variables when they're converted into bigger/wider signed variables. However, you defined that variable as a <pre><code>char</code></pre> which the standard does not enforce sign-ness for, so the compiler is not obligated to sign-extend that variable assignment.\nBut the most important part is that only when you replaced the <pre><code>char</code></pre> with an <pre><code>int</code></pre> you created a variable 4 bytes long that could actually be sign extended.\nLast but not least, removing the minus mark obviously removed the <pre><code>NEG EDX</code></pre> instruction.\nIf you didn't, looks like you still need to change the assignment line (<pre><code>str[32] = *(a+6);</code></pre>) to treat the destination as a dword sized array, because you're interested in assigning the entire dword. Your code will still have <pre><code>MOV BYTE PTR SS:[EBP-20],DL</code></pre> instead of <pre><code>MOV DWORD PTR SS: [EBP-20],EDX</code></pre> unless you have something like <pre><code>(int*)str[8] = *(a+6);</code></pre>\nI replaced the 32 with an 8 because we're indexing 4-byte long array instead of a single byte long array.\n",
