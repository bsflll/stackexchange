            "content": "I have one solution after mucking around for a while, I'm sure I can find something better, in the meantime however here you go.\nUsing the 'Memory Map' Tab you can create a memory breakpoint on code sections\nRight click on a section->Memory Breakpoint->Execute->Restore\nThen you can edit the breakpoint condition to be something like this\n(I am using a 64 bit process)\n\nI just figured out how to reduce the range of this.\nYou can use Log Condition like this:\n<pre><code>00007FF6D2F71000 < rip < 00007FF6D2F72000</code></pre>\nwhich is symbolically\n<pre><code>start_address < eip < end_address</code></pre>\nor\n<pre><code>start_address < rip < end_address</code></pre>\nIt works pretty well. I'll update if I find any better alternatives\nEDIT:\nhttps://x64dbg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/Expression-functions.html\nhttps://x64dbg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/Expressions.html\nRead some of the docs for the cool stuff you can do\nI managed to get it to log only call instructions, and print the address and instruction using\n<pre><code>dis.iscall(rip)</code></pre> in Break Condition and\n<pre><code>{rip}:{i:rip}</code></pre> in Log Expression\nThanks for asking this question, this is actually really useful stuff I never thought of before.\n",
