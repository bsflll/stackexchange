    "content": "I am thinking of buying IDA Pro for my Linux programming environment after reverse engineering a bit with OllyDBG (under WINE)... But before I endorse into such a costly purchase I ask the following question(s):\n\nIf I have native IDA Pro on Linux, can it disassemble/decompile a Windows PE (or Mac OS X apps as a bonus)?\n\n\nIf not, when I multi boot Windows, can I download the Windows version of IDA on the Windows without purchasing it again?\n\nMotive\nSome renowned programs I'd like to reverse (for fun) are Windows executables, so if it can't disassemble a Windows executable from Linux, I'll have to multi boot (tedious)\nNote\nIf it helps, I have a 32-bit machine with a x86 processor\n",

You can definitely analyze PE and Mach-O files on Linux. Most debuggers are also available on all platforms.\nA couple of features are available only in the Windows version:\n\nWinDbg and Symbian debuggers\nWinCE debugging over ActiveSync\nPDB symbol parsing\n\nNote: the last function is available on Linux and OS X if you can run the <pre><code>win32_remote.exe</code></pre> debugger on a Windows system/emulator.\n",

There are .pdf forms that break out the pricing for IDA/IDA Pro. You must purchase the Linux and Windows version separately. As far as I understand, the disassemblers for IDA/IDA Pro are the same across platforms. You can see the differences in included disassemblers per edition here. As one of the other answers to this question has pointed out, some of the integrated debuggers are not included on non-Windows versions.\n",

IDA uses some Microsoft dll's for parsing.\nAnother point:\nAs IDA is a 32bit application (even the 64bit disassembler) you always have to use remote debuggers for handling 64bit applications.\nIDA works well for me with Wine under Linux. So I bought the Windows version to have all the features and use it either native under Windows or via Wine(Crossover) under Linux.\n",
