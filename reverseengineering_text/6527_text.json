    "content": "I got some game compression data which I couldn't find any clue.\nAll compressed file signature start with: [SK_ASC] and unknown compression method.\nI got some information from RAM/Executive file but still didn't work.\nI think the compression is the lossless format (But it's not a LZO nor ZLIB).\nCan anyone help me figure out the compression, and how to decompress?\n\nAll of example file above can be found here: http://goo.gl/JJQfl4\n\n=== 10.25.14 ADDED ===\nThe list below compression method that I tested, but doesn't match:\n\nLZ10\nLZ11\nLZ77\nLZO1x-1\nLZO1x-999\nLZSS\nLZW\nLZMA\nHUFF blocksize 4 & 8 byte\nRLE\nZLIB\n\n=== 10.26.14 ADDED ===\nToday I analysis something via memory dump.\nFirst of all, compressed <pre><code>EMnMenu.cmp</code></pre> file could be loaded when I enter the main menu by guessing it's file name. and there are very similar files which is unused. (<pre><code>EKisokMenu.cmp</code></pre>, <pre><code>EE3Menu.cmp</code></pre>)\nSo I try to check memory dump by replacing file each other. and I got <pre><code>dump_menu.ram</code></pre>, <pre><code>dump_e3menu.ram</code></pre>, <pre><code>dump_kioskmenu.ram</code></pre>. By comparing three different ram dump data, I found out only specific offset data is changed.\nBy using this method, I finally got a decompression data dumped via offset: 0x80CA6980. Decompressed data is well known texture which was first 4 byte signature  start with 0x00 0x20 0xAF 0x30. (check texture format here: http://goo.gl/UqLz3m)\nI try to find compression algorithm by compressing the decompression data and compare with original data. but non of algorithm that I test above doesn't match.\nAnyway, I uploaded several decompressed data via ram dump and compressed data so you can check here: goo.gl/JJQfl4\n\nCMP is a compressed data which always start with SK_ASC.\nBIN is a same as CMP.\nDCMP is a instant copy from memory file, which was extracted from offset 0x80CA6980.\nDMP is a data value correction by subtracted 0x80CA6980 because there so many memory scrapping dummy (so this is the cleaned decompressed data if I guess right)\n\nADDED Didn't work with regular deflate/zlib all compress level.\n== 11.09.14 ==\nI posted several forum to help, but no clue for weeks :(\n\nhttp://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=313&sid=3172c154c5da95476795ac742501fec1\nhttp://encode.ru/threads/2074-Identifying-compression-method?p=41188&posted=1#post41188\n\n== 11.15.14 ==\nOther forum user said to me there are Gamecube DOL (executive file) plugin for IDA.\nSo I use them and now I've found decompression main/algorithm subroutine.\nWould anyone help me find out describe how it works?\n(I'm not well in dis-assembly, So I'm learning now)\nhttp://goo.gl/2bQNfj\nPower PC based Dis-Assembly skill Required\n",
