    "content": "I'm using WinDbg to debug a program under WOW64 (OS is x64, app is 32-bit).\nI came across some indirect call inside the process module (module created by the app and not Windows), and started following it.\nStepping into this call gets me to an <pre><code>(*)</code></pre> address which doesn't match any loaded module:\nTried to search manually with <pre><code>lm</code></pre>, didn't see a match.\nUsed <pre><code>!address</code></pre> command with that address, and it says the page is committed but the protection is <pre><code>PAGE_NOACCESS</code></pre>.\nAlso the stack trace gives me a warning \"frame ip not in any known module\".\nStepping one more, I get again an indirect call to <pre><code>fs[0c0h]</code></pre> which is a stub for <pre><code>WOW32Reserved</code></pre> (after some more single stepping I get into <pre><code>ntdll.dll</code></pre>. So it's obviously some WOW64 code).\nThe question is, where did the code in <pre><code>(*)</code></pre> came from? Who's responsible for it? Why isn't it mapped to any module?\n",

            "content": "This sounds like the process has allocated a page for itself, in which it has placed code to run.  It might be a form of obfuscation, or if the file was packed, then the unpacker code might be in that page.  If you're able to step into the code, then it can't be <pre><code>PAGE_NOACCESS</code></pre>, so perhaps the debugger is confused.  The call through <pre><code>fs[0c0h]</code></pre> is the interface for 32-bit code to call kernel code in a 64-bit environment.  Depending on the version of Windows, there is either a far jump at that location (pre-Win10), or some stack manipulation followed by a <pre><code>retf</code></pre> (Win10).\n",
