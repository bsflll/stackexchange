Typically, I encounter this syntax when I activate the canaries in GCC (<pre><code>-fstack-protector</code></pre>), as in the following example:\n<pre><code>(gdb) disas\nDump of assembler code for function foo:\n   0x000000000040057c <+0>: push   %rbp\n   0x000000000040057d <+1>: mov    %rsp,%rbp\n   0x0000000000400580 <+4>: sub    $0x20,%rsp\n   0x0000000000400584 <+8>: mov    %edi,-0x14(%rbp)\n=> 0x0000000000400587 <+11>:    mov    %fs:0x28,%rax\n   0x0000000000400590 <+20>:    mov    %rax,-0x8(%rbp)\n   0x0000000000400594 <+24>:    xor    %eax,%eax\n   0x0000000000400596 <+26>:    mov    $0x4006ac,%edi\n   0x000000000040059b <+31>:    callq  0x400440 <puts@plt>\n   0x00000000004005a0 <+36>:    mov    -0x8(%rbp),%rax\n   0x00000000004005a4 <+40>:    xor    %fs:0x28,%rax\n   0x00000000004005ad <+49>:    je     0x4005b4 <foo+56>\n   0x00000000004005af <+51>:    callq  0x400450 <__stack_chk_fail@plt>\n   0x00000000004005b4 <+56>:    leaveq \n   0x00000000004005b5 <+57>:    retq   \n</code></pre>\nWhat is the meaning of this kind of syntax?\n",

There's no syntax for extracting bits from a register (x86 ISA does not support operands like that). 0x28(%fs) would mean <i>value of <code>FS</code> plus 0x28</i> which is a different thing.</span>",
