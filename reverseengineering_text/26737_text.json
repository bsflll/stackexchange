It's undefined.\n",

            "content": "The reason why your code is slow is not Frida but your code. Your code would be also slow when executed in plain J2SE Java.\nThe simple reason is because you are reading the file byte by byte using an unbuffered <pre><code>FileInputStream</code></pre> which is the worst way you can read a file. Typically IO operations work on blocks of at least 4096 bytes (a typical block site in a file-system).\nTherefore a simple modification would be to wrap the <pre><code>FileInputStream</code></pre> in an <pre><code>BufferedInputStream</code></pre>:\n<pre><code>var fis = Java.use(\"java.io.FileInputStream\");\nvar bis = Java.use(\"java.io.BufferedInputStream\");\nvar file = bis.$new(fis.$new(\"/data/local/file.txt\"));\n...\n</code></pre>\nHowever this does not the <pre><code>read</code></pre> calls which will take significant time. Therefore the following code reads byte blocks and procesess them.\nThis should be a lot faster:\n<pre><code>var fis = Java.use(\"java.io.FileInputStream\");\nvar file = fis.$new(\"/data/local/file.txt\");\nvar fileBytes = new Uint8Array(file.available());\nconst buffer = Java.array('byte', new Array(4096).fill(0));\nvar x;\nwhile ((x = file.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < x; i++) {\n        fileBytes.push(buffer[i]);\n    } \n}\n</code></pre>\nThe fasted way would be if your app would contain Java code that directly read a file to a byte array. The less Frida JavaScript calls you have to perform the faster the result.\nTherefore check if your app contains a libraray like Apache common IO. Then you could directly execute <pre><code>org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.toByteArray(java.io.InputStream)</code></pre>.\n",
