    "content": "I'm using Rpetrich's Theos repository and I'm using <pre><code>tweak.xmi</code></pre> for making tweak on multiple files for easier in management.\nI can build and run successfully except one thing: I cannot use  <pre><code>hookf</code></pre>. Before that, when I put all source code inside one <pre><code>tweak.x</code></pre>, everything works normal. But now, everytime I compile, I meet this error:\n<pre><code>error: %orig found outside of hook or subclass \n</code></pre>\nOne example of my hook is:\n<pre><code>%hookf(int, uname, struct utsname *value) {\n    int ret = %orig;\n    strcpy(value->machine, getModelIdentifier());\n    strcpy(value->nodename, getHostname());\n    return ret;\n}\n</code></pre>\nUpdate:\nHere is my tweak that using <pre><code>MSHookFunction</code></pre>\n<pre><code>#import \"substrate.h\"\n\nstatic int (*original_gethostname)(char *, size_t);\n\nstatic int replace_gethostname(char *value, size_t valueLen) {\n    int ret = gethostname(value, valueLen);\n    if (value) strcpy(value, \"thao\");\n    return ret;\n}\n\n%ctor {\n    %init(_ungrouped)\n    MSHookFunction((void*)gethostname, (void*)replace_gethostname, (void**)&original_gethostname);\n}\n</code></pre>\n",
