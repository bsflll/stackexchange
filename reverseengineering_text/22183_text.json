    "content": "I am trying to figure out what is going on with my simple example programs, when I disassemble them with Ghidra. I am not sure whether this is some strange Ghidra behaviour or something that is set by default during compile time which produce a lot of assembly code, but I actively write only few LOC.\nHere is my sample C program created with VS Studio 2017:\n<pre><code>void main()\n{\n    int x = 1;\n    int y = 2;\n    x = x + y;\n}\n</code></pre>\nAnd this is what I get when I try to disassemble it with Ghidra:\n\nThe above screenshot is from the supposed 'entry' point of the program. But why is it so complex? I did a simple program to test how local variables are presented in Assembly and I get such output. Yet it should be few simple Assembly commands instead.\n\nI am not sure what I am missing out here, so if someone could help me to try and understand this, I would be grateful.\n",

            "content": "Program entry point != <pre><code>main</code></pre>\nYou're seeing disassembly of a few of the functions automatically linked to the program by the compiler toolchain that are responsible for setting up the C Run-Time (CRT) environment. \nFrom Microsoft's CRT Initialization:\n\nBy default, the linker includes the CRT library, which provides its own startup code. This startup code initializes the CRT library, calls global initializers, and then calls the user-provided <pre><code>main</code></pre> function for console applications.\n\nFrom What is the difference between main and mainCRTStartup?:\n\n<pre><code>main()</code></pre> is the entry point of your C or C++ program. <pre><code>mainCRTStartup()</code></pre> is the entrypoint of the C runtime library. It initializes the CRT, calls any static initializers that you wrote in your code, then calls your <pre><code>main()</code></pre> function.\n\nAn exercise you may find interesting is compiling the following code (assuming VS Studio 2017 allows it) and then disassembling the resulting binary:\n<pre><code>int main(){}</code></pre>\nHere is the Linux version: Linux x86 Program Start Up\n",

I have one other question, but I will open another thread here, because it requires a bit more information. I am essentially trying to learn difference between Global vs Local variables in Assembly. I know the theory that global are stored in Memory, and Local variables are on Stack, but I want to see it with my C code and my disassembly.</span>",
