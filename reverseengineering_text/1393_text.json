    "content": "I love using firmware-mod-kid to modify SoHo router firmware.  The problem I encounter is that it often bloats the size of the image.  It appears this happens during the <pre><code>mksquashfs</code></pre> step.\nIf I'm just unsquashing a filesystem and then resquashing it with the same compression, with no modifications, why is the resulting image larger than the original?\n",
