    "content": "Recently was doing some pydbg testing, so I had to remove the AeDebug entry (which determines the JIT debugger) in the registry, and Windbg was (and is) my JIT debugger. Exported the key before deleting it. It was:\n<pre><code>HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\AeDebug\n</code></pre>\nand the values were:\n<pre><code>(Default) REG_SZ (value not set)\nAuto REG_SZ 1\nDebugger REG_SZ \"C:\\...\\windbg.exe\" -p %ld -e %ld -g\nUserDebuggerHotKey REG_DWORD 0x00000000 (0)\n</code></pre>\nNow I had to test some other stuff in Windbg, so I added the exported AeDebug key in the .reg file. \nHowever, when I attempt to run a few test assembly programs that contact int 3h/0xCC (which should make Windbg come up as my JIT debugger) instead my system freezes with no BSOD, and I have to power off/turn back on.\nI've deleted all of AeDebug and re-ran \"windbg -I\" to register it as my JIT debugger. However, I still get system freezes!\nPlease help! It only occurs so far when code Im running contains an int 3h breakpoint in it.\nI tried running an assembly (masm32) program that I compiled with the following to test:\n<pre><code>.586\n.model flat, stdcall\n\noption casemap:none\n\nincludelib \\masm32\\lib\\kernel32.lib\nincludelib \\masm32\\lib\\user32.lib\n\ninclude \\masm32\\include\\kernel32.inc\ninclude \\masm32\\include\\user32.inc\ninclude \\masm32\\include\\windows.inc\n\n.code\nstart:\nxor eax, eax\nxor ebx, ebx\nxor ecx, ecx\nxor edx, edx\nint 3h\ninvoke ExitProcess, 0\nEND start\n</code></pre>\nHowever, the system still freezes. When I run windbg first and I step out of the breakpoint, it exits like normal but doesn't feeze my whole system.\nHow can I get normal breakpoints again that dont cause undefined behavior?\n",
