    "content": "I'm trying to break execution when a string is loaded in memory.\nI can´t find the string by using the <pre><code>search for -> string references</code></pre>\nSo I press <pre><code>Alt + M</code></pre> and press <pre><code>Ctrl + B</code></pre> to search my string once is loaded, I can see it.\nI try to right click on the address and set a hardware breakpoint but the software closes as soon as that string is shown so it doesn't break on the next run.\nHow can I set a condition so if a string appears a break happens?\nI tried <pre><code>shift + F4</code></pre> like with ollydbg and then I try to create an expression like this <pre><code>UNICODE[EAX] == \"myString\"</code></pre> but it says <pre><code>invalid expression...</code></pre>\nI also tried the same expression using traceInto, but it definitely is not matching for the string, because I can't see it int he dump and even if I compare with a huge string, it doesn't do anything at all.\nAny suggestions or ideas?\n",
