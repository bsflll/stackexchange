If the file has no associated entry point, this member holds zero.  \nSource: http://www.sco.com/developers/gabi/latest/ch4.eheader.html\n\nAnd a more detailed description from Wikipedia:\n\nIn computer programming, an entry point is where control is\n  transferred from the operating system to a computer program, at which\n  place the processor enters a program or a code fragment and execution\n  begins. In some operating systems or programming languages, the\n  initial entry is not part of the program but of the runtime library,\n  in which case the runtime library initializes the program and then the\n  runtime library enters the program. In other cases, the program may\n  call the runtime library before doing anything when it is entered for\n  the first time, and, after the runtime library returns, the actual\n  code of the program begins to execute. This marks the transition from\n  load time (and dynamic link time, if present) to run time.\n\n[emphasis mine]\n",

For a given binary file (ELFBIN), you can run the following command to read the binary's header information (-h):\n<pre><code>       readelf -h ELFBIN\n</code></pre>\nYou'll obtain an output similar to this:\n<pre><code> ELF Header:\n Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \n Class:                             ELF64\n Data:                              2's complement, little endian\n Version:                           1 (current)\n OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V\n ABI Version:                       0\n Type:                              EXEC (Executable file)\n Machine:                           Advanced Micro Devices X86-64\n Version:                           0x1\n Entry point address:               0x400a80\n Start of program headers:          64 (bytes into file)\n Start of section headers:          46528 (bytes into file)\n Flags:                             0x0\n Size of this header:               64 (bytes)\n Size of program headers:           56 (bytes)\n Number of program headers:         9\n Size of section headers:           64 (bytes)\n Number of section headers:         31\n Section header string table index: 30\n</code></pre>\nIf you look closely, you'll find Entry point address : 0x400a80.\nAfter running objdump on the binary and looking up the given address you'll obtain something this:\n<pre><code>0000000000400a80 <_start>:\n 400a80:       31 ed                   xor    %ebp,%ebp\n 400a82:       49 89 d1                mov    %rdx,%r9\n 400a85:       5e                      pop    %rsi\n 400a86:       48 89 e2                mov    %rsp,%rdx\n 400a89:       48 83 e4 f0             and    $0xfffffffffffffff0,%rsp\n 400a8d:       50                      push   %rax\n 400a8e:       54                      push   %rsp\n 400a8f:       49 c7 c0 c0 48 40 00    mov    $0x4048c0,%r8\n 400a96:       48 c7 c1 50 48 40 00    mov    $0x404850,%rcx\n 400a9d:       48 c7 c7 70 0b 40 00    mov    $0x400b70,%rdi\n 400aa4:       ff 15 1e 85 20 00       callq  *0x20851e(%rip)        # 6  08fc8 <__libc_start_main@GLIBC_2.2.5>\n 400aaa:       f4                      hlt    \n 400aab:       0f 1f 44 00 00          nopl   0x0(%rax,%rax,1)\n</code></pre>\nThis is the _start function that prepares certain parameters/registers before eventually calling main (see the label on the right at address 400aa4 in the example) that contains \"your\" code. The _start function is usually called after all other sections of the binary have been loaded in memory. After the main is done, the hlt instruction is executed to terminate the execution in this example. \nThis is what's called entry point. Now, regarding analysis, it has to be started somewhere in the binary, that somewhere is represented using an address (like the entry point).\nIf you want to play with the language/jargon, you can say: analysis entry point rather than binary entry point.\nAll in all, it's just technical keywords and they have to be defined properly.\nHope this answers your question :)\n",
