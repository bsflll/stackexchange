    "content": "I know that both <pre><code>pdf @ func</code></pre> and <pre><code>pdr @ func</code></pre> disassemble the function, the first using linear and the second recursive traversal disassembly. <pre><code>VV @ func</code></pre> shows the disassembled function in visual mode, but it seems it uses linear sweep. Can I use recursive traversal and see the output in visual mode?\n",
