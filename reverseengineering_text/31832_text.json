    "content": "A glyph holds data such as its name and contour points. But how do you determine where the characters of one language end and another begins? Is there a written standard that says language X starts at index Y and ends at index Z?\nIn case it matters, I'm referring to <pre><code>.ttf</code></pre> & <pre><code>.otf</code></pre> font files.\nI'm unsure if my question fits in this community and I'm struggling to find another, so if there's one better suited, please let me know.\nAny info or documentation on this would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks in advance.\n",
