    "content": "So I'm looking at these sprite files from a type of virtual world format that's no longer around. They appear to be JPEGs with some custom markers, one of which appears to be an alpha mask. Here's some examples with the first 30 bytes from the chunk in each file, immediately following \"CWMAHUF1\"\n\n\n\n\nFile\nWidth\nHeight\nLength\nFirst Four Bytes\nDivided by Height\nDivided by 4\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n\n\n\n\nafrowomandoc.sprite\n277\n866\n6148\n31176\n36\n9\nc8\n79\n0\n0\nff\nb0\n0\n0\n0\n17\nc6\n0\n0\n0\n5\ne0\na1\ne0\n6\n80\n0\n0\n6f\n74\n1c\n1\n60\n0\n0\n27\n\n\nasiandoc.sprite\n268\n906\n6497\n32616\n36\n9\n68\n7f\n0\n0\nff\nb0\n0\n0\n0\n2f\nc\n3\n80\n0\n2\ne0\n70\n70\n2\ne4\n0\n0\nb\nf8\n98\n1\n3e\n0\n0\n12\n\n\nbalddoc.sprite\n301\n855\n7008\n34200\n40\n10\n98\n85\n0\n0\nff\nb0\n0\na\n3\n0\na1\ne0\n0\n2f\nc4\n60\n0\n2\ne4\nc0\n0\n4f\n80\n0\n19\nc0\nab\n23\ne0\n0\n\n\nblondedoc.sprite\n215\n865\n5118\n24220\n28\n7\n9c\n5e\n0\n0\nff\nb0\n0\n0\n17\nf6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n6e\n0\n17\nb7\nf0\n1\n70\n4\n1\nd0\nfc\nf9\n9f\n80\n8\nc0\n\n\ncrowd02.sprite\n247\n274\n2509\n8768\n32\n8\n40\n22\n0\n0\nff\nb0\n0\n0\n80\n30\n30\n5f\nec\n0\n0\n6\nf8\nb0\n10\nc0\n0\n0\nbf\nf\nb7\nf0\n9c\n0\n0\na\n\n\ndesk.sprite\n393\n482\n5431\n25064\n52\n13\ne8\n61\n0\n0\nff\nb0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n28\nc\n3\n80\n0\n1\n3a\n0\n0\n1\n94\n0\n0\nc\nfe\naa\naa\nd0\n70\n\n\ndesknocomputer.sprite\n393\n241\n2508\n12532\n52\n13\nf4\n30\n0\n0\nff\nb0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n28\nc\n3\n80\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n34\nc0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n17\nc0\n0\n\n\ndome.sprite\n256\n128\n762\n4096\n32\n8\n0\n10\n0\n0\nff\nb0\n1\n7c\n60\n1e\n8f\n80\n0\n0\nf\ne1\n27\ne8\n78\n0\n0\n3\n3f\ndf\n55\n97\nf0\n0\n0\nc\n\n\nentrance.sprite\n600\n279\n3937\n21204\n76\n19\nd4\n52\n0\n0\nff\nb0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n8\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n50\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nflags.sprite\n245\n28\n194\n896\n32\n8\n80\n3\n0\n0\nff\n87\nf1\n0\n50\n0\n99\ne5\nf8\n90\n4\n0\n8\n0\n14\n42\n2b\nd6\nf\n0\n34\ne8\n1\ndc\n9\n40\n\n\nFountain.sprite\n460\n1584\n28016\n95040\n60\n15\n40\n73\n1\n0\nff\nb0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2f\nc\n3\n80\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n34\nc0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nindoor_stadiumwl01.sprite\n256\n500\n2007\n16000\n32\n8\n80\n3e\n0\n0\n80\n30\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nindoor_stadiumwl02.sprite\n256\n500\n2007\n16000\n32\n8\n80\n3e\n0\n0\n80\n30\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nleftwingroof.sprite\n256\n116\n806\n3712\n32\n8\n80\ne\n0\n0\nff\nb0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nlights.sprite\n165\n500\n2858\n12000\n24\n6\ne0\n2e\n0\n0\nff\nb0\n0\n5\nf1\n80\n78\n0\n0\n11\nf0\n3\n3f\n34\n4\n1\nfe\n0\n67\n82\nc9\nf8\n6\n54\n0\nee\n\n\nphone.sprite\n192\n358\n1997\n8592\n24\n6\n90\n21\n0\n0\nff\nb0\n0\n1\n7f\n60\ne0\n0\n0\n5f\nca\n6\n0\n0\n4\nfc\n48\n8\n0\n0\n1d\ne0\n0\n0\n7f\n85\n\n\nPLANT.sprite\n676\n686\n13127\n60368\n88\n22\nd0\neb\n0\n0\nff\nb0\n0\n0\n0\n17\nf0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\nf0\na0\n13\n40\n0\n0\n0\na\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\npowercells.sprite\n457\n798\n8241\n47880\n60\n15\n8\nbb\n0\n0\nff\nb0\n0\n2f\n8c\n3\nd3\nf0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nf0\n12\n0\n0\n3e\nb4\n1c\n0\n0\n0\n0\n6a\n80\n0\n\n\nro.sprite\n197\n668\n4724\n18704\n28\n7\n10\n49\n0\n0\nff\nb0\n0\n0\n5f\n18\n7\n80\n0\n0\n11\nf0\n0\nc1\nfd\ne0\nb2\nfe\n0\ncf\n80\nf\nf0\ne8\n7d\n40\n\n\nrocks.sprite\n400\n200\n1992\n10400\n52\n13\na0\n28\n0\n0\nff\nb0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n10\n5\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n38\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\na0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nsleep.sprite\n600\n2888\n42275\n219488\n76\n19\n60\n59\n3\n0\nff\nb0\n0\n0\nb0\n40\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n6\n0\n0\n0\n5\nfc\na0\n20\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2\n0\n\n\nTORCH.sprite\n300\n2600\n23504\n104000\n40\n10\n40\n96\n1\n0\nff\nb0\n0\n0\n0\n2\nf0\nc0\n38\n0\n0\n0\n0\n34\nc0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n7c\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1a\n80\n\n\ntreee.sprite\n400\n437\n5290\n22724\n52\n13\nc4\n58\n0\n0\nff\nb0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n10\n5\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n38\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\na0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nweldbotlit.sprite\n352\n607\n5979\n26708\n44\n11\n54\n68\n0\n0\nff\nb0\n0\n5\nc1\n81\n80\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1b\n80\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1c\n3\n71\nfc\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\n\n\n\nAll I've been able to determine is that the first four bytes are a word that seems to have nothing to do with the actual length of the chunk. However, they are all divisible by the image's height and further divisible by 4.\nindoor_stadiumwl01.sprite and indoor_stadiumwl02.sprite seem to be (almost) all 0s, and the image themselves look to be almost completely opaque\nI'm not entirely sure what the data is supposed to look like decoded, but the mask appears to be binary\n",

The 4x4 examples you posted there are probably more tractable, although would be useful to know where the transparent bit is in the first one, and whether the checkerboard starts wth on or off top left\n",
