            "content": "According to HexRays IDA support, this means an error. In IDA help (press <pre><code>F1</code></pre>), under the <pre><code>Problems List</code></pre> header you have the list of possible problems encountered during analysis. In your case it seems to be <pre><code>BADSTACK</code></pre>, which means:\n\nThe value of the stack pointer at the end of the function is different\n          from its value at the start of the function. [...] The most probable cause is that stack tracing has failed.\n\nYou will see each line causing this problem in the <pre><code>List of problems</code></pre> window.\nThe description how to fix this problem is included in the IDA help as well, below the problem description.\n",
