    "content": "I know that I can output the value of a variable using \n<pre><code>(gdb) p var_name\n$1 = \"varvalue\"\n</code></pre>\nIs there a way to set the value of a variable while debugging with gdb? The document that I'm using doesn't seem to have this command. \nEdit\nI've since learned that I can change the state of objects in memory by simply calling their functions! So to modify an object of type <pre><code>std::string</code></pre>, just call the <pre><code>assign</code></pre> function as follows:\n<pre><code>(gdb) call str.assign(\"New Value\")\n</code></pre>\nThank you.\n",
