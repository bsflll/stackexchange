    "content": "I'm new to reverse engineering, assembly and IDA and I'm learning NASM. Whenever I load an executable (a PE file or an ELF) IDA disassembles it using a MASM-like syntax (it looks to me that it does) and I think NASM is better so I'm sticking to NASM but IDA doesn't help me with that. So:\nHow can I make it disassemble in a NASM-like syntax?\nAlso because there are major differences between MASM and NASM like using the square brackets differs in both (like: mov eax, [var]), How do I know what IDA exactly uses if it is not using MASM?\nAny understanding and help is highly appreciated as I do not know how to word most of things in this regard and don't understand many concepts.\n",
