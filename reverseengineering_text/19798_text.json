    "content": "In Windows 10, I can easily intercept traffic of an application using Proxifier and route it to Charles proxy, so that I can inspect and edit the data.\n<pre><code> exe -> Proxifier (Socks proxy to localhost:8889) -> Charles (socks listen localhost:8889)\n</code></pre>\nI now would like to replace Charles with my own Java server.\n<pre><code>public void StartListener(int port) throws Exception {\n    HttpServer server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(8889), 0);\n    server.createContext(\"/MyHandler\", new MyHandler());\n    server.setExecutor(null);\n    server.start();\n}\n</code></pre>\nWhile this works fine if I turn off Proxifier (or even if it's on) open Chrome and navigate to <pre><code>localhost:8889/MyHandler</code></pre> it does not when the exe tries to connect to <pre><code>ExeWebsite.com:80/MyHandler</code></pre>.\nI tried settings up Proxifier either as Socks or Http proxy but nothing.\nI also tried to edit the Java server like this, as per specs:\n<pre><code>HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(\"ExeWebsite.com\", 80), 0);\n</code></pre>\nThe result I see in Proxifier log is:\n\nexe.exe *64 - ExeWebsite.com:80 error :\n  Could not connect through proxy 127.0.0.1:8882 - Proxy server cannot\n  establish a connection with the target, status code 400\n\nWhich tool should I use to quickly and painlessly redirect all the traffic to my local server?\n",
