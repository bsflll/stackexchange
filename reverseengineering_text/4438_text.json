    "content": "I wanted to know if one can see old register values in Ollydbg in the register window. I mean, for example, I have the register value of <pre><code>eax</code></pre> like <pre><code>eax=12345678</code></pre>. And, now, let say that I go to the next instruction, and then to next instruction and so on... Lets also say, that <pre><code>eax</code></pre> is changing all the time and after a couple of instructions and changements of <pre><code>eax</code></pre>. \nI want to know the former value of <pre><code>eax</code></pre>, namely <pre><code>eax=1234568</code></pre>, how can I do that in Ollydbg ?\n",
