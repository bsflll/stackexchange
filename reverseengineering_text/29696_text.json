    "content": "I have a custom chromium browser build which has a bunch of \"native\" functions which I would like to have definitions for.\nApparently, these are registered as en extension using this function: <pre><code>Chromium.Remote.CfrRuntime.RegisterExtension(System.String,System.String,Chromium.Remote.CfrV8Handler)</code></pre> which I was able to find in the ChromiumFX.dll.\nI found this in the definition:\n\n\"Register a new V8 extension with the specified JavaScript extension\ncode and handler. Functions implemented by the handler are prototyped\nusing the keyword 'native'. The calling of a native function is\nrestricted to the scope in which the prototype of the native function\nis defined. This function may only be called on the render process\nmain thread.\"\n\nI'm a total reverse engineering noob so don't really know what I'm doing. I found the function using dnSpy but that's about it.\nI tried looking into extracting the function definitions right from Chrome but apparently in the build they're using you can't do that. Or at least I couldn't find a way.\nIs there a somewhat easy way of achieving what I want?\n",
