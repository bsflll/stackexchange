However, checking the MD5 I can observe that the hash is different.\n",

            "content": "Your commands to correct replace the manifest are correct. The likely problem is you are corrupting the .res file; note this is a compiled binary format, you cannot just modify it in a simple text editor, despite it containing the manifest contents in a text format. After exporting, if you make the text longer you will need to modify the .res file header, some basic details here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/menurc/resource-file-formats\nAlternately edit the .res file in Resource Hacker or Visual Studio then compare the files at a binary level to see what is being modified. Once you have a valid .res file to import your commands will work.\nYou can manually confirm your .res file is the problem by using Resource Hacker to manually replace your .res file, if you have corrupted it you will get a failure message.\nWith a corrupt .res file you will see something like this:\n\nWith a valid .res file you will see output like below:\n",
