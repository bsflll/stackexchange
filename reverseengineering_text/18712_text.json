    "content": "I've been messing around a little with Radare2 trying to master binary exploitation and patching.\nI added a couple of assembly instructions to an x86 elf binary in a non-executable section of the file, precisely the section LOAD1 I spotted after listing the available sections of the executable :\n<pre><code> S=\n00* 0x08048000 |#################################-----------------------------------------------| 0x0804868c  1.6K mr-x  LOAD0\n01  0x08049f0c |---------------------------------------------------------------------------#####| 0x0804a028   280 mrw-  LOAD1\n=>  0x080483d0 |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 0x080483cf\n</code></pre>\nThen when I tried to execute the binary I got the following error :\n<pre><code>Inconsistency detected by ld.so: dl-version.c: 205: _dl_check_map_versions: Assertion `needed != NULL' failed!\n</code></pre>\nI think the instructions types I added are not relevant in this matter as the issue arises with <pre><code>mov</code></pre> instructions as well as with simple <pre><code>jmp</code></pre>.  \nFrom what I know, the linking step had been performed at the compilation/linking of the original source code, so how does it come that ld is involved here ?\nWhat exactly causes the linker inconsistency triggering the above error ?\n",
