    "content": "I am reversing engineering a program. Right now I was using Hopper.\nWith Hopper once I find a string I can right click and I have an option call \"References to ...\"\nthat will return a list of functions that call or access this data.\n\nWhen I try to use Binary Ninja. I find the string then I noticed that \"Cross Reference\" is empty. This is the main reason I don't use Binary Ninja but I want to use it because there are other things I really like.\n\nAnybody knows if I have to check any specific option or do anything special to get the same result?\n",
