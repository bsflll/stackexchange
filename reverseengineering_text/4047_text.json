    "content": "In IDA I can easily change the size of the local variables using <pre><code>Alt+P</code></pre> and then changing the \"Local Variables area\" field to the desired value.\nHowever, how can I do this with the parameters size? IDA has misanalyzed the function and got the result that it has about 30 kilobytes arguments when it actually just has 30 kilobytes variables.\n",
