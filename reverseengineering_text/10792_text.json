    "content": "I extracted Samsung Galaxy S6 kernel image from its stock boot.img. The result is a raw code kernel image. I load into IDA 6.8 (64-bit) using <pre><code>ROM Start: 0xffffffc000205000 size:0x18C020000, load address:0xffffffc000205000 size:0x18C020000</code></pre> which is the address of <pre><code>_text/_stext</code></pre> inside it's kallsyms, it does not disassemble correctly and recognise nearly everything as data. On the other hand, using the _text/stext function for a 32-bit ARM Note 4 kernel image at <pre><code>0xC0008000</code></pre> works perfectly. Does any one have any idea how to disassemble ARM64 android image correctly? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.\n",
