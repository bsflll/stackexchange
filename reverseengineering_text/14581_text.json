    "content": "I'm trying to decompile an unknown Win32 executable using ILSpy. However, it only answers by giving me the useless message: \n<pre><code>This file does not contain a managed assembly.</code></pre>\nI have also tried to use other tools like dotPeek64 and Teleirik without success. Virustotal tell me that it is using: \n<pre><code>[+] COMCTL32.dll\n[+] ComMgr.dll\n[+] KERNEL32.dll\n[+] MSVCP90.dll\n[+] MSVCR90.dll\n[+] OLEAUT32.dll\n[+] SHLWAPI.dll\n[+] USER32.dll\n[+] mfc90.dll\n</code></pre>\nI'm pretty sure it is made with .NET, since this XML is present in the code:\n<pre><code><assembly xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\" manifestVersion=\"1.0\">\n  <trustInfo xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3\">\n    <security>\n      <requestedPrivileges>\n        <requestedExecutionLevel level=\"asInvoker\" uiAccess=\"false\"></requestedExecutionLevel>\n      </requestedPrivileges>\n    </security>\n  </trustInfo>\n  <dependency>\n    <dependentAssembly>\n      <assemblyIdentity type=\"win32\" name=\"Microsoft.VC90.CRT\" version=\"9.0.21022.8\" processorArchitecture=\"x86\" publicKeyToken=\"removed\"></assemblyIdentity>\n    </dependentAssembly>\n  </dependency>\n  <dependency>\n    <dependentAssembly>\n      <assemblyIdentity type=\"win32\" name=\"Microsoft.VC90.MFC\" version=\"9.0.21022.8\" processorArchitecture=\"x86\" publicKeyToken=\"removed\"></assemblyIdentity>\n    </dependentAssembly>\n  </dependency>\n</assembly>\n</code></pre>\nAlso note that I'm using Win8 and do not have VS installed. So my questions are: \n\nWhat do I need to do to resolve the above error?\nWhat am I missing if anything?\nHow can I check if I have those *.dll's listed?\n\nEDIT: I'm now thinking it was made with plain C++...\n",
