I've searched the Idapython documentation and previously similar questions and could not find an answer\n",

I'm not sure exactly where you're _supposed_ to set it if using IDAPython, but it's part of <pre><code>idainfo</code></pre>. So, you can prolly use the <pre><code>idaapi.inf_*</code></pre> functions, ctypes with the IDA library to call <pre><code>setinf</code></pre> directly, or I think even the \"Root Node\" netnode iirc.\n",

It used to be an actual global variable accessible via the <pre><code>idaapi.cvar</code></pre> wrapper, but now you need to use the various getters/setters in the <pre><code>ida_ida</code></pre> module.\nWhile you can indeed go down that road and use <pre><code>inf_get_cc</code></pre>/<pre><code>inf_set_cc</code></pre> or <pre><code>inf_set_cc_cm</code></pre>, in case you only need to change the pointers to 64-bit, normally it should be enough to call <pre><code>inf_set_64bit(True)</code></pre>.\n",
