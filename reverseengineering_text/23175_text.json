    "content": "Are there any community tools that are aimed specifically at extracting or replacing AGESA code in a UEFI?  In AMI UEFIs, AGESA is said to be scattered among multiple modules.  I have read that in AWARD BIOSes it's contained within a single module.  Are there any modern AWARD AMD UEFIs?\nThank you for any guidance.\nEdit: Removed the long intro, straight to business.\n",
