            "content": "I'd just like to add what this code actually does, since it's rather simple. It is designed to be used as a shellcode. A relatively standard one. What it does is write something to AHMADUMinU to STDIN (?) which gets printed on the screen and then proceeds to execute /bin/sh via syscall 11. It's fairly easy to follow since it's heavily commented. \nI am mentioning all of this because you won't be able to see many of the details in \"decompiled code\" which would look somethign like this:\n<pre><code>main(){\nwrite(0,\"AHMA...\",15);\nexecve(\"/bin/sh\",NULL,NULL);\n}\n</code></pre>\nThere is one interesting bit (old shellcoding trick). The shellcode needs to NULL terminate the \"/bin/sh\" string which will be somewhere on the stack. For that purpose, it needs to get its address. It does that by making two calls. Calls will make new stack frames, at which point it can just pop the saved stack frame.\n",
