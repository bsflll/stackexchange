    "content": "I'm fairly new in reverse engineering, but I do comprehend assembly code. However, I'm facing a problem. \nIt is about an old Rockstar game, \"Bully: The scholarship edition\" (released 2007 - aka \"Canis Canem Edit\"). It however has issues to perform on Windows 10 anniversary edition OS that I have at this moment. That is expected since it's an old software. To resolve that, I tried many online solutions (compat mode, setting CPU affinity, ect), which didn't helped much.\nSo I decided to look into the code by using OllyDbg. The cause of the crash is pretty constant; an access violation. However, it is purely random. I am able to play a hour without problems, or experiencing a crash within 10 minutes. The program apparently tries to move data from address 0 to a register, which isn't allowed. The exception is always thrown at the same place, where the pointer call occurs.\nHere is a screenshot from OllyDbg when debugging the program. (Sorry for small resolution, it's an old game, hence the resolution is set at 1280x960)\n\nThe exception is thrown at address <pre><code>0088729D</code></pre> which has this instruction\n<pre><code>MOV ECX, DWORD PTR DS:[EAX]\n</code></pre>\nThe EAX register is apparently empty (you can see that in the image). So I checked when information is moved to that register. It happens at the address (I've selected the line and added comment \"moves empty address\") <pre><code>00887281</code></pre>. It contains the following instruction:\n<pre><code>MOV EAX, DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+8]\n</code></pre>\nAs far I know, SS is the stack segment register and ESP extended stack pointer. The ESP register contains address <pre><code>0019F3A0</code></pre>. With offset 8, the address is now <pre><code>0019F3A8</code></pre> (see selection in the right bottom box). It contains <pre><code>00002000</code></pre>.\nI'm now clueless after this point. I don't understand why the address during the call is zero and not that value. I expect that the EAX register would contain <pre><code>00002000</code></pre> after the instruction. However, this is not the case this time. The EAX register contains <pre><code>00000000</code></pre>.\nI believe that I'm interpreting this incorrectly. Can someone point me where my misinterpretation occurs or inform me how to check this problem more correctly?\nThank you.\nPS: the reason for this is because I've played bully in my childhood and want to play again. Apparently, there are other users with the same problem, even after attempting the known solutions on the web. Perhaps if I find a solid solution for this, that I would be able to help others too.\n",
