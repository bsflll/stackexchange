    "content": "Since React Native 0.60.4 developers can opt-in to use the Hermes JS Engine. This generates an <pre><code>index.android.bundle</code></pre> binary that contains Hermes JS bytecode.\nThe Hermes documentation mentions <pre><code>hbcdump</code></pre> which is described as a \"Hermes bytecode disassembler\"\nBy using <pre><code>hbcdump -pretty-disassemble -c disassemble -out out.txt index.android.bundle</code></pre> I do get something that is at least a little more human readable but it does not look like it can be compiled back again and is not easy to work with.\nHow can I decompile Hermes JS bytecode into JavaScript?\nAlternatively: How can I modify the bytecode? Is there a tool that understands this bytecode?\n",
