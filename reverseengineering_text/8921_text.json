    "content": "I'm guessing that tools like PeiD detect packers by looking for signatures inside the packed binary and by measuring the entropy. Is there any other work that tries to determine if a binary is obfuscated in some way based on some property of the binary? Would this be able to detect control flow obfuscations as in the case of ollvm?\n",

Relation between code and data sizes, number of jumps, number of ALU ops, number of load/store operations related to code size - all this may give a lot of information. Using the famous triad of multidimensional statistics (factor, discriminant and cluster analysis) on a these metrics should give a good detection ratio.</span>",

Switch statements lead to all sorts of interesting code generation possibilities that may look a lot like obfuscation.\n\nExtreme cases of obfuscation are relatively esay to detect.  But an obfuscator that's trying to be stealthy will not be easy to detect.\n",
