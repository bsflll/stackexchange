    "content": "I am new to forum and new to programming (total noob).\nI am trying to modify a program using ollydbg and x32dbg and while attached to file I make the changes fine and it does what I expected.\nMy problem is saving the changes to file or patching in x32dbg does not work.\nThe second I make changes and save/patch I then rename original and move patched version into place and try to run the problems start.\nFirst Windows 10 stops the file from running and at same time my malware and virus protection quarantines the file.\nI know ollydgb and x32dbg are safe as I have used them before and my system is clean.\nSo is it because I did not disassemble the program first?\nOr could the program have some sort of code that detected the changes made and then kills the program?\nThanks\nGren\n",
