    "content": "I am debugging a program that I compiled.\nThis program calls <pre><code>SetWindowTextW</code></pre>.\nWhen I am debugging it with IDA I can step into this function, but it doesn't recognize anything there:\n\nIf I will load <pre><code>user32.dll</code></pre> (where the function is exported), I will see all the symbols and functions named, everything.\nIs it possible to load the <pre><code>user32.dll</code></pre> to a process that I am debugging, so I will be able to see what functions it calls.\nYou can see the difference, in the left side is when I am debugging my program and access <pre><code>user32.dll</code></pre> and on the right side is when I debug it directly.\n\nSolved (thanks to Igor):\n",
