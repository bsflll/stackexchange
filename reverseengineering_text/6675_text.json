    "content": "Can the signatures from PeID be used on 64-Bit Portable Executable (EXE) files? \nPeID does not support 64-Bit files but I can use the signatures in another application with 64-Bit support.\nMy main interest is detecting 64-Bit EXE files that are packed.\nThis question is related to another question I have:\nDetecting packed 64-bit Windows Portable Executable (EXE) files\n",
