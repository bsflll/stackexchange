It appears to be wrapped in some kind of wrapper that I've never seen before. It's not a DFU footer, or a DfuSe header and I can't see anything obvious. Any ideas very welcome. <pre><code>srec_info</code></pre> seems to think it's \"Motorola S-Record\" but this is clearly a padded binary format, ending with what looks like a SHA256 hash:\n<pre><code>0000000 0001 0000 0200 0000 0000 0003 0000 0400\n0000010 0000 0000 0005 0000 3000 0000 0000 0031\n0000020 0000 3200 0000 0000 0101 0010 0020 0403\n0000030 18ff 0300 ff04 0018 0000 0000 ffff ffff\n0000040 ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff\n*\n0000200 df03 fae3 dcb6 3e5e 1dd8 d3b8 8805 a692\n... firmware blob ...\n0003410 0073 0065 ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff\n0003420 ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff\n*\n0003500 0001 0000 0200 0000 0000 0003 0000 0400\n0003510 0000 0000 0005 0000 3000 0000 0000 0031\n0003520 0000 3200 0000 0000 0101 0010 0020 0403\n0003530 18ff 0300 ff04 0018 ffff ffff ffff ffff\n0003540 ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff\n*\n00035e0 8bce 56ef c6db d0db a6ce 9cce 9cce 9cce\n00035f0 9cce 9cce 9cce 9cce 9cce 88d1 55aa 1385\n0003600\n</code></pre>\nAny ideas very welcome, thanks!\n",
