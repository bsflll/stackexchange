    "content": "I have a qemu instance running a custom Linux distribution, within which I'd like to debug an (already running) application. I have already embedded a <pre><code>gdbserver</code></pre> inside (and have a root shell available), so I can start it with <pre><code>--attach <pid></code></pre>. I also have extracted and analyzed the binary I am interested in and have an <pre><code>.idb</code></pre> file for it. However, when I connect to the remote GDB through IDA (via <pre><code>Debugger > Attach to process</code></pre>, and then selecting <pre><code>0 - the running process</code></pre>), it completely ignores everything in the database. No functions, no comments, nothing. ASLR is disabled, but if somehow still needed, I can provide <pre><code>/proc/<pid>/maps</code></pre>. The question is, how do I inform IDA that the app it's looking at is the same as the database?\nIf it matters, I'm running IDA Pro 7.5 on Windows\n",
