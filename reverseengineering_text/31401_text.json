    "content": "I am starting Debugging Linux Virtual Machine by IDA GDB debugger. I can say I am able to connect to process (0) and start the machine (by using IDA 32bit,  IMO it has something to do with bios! or I don't know at all!).\n\nBut after starting it I cannot get data back to IDA. when I try to suspend the machine via IDA it won't work at all and takes so long time without any chance.\nI also tried connecting to the machine via another IDA instance by a 64bit version of IDA and I can only connect to process (1) which breaks the line to debug processes already running!\n\nCould someone help a bit on this tricky thing?\n",
