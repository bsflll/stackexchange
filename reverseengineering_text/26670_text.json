    "content": "I have modem Echolife HG8245H (V3R016C10S150). I'm using telnet to connect it. I need to read some files from this modem. There's a shell mode I can enter, but it is nerfed badly:\n<pre><code>SU_WAP>shell\n\nBusyBox v1.18.4 (2016-10-11 19:35:35 CST) built-in shell (ash)\nEnter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.\n\nprofile close core dump  \nWAP(Dopra Linux) # ?  \nexit  \ngetcustominfo.sh  \nrestorehwmode.sh  \n</code></pre>\nThese are all commands I can do in this mode. There is another way to look at the directories:\n<pre><code>SU_WAP>wap list path /    \nbin  \nboot  \ndev  \netc  \nhtml  \nlib  \nlibexec  \nlinuxrc  \nmnt  \nproc  \nroot  \nsbin  \nshare  \nsys  \ntmp  \nuer   \nusr  \nvar  \n</code></pre>\nIt works like 'ls'. But I can not read any file:\n<pre><code>SU_WAP>wap list path /var/wifi.txt  \n/var/wifi.txt  \nsuccess!  \n</code></pre>\nCommands like 'cat' aren't working. Does anybody know is there any way to read these files if you're connecting modem through telnet? Maybe this is not possible with this firmware?\nThank you:)\n",
