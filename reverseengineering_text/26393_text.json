    "content": "I have tried repackaging few financial apps and when I tried running their repackaged version, I found out that either it is getting crashed at the launcher activity, or at the later point it is getting crashed.\nI have a doubt that how the developers of these financial apps make their app more secure against repackaging?\nIs signature checking the only way, developer will use as an anti-repackaging measure or is there any other way which developer can use?\nAre the developers using any existing framework which automatically makes their app more secure?\n",
