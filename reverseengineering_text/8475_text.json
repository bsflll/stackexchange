    "content": "I am investigating car navigation software which runs on QNX and want to replace the startup animation with my own. I have found the files in the firmware which have the extension .canim which likely stands for compressed animation.\nThe files are zlib compressed and after deflating the files start with HEX <pre><code>41 4E 49 4D 31 20 20 20 20 03 00 00 E0 01 00 00</code></pre>(ANIM1). My question is what file format is this? (possible match: Amiga ANIM)\nI know that the screen resolution for the device is 800x480 so after DWORD 3&4 are resolution (<pre><code>20 03 00 00</code></pre> -> 80 and <pre><code>E0 01 00 00</code></pre> -> 480\nI've uploaded the files here, bin files are deflated versions of the .canim files.\nEDIT: some additional info: I found startup pictures in the same folder and they are zlib compressed and are simple RGB pairs with a padding 00 to align at DWORD, eg : <pre><code>04 02 04 00 04 02 04 00 04 02 04 00 04 02 04 00</code></pre>\nEDIT2: This site has video's for each of the possible startup animations.\nAnd these are the startup pictures I have extracted:\n\nand\n",
