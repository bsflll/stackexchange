    "content": "I have a question about reversing a tutorial which shows how to reverse engineering shellcode. My question is simple:\nIn figure 4, we see at (7) <pre><code>TEX.ProcessEnvironmentBlock</code></pre>: is this a comment, or was IDA able to figure this out?\nWhen I reverse engineer the same payload, I see\n<pre><code>edx, fs:[eax, 30h]\n</code></pre>\nAnd at (8) I see:\n<pre><code>edx, [edx, 0Ch]\n</code></pre>\nis my IDA set up not correct? I heard about hard coded vtable values(?) which have an integer identifier. Not sure if I am mixing up things at the moment, but is that what we are looking at?\n",

To do the same yourself, place your cursor over the memory operand (i.e., <pre><code>[eax+30h]</code></pre>) and press <pre><code>T</code></pre> to bring up the list of possible structures to apply.\nTwo more notes. IDA knows about many structures, but you might have to do a few things before you're able to select them from the <pre><code>T</code></pre> window as described above. If you don't see the structure you want in that window:\n\nThe first thing to try is to go to the structures window (<pre><code>Shift-F9</code></pre> on Windows, or <pre><code>View -> Open subviews -> Structures</code></pre>) and press <pre><code>Insert</code></pre> to create  a structure. Then select <pre><code>Add standard structure</code></pre>, and choose the one you want.\n\nIf the structure you want doesn't appear in the window popped up by <pre><code>Add standard structure</code></pre>, you might have to load a type library first. Go to <pre><code>View -> Open subviews -> Type libraries</code></pre>, then right-click and select <pre><code>Load type library...</code></pre> to see the list that IDA has available.\n",
