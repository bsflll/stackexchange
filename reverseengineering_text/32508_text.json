    "content": "I'm trying to parse a binary file and it has a structure similar to this,\n<pre><code>struct foo {\n   int64_t count_things;\n   int64_t offset_to_thing[count];\n   int8_t  bytes[];\n   int64_t other fields;\n}\n\nstruct thing { ; not relevant for example }\n</code></pre>\nNow the catch here is that the amount of things is stored in the struct. I assume the whole rest of this is more or less stored as a flexible array member...\n<pre><code>struct foo { int64_t count_things; int8_t bytes[size] }\n</code></pre>\nBut I want more specificity as I want to be able to seek to the location and dump this out. Does Radare give me the tools to parse this kind of variable-length struct?\n",
