    "content": "I have one question maybe you can help, I always find this functions in IDA:\n<pre><code>void __thiscall sub_79340(_BYTE *this, int a2, int a3, int a4)\n</code></pre>\nAnd I use them like this:\n<pre><code>// talkChannel\ntypedef DWORD(__thiscall* _talkChannel)(DWORD localplayer, uintptr_t mode, uintptr_t channelId, const std::string& message);\n_talkChannel talkChannel;\ntalkChannel = (_talkChannel)(moduleBase + 0x79340);\n\ntalkChannel(LocalPlayerPointer, 1, 0, \"hello world\");\n</code></pre>\nBut this time I find this in IDA:\n<pre><code>_DWORD *__thiscall sub_142860(_DWORD **this, _DWORD *a2, int a3)\n</code></pre>\nI understand the first definition (return void, calling convention thiscall, address of function X, pointer to this as it's a thiscall, parameters)... but I can't understand the second one :(\nI don't know how to call this... Anyone could help me explaining what it means and how to use it? I would like to understand the difference between both\nThanks for your time <3\n",
