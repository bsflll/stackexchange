    "content": "So I just got Zyxel nas326 and I looked from internet how to protect nas from bruteforce attack and I found that fail2ban can protect my nas.\nThen I found that I can't download any programs to nas326. So now I ask how I can Install fail2ban to Zyxel nas326.\nI know in theory I can use wget to download it from my own ftp server and run it, because that nas have python by default, but command <pre><code>pip</code></pre> doesn't work\" (<pre><code>python</code></pre> work). Commands like <pre><code>sudo</code></pre> and <pre><code>apt-</code></pre> dont work\nAnyone have done this before? Any other suggestions for bruteforce protection?\n",

Try placing the files where required manually... you don't really need the docs, so you could ditch those.
