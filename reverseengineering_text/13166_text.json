    "content": "I'm reversing an x86 binary and I have an instruction that using the at&t syntax is\n<pre><code>movl 0xc(%ebp), %eax\n</code></pre>\nwhile using the intel syntax is\n<pre><code>mov eax, dword [ebp+arg_3]\n</code></pre>\nI'm using radare2, and at the start of the function it prints\n<pre><code>; arg int arg_0_1      @ ebp+0x1\n; arg int arg_3        @ ebp+0xc\n</code></pre>\nWhy <pre><code>[ebp+arg_3]</code></pre> instead of a simple substitution like <pre><code>[arg_3]</code></pre>?\n",

A compiler might have produced an instruction using <pre><code>esp</code></pre> instead, if no stack frame exists, or any other register if the code were written by hand. \nFurther, to show only <pre><code>[arg_3]</code></pre> implies that the access is equivalent to another memory location such as <pre><code>[401000h]</code></pre>, but with a name instead of a number.\n",

They seem to simply equate arg3 to 0xc and not bother with details :) If your question is about \"; arg int arg_3        @ ebp+0xc\" - then yeah I agree it's a bit illogical but hey, ask them to fix it :)</span>",
