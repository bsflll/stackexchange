    "content": "I'm currently debugging a program using x64dbg, and I'm wondering how to quickly jump to the start or end (prologue/epilogue) of a function while I'm in the middle of it. I couldn't find this information through Googling.\nSpecifically, I'd like to know if x64dbg has any built-in commands or shortcuts to navigate directly to the beginning or end of a function while debugging. If such functionality exists, what are the steps or commands to use it effectively?\nAdditionally, if there are any alternative methods or plugins available that can achieve this, I'd appreciate hearing about them as well.\nRelated\n\nHow to jump to the start/end of a function in IDA disassembly?\n",
