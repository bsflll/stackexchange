            "text": "@rce It's not a stupid question. As I read it, the question is about how to ask IDA to show an operand (in the disassembly) or an expression (in the decompilation) in an alternative fashion, as a form of annotation to aid in comprehension. This is not that much different from displaying a constant as an enum element. And as my answer illustrates, it is in fact possible to do this. Everybody else seems to have interpreted the question as being how to undo compiler optimizations instead of a question about how to annotate the database.\n",

            "content": "At the assembly level, IDA reconstructs the instructions as seen in memory.\nConstant multiplication adds an overhead of at least one additional instruction (like MUL or MLA for ARM CPUs); when a compiler detects two constants being multiplied in source code, the result is usually calculated at compile time and used as a single constant in the compiled binary.\nIf the compiler optimized your code by replacing <pre><code>5 * 20</code></pre> with <pre><code>100</code></pre>, there isn't any way for IDA to disassemble or decompile it differently. In such a case that information has been lost during compilation and only exists in the application's source code.\nAssuming ARM architecture and a little-endian CPU like TI MSP430, the first instruction,\n<pre><code>MOV R1, #100\n</code></pre>\nwould produce the following opcodes:\n<pre><code>\\x64\\x10\\xa0\\xe3\n</code></pre>\nIf that is the case for you, you need to recompile the program with different compiler settings or use a different compiler to exclude compilation-time optimizations.\nYou can enable the view of opcodes in IDA with\nOptions/General/Disassembly → Number of opcode bytes (non-graph).\n",

The \"manual operand\" feature is meant for exactly this case. On the most common assemblers, IDA is even able to verify that your manually entered operand expression matches the value found in the machine code. Features like this make IDA an <i>Interactive</i> Dis-Assembler and IMHO are a significant reason why IDA use is so wide-spread.</span>",

As an example consider a situation that the variable \"var\" with immediate value 100 is compared with another variable that holds a temperature sensor value in disassembly. From its datasheet you know sensor is reporting the read temperature in \"4X °C\" format. Now the mysterious value \"100\" became the friendly \"4 * 25\" which means the original code was comparing the sensor value with 25 °C.</span>",

If 5*20 makes the code more legible and understandable it's better to decompile it to that regardless of what the original source code had. It may even be an improvement over the original source code.</span>",
