    "content": "I am writing my own applications to practice reversing. I want to be able to detect debuggers and change the execution in response.\nWhen building the application, I am easily able to detect it is being debugged with\n<pre><code>System.Diagnostics.Debugger.IsAttached</code></pre> or kernel32.dll's <pre><code>CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent</code></pre>method.\n<pre><code>if (System.Diagnostics.Debugger.IsAttached)\n            {\n                //code if being debugged\n            }\n</code></pre>\nWhen I debug my release in x64dbg though, the debugger is not detected. Is there a way to detect this?\n",
