    "content": "I am playing with the project here: https://github.com/foreverbell/angr-rust-example\nAfter running <pre><code>make solve</code></pre>, I cannot get the desired output.\nI added <pre><code>print(sm.errored)</code></pre> to the end of the script and get\n<pre><code>...\n65 <SimulationManager with 1 active> 1\n66 <SimulationManager with all stashes empty (1 errored)> 0\n[<State errored with \"No bytes in memory for block starting at 0x23930.\">]\n</code></pre>\nI played around with several other examples and the same problem <pre><code>'No bytes in memory for block starting at'</code></pre> occured.\nI changed <pre><code>full_init_state</code></pre> to <pre><code>entry_state</code></pre> in the code, and the code works somewhat normally (I am able to get the output).\nThis is the full code I am using:\n<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport angr\nimport sys\n\nif sys.argv[1] == \"main\":\n  p = angr.Project(\"build/main\")\nelif sys.argv[1] == \"bench\":\n  p = angr.Project(\"build/bench\")\n\nstate = p.factory.entry_state()\nstate.options.add(angr.options.BYPASS_UNSUPPORTED_SYSCALL)\n\nsm = p.factory.simulation_manager(state)\nsm.use_technique(angr.exploration_techniques.dfs.DFS())\n\ndep = 0\nwhile len(sm.active) > 0:\n  dep += 1\n  sm.step()\n  print(dep, sm, len(sm.deadended + sm.active))\n  for s in sm.deadended + sm.active:\n    stdin = s.posix.dumps(0)\n    stdout = s.posix.dumps(1)\n    if stdin and (b\"yes\" in stdout):\n      print(stdin)\n      exit()\n\nprint(sm.errored)\n</code></pre>\nI do not know if it is a problem with my installation of angr or if something changed that breaks <pre><code>full_init_state</code></pre>, but I found that I frequently encounter 'No bytes in memory for block starting at' on other large binaries even with <pre><code>entry_state</code></pre>. So I want to know if I am doing something wrong with my installation or workflow here.\nFor the record, I am using <pre><code>angr_dev</code></pre> for installation of angr.\n",
