    "content": "I am working on a mipsel binary in IDA Pro and I'm having some issues with renaming subroutines.\nI have the subroutine \"system\" at 0x739644. I renamed this using the N hotkey.\n\nNow if I hit X, some of the xrefs have been replaced:\n\nAll of the JALR instructions are fine.\nHowever, sometimes subroutines are called like so:\n\nIn this case, sometimes the reference has been renamed and sometimes it hasn't. They all show up in xrefs though:\n\nWhy is this? Can I rename them all?\n",
