    "content": "Well, I have the old version of an assembly with a mapped address to a function I need to detour.\nThe developer has stopped the reverse engineering to that assembly, so now, I want to do his job. But Idk where to start. I'm very newbie on this bussiness.\nI have downloaded IDA, and I have subroutine calls on the assembly language. but I don't know how to continue.\nI already have checked for the hexadecimal but this trick didn't worked on the new version.\nSo, what tricks do you suggest?\n",
