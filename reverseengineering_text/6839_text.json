    "content": "I have researched a lot about reverse engineering WP8 apps but nothing seems to work for apps that are digitally signed (Yes, I am talking about Apps from Windows App Store)\nXAPSpy works with Windows Phone 7 only and may be, with unsigned WP8 apps(but I am not sure on this part).\nSome answers of StackExchange says that <pre><code>Tangerine</code></pre> and <pre><code>Windows Phone App Analyzer</code></pre> can be used, but it doesn't seem to work with digitally signed apps. \n<pre><code>Question</code></pre> :\nIs it not possible at all, to reverse engineer WP8 apps collected from Store and perform security audit? \nTIA.\nRegards,\n",

The \"root/jailbreak\" solution is true but as per my knowledge the jailbreak is not yet available for Windows Phone 8.  I have been searching since long and have come to the conclusion that currently my question has no solution unless any jailbreak is available or else the device has a zero-day ;-).  The only solution left is to get the Developer version of the app in order to proceed further.\n",
