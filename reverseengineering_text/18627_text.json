    "content": "I have a .so from an Android JNI/NDK application. Here are two of its sections:\n<pre><code>[Nr] Name              Type            Addr     Off    Size   ES Flg Lk Inf Al\n[10] .rel.plt          REL             001c9034 1c9034 00c928 08  AI  3  11  4\n[11] .plt              PROGBITS        001d595c 1d595c 012dd0 00  AX  0   0  4\n</code></pre>\nBased on the Info parameter of <pre><code>.rel.plt</code></pre>, I would expect the relocations it contains to affect the contents of the <pre><code>.plt</code></pre> section. However, the addresses in the relocations are all to much higher addresses:\n<pre><code>Relocation section '.rel.plt' at offset 0x1c9034 contains 6437 entries:\n Offset     Info    Type                Sym. Value  Symbol's Name\n00e1bb6c  00000216 R_ARM_JUMP_SLOT        00000000   __cxa_atexit@LIBC\n00e1bb70  00000116 R_ARM_JUMP_SLOT        00000000   __cxa_finalize@LIBC\n00e1bb74  00000316 R_ARM_JUMP_SLOT        00a0f8c5   _Znwj\n00e1bb78  00000416 R_ARM_JUMP_SLOT        00a0f941   _ZdlPv\n00e1bb7c  00000516 R_ARM_JUMP_SLOT        00a1886d   __gxx_personality_v0\n00e1bb80  00000716 R_ARM_JUMP_SLOT        00000000   __stack_chk_fail@LIBC\n00e1bb84  00000b16 R_ARM_JUMP_SLOT        009ed201   _ZNSt6__ndk16chrono12system_clock3nowEv\n</code></pre>\nThose addresses fall into the range of the <pre><code>.got</code></pre> and <pre><code>.data</code></pre> sections. This is a shared object, so the offsets should be virtual address based rather than section based, and the ELF for the ARM Architecture says:\n\nThe ELF standard requires that the GOT-generating relocations of the PLT are emitted into a contiguous sub-range of the dynamic relocation section. That sub-range is denoted by the standard tags DT_JMPREL and DT_PLTRELSZ.  The type of relocations (RELor RELA) is stored in the DT_PLTREL tag.\n\nAm I misunderstanding what the offset of these relocations applies to? Or perhaps what \"GOT-generating relocations\" means?\n",

Correcting this misunderstanding, the relocations all address entries in the GOT which address the PLT, as expected.\n",
