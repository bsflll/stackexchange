    "content": "i'm new to this and still learning a lot. Now i have managed to download the binary image from an Flash memory out of a unit having an OMAP5912 SoC. The SoC has an ARM9 family CPU core running little endian ARM code.\nFor now i could disassemble it using IDA Pro, but some things need to be checked at runtime.\nTherefore i was looking for a way to execute instructions step-by-step, watching the registers, set breakpoints and such.\nMy binary has no symbols inside.\nIs is possible to let QEMU emulate the CPU using \"qemu-sytem-arm\" and connect this to IDA Pro debugger?\nIf so, please help me in that, because i'm new to debugging.\n",
