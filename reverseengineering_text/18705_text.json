            "content": "It seems you may be looking for:\n<pre><code>gdb --args ./RelayD start --daemon\n</code></pre>\n(although you probably want to avoid <pre><code>--daemon</code></pre> if that's optional).\nHowever, that above (shell) command is equivalent to:\n<pre><code>gdb ./RelayD\n</code></pre>\n... followed by (on the GDB prompt):\n<pre><code>run start --daemon\n</code></pre>\nNote how in both cases I am passing the arguments as per the script line and how I am passing the relative path instead of merely the name of an executable.\nThere may be another catch here, but it's hard to tell and you don't explicitly mention the distro you're on. However, it's possible that for your system you need to enable multilib support [1] so that your x86-64 OS can run x86-32 binaries (that <pre><code>RelayD</code></pre> ELF file) and that you may have to install some packages you have to install in order to have GDB support this scenario. The alternative could be to run a 32-bit container (which still requires multilib, if I am not mistaken) and inside that prepare and debug with a 32-bit GDB or use a 32-bit VM to get the debugging done. But for all I know most distros support the scenario of debugging a 32-bit binary on the 64-bit host system. So it's likely a matter of installing some extra packages.\nOh and last but not least you may be missing some of the shared objects (libraries) that the 32-bit executable expects. Use <pre><code>readelf</code></pre> or <pre><code>ldd</code></pre> on your <pre><code>RelayD</code></pre> to find out more.\n[1] <pre><code>yum groupinstall \"Compatibility Libraries\"</code></pre> should do the trick, provided <pre><code>multilib_policy=all</code></pre> is set in your <pre><code>yum.conf</code></pre> and you're indeed running on RHEL (or CentOS or Scientific Linux) as suggested by the GDB output you gave. Also make sure <pre><code>yum.conf</code></pre> does not contain <pre><code>exclude = *.i?86</code></pre> to preclude the 32-bit packages from being considered (<pre><code>exactarch=1</code></pre> may also have an adverse effect, so consult <pre><code>man yum.conf</code></pre>). You can also pick and choose your own compatibility libraries by searching the list with <pre><code>yum search compat|grep ^compat-</code></pre>.\n",

You may have to use <code>readelf</code> instead (which doesn't use the loader) <i>or</i> install a 32-bit linker first, so <code>ldd</code> can do its job. Otherwise, I reckon, something fishy is going on ...</span>",
