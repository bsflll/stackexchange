    "content": "Unlike <pre><code>LogMeIn</code></pre> or <pre><code>GoToMyPC</code></pre>, <pre><code>TeamViewer</code></pre> does not have any driver files except for the <pre><code>INF and GPD</code></pre> files. <pre><code>LogMeIn</code></pre> and <pre><code>GoToMyPC</code></pre> have their own configuration and driver dlls, while TeamViewer uses the <pre><code>default unidrvui.dll for config and unidrv.dll as driver file</code></pre>. \nI don't seem to understand how Teamviewer is able to develop a <pre><code>virtual printer driver</code></pre> without writing their own driver dll.\nVNC also seems to follow similar way, they use <pre><code>unidrvui.dll and unidrv.dll</code></pre>, but they have one more custom dll <pre><code>VNCui.dll</code></pre> (guess this is also a config dll).\nHave anyone tried to reverse engineer <pre><code>TeamViewer</code></pre> or <pre><code>VNC's</code></pre> virtual printer driver? Please shed some light on this.\n",
