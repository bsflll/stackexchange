            "content": "Yes. The newer versions of IDA has official bindings for the Hex-Rays decompiler.\nOriginally, the Python bindings were written by EiNSTeiN around the Hex-Rays Decompiler SDK API. Later it has been merged into IDAPython.\nYou can find the documentation under \"ida_hexrays\" in the IDAPython docs.\nExamples can be found in IDAPython repository. Check the scripts which starting with \"vds\".\nYou can check IDA Batch Decompile plugin which aims, as stated by the author, to batch decompile files in a folder:\n\nIDA Batch Decompile is a plugin for Hex-Ray's IDA Pro that adds the\n  ability to batch decompile multiple files and their imports with\n  additional annotations (xref, stack var size) to the pseudocode .c\n  file\n\nNotice that this is a work-in-progress project so you might encounter some bugs.\n",

I can't share the exact code used, but this might be useful for others looking at this too:\nDocker-IDA -  https://github.com/intezer/docker-ida - Can be changed to work on HexRays fairly easily\nThen commands such as the following may be useful:\n['/ida/idat','-Ohexrays:outfile:ALL','-A',folder + 'input.bin'])\n['mono','/dnSpy/dnSpy.Console.exe',filename,'-o', outdir]\n['/retdec/bin/decompile.sh','-l','py',filename]\n",
