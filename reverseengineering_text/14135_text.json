    "content": "I am looking at a statically linked ARM binary from a Busybox system. \nAfter IDA is done with the initial analysis, I end up with a lot of subroutines with these strange floating stubs. There are no references to get to them, and I can't see what function they serve.\nIs this simply an IDA issue?\n",
