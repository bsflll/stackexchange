    "content": "I have a running memory dump saved as a raw binary file.  This isn't a standalone executable - it's literally just a snapshot of running memory.\nI'm looking for a tool that will help me identify assembly instructions within this binary file.  Does such a tool exist?  \nI know you can use OllyDebug or IDAPRO to analyze executables.  However, since this is a full memory dump, it'a not clear to me whether these tools are still applicable.  For a raw memory dump there isn't a clear entry point that IDA can start with.\nAny suggestions would be very helpful.  Thanks!\n",

To find them in a memory dump (kernel or user mode), you can run the WinDbg command\n<pre><code>.imgscan\n</code></pre>\nFrom WinDbg help:\n\nThe .imgscan command scans virtual memory for image headers.\nThe .imgscan command displays any image headers that it finds and the header type. Header types include Portable Executable (PE) headers and Microsoft MS-DOS MZ headers.\n\nI was able to verify this in user mode, but with the only Windows XP kernel mode dump I currently have, it does not output anything.\nExample output from a user mode dump:\n<pre><code>MZ at 000007fe`ff4d0000, prot 00000004, type 00020000 - size db000\n  Name: ADVAPI32.dll\n</code></pre>\nSo all the necessary information to get the DLL is available. In case of a user mode dump I have used\n<pre><code>.writemem <FileName> <Range>\n</code></pre>\nto write the DLL to disk and analyze later. \n<pre><code><Range></code></pre> is according the address and range syntax, e.g.\n<pre><code>.writemem advapi32.dll 000007fe`ff4d0000 Ldb000\n</code></pre>\nThis probably won't work for kernel mode dumps because parts of the module may have been swapped to disk, so the DLL in memory is no longer complete.\nThis approach will also not find code that was generated on the fly.\nFinding potentially executable code\nCode that can be executed must reside in a memory block that has the <pre><code>executable</code></pre> flag set.\nUnfortunately the command\n<pre><code>!address -f:<filter>\n</code></pre>\nis broken in WinDbg 6.2.9200. It should work in user mode dumps and output a list of start and end addresses that are executable.\nAt the moment I only get\n<pre><code>0:067> !address -f:PAGE_EXECUTE\n\n        BaseAddress      EndAddress+1        RegionSize     Type       State                 Protect             Usage\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0:067> !address -f:PAGE_EXECUTE_READ\nInvalid filter arguments. Type !address -? to get the list of supported parameters\n0:067> !address -f:PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE\nInvalid filter arguments. Type !address -? to get the list of supported parameters\n0:067> !address -f:PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY\nInvalid filter arguments. Type !address -? to get the list of supported parameters\n</code></pre>\nAlthough I have a full memory dump\n<pre><code>0:067> .dumpdebug\n...\nFlags           40002\n                0002 MiniDumpWithFullMemory\n                40000 MiniDumpWithTokenInformation\n</code></pre>\nBut you get the idea and might be able to apply it to other tools.\n",
