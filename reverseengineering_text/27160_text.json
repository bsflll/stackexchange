    "content": "Is there a way in ghidra to change decompiled switch statement case values to their names?\nI'm looking at a WndProc function, with a prototype of <pre><code>LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc(HWND hwnd, UINT msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)</code></pre>. Inside the function are a number of switch statements based on the <pre><code>msg</code></pre> UINT, which ghidra calls <pre><code>param_2</code></pre>. The uint values are defined in <pre><code>winuser.h</code></pre>. I want to change all the spots <pre><code>param_2</code></pre> is compared in the decompilation so it uses the winuser.h names instead of the uint values, for example, change <pre><code>if (param_2 != 0x100)</code></pre> to <pre><code>if (param_2 != WM_KEYDOWN)</code></pre>, for all the <pre><code>param_2</code></pre> checks in a given function.\n",

            "content": "Besides manually changing each case, with some measure of success depending on the logic for the switch, the best way is to create an <pre><code>enum</code></pre> type (it must be sized correctly) with all the values you'd like to see, and then cast <pre><code>param_2</code></pre> to that <pre><code>enum</code></pre> type.\nI don't do many Windows RE, so I'm not certain on how Ghidra has those values available currently, it might already exist in their windows libraries as an enum, though it might be a bunch of individual defines that you might to need to manually create into an <pre><code>enum</code></pre> to use like you're wanting.\n",
