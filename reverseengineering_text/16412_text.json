    "content": "How one can find all subroutine calls once an iOS app has been load into Hopper ?\nIf I understand correctly, a subroutine is identified by a unique address. So in the binary, all calls to this subroutine should point to this address. Thus, it should be possible to list all calls to this address, am I wrong ? It seems to be a simple things to look for, yet I cannot find anything about that elsewhere.\n",

            "content": "If I correctly understand your question, you are searching for the Cross References feature in Hopper.\nCross References\nCross References (or simply XREFs) is a feature of disassemblers to show you where certain functions and objects were called from or which functions and objects are used by a specific function. We can simplify it by relate to it as XREF-To and XREF-From. The referenced can be either Data or Code.\nXREFs are a valuable resource when we want to figure out exactly where a function was called from or what functions the current function calls. This, as you understand, can be quite useful, so we donâ€™t have to iterate the stack for frame pointers to look for the function that called the current function or alternatively searching by hand for a CALLs to specific addresses.\nHopper\nIn hopper disassembler you can can see XREFs-To addresses by pressing X while you mark the desired address. XREFs-From can be shown using Alt+X. Alternatively you can find the Cross References lists under <pre><code>Navigate</code></pre> in the Hopper's top toolbar.\nYou can also find the references to and from an adress by pressing Right Click on it and then choosing either \"References to...\" or \"References from...\".\n\nNeverthless, when a program is analyzed, Hopper is adding a list of XREFs-From in the comments:\n<pre><code>  j_puts:\n08048390   jmp   dword [puts@GOT]   ; puts@GOT,puts, CODE XREF=sub_8048662+15, sub_8048662+31, sub_8048662+86, sub_8048662+104\n</code></pre>\n",

A function is located at VA 1000\n\nLoad value 100 into register1\nMultiply register1 by 5\nAdd 500 to register1\nPush arguments onto the stack\nCall register1\n\nI hope this helps a bit.\n",
