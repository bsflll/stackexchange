            "content": "It is a bit unclear what do you mean by \"library being called\". If you want to know when the library is loaded, you may look for references to <pre><code>System.loadLibrary(string)</code></pre> or <pre><code>System.load(string)</code></pre> java functions. You might for example hook it using Frida.\nIf you want to see when particular functions exported by the <pre><code>libusbhost.so</code></pre> are called, you also may use Frida. There is prebuild tool called frida-trace. For example using <pre><code>frida-trace -U -i “Java_*” [package_name]</code></pre>, will print out all the calls to JNI native functions from your app, along with their timestamp.\nIf you want to alter the parameters of the called functions, modify the way they work, or replace their return values - you may find the Frida Interceptor module useful.\n",

My problem is, it's always stopping with the error message <code>Failed to start tracing: script is destroyed Server terminated</code> I think it's probably due to me repackaging the app, and then using it. It probably has some problems with that, because it destroys the process immediately (from logcat, what I've seen)</span>",
