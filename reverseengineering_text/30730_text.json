    "content": "I am trying to modify cfunc AST from\n<pre><code>If (a1 && some_func_ptr) {\n  some_func_ptr();\n}\n</code></pre>\nTo\n<pre><code>if (a1) {\n  some_func_ptr();\n}\n</code></pre>\nBut I constantly get INTERR 50683 error. I tried\n<pre><code>new_item = idaapi.cexpr_t(item.cif.expr.x)\nitem.cif.expr.swap(new_item)\n</code></pre>\nAlso many other attempts to modify other parts of AST fail in the same way. I suspect that it has something to do with thisown flag, but various changes did nothing.\n",

            "content": "The 50683 INTERR means address is invalid. There is a check applied by verifier (\\IDAFolder\\plugins\\hexrays_sdk\\verifier\\cverify.cpp) in cfunc_t::verify_insn function:\n<pre><code>case cit_if:\n  if ( maturity < CMAT_TRANS1 || maturity >= CMAT_CASTED )\n  {\n    ea_t jea = i->cif->expr.calc_jmp_cnd_ea();\n    if ( jea != BADADDR && i->ea != jea )\n      // ctree: mismatch in if-statement and its expression addresses\n      CFAIL_QASSERT(50683, i);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThere are also many other INTERRs for decompilation in case anyone is looking. So, the correct code in my case had to have something like this:\n<pre><code>new_item = idaapi.cexpr_t(item.cif.expr.x)\nnew_item.ea = item.cif.expr.ea\n# or just new_item.ea = idaapi.BADADDR it works too\nitem.cif.expr.swap(new_item)\n</code></pre>\n",
