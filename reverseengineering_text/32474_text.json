    "content": "I asked exactly the same question here, but later I figure out this community and found out this helpful to ask it here as well.\nI would like to have a decompiled pseudo-code in <pre><code>Ghidra</code></pre> like:\n<pre><code>FUN_4c4363e8(\"Hello world\");\n</code></pre>\nThis is what usually I see in <pre><code>IDA</code></pre> , but in Ghidra, by default I get such a code:\n<pre><code>FUN_4c4363e8((char*)(DAT_4c447798));\n</code></pre>\nIs there a way to force the decompiler to convert the <pre><code>DAT_4c447798</code></pre> memory address to <pre><code>\"Hello world\"</code></pre> null-terminated string?\nThanks.\n",
