    "content": "I am attempting to communicate to a device i have via the onboard rx/tx solder points i found on the board. I am doing this via an arduino uno.\nThe problem i am having is that when i connect to it via serial (baud 115200) i get the correct output from the device but any key i press seems to come up as a random character. Is there a setting that i need to change in putty? What am i missing?\nThe following screenshot is just holding down the \"h\" key.\n",
