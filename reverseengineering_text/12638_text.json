    "content": "First off, I hope this is the right place to ask this question, if not please let me know where I should ask it. \nI have a Windows XP sp2 VM (fresh install with no updates), with Python and immunity installed. \nWhen I try and launch immunity, I see a brief view of the main window, then it closes. I get no errors and nothing in the Windows event viewer. \nI am using the latest version of immunity from their website. \nIs there anywhere else I can look for the cause of the problem? Is this a known issue? Does anyone know how to fix this problem? \nCheers!\n",

I installed Python 2.7 and, when I launched Immunity Debugger, it came up perfectly.  So, in addition the your environmental variables, also be careful about which version of Python you're running!\n",
