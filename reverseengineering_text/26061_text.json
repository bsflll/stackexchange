    "content": "My question is theoretical, and not bound to python - but for the sake of simplicity, I'll use Python code snippet.\nLet's assume I have the following code:\n<pre><code>import os\nimport sys\n\nif os.path.exist(sys.argv[1]):\n    os.system(f\"echo {sys.argv[1]}\")\n</code></pre>\nIs there a way to do a command injection attack in the scenario when the unsanitized input is a path to a valid file?\n",
