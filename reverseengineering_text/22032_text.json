    "content": "In Android shared library that heavily protected against debugging, I found following code:\n<pre><code>CODE32\nldr pc, [pc, #-4]\n</code></pre>\nFor me, this instruction looks like <pre><code>NOP</code></pre>; it just jumps to next instruction in ARM mode. The debugged process crashes on this command, however. I use <pre><code>IDA</code></pre> to debug the process.\nCan anyone explain why?\n",
