    "content": "I Have an ultrasonic machine that has a cartridge with a set amount of uses. When that value gets to 0, the cartridge has to be disposed, and a new one bought. The thing is that with some maintenance before the cartridge runs out of uses, it's possible to prevent it from being damaged, and it's life can be extended (I don't know how true this is, I was just asked to believe).\nSo far, I was able to find that the cartridge uses an STC uC (100% impossible to read back), and that it's using UART at 19200bps. That's all I know, and I certainly can read the communication with the machine and the cartridge, so I think all the other things are OK. I was even able to replicate the cartridge with my computer, by re-sending recorded messages using docklight.\nThe thing now is that I can't figure out what is what on the communication. Here is a selected and filtered communication between both devices:\n<pre><code>CART - FB 05 01 03 86 00 8E BF // 20100 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 95 A8 BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 95 53 BF // 20099 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 94 AF BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 94 54 BF // 20098 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 93 BA BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 93 41 BF // 20097 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 92 BD BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 92 46 BF // 20096 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 91 B4 BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 91 4F BF // 20095 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 90 B3 BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 90 48 BF // 20094 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 8F EE BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 8F 15 BF // 20093 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 8E E9 BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 8E 12 BF // 20092 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 8D E0 BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 8D 1B BF // 20091 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 8C E7 BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 8C 1C BF // 20090 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 8B F2 BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 8B 09 BF // 20089 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 8A F5 BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 8A 0E BF // 20088 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 89 FC BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 89 07 BF // 20087 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 88 FB BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 88 00 BF // 20086 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 87 D6 BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 87 2D BF // 20085 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 86 D1 BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 86 2A BF // 20084 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 85 D8 BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 85 23 BF // 20083 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 84 DF BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 84 24 BF // 20082 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 83 CA BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 83 31 BF // 20081 uses left\nMACH + FB 03 85 82 CD BF // subtract 1 use\nCART - FB 05 01 03 85 82 36 BF // 20080 uses left\n</code></pre>\nSome things to note:\n\nafter the cartridge (CART) sends its byte stream (which I call \"Identification\" string), it stays on \"idle\", sending 00s every 750ms, waiting for the machine to talk to it.\nthe ID string is only sent once, and only when the cartridge gets power, never again until power goes out. for the tests, I always turned the machine on, did one trigger (subtract one use) and turned it off.\nthe machine reads the remaining uses of the cartridge by the ID string. It never verifies if the chip wrote the data to its internal eeprom or wherever it has to be written.\nthere are some prior init messages that have nothing to do with what I want to do\nafter the machine (MACH) sends its \"Subtract\" command, the cartridge responds with sort of an acknowledge, before the machine sends again the same command, and the cartridge responds again, before going into \"idle\" mode\n\nSo far, I think this is how things go:\nfor everything: <pre><code>FB</code></pre> opens the communication and <pre><code>BF</code></pre> closes it.\nfor the Identificacion string:\n\n<pre><code>05 01 03</code></pre> is probably some kind of identification string (I'm still in doubt about the <pre><code>03</code></pre>), the machine is supposed to support different types of cartridges.\nthe next two bytes are probably the uses number, but I cant figure out how to obtain an actual decimal number that is equal to the one I know (I can see it on the machine panel).\nI believe that the next bit is some kind of checksum, but I don't know which one.\n\nfor the Subtract command:\n\n<pre><code>03</code></pre>, I don't really know. It can be part of the number of uses, but I'm not sure. I can't get the cartridge to go to 0.\nthe next two bytes are, again, the number of uses left, or part of it.\nthe next byte, again, could be a checksum, but don't know what.\n\nThat's where I'm currently sitting. I would like to know if there is some kind of program or website that could help me figure out if the supposedly \"checksum\" byte, is actually a checksum or not, and also figure out what operation is done to the number to convert it to those two or three bytes before the checksum\n",

If so, what happens if you send a \"subtract to 20099\" as in your second line of code? BTW, the second byte, right after <code>FB</code> seems to be the size in bytes of the data including checksum</span>",

The cartridge does no verification if the number is bigger or smaller than the one already stored. The limit seems to be 20100 uses tho. Giving it a bigger number just has no effect. And also, good suggestion about the first data byte, I wouldn't have figured it out. I still have to figure out what the 01 03 means, but maybe playing with other cartridge models will help</span>",
