    "content": "Last night I was extending functionality of HexRaysCodeXplorer - implemented feature to automatically rename duplicating variables. It needs some fixes to work well, but the problem I cannot cope with is - how to preserve lvar names?\nThis is how it works:\n\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\n\nThese names do exist only till end of current Ida session. \nI have read about Ida's netnodes, but I don't think it's rational to store lvar names in this container and do renaming at the start of every session. I suspect there is some native way to preserve essential information (like in this case), but I cannot find it.\nBecause I had to analyse c-tree, I used HexRays classes like: <pre><code>ctree_visitor_t</code></pre>, <pre><code>cfuncptr_t</code></pre> and <pre><code>lvar_t</code></pre>.\n",
