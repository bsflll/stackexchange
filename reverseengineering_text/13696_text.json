    "content": "this is Easy_ELF from Reversing.Kr\nRight now R2 displays absolute address for a character inside of a string:\n<pre><code>  [0x08048454]> pdf\n  ...\n  0x08048454      0fb60521a004.  movzx eax, byte [0x804a021] \n</code></pre>\nI already made a flag for global buffer\n<pre><code> f glob.passwordBuf 16 @ 0x0804a020 \n</code></pre>\nhow to apply offset from it to make R2 to display something like\n<pre><code> 0x08048454      0fb60521a004.  movzx eax, byte [glob.passwordBuf + 1] \n</code></pre>\n? I.e. I want disassembler to use  what <pre><code>fd 0x804a021</code></pre> returns (which is <pre><code>glob.passwordBuf + 1</code></pre>)\nI tried to reanalyze the function, but it didn't help.\n",
