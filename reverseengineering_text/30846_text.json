Is there any automated way that I can distinguish them from other ARM firmwares?\nI have some ideas like Interrupt vector Table (ivt) or looking for other specific features of Cortex-M like Systick, but I am not sure if they are going to work.\n",

If you have many of them at even addresses, especially repeated (sequence of empty functions), then it’s a pretty strong hint.\n",
