There is a sequence of 14 bytes in the file, which is repeated every 64 KB, it looks like something to mark blocks... On the other hand, binwalk calculated entropy close to 1 in the entire file. So there will be some compression. That does not go together. The sequence must go away... ??? After those 14 bytes is always increasing number. Always the same structure up to 32. byte. It is possible, that somewhere on the beginning is one or more \"small\" pictures.\n",
