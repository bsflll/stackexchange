We plan to port it to other platforms and add a programmatic API. This will allow our customers to implement their own analysis methods. Vulnerability search, software validation, coverage analysis are the directions that immediately come to mind.\n\nOn 2014/06/04, with the release of IDA 6.6 hex-rays officially released their 64bit x86 decompiler, and it has been steadily improved since then. The official release can be seen on IDA 6.6 page as the first new feature as well as on their changelog.\nIt is a separate product and sold apart from their x86 32bit decompiler, and is currently quoted at the same price as the other decompilers (see price quotes page for named licenses).\nMore than two years after the first release, the decompiler is fully featured and is considered high-grade.\nTwo images of using IDA's 64 bit x86 disassembly and decompilation (from hex-ray's IDA 6.6 page):\n\n(source: hex-rays.com)\n\nOther solutions\nThere are, however, other solutions that provide an IDA plugin for decompilation. Although not precisely what you were looking for, those provide another possible way to achieve your desired goal:\n\nSnowman, A full-blown decompiler with an IDA plugin\na plugin for AVG's Retargetable Decompiler online decompiler (Mentioned by @ws)\nA python-only IDA decompiler plugin called ida-decompiler (Mentioned by @0xea)\n",

It doesn't work on x86_64.\nHowever, if you need something that will work on x86_64 take a look at ida-decompiler:\n\nAn IDA plugin that attempts to decompile a function. Written in Python. To try it in IDA, place your cursor on a function, and execute the plugin. The decompiled function will appear in the output window.\n\nObviously, it's not as advanced as Hex-Rays, but it's a good step toward a good, open decompiler.\n",
