    "content": "I am using BinDiff 4.0 as a plug-in for IDA Pro 6.5. I know that it is possible to save the results as a <pre><code>.BinDiff</code></pre> file, however is there a way I can format this into a more easily accessible file type? I have been searching for a solution for several days and so far the two best solutions I have discovered are to:\n\nCopy and paste the matched functions window (this is simply too inefficient for what I am looking for).\nExport the data as a <pre><code>.BinDiff</code></pre> and then access through an SQL database manager and try to export from there. However it seems to change the data to incorrect values and not what I am looking for. (I want the exact information from the matched functions window).\n\nAdditional Information: I know that BinDiff 3.x had a <pre><code>save_to_log</code></pre> function which (I think) did what I am looking for, and saves the information in the matched function window to a <pre><code>.txt</code></pre> file. I have tried contacting both Zynamics support, and Google/Zynamics support with no reply.\n",
