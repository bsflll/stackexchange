    "content": "Hopper allows you to change the representation of numbers in the disassembly window so that:\n<pre><code>0000be84         str        r3, [r11, #0xfffffff0]\n</code></pre>\nbecomes:\n<pre><code>0000be84         str        r3, [r11, #-0x10]\n</code></pre>\nThis doesn't carry over into the decompiled code though:\n<pre><code>r3 = *(r11 + 0xffffffffffffffd8);\n</code></pre>\nWhilst it's not a major thing, it would be nice for the representation to be carried across.\nCan this be done?\n",
