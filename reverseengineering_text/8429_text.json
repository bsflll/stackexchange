    "content": "I am trying to create a communication interface using C Language to an Air conditioning system, after analyzing the data packets I have identified that the data packet is consist of an 8 bit CRC (I am pretty sure the CRC is the last byte because the rest of the data only changes when I change something in the settings).\nSo what I need to do now is to be able to reverse engineer the process on how to come up with this CRC\n<pre><code>A802000000001F5D0000000073\nA802000000001E5D0000000070\nA802000000001D5D0000000071\n</code></pre>\nIn the data above I purposely changed <pre><code>1F</code></pre> -> <pre><code>1E</code></pre> -> <pre><code>1D</code></pre> and as you can see the value of last byte changed from <pre><code>73</code></pre> -> <pre><code>70</code></pre> -> <pre><code>71</code></pre>.\nI tried different on-line CRC calculators but still had no luck.\nI managed to capture more data samples:\n<pre><code>A80300000004045D0000000045\nA80300000004055D0000000044\nA803000000040F61000000004A\nA802000000040F61000000004B\nA81200004004169A00000000FB\nA81200004004159A00000000F8\nA81200004004149A00000000E5\nA81200084000149C00000000E7\nA83200084000149C0000000087\nA85200084000149C00000000A7\n</code></pre>\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n",

However, this certainly isn't a CRC (the output bits should change more depending on the input if it was), this seems rather like a primitive scheme to me (xor each byte with something, add up the values, xor the result with something else) since in many cases, adding 1 to a nibble subtracts 1 from the checksum.\n",
