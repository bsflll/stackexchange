    "content": "I was reading this article Where I saw that while reversing the WinRAR I saw that the x64dbg is not able to search for a string in all modules \"evaluation copy\". but why is that happening. is the binary not containing this string? and then the author has used the Resource Hacker to search for the string. and he gets the string. but how? what is resource doing that the disassembler isn't? And one more question, what is that constant \"<pre><code>873</code></pre>\". why does it has the value of the string?\nPlease if someone knows, tell me.\n",
