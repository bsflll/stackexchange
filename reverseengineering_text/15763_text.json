    "content": "I'm trying to de-compile a cheat created for my game so I can fix it. The problem is the version used is 3.3.14.2 which no longer has official de-compiler support.\nI have tried looking for 3rd party de-compilers but none of them worked for me. I've read somewhere that the <pre><code>.exe</code></pre> generated by AutoIT is just an embedded interpreter for AutoIT and the script source code but obfuscated.\nDoes anyone know how it is compiled so I can use OllyDBG to try and de-obfuscate the script?\nOf-course the <pre><code>.exe</code></pre> is packed with UPX but can easily be unpacked. So the only problem is script obfuscation. (If my understanding is correct)\nI've tried dumping the application memory but didn't find any readable script there. I've also used OllyDBG to run the application but it gave me the error <pre><code>This is a third-party compiled AutoIt script</code></pre>. Bit confused why but attaching to the running application works okay.\n",
