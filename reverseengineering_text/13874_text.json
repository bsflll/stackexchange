    "content": "I have 64 bit process I want to debug with x64dbg. There is memory mapped file, I found with help of Process Explorer. Properties windows says:\n<pre><code>Type: Section\nDescription: A memory mapped file or paging-file...\nAddress: 0xFFFFF8A002D8A080\n</code></pre>\nBut when I look into x64dbg Memory Map tab, there is no such addresses. I see only range <pre><code>0000000000010000-000007FFFFFE0000</code></pre>. How I can find memory mapped file? I want to place memory breakpoint on it.\n",
