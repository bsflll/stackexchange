    "content": "Decided to write out a list of still unsolved fundamental problems in the field of reverse engineering.\nThis means that today - there is no easy solution to these problems, or problems that can only be solved manually with a lot of effort and time.\n\nRestoration of information about relocations (relocation at the\nlevel of COFF-objects, i.e. more detailed than regular\nfixups-relocations)\nExtracting a linked static library from an PE-executables\nRelocation of functions and sections within PE executables (if\nsymbols and relocation information are removed from PE executables)\n\n\nAll these problems are mainly related to the lack of debugging information in pe-executables, therefore, I did not separate them into separate topics-questions.\nLet me know if there is already a solution for at least one of these problems.\n",
