            "content": "You really need to read up on public-key cryptography, methinks.\nThe scheme - if properly (i.e. securely) implemented - could work somewhat like this:\n\ngenerate a public/private key pair on the infected/affected machine. NOTE: this means each key pair is specific to the machine and there is no single private key that could be used to decrypt everything across a number of machines\ntransfer the private key to the C&C server\nsecurely delete (overwrite) the private key (assuming it was even ever on disk ... could have been in memory the whole time)\nencrypt files against the public key (matching the now unavailable private key)\nshow the ransom note\n\n... now, as a victim you don't have a private key at all.\nYou can vary this further, of course. So this is just one example of how to make sure there is no escape from paying the ransom other than having an (offline) backup in place.\n\nNow some more comments regarding what seem to be misconceptions on your part:\n\nFrom my understanding most randomware has a secret key used for\n  encryption in a server which it contacts to send over the key and use\n  it for encryption\n\nIn asymmetric crypto you need\n\nthe public key:\n\n\nto encrypt data (with the owner of the matching private key being the recipient) or\nvalidate a signature (made by the owner of the matching private key)\n\nthe private key:\n\n\nto decrypt data or\nsign something\n\n\nWhy would someone trying to extort a ransom from you give you the private key before payment?\n\nBut I am wondering, couldnt someone easily either intercept the\n  winsock functions or just grab the key themselves and use it to\n  decrypt the encrypted files?\n\nSince this is based on the misconception above ... nope. But let's assume for a second that that \"author\" of the ransomware would want to provide a way to prove they are able to decrypt the data, they could simply demand that the victim send them one encrypted file and send back the decrypted file without the victim ever getting to see the private (or \"secret\") key. With this modus operandi I have immediately dismantled your idea of sniffing the private key (by whatever means).\nAlso, transport encryption (TLS) can be used to make it even harder to sniff the traffic. So good luck with your suggestion. In theory it may work, but only if the \"author\" of the ransomware is patently stupid.\n\nEven if it is encrypted, it couldnt be that hard to find the place\n  where it gets decrypted by debugging the ransomware\n\nYou would only ever get the private key from the ransomware \"author\" after payment. So for all practical purposes they could even disclose the source code of their \"client-side\" software and you'd still have to pay to be able to decrypt your files.\nThe gist is: if properly implemented, modern crypto is rather secure. In this case to the disadvantage of the victims.\nYour view on ransomware, and I don't mean this in any denigrating fashion, is rather na√Øve. I hope I have clarified some aspects.\n",

So I think it's simpler if 1) bundle public key P in the ransomware 2) generate random key K on the infected machine 3) encrypt all the data with K 4) save P(K) and delete K 5) user pays the ransom with P(K) 6) ransom server decrypts P(K) to K for user to decrypt data. Then the ransomware doesn't need to phone home at all.</span>",
