Do you see the potential for widespread adoption?\nTo me, it looks interesting from the description:\n\nInternational in scope and free for public use, MAEC is a standardized\n  language for encoding and communicating high-fidelity information\n  about malware based upon attributes such as behaviors, artifacts, and\n  attack patterns. \nBy eliminating the ambiguity and inaccuracy that currently exists in\n  malware descriptions and by reducing reliance on signatures, MAEC aims\n  to improve human-to-human, human-to-tool, tool-to-tool, and\n  tool-to-human communication about malware; reduce potential\n  duplication of malware analysis efforts by researchers; and allow for\n  the faster development of countermeasures by enabling the ability to\n  leverage responses to previously observed malware instances.\n\nBut it also looks fairly complicated, which might limit widespread adoption.\n",

To clarify, I meant the 'question' to be mostly 'Is anyone using or contributing to, the MITRE Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization project?' It looks interesting to me, but I have gotten involved in other such projects that have gone nowhere due to lack of interest. My intent was to see the level of interest among malware analysts to help me determine if I should invest time and effort to understand, adopt, and possibly contribute to the project. While interesting, and on version 4, I have not heard of anyone actually using it.\n",
