            "content": "Kevin,\nAs I answered on your last question:\nopen ghidra gui, analyse the binary, click on file -> export program -> and export as a C/C++ file.\nIn this file, ghidra constructs possible typedefs for you.\nFor e.g. <pre><code>typedef unsigned char    undefined1;</code></pre>\nSo, you'll know the possible type of this object. In your particular case, it constructs (assuming a stripped binary):\n<pre><code>typedef unsigned long    undefined8;</code></pre>\nBut, note that these types are just estimates and could be different than the original source code (in case of user defined functions).\n",
