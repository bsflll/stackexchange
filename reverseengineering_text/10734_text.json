    "content": "<pre><code>000007FEEC55CF58| 48 8D 0D F1 A7 0B 00 | lea rcx,qword ptr ds:[7FEEC617750] | ;7FEEC617750:\"500117367\"\n</code></pre>\nI see the above line in the ollyDBG which has the value of <pre><code>\"500117367\"</code></pre> according to the comment made by the ollyDBG itself. \nHowever, I don't know how to access the dereferenced pointer value. When I press Ctrl + G and go to the <pre><code>7FEEC617750</code></pre> memory address, I get an expression like <pre><code>push rbx</code></pre> which is not the value shown in the ollyDBG. \nI am pretty confused by how I should use the offsets and stack in ollyDBG. I simply want to know how to access the value of pointer shown in the comment of ollyDBG <pre><code>[7FEEC617750]</code></pre> and also find out what accesses and writes to <pre><code>[7FEEC617750]</code></pre>.\nP.S Thanks to AcidShout for pinpointing, indeed, the debugger is <pre><code>x64_dbg</code></pre> the cousin of ollyDBG :)\n",
