    "content": "I am reversing a firmware with binwalk. \nUnpacking was succeed, but I can't find my target files. (CGI files in www folder)\nWhen I connect to the web page of my router, I can see links include CGI file names. \nBut after unpacking, I can see only html files, I can't see CGI files.\nI think only some files are unpacked with binwalk tools. \nHow do you think what's the problem? \nThank you\n",
