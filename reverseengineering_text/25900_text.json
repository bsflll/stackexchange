    "content": "I have used MS Detours for one project in c++ and work perfectly.\nI have created a clone of this application (95% of the some code) to hook another file (a GOG game with DRM free), but this time crash always on DetourAttach.\nI have compared A/B these 2 projects (both are 32 bit) and for now seem that the new game that I need to hook is incompatible with detuors (or this is my impression).\nI ask if there is a good alternative when detours not work.\n",
