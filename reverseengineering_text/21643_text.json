    "content": "So I just switched to x64dbg (really using x32 atm) from windbg and so far I like it but the one thing I'm missing is windbg printing all the registers every step in the command window. Anyone know how to get a log like this?\n",

            "content": "There is no such functionality in x64dbg out of the box, but we can make your own by writing a plugin! There are many examples (often with source code) available on http://plugins.x64dbg.com.\nIn this case you will want to register a callback for <pre><code>CB_STEPPED</code></pre>, which gets called after every step. The basic functionality could look something like this:\n<pre><code>PLUG_EXPORT void CBSTEPPED(CBTYPE, PLUG_CB_STEPPED* info)\n{\n    REGDUMP regdump;\n    DbgGetRegDump(&regdump);\n\n    auto& r = regdump.regcontext;\n\n    _plugin_logprintf(R\"(eax=%p ebx=%p ecx=%p\nedx=%p esi=%p edi=%p\neip=%p esp=%p ebp=%p\n)\",\nr.cax, r.cbx, r.ccx,\nr.cdx, r.csi, r.cdi,\nr.cip, r.csp, r.cbp);\n}\n</code></pre>\nI added 64-bit support and a menu to enable/disable this functionality and put the source code on GitHub: https://github.com/mrexodia/regstep.\nThis functionality is dubiously useful in my opinion, because the changes to register values are highlighted in red in the register view and the affected registers of the selected instruction are underlined there as well. In addition you have the info box below the CPU view, which shows you all relevant values for the currently selected instruction too, but if you think logging registers every step is useful for you feel free to extend the plugin to your liking.\n",
