    "content": "I am currently learning RE and I came upon this piece of code which made me question whether  stack frames grow upward:\n<pre><code>0x080483f4 <main+0>:    push   ebp\n0x080483f5 <main+1>:    mov    ebp,esp\n0x080483f7 <main+3>:    and    esp,0xfffffff0\n0x080483fa <main+6>:    sub    esp,0x60\n0x080483fd <main+9>:    mov    DWORD PTR [esp+0x5c],0x0\n</code></pre>\nSo I understand that from <pre><code><main+0></code></pre> until <pre><code><main+6></code></pre>, we're setting up the stack frame. Being that the stack grows downwards, it makes sense that we <pre><code>sub esp,0x60</code></pre> thereby allocating 96 bytes for the main function's stack frame.\nMy confusion/doubts, however start on <pre><code><main+9></code></pre> <pre><code>mov    DWORD PTR [esp+0x5c],0x0</code></pre> which from what I understood stores the value <pre><code>0</code></pre> in a location 4 bytes above the stack pointer and we know that the stack grows downwards, but this operation seems to indicate that the data in the stack frame is stored bottom up.\nSo my question is, does that mean that while the stack as a whole grows downwards individual stack frames actually grow upwards?\n",

Say two variables 'a' and 'b' are created which one will be closer to the stack pointer the first or the second variable?</span>",
