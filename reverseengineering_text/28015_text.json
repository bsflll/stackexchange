    "content": "While using <pre><code>WinDbg: u/uf</code></pre> to disassemble functions in <pre><code>ntoskrnl.exe</code></pre> there are functions that are used in system calls and exception handling that have these weird function call patterns and I can't really make out what is going on. For example, the output of <pre><code>uf nt!KiSystemService</code></pre> has this in the middle of it:\n<pre><code>nt!KiSystemService+0x10b:\nfffff803`66e07acb e80e010000      call    nt!KiSystemService+0x21e (fffff803`66e07bde)\nfffff803`66e07ad0 4883c408        add     rsp,8\nfffff803`66e07ad4 e80e010000      call    nt!KiSystemService+0x227 (fffff803`66e07be7)\nfffff803`66e07ad9 4883c408        add     rsp,8\nfffff803`66e07add e8eeffffff      call    nt!KiSystemService+0x110 (fffff803`66e07ad0)\nfffff803`66e07ae2 4883c408        add     rsp,8\nfffff803`66e07ae6 e8eeffffff      call    nt!KiSystemService+0x119 (fffff803`66e07ad9)\nfffff803`66e07aeb 4883c408        add     rsp,8\nfffff803`66e07aef e8eeffffff      call    nt!KiSystemService+0x122 (fffff803`66e07ae2)\nfffff803`66e07af4 4883c408        add     rsp,8\nfffff803`66e07af8 e8eeffffff      call    nt!KiSystemService+0x12b (fffff803`66e07aeb)\nfffff803`66e07afd 4883c408        add     rsp,8\nfffff803`66e07b01 e8eeffffff      call    nt!KiSystemService+0x134 (fffff803`66e07af4)\n\nGoes on for many many more lines...\n\n</code></pre>\nI'm pretty sure anyone who has poked around <pre><code>ntoskrnl.exe</code></pre> has seen these types of calls before, but I'm not really sure as to what's happening. Is there any explanation as to what kind of C code can cause this kind of ASM code to be compiled, or is this something else from handwritten ASM that's been linked into the executable?\n",
