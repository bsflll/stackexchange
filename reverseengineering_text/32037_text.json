    "content": "Normally in CLI apps you can use <pre><code>Ctrl + c</code></pre> / <pre><code>Ctrl + d</code></pre> to terminate/exit, but they don't seem to do anything in <pre><code>r2</code></pre> - at least not in debugger's <pre><code>v</code></pre> (visual) mode, which is how I use it. To exit, I press <pre><code>q</code></pre>, then type \"exit\", and have to press <pre><code>y</code></pre> twice to confirm quitting and killing the process, which is quite tedious.\nIs it possible to terminate a visual debugging session and exit <pre><code>r2</code></pre> with a single key combination ?\n",
