    "content": "A while back, on a <pre><code>Linux</code></pre> system, I found a strange binary being executed at seemingly random times with some strange arguments, briefly appearing in <pre><code>ps</code></pre>. There was nothing to be found at the usual suspect like <pre><code>init.d</code></pre>, <pre><code>.bashrc</code></pre> and <pre><code>crontab</code></pre>. I found where the binary was located, renamed it, and put a script it its place. The script displayed and passed through all the received arguments and recorded the time and the duration of the binary execution, as well as some <pre><code>/proc</code></pre> information. I was able to figure out what called it, when, and what were the arguments. What is the name of this <pre><code>honeypotting</code></pre>, <pre><code>MITM</code></pre> technique?\n",
