Therefore my guess would be that this is a method call on an COM object instance defined in an external DLL. If you have installed the program check your registry to which DLL the CLSID belongs to. You should find the details here <pre><code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\CLSID\\{EEF18FCD-D67D-4E3C-AA21EC9AF56F90E9}</code></pre>.\n",
