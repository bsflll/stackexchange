    "content": "Environment:\n\nHost: Win7 SP1 x64: VMWare Workstation 9.02, VirtualKD, IDA Pro 6.4.13 (x64) and WinDbg\nGuest: Win7 SP1 x64\n\nI have VirtualKD setup correctly in my guest and host.\nI say this because attaching WinDbg to the guest VM through VirtualKD works flawlessly.\nBut when I try to connect IDA Pro's WinDbg interface using instruction on this page, IDA keeps throwing the following error:\n<pre><code>Windbg: using debugging tools from '<PATH>'\nConnecting to debugger server with 'com:port=\\\\.\\pipe\\kd_Win7x64_SP1,pipe'\nConnect failed: The server is currently disabled.\n</code></pre>\nVirtualKD's <pre><code>vmmon</code></pre> is running on the host and shows the following:\nUPDATE: Turns out, It's a problem with IDA 6.4. I happened to have IDA 6.3 installed on my machine too. That worked with no issues.\nHas anyone used IDA6.4 for live kernel debugging?\nCan someone please tell me how I can correct this issue in IDA 6.4?\n",
