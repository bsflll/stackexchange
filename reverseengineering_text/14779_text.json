    "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/14779/how-to-successfully-add-a-code-section-to-an-executable-file-in-linux",
    "content": "I am in Linux, and I have seen this question a few times but never, nobody answered how to really make this work.\nI need to add a section to an already compiled binary. Lets say for a moment is an ELF file. I'm using objcopy so this should be generic for any format because objcopy uses libbfd that handles many formats.\nMy process is as follows.\nI create the bytecode for a section I want to append to an already compiled ELF file. Let's name this file bytecode.bin\nThen I do:\n<pre><code>objcopy --add-section .mysection=bytecode.bin \\\n--set-section-flags .mysection=code,contents,alloc,load,readonly \\\nmyprogram myprogram_edited\n</code></pre>\nThen I adjust the VMA of the secition:\n<pre><code>objcopy --adjust-section-vma .mysection=$((16#XXXXX)) myprogram_edited myprogram_edited\n</code></pre>\nWhere XXXXXX is the new VMA address for the section.\nI get the warning:\n<pre><code>objcopy: stIbZt3t: warning: allocated section `.mysection' not in segment\n</code></pre>\nWhen I do:\n<pre><code>objdump -d myprogram_edited\n</code></pre>\nI see:\n<pre><code>Disassembly of section .mysection:\n\n0000000000201011 <.mysection>:\n...\n...\n</code></pre>\nSo I see the section is created OK and the VMA adjusted. But the section is not mapped to segments, so it can't be loaded at runtime.\nHow can I solve this?\nEDIT:\nI opted for using Intel's PIN tool. Very useful and powerful for RI and binary injection.\n",

In particular, <pre><code>objcopy</code></pre> won't add PHT entries for you, so you will have to extend or adjust the PHT manually. You can either do it manually with a hex editor or try using a library such as <pre><code>libelf</code></pre> (it gives you necessary primitives but you'll need to implement the logic yourself).\n",
