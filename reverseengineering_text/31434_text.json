    "content": "I am trying to learn binary exploitation. I can modify the binary behaviour with gdb, but I have not understood how to exploit the binary in C.\nI've found some references on \"Hacking - the art of exploitation\", but I cannot completely figure out how to exploit the binary. Could someone show me some examples or give me a guideline?\nBelow is the simple code I am trying to exploit (force the app to run execl):\n<pre><code>#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) \n{\n  int shell= 0;\n\n\n  if (shell==0) {\n  printf(\"Bye\n\");\n  return 1;\n  \n  }\n\n  execl(\"/bin/sh\", \"/bin/sh\", \"-p\", (void *) NULL);\n  perror(\"exec\");\n  return 1;\n}\n  \n</code></pre>\nwith objdump:\n<pre><code>08048486 <main>:\n 8048486:       55                      push   %ebp\n 8048487:       89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp\n 8048489:       83 ec 04                sub    $0x4,%esp\n...\n 80484b4:       68 68 85 04 08          push   $0x8048568\n 80484b9:       68 68 85 04 08          push   $0x8048568\n 80484be:       e8 8d fe ff ff          call   8048350 <execl@plt>\n 80484c3:       83 c4 10                add    $0x10,%esp\n...\n 80484d8:       c9                      leave  \n 80484d9:       c3                      ret    \n 80484da:       66 90                   xchg   %ax,%ax\n 80484dc:       66 90                   xchg   %ax,%ax\n 80484de:       66 90                   xchg   %ax,%ax\n</code></pre>\nThank you\n",
