    "content": "I have under my disposal some Ford EECV bin files and my goal for the next few weeks is to retrieve the functions and tables, and plot them out before going onto DIY hardware.\nDoes anyone know which platforms to use to analyze Ford/Intel 8061/8065 bin files, or possibly disassemble them? I checked into the bin files today using Notepad++ hex editor plugin, and didn't get many strings except for 'Ford copyright 2002', but I do see some hex patterns floating aroundâ€¦  Thus, would I find a disassembling platform, or hack it with the 8061 manual?\nAlso, pardon my ignorance, but how do you regulars retrieve bin files? I know you can stick the ROM into the ROM reader, but intuitively I feel that people also get bin files from the OBD port upon KOEO and get the 'ROM dump' from the RAM in the ECU. Is that the 'frontdoor' way of getting live data?\nP.S.: Excuse me for my use of semantics.\n",

But the file signatures disappear after the first 'binwalk' of the file. If you could advise me that would be great, since I thought I had something going and had to just -dd the block of lzma compressed files more precisely in bytes so I can open them.\n",
