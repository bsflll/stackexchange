You can find more about it here.\nThe page includes the list of supported processors (correct for December 2019):  \n\n\nx86, x64, ARM32, ARM64, PowerPC, and PowerPC64\n\nThis product is implemented as a plugin for IDA, doesn't work without IDA itself, has its own license,and cost additional money.\nIf you processor is not supported by Hex-Rays Decompiler, you can either use Ghidra instead of IDA (it has common, but less polished decompiler for all processors it supports) or find/create decompiler plugin yourself.\n",
