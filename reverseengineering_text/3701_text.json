    "content": "Whenever I attach a process in OllyDbg v1.10 on my Windows 7 64-bit machine, I notice that the first saved EBP on the stack doesn't point to the very base of the stack. Instead it points 16 bytes before it.\nTo illustrate what I mean, see the following screenshot:\n\nThe EBP (highlighted in gray), which is right above the <pre><code>RETURN to ntdll.76FC9F45</code></pre>, is pointing to <pre><code>1B05FFEC</code></pre>. Note that this address ends with <pre><code>EC</code></pre>, not <pre><code>FC</code></pre>.\nQuestion 1: Why isn't the EBP pointing to <pre><code>1B05FFFC</code></pre>?\nQuestion 2: What do the first 16 bytes on the stack represent?\nQuestion 3: Is the number of bytes (16), which are between <pre><code>StackBase</code></pre> and the address to where the first <pre><code>EBP</code></pre> points to, fixed for Windows OSs?\n",

However, I've used the code snipped from my previous comment to get the stack base address. Then I read DWORD after DWORD using <code>memcpy</code>, from base to top, and those 16 bytes at the beginning are still there.</span>",
