    "content": "I want to do a reverse-engineering of an obfuscated Unity DLL assembly, but de4dot doesn't work. It says \"Unknown Obfuscator\".\nAlso tried iMPROVE and it says that there is a 97% chance that it is a DotWall obfuscated assembly, but deobfuscation doesn't work!\nHere is the DLL:\nhttp://uploadboy.me/87n60oy2ifiw/Assembly-CSharp.zip.html\nCan someone say how can I deobfuscate it? or at least which obfuscator has produced this DLL?\n",
