    "content": "I am studying the way that can be used to check if a given password for an encrypted zip file is correct or not. I see this link:\nHow does a zip file detect a correct password?\nIn the answer of this question, it said CRC is used to check if a password is correct. It also paste a code snippet from Info-zip to prove this.\nHowever, after carefully studying the Info-zip source code, as below:\n<pre><code>    if ((ush)(c | (b<<8)) != (GLOBAL(pInfo->ExtLocHdr) ?\n                           ((ush)GLOBAL(lrec.last_mod_dos_datetime) & 0xffff) :\n                           (ush)(GLOBAL(lrec.crc32) >> 16)))\n</code></pre>\nI find when there is ExtLocHdr in the zip item, the lower 2 bytes of last_mod_dos_datetime, instead of the CRC, will be used to verify the password. But this is not mentioned in the file format specification in https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT at all.\nWhy?\n",
