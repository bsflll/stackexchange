    "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/22506/x64dbgpy-application-unresponsive-when-trying-to-automate-inside-breakpoint-cal",
    "content": "When a breakpoint callback is triggered trying to automate the debugger inside the callback causes the application to become unresponsive. <pre><code>x64dbg</code></pre> continues functioning but the application itself doesn't resume execution.\nThis is only happening when the functions are called inside the BP callback.\nScript:\n<pre><code>from x64dbgpy import *\n\ndef handle():\n    pluginsdk.Run()\n\n\nBreakpoint.add(0x81755, handle)\n</code></pre>\nCalling any function such as <pre><code>pluginsdk.StepOver</code></pre>, etc also causes the freeze.\nDoes x64dbgpy not support automating the debugger inside breakpoint callbacks? Or am I doing something wrong? Suggestions would be great.\n",

            "content": "Currently it is not supported to do debug automation in callbacks. This is related to the threading model and is further explained at https://x64dbg.com/blog/2016/10/20/threading-model.html, which links to some older resources.\nRecently there was an interesting development though, because it became possible to automate in the debug callbacks with x64dbgâ€™s built in scripting language (which I do not recommend). The idea now is to port this idea to a C api, which can then be used by plugins like x64dbgpy or x64dbgPlaytime.\n",
