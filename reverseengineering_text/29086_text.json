    "content": "I put INT3 breakpoint and starting the program. The OllyDbg break at the breakpoint, but when I step over, the OllyDbg put a hardware breakpoint. (Yesterday not happened in OllyDbg, but today during training it happened.)\nŸçEdit : A red square usually occurs when step over, but goes to the next line immediately. But in this call, when i click F8 to step over, the program has stopped and no longer works.\n",
