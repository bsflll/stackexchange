    "content": "I'm learning lena151's materials and in 4 lesson she uses Olly's Back-to-user feature to find where the MassegeBox is creating.\n\nIt works fine under x32 windows server 2003.\nBut what about nowadays?!\nIs there similar option in IDA+WINDBG for x64 apps?\nCoz I've tried setting BP to the .text section but I faced the message of IDA 'BP set is failed coz of break point overlapping' (so you should delete all previous if some was set)\n",
