    "content": "Radare2 doesn't update current address, when single-step debugging using <pre><code>ds</code></pre>?\n\nI'm debugging an ELF binary on Linux using single-step (<pre><code>ds</code></pre>). The problem is that the current address at the prompt doesn't update after each step.\nThe prompt:\n\nHow do I make Radare2 update the prompt to reflect the current value of EIP?\nFurthermore, is it possible to make Radare2 automatically disassemble the next instruction after each <pre><code>ds</code></pre>, like it is possible with GDB?\n",

See question and issue for more details.\n\nFurthermore, is it possible to make Radare2 automatically disassemble the next instruction after each ds, like it is possible with GDB?\n\nNot automatic solution, but you can do <pre><code>pd1</code></pre> each time you want to see the next instruction to perform.\nHowever, if you want it badly to be automatic, you can modify the source code to perform <pre><code>pd1</code></pre> automatically for you. To do so, you want to modify <pre><code>libr/core/cmd_debug.c</code></pre>. Just find the place where <pre><code>ds</code></pre> is handled and put relevant code there like so:\n\nThen run <pre><code>make</code></pre> and enjoy the new functionality.\n",
