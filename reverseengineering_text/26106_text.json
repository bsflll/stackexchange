    "content": "I like to attach a dll to a game to add more features.\nThe DLL is 95% done, the problem is find the best and easy way to load this dll from the Game.\nMy idea is use this technique:\n<pre><code>dinput_ori.dll  (old dll).\ndinput.dll      (my dll that point to dinput_ori.dll)\n</code></pre>\nI don't need to access to any member of original DLL, but only load my dll.\nI searching for a generic dll source code that do this:\n<pre><code>bool WINAPI DllMain(HMODULE hModule, DWORD dwReason, LPVOID lpReserved)\n{\n\n    std::string DLLFileOri = \"dinput_ori.dll\";\n\n    switch (dwReason)\n    {\n    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:\n        // Load dll\n\n        LoadOriDll(DLLFileOri);\n\n        MsgBox(\"This DLL was loaded.\");\n\n        break;\n\n    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:\n\n        // Close the DLL\n        \n        UnloadOriDll(DLLFileOri);\n\n        break;\n    }\n\n    return true;\n}\n</code></pre>\nin this case the name of my DLL is \"dinput.dll\".\nThere is a generic source code that do this ?\nThanks !\n",
