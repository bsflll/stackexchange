    "content": "ive started studying reverse engineering, and in a binary i am trying to reverse i stumbled upon an unusual(to me) line of assembly in IDA PRO. and it looks like this\n<pre><code>.text:00000000008A1C21                 mov     r8d, ds:(off_8A40FC - 400000h)[rcx+rax*4]\n</code></pre>\nso i know that it moves something into the r8 register which is the size of a dword, but i do not understand what it moves into it ? something from the data segment, but im clueless as of how to interpret it, any help would be great.\n",

I recommend studying the assembly more, this is a bad question as its not giving full detail on what <pre><code>rcx</code></pre>, and <pre><code>rax</code></pre> is.\nHappy hacking! :-)\n",
