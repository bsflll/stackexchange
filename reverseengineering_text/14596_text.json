            "content": "It seems very likely that this chip is indeed MIPS, so any MIPS disassembler should work. Remember to try both little-endian and big-endian variants. For finding the entrypoint, see here: Reverse Engineering MIPS Bootloader\nNote that it may be possible that the firmware is packed or encrypted (check binwalk's entropy analysis); in that case reading it directly from the flash chip may be necessary.\nEDIT: So, apparently the code is not MIPS after all. Going by the objdump output, the instruction set seems to be a derivative of the Motorola/Freescale MCORE (previously Motorola RCE), even if they call it \"csky\". You should be able to disassemble raw binary by specifying binary file format and architecture to objdump, e.g.:\n<pre><code>objdump -D -b binary -m csky file.bin\n</code></pre>\nIn case you don't get good results, try adding <pre><code>-EB</code></pre> or <pre><code>-EL</code></pre> to force big-endian or little-endian disassembly. Note that sometimes you may get nonsense disassembly in case there is data intermixed with code (<pre><code>-D</code></pre> forces disassembly of the whole file).\nEDIT2:  C-sky support has been added to official binutils source tree. The commit message says:\n\nV1 is derived from the MCore architecture while V2 is substantially\ndifferent, with mixed 16- and 32-bit instructions, a larger register\nset, a different (but overlapping) ABI, etc.\n\nEDIT3: C-SKY and Motorola MCore architecture support was added in Radare2 reverse engineering framework. You can use it with <pre><code>-a mcore</code></pre> radare2 switch, also it should recognize the architecture in the ELF file directly.\n",

The CK610M is a v1 ISA, which has the MMU, so it is able to run Linux, which contains support as of v4.19.\nThere are currently (since October 2018) a $6US C-Sky Development SBC's supporting the CK610M in the gx6605s SoC package produced by NationalChip. QEMU supports boot C-SKY v1 & v2 ISA.\nhttps://c-sky.github.io/docs/gx6605s.html\n",
