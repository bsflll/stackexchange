    "content": "If I have a program A, which uses <pre><code>execve</code></pre> to run program B. How can I set a breakpoint in program B's main routine if I'm debugging program A?\nAfter a certain point in the execve routine, program B will be loaded into memory. After that I can see the symbols in the binary and the regions of memory they have been loaded into. However, to get to that point at the moment I just step through some of the execve instructions which is very fiddly and prone to mistakes.\nIs there a simpler approach to this?\n",
