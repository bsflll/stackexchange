    "content": "I am trying to decompile a Android ARM native binary using Hex-Rays IDA Pro. IDA detects the possible formats as \n\nELF for ARM (Shared object)\nBinary file\n\nIf I choose ELF for ARM (Shared object), then it correctly decompiles and detect most of the standard functions like tan/sin/cos etc. But when I try to run the remote android debugger, I am getting the alert messages\n\nInput file is a dynamic library, it cannot be run by itself. Please specify the host application.\nThe file can't be loaded by the debugger plugin. Please verify that the parameters are valid.\n\nIf I select Binary file, then it is not decompiling correctly. Also remote android debugger option is not listed in debuggers list.\nI am able to execute the binary file directly on an Android ARM emulator.\nWhat am I doing wrong? How can I debug a ELF for ARM binary executable file with IDA pro?\n\nEdit: I have already tried with <pre><code>android_server</code></pre> running on an AVD and a physical device. When I try to connect [ELF for ARM (Shared object)], I can see the following output in <pre><code>android_server</code></pre>\n<pre><code>=========================================================\n[7] Accepting connection from 127.0.0.1...\n[7] Closing connection from 127.0.0.1...\n</code></pre>\nAre all ARM binary executables detected as shared object? Or is my executable file being misidentified as a <pre><code>.so</code></pre> file?\n",

Are you positive that this application can be run independently from the command line (adb)?\nIf it is a shared library, you will need to attach to a process that can load and call the functionality that you want to step through in IDA. You can do this using an \"shim\" application that I created and posted online;\nhttps://github.com/rednaga/native-shim\nIt include directions on how you would compile it, push it to the device and point IDA Pro at it. This allows you to pass the shared library as an argument and allow it to be \"run\" via IDA Pro. Hopefully this solves your issue.\n",
