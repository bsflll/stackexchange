    "content": "I have been trying to figure out exactly what is happening with these instructions and can't make sense of them. I can see that the PSHUFLW instruction acts upon the first 16 bytes of the XMM register but can not figure it out. I have read the decription in the IntelÂ® Architecture Instruction Set Extensions Programming Reference  but just can't seem to get it. I am a very visual person so any help would be greatly appreciated. I have run some tests using the code \n<pre><code>xxm0 = 00000000000000000000000000003E2D\nPSHUFLW xmm0, xmm0, N\n</code></pre>\nand have the following results \n<pre><code> N = 0, output = 00000000000000003E2D3E2D3E2D3E2D\n N = 1, output = 00000000000000003E2D3E2D3E2D0000\n N = 2, output = 00000000000000003E2D3E2D3E2D0000\n N = 3, output = 00000000000000003E2D3E2D3E2D0000\n N = 4, output = 00000000000000003E2D3E2D00003E2D\n N = 5, output = 00000000000000003E2D3E2D00000000\n N = 6, output = 00000000000000003E2D3E2D00000000\n N = 7, output = 00000000000000003E2D3E2D00000000\n N = 8, output = 00000000000000003E2D3E2D00003E2D\n N = 9, output = 00000000000000003E2D3E2D00000000\n N = 10, output = 00000000000000003E2D00003E2D3E2D\n N = 11, output = 00000000000000003E2D00003E2D0000\n N = 12, output = 00000000000000003E2D00003E2D0000\n N = 13, output = 00000000000000003E2D00003E2D0000\n N = 14, output = 00000000000000003E2D000000003E2D\n N = 15, output = 00000000000000003E2D000000000000\n N = 16, output = 00000000000000003E2D000000000000\n N = 17, output = 00000000000000003E2D000000000000\n N = 18, output = 00000000000000003E2D000000003E2D\n N = 19, output = 00000000000000003E2D000000000000\n N = 20, output = 00000000000000003E2D00003E2D3E2D\n</code></pre>\nI would like to know how these instructions work, and maybe a visual guide on future instructions similar to this. I have only been reversing for a couple of weeks so I am very fresh. Thanks for any help you can provide.\n",

            "content": "The visual story of PSHUFLW is as follows:\n\n\nI will use <pre><code>Position</code></pre> as same mean as <pre><code>Order</code></pre> here and starts from Zero (Zero-Indexed).\n\nAs you can see it selects words from source based on value of N. The Order/Position of selection will be chosen by 2 bit values of N. for example when N=4, \n\nAccording to first bite (2-bits) of N (= 00), it will select <pre><code>word</code></pre> at position/order 0 of source and copies it in Position 0 of destination.\nAccording to second bite (2-bits) of N (= 01), it will select <pre><code>word</code></pre> at position/order 1 of source and copies it in 1st Position of destination.\nAccording to third bite (2-bits) of N (= 00), it will select <pre><code>word</code></pre> at position/order 0 of source and copies it in 2nd Position of destination.\nAccording to fourth bite (2-bits) of N (= 00), it will select <pre><code>word</code></pre> at position/order 0 of source and copies it in 3rd Position of destination.\n\nNext example when N=17,\n\nAccording to first bite (2-bits) of N (= 01), it will select <pre><code>word</code></pre> at position/order 1 of source and copies it in Position 0 of destination.\nAccording to second bite (2-bits) of N (= 00), it will select <pre><code>word</code></pre> at position/order 0 of source and copies it in 1st Position of destination.\nAccording to third bite (2-bits) of N (= 01), it will select <pre><code>word</code></pre> at position/order 1 of source and copies it in 2nd Position of destination.\nAccording to fourth bite (2-bits) of N (= 00), it will select <pre><code>word</code></pre> at position/order 0 of source and copies it in 3rd Position of destination.\n\nPS: your output for N=17 in above question is wrong! PSHUFD is just same except it will select doublewords from source and copies in destination. so low and high quadword in PSHUFD will be used while in PSHUFLW the low quadword used.\n",
