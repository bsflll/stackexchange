    "content": "I'm taking a reverse engineering course and the class has just been given a big project where we have to analyze a packed malware binary. I am using a Windows 10 VM. I am a little confused on where to begin. The professor has mentioned that the best place to start is by taking a snapshot of your initial system setup, running the malware, and then \"figuring out what has changed\".\nMy strategy is as follows:\n\nTake a memory backup of my initial VM state. \nSet up my VM so that a network connection is available, but doesn't actually connect to the internet.\nRun the malware (in a debugger? outside of a debugger?).\n???\n\nThis is where I get a little iffy. I am not sure what \"checking for changes on the system\" entails. Does this mean I need to take a memory dump of the OS state after the malware has run? What should I be looking for within the memory dump? Is there some tool that identifies meaningful changes between my starting state and the state after the malware runs? Do I need to audit the registry keys to see what has been changed? If I know the malware uses the network, should I be running Wireshark? \nUltimately, I am not sure what the most efficient approach is. It is a pretty powerful piece of malware with a lot of functionality and I want to make sure I collect all necessary information upfront so I don't waste time later in the project.\nThank you\n",

The web is awash with “how to get started with malware analysis”-type material. I’m sure your professor has provided you with a lot of material as well.\n",

            "content": "I find it really disturbing that in an official university class there are no proper safety guidelines and procedures for students before dealing with actual malware. This is super risky and should be dealt with accordingly. However, here are a few steps to make your task safer and easier:\nBuilding a malware lab:\nYou can follow the full procedure here by Lenny Zelster. In short, it has the following steps:\n\nInstall Virtualization Software - I recommend Virtualbox for beginners.\nGet a Windows Virtual Machine - You can download a free trial from Microsoft.\nUpdate the VM and Install Malware Analysis Tools - Static Analysis: Ghidra, IDA, Cutter, PE Studio, Dynamic Analysis: X64dbg, OllyDbg, WinDbg, Immunity Debugger. You can also find many other tools and guides here.\nSpecific tools for your mission \"figuring out what has changed\": Sysinternals\n\nUnderstanding our task:\nOnce your lab is set, let's examine our tasks, from your words:\n\n\"checking for changes on the system\" & \"figuring out what has changed\"\n\nSince we are dealing with a Windows based system, we need to ask ourselves what possible system changes can be done by malware and for what purpose. For example, malware is usually looking to achieve some kind of persistency. This is usually done by the following methods:\n\nRegistry run keys\nStartup folder\nScheduled tasks\nService registrations\n\nA much more comprehensive list is available by MITRE ATT&CK here.\nIn addition, malware usually has some sort of intention, for example stealing cookies, hooking to a web browsers or maybe just wait for a secondary payload or update. If we ignore \"Fileless\" or \"Memory Injections\" attacks for the simplicity of this short guide, malware has to leave some file traces on the system. We need to look for files (executable or not) written to the file system. \nGetting our hands dirty:\nIn order to monitor the system changes mentioned above, we can use Sysinternal tools initially developed by Mark Russinovich and now owned by Microsoft. \nTip: it's recommended to read Mark's Windows Internals book for anyone starting with malware analysis.\nBeing more specific, the tools of the Sysinternals suite you should learn how to use are:\n\nAutoruns - execute and note your initial system values.\nProcess Monitor - After you read the manual, create a filter to only follow the malware you are executing. Note any file and registry changes, this will be a really good starting point.\nAutoruns - execute and note any changes to your system and what new autoruns have been registered.\n\nThe guide above should get you to a good starting point for your project.\nIf you want to cheat\nYou can skip all this stages and use one of the publicly available malware detonation sandboxes. However,  in order to become a reverse engineer or malware analyst you should only use these tools once you have learned the basics and understand what you are actually doing. \n\nHybrid-Analysis \nSndbox\nAnyrun\n",

RegShot is straightforward.  You take a snapshot before running a process, a second one after, and then to compare them.  If you select \"Scan dir\" and enter \"C:\\\" in the box, it will also tell you file changes.  These are snapshots at the time the buttons are pressed, so may miss files that are dropped and deleted.  Use Process Monitor or Sysmon for that info and more.</span>",
