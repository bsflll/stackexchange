It will create a .reloc section from different based images.\nWhat does it need?\n\nAt least 2 different based images of a module. The more you have images, the more your relocations will be reliable.\n\nLimitations\n\nIt will only support 32 bits relocations of type (3). (IMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGHLOW : The fixup applies the delta to the 32-bit\n  field at Offset)\n\n\nAt the time of writing, a copy seems to be available here.\n",
