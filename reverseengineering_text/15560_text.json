    "content": "I am a noob in this field. I have reverse engineered an Android game to hack it but I can only install the game if it was not digitally signed.\nIf the game is digitally signed, I am unable to install it on my android device (No root device). I know that signature verification can be bypassed in root devices. But I need to know that could it de done in No Root devices?\nPlease point me in right direction\n",
