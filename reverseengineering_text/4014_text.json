    "content": "Is anyone aware of any documentation (official or reverse-engineered) on the Windows Media Player library / database <pre><code>.wmdb</code></pre> format?  (Specifically WMP 12).\nThe file resides at <pre><code>C:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Media Player\\CurrentDatabase_[nnn].wmdb</code></pre>. It's a binary file, seemingly uncompressed.\nI'm willing to work on this, but don't want to waste my time if it's already been done!\nResearch:\n\nNeither the Mulimedia.cx wiki page, nor the hachoir utility seem to have any information about it.\nThis blog post links to a product called Simple Carver, a paid forensics utility, that claims to support the format.\nThis forum post indicates that WMP 11 came with a <pre><code>wmdbexport.exe</code></pre> utility, but this doesn't exist in WMP 12.\n\nSpecifically, there are a few tools/scripts I've wanted to write that would need to directly manipulate this database.\n",

I am doing a forensic research on Windows Media Player for my Master's Thesis and I am having the same issue, I cannot understand the structure of the \"CurrentDatabase_xxx.wmdb\" file. If you have figured out about the structure and documented it. Can you please share it with me? It would be a great to me. Thanks in advance.\n",
