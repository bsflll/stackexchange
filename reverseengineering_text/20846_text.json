    "content": "I have a chip I am trying to use JTAG communications with using openOCD. However, I get the following error:\n<pre><code>openocd -f ocd.cfg \nOpen On-Chip Debugger 0.10.0\nLicensed under GNU GPL v2\nFor bug reports, read\n    http://openocd.org/doc/doxygen/bugs.html\nWarn : Adapter driver 'buspirate' did not declare which transports it allows; assuming legacy JTAG-only\nInfo : only one transport option; autoselect 'jtag'\nsrst_only separate srst_gates_jtag srst_open_drain connect_deassert_srst\nInfo : Buspirate Interface ready!\nInfo : This adapter doesn't support configurable speed\nWarn : There are no enabled taps.  AUTO PROBING MIGHT NOT WORK!!\nInfo : TAP auto0.tap does not have IDCODE\nWarn : AUTO auto0.tap - use \"jtag newtap auto0 tap -irlen 2 -expected-id 0x00000000\"\nError: auto0.tap: IR capture error; saw 0x0002 not 0x0001\nWarn : Bypassing JTAG setup events due to errors\nWarn : gdb services need one or more targets defined\n</code></pre>\nI suspect this is due to a poor connection somewhere, but I don't know which lead to suspect. How should I go about debugging this issue? \nTo be clear I am asking this from the perspective of OpenOCD software, not my hardware: \nWhy does it expect 0x0001? Can I configure it to expect 0x0002? \nWhy is it giving up after these two errors? \nFor the record I am using this config:\n<pre><code>source [find interface/buspirate.cfg]\n\n\nbuspirate_vreg 0\nbuspirate_mode open-drain\nbuspirate_pullup 1\n\nbuspirate_port /dev/tty.usbserial-A90809RC\n\n</code></pre>\nAs my chip is not includes in the /boards directory, I could include a board from there using the source directive.\n",
