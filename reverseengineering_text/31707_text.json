            "content": "To parse templates you need to use the IDAClang plugin that comes with Ida Pro (I think it's not available with IDA Free).\nTo add a single class/structure definition you can use IDAPython:\n<pre><code>import ida_srclang\n\ncode = \"\"\"\ntemplate <typename T, typename U>\nstruct S;\n\ntemplate<>\nstruct S<int, void *>\n{\n  int x;\n  void *y;\n};\n\"\"\"\n\nida_srclang.set_parser_argv(\"clang\", \"-x c++\")\nida_srclang.parse_decls_with_parser(\"clang\", None, code, False)\n</code></pre>\nIf you want to parse whole header files, you need to:\n\nSet clang as your parser in <pre><code>Options > Compiler > Source parser</code></pre>\nEnsure you set the correct include directories\nEnsure you added the <pre><code>-x c++</code></pre> argument\n\nYou should then be able to parse whole files with <pre><code>Load file > Parse C header file</code></pre>\nSadly you cannot later edit such structures because the Edit dialog in <pre><code>Local Types</code></pre> will not be able to parse them correctly. If you want to modify such a structure, you will need to re-parse it with clang using one of the two ways above.\nSee the IDAClang tutorial on Hex-Rays website for more information.\n",
