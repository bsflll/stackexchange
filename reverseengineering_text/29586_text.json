    "content": "Trying to save a big graph(the default graph view of assembly instructions in IDA after you press space in text view while viewing instructions of a function) as an image.\nGoogled this article: Converting IDA Pro graphs to images, it tells to use graph-easy for Linux, and saw this question: Saving IDA graphs as image. The only answer suggests to use graph-easy for Linux. I'm on Windows. How to convert the graph to an image on Windows 10?\nI googled how to convert gdl to image, too, and there's some ArchiCAD software for $3000 or something, and it looks like it's some big program for modeling or whatever. Then there's this online tool which doesn't work: https://fileproinfo.com/tools/viewer/gdl . Says the preview doesn't work. There's also: Stanford Microarray Database GDL Data . Their site is dead.\nPlease help.\n",
