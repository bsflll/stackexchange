    "content": "I'm trying to RE a program which has a limit of n iterations.\nI already found the interesting part in the disasembled code with static analysis and analysis with the local win32 debugger.\nThere seems to be a correlation between being BELOW / ABOVE the limit\nand a number.\nWhile I'm below the limit the value is set to 1.0. \nIf I go above the limit of the value keeps being 0.0\nA mouseover tells me the \"magic\" value.\n\nNow I have two problems:\n\nI would like to find out WHAT writes to that address. My idea was to set a write-trace on it - but see no. 2\nI cannot find the value in memory.\nRight click -> \"jump in new window\" leads me to <pre><code>0x0072EB88</code></pre>\nThe stored value there is 0 altrough IDA is showing me a 1.0 (see first image)\n\n\nManual check\nESP = <pre><code>0x0072EB40</code></pre>\nvar_838 = <pre><code>-0x838</code></pre>\n\nputting it all together: \n<pre><code>0x0072EB40</code></pre> + <pre><code>0x880</code></pre> - <pre><code>0x838</code></pre> => <pre><code>0x0072EB88</code></pre>\nCan someone help me out please and tell me what my error is?\nThanks in advance.\n",
