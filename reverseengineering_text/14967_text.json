You can parse the permissions out of the sections table. Please know that the permissions may be changed at runtime and also may be manipulated for smaller units of memory (pages!).\nThat being said, there is always some 'default' permissions set by the compiler if the programmer doesn't care about them explicitly:\nFor example, the <pre><code>.text</code></pre> section is usually <pre><code>READ + EXECUTE</code></pre>, while data sections are usually <pre><code>READ + WRITE (+ PROTECTED)</code></pre>. There is no magic here.\nThere is plenty of software available to look at the startup section permissions (basically everything parsing pe files).\n",
