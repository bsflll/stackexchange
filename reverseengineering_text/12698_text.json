Then, it creates segments according to the analysis, and marks each segment as a \"THUMB\" or \"ARM\" segment.\nPress ctrl-G to see which segment has which type (Value 00=ARM, 01=THUMB).\nPress alt-G to change the designation of the current segment (the one the cursor is in right now).\nIf you aren't satisfied with what the analyzer created, use the Edit/Segments submenus to move, resize, create, or delete them.\n",
