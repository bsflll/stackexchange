    "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/24694/x86-elf-argc-location-on-stack",
    "content": "According to the System V ABI for x86, <pre><code>esp</code></pre> should be pointing at <pre><code>argc</code></pre> when entering <pre><code>main</code></pre>. However, I've seen many binaries where <pre><code>argc</code></pre> instead is retrieved from <pre><code>esp + 4</code></pre>, or <pre><code>esp + 8</code></pre>. Is this correct, or am I missing something? Also, why do these offset differ?\n",

If this happens, then the init procedure calls \"main\", pushing argc on the stack. After the call, [ESP] will point to the return address and [ESP+4] will contain argc. At the beginnig of main, a PUSH EBP will move ESP another 4 bytes back, now [ESP+8]=argc.\n",

            "content": "I think your confusion stems from the fact that quoted part of the spec is talking about the process entry point which is a different concept from the C <pre><code>main</code></pre> function. The <pre><code>main</code></pre> is called by the C library startup code so it will follow the standard calling sequence rather than \"Initial process stack layout\". For 386, it means that <pre><code>argc</code></pre> will be the first value passed on the stack after the return address, and <pre><code>argv</code></pre> will be the second. I.e. at the beginning of <pre><code>main</code></pre>, the layout will look like this\n<pre><code>|                |\n+----------------+\n| argv           | <-- esp+8\n+----------------+\n| argc           | <-- esp+4\n+----------------+\n| return address | <-- esp\n+----------------+\n</code></pre>\nIf the compiler decides to use the frame pointer, then <pre><code>argc</code></pre> will be typically accessed as <pre><code>[ebp+8]</code></pre> due to the extra 4 bytes taken by the saved <pre><code>ebp</code></pre>.\n",
