    "content": "The program I'm currently reversing is missing a section that contains a bunch of interesting strings. I see the memory addresses of where these should be, instead of the reference to the string. \nThe strings are in the binary file analyzed by IDA, but since there isn't any segment for them, IDA ignored them.\nI tried manually creating the segment, which works (it now references unknown variables instead of memory addreses), but I can't figure out how to load the proper data into that section. (The entire section is filed with <pre><code>db ? ;</code></pre>)\nI've tried using <pre><code>File > Load File > Load additional binary file</code></pre>(with file offset & size), as well as reloading the current file. I've also dumped the part of the file I'm interested in another file and tried to load that one as an additional binary as well.\nThe only results I can get from that is:\n\nIDA creates a new segment at the end of all other segments (Not following the <pre><code>Loading Segment</code></pre> address I filled in.\nIf I uncheck <pre><code>Create Segments</code></pre>, IDA does nothing. (Even though I specified the address of my manually created segment in <pre><code>Loading Segment</code></pre>\n\nThe segment I manually created has the following settings:\n\n.\nHere's the form I filled while loading the binary file that contains the data I want. \n\n.\nI've never done this before, so it's likely I'm doing something wrong, but I can't figure it out.\n",

The final address is calculated by\n<pre><code>(base << 4) + offset</code></pre>.\nIn fact, IDA is telling you to input \"in paragraph\", which is 0x10 each paragraph on IBM PC.\nBut as x86 is using \"flat memory model\" now, what you should use is something like this:\n\nYour original operation will create a segment which has an EA of 0x1431A20000 (note the last zero), and what you will see in the IDA view will be segXXX:XXXXX instead of the \"flat\" segments like .text\n",
