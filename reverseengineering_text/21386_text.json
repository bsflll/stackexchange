    "content": "Based on what explained here, genuine ink cartridges may come with cartridge protection embedded in their chip. Once an ink cartridge is installed, printer will mark it as protected. \nWhat is embedded in the chip? \nHow can we make sure that it is original and not duplicated with a 3rd party? \nIs this a safe and well-known offline security protocol? (it will be great if some one can point me to a reference about it)\n",

It’s hard to know what type of chips are being used by the printer and cartridges but I bet it’s something like the Microchip’s ATSHA204A or ATTECC508. Google those chips and they can give you some info on how host - client authentication can be done with hardware.\n",
