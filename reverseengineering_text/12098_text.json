    "content": "I followed the tutorial IDA Help: Debugging code snippets with QEMU.\nIt always worked with ARM code, but now I have to reverse some MIPS and only nops are displayed like this:\n\nShould I adjust something on the memory map? As you can see, the code is rebased in the range of <pre><code>0x8f0000000</code></pre>.\nOr is it something with the generated intermediate ELF file?\nI am using the Mipsel_Malta config, cmd line is\n<pre><code>\"D:\\attila\\qemu\\bin\\qemu-system-mipsel\" -S -gdb tcp::%p,ipv4 -cpu 4Km -kernel \"%e\"</code></pre>.\n",
