            "content": "If you want to execute another command after doing <pre><code>ds</code></pre> you can simply use <pre><code>;</code></pre> to add a new command. So for example, the command <pre><code>ds; pd 1 @ rip</code></pre> will step one instruction and disassemble the instruction at <pre><code>rip</code></pre>.\nYou can also define a macro (an alias) for a set of commands. Let's define for example the macro <pre><code>foo</code></pre> to do the following things:\n\nSingle step\nPrint hexdump of 16 bytes at <pre><code>rip</code></pre>\nDisassemble 1 instruction at <pre><code>rip</code></pre>\n\nTo do this you can simply run:\n<pre><code>[0x7f46fea5ee00]> (foo, ds, px 16 @ rip, pd 1 @ rip)\n</code></pre>\nAnd then use it with <pre><code>.(foo)</code></pre>:\n<pre><code>[0x7f46fea5ee00]> .(foo)\n- offset -       0 1  2 3  4 5  6 7  8 9  A B  C D  E F  0123456789ABCDEF\n0x7f46fea5ee1a  89c0 48c1 e220 4809 c248 8b05 0e70 0200  ..H.. H..H...p..\n            ;-- rip:\n            0x7f46fea5ee1a      89c0           mov eax, eax\n\n[0x7f46fea5ee00]> .(foo)\n- offset -       0 1  2 3  4 5  6 7  8 9  A B  C D  E F  0123456789ABCDEF\n0x7f46fea5ee1c  48c1 e220 4809 c248 8b05 0e70 0200 4889  H.. H..H...p..H.\n            ;-- rip:\n            0x7f46fea5ee1c      48c1e220       shl rdx, 0x20\n\n[0x7f46fea5ee00]> .(foo)\n- offset -       0 1  2 3  4 5  6 7  8 9  A B  C D  E F  0123456789ABCDEF\n0x7f46fea5ee20  4809 c248 8b05 0e70 0200 4889 156f 6802  H..H...p..H..oh.\n            ;-- rip:\n            0x7f46fea5ee20      4809c2         or rdx, rax\n</code></pre>\n\nVisual Modes \nNow, after all this was said, I want to add that in my opinion, interactive debugging using <pre><code>ds</code></pre>, <pre><code>dso</code></pre>, <pre><code>dc</code></pre> and similar are the wrong approach. For a debugging session, it is preferred to use the Visual Modes of radare2. Visual Panels mode is ideal for debugging session but you can also enjoy from a good experience while using the regular Visual and Visual Graph modes.\nThe following GIF shows the Visual Panels mode (<pre><code>V!</code></pre>) as well as the regular Visual mode. You can also see that by pressing <pre><code>:</code></pre> I can execute radare2 commands (in the gif I executed <pre><code>px</code></pre>). Visual Panels mode is very configurable and you can tweak it as you see fit. Simply use the <pre><code>?</code></pre> key to see the help and the available commands.\n\n\nRead more:\n\nVisual Modes | r2 book\nVisual Panels Mode | r2book\nMacros | r2book\n",

And for the seek, I don't know if it should be changed at all. If you think so, you can open an issue on GitHub or just ask in the radare2 telegram/irc group. Alos, you can add <code>s rip</code> to your macro in order to make r2 seek to the IP.</span>",
