    "content": "I took a basic 40-hr Reverse Engineering course a few summers ago. While teaching us to use IDAPro, the instructor demonstrated, rather quickly and without explaining much, how to label certain variables in the ASM as members of a structure, basically equivalent to a good old fashioned <pre><code>struct</code></pre> in C/C++, and treat them as such wherever they are seen in the rest of the code. This seems rather useful to me.\nWhat he did not cover, however, was how to identify a structure. How do you know when a group of variables does in fact constitute a structure and not just a set of related variables? How can you be sure that the author used a <pre><code>struct</code></pre> (or something similar) there?\n",

            "content": "There are very common patterns that you will find in code that denote structure usage.\nDereferencing offsets:\nIf you have a pointer which is dereferenced at some non-zero offset, you are probably dealing with a structure. Look for patterns like:\n<pre><code>mov eax, [ebp-8]  ; Load a local variable into eax\nmov ecx, [eax+8]  ; **Dereference a dword at eax+8**\n</code></pre>\nIn this example, we have a variable that contains a pointer, but we care about the contents of memory at some specific offset ahead of the pointer.  This is exactly how structures are used:  We get a pointer to the structure, and then dereference the pointer plus some offset to access a specific member. In C, the syntax for this is: <pre><code>pMyStruct->member_at_offset_8</code></pre>.\nSide note:  Do not confuse dereferencing at the offset of some variable with dereferencing at offsets of the stack pointer or the frame pointer (<pre><code>esp</code></pre> or <pre><code>ebp</code></pre>).  Of course, you could think of the local variables and function arguments as being one large structure, but in C, they are not explicitly defined as such.\nMore subtle pointer offsets:\nYou don't actually need to dereference anything to detect a structure member.  For example:\n<pre><code>mov eax, [ebp-8]     ; Load a local variable into eax\npush 30h             ; num = 30h\npush aSampleString   ; src = \"Sample String\"\nadd eax, 0Ch\npush eax             ; dst = eax + 0xC\ncall strncpy\n</code></pre>\nIn this example, we are copying up to 0x30 characters from some source string to <pre><code>eax + 0xC</code></pre> (see strncpy).  This tells us that <pre><code>eax</code></pre> probably points to a structure with a string buffer (of at least 0x30 bytes) at offset 0xC.  For example, the structure may look something like:\n<pre><code>struct _MYSTRUCT\n{\n    DWORD a;      // +0x0\n    DWORD b;      // +0x4\n    DWORD c;      // +0x8\n    CHAR d[0x30]; // +0xC\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\nIn which case, the sample code would look like:\n<pre><code>strncpy(&pMyStruct->d, \"Sample String\", sizeof(pMyStruct->d));\n</code></pre>\nSide note: It is possible (though unlikely) that we could be copying to a large string buffer at offset +0xC, but you would be able to determine this through context.  If, say, offset +0x8 were an integer, for example, then it's definitely a struct.  But if we copied a string of fixed length 0xC to address <pre><code>eax</code></pre> then copied another string to address <pre><code>eax+0xC</code></pre>, it's probably one giant string.\nAll reads / all writes:\nLet's say you have a struct (not a pointer to a struct) as a local variable your stack.  Most of the time, IDA doesn't know the difference between a struct on the stack or a bunch of individual local variables.  But a huge tip-off that you're dealing with a structure is if you only ever read from a variable without writing to it, or (less so) if you only write to a variable without reading from it.  Here's an example of each:\n<pre><code>lea eax, [ebp+var_58]  ; Load THE ADDRESS of a local variable into eax\npush eax\ncall some_function\nmov eax, [ebp+var_54]  ; Let's say we've never touched var_54 before...\ntest eax, eax          ; ...But we're checking its value!\njz somewhere\n...\n</code></pre>\nIn this example, we're reading from <pre><code>var_54</code></pre> without ever writing anything to it (within this function).  This probably means that it is a member of a structure which was accessed from some other function call.  In this example, it's implied that <pre><code>var_58</code></pre> might be the start of that structure, since its address is pushed as the argument to <pre><code>some_function</code></pre>.  You can verify this by following the logic of <pre><code>some_function</code></pre> and checking if its argument is ever dereferenced (and modified) at offset +0x4.  Of course, this doesn't necessarily have to happen in <pre><code>some_function</code></pre> -- it could happen in one of its child functions, or one of its child functions, etc.\nA similar example exists for writing:\n<pre><code>xor eax, eax\nmov [ebp+var_28], eax  ; Let's say this is the *only* time var_28 is touched\nlea eax, [ebp+var_30]\npush eax\ncall some_other_function\n...\n</code></pre>\nWhen you see local variables being set and then never referenced again, you can't just forget about them, because they could very likely be members of a structure which is passed on to another function.  This example implies that a structure (which starts at <pre><code>var_30</code></pre>) is written to at offset +0x8 before the address of that structure is passed to <pre><code>some_other_function</code></pre>.\nBoth of these examples in C might look like:\n<pre><code>some_function(&myStruct);\nif (myStruct.member_at_offset_4) ...\n</code></pre>\nand\n<pre><code>myStruct.member_at_offset_8 = 0;\nsome_other_function(&myStruct);\n</code></pre>\nSide note: Although each of these examples used local variables, the same logic applies to globals.\nDocumented functions that expect structures:\nThis one's probably obvious, and IDA will handle this for you almost all of the time, but an easy way to know when you have a structure in your code is if you call a documented function that expects a certain structure.  For example, <pre><code>CreateProcessW</code></pre> expects a pointer to a <pre><code>STARTUPINFOW</code></pre> structure.  This one shouldn't require an example.\nHow do I know if these patterns actually indicate structure usage?\nOne final point I want to make is that in all of these cases, yes, technically, the author of the program could written their code without the use of structures.  They also could have written their code by defining every function as <pre><code>__declspec(naked)</code></pre> with a large <pre><code>__asm</code></pre> inline.  You'd never be able to tell.  But arguably, it doesn't matter.  If there are logical groups of values that are stored contiguously in memory and passed from function to function, it is still meaningful to annotate them as structures.  Almost all of the time, this is how the author wrote their code anyway.\nIf you need me to elaborate on anything, let me know.\n",

            "content": "Finding structs is tricky, but can help in understanding the code a lot. As Andrew said, structs are just an C abstraction and in assembly, it is just a blob of memory and there is no fool proof way of identifying structs. However, for simpler programs, some heuristics can be helpful. For example, \"small\" sized arrays are more likely to be structs than giant arrays. Seeing, for example, ints read from a loop would make it appear to be an array, while reading a couple of ints at some constant offset would make it look more like a struct. Another way is seeing the same group of dereferences happening in different areas of the code. If two different functions take some pointer as paramater and both try to deference offset 0x10 followed by 0x18 followed by 0x14 or something, it could be code setting fields of a struct. Also, any access of different sized data dereferenced from a single inputted pointer is a good indicator.\n",

It also helps when you see it being allocated dynamically (malloc or new) then being filled in with data of various types. \nIn IDA, I always advise my students to go ahead and create the IDA structs for things they suspect to be structures, and fill them in with elements as they see them being referenced, even if they later turn out to be wrong/misled. It's very much an iterative process, filling it in with more detail as you gain more understanding about the program and how it uses that data as you go, so it's important to mark up things you figure out as you figure them out.\n",

            "content": "There's several methods you can use (most of which have been hinted at by previous answers), but for completeness' sake I'll list some here.\n\nLook for calls to libraries that expect structures.  Unless the executable is doing something it really shouldn't and casting pointers and then feeding them to the library function and hoping it doesn't crash (unlikely), then here you can get a good feel for what sections of memory are structures.  \nLook at how parts of memory are passed/returned from functions.  Some compilers/calling conventions/platforms pass and return small structures (which can fit in a couple of registers) differently than other types of data.  For example, if you see data being returned in both <pre><code>eax</code></pre> and <pre><code>edx</code></pre> then you're probably dealing with a small struct.\nLook at how the memory is addressed.  If it appears that sections of memory are getting modified past one register size through a pointer, it's most likely (again, unless they're doing something unusual) an array or struct.  Also, like Yifan said, if there's a lot of accesses via constant offset you're probably looking at a struct, or a small array that is used in a manner similar to a struct (such as <pre><code>unsigned char rgb[3]</code></pre>).  And if you're looking at different size chunks of data, then it's almost definitely a struct.\n\nHowever, with any what-if scenario, as long as the use of data is consistent with your model, it doesn't matter if in the original code it is just an array of bytes with some conventions about what goes where or a full-blown struct.  Use whatever model helps you reason about the code.\nTo address the union issue about structs having different memory layout in different code branches, I'll address the two most common usages of unions (in my experience):\n\nType punning:  In this case, you probably won't even see it in the compiled code.  Though it's technically undefined behavior AFAIK, most compilers will treat it like a <pre><code>reinterpret_cast<>()</code></pre>\nAlgebraic Types:  Usually, this is accompanied by a tag which makes it easy to identify.  If you see code in several places that checks some integer and then treats the memory different based on that value, then you can guess this is what is going on.  If certain functions don't check the tag, then that also tells you something about the function - assuming the author isn't lazy and want their code to break, they probably consider it an invariant that that function will only be called in branches that already know that it is of a certain type.\n",
