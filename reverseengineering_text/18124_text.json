    "content": "I am working on a project that requires to modify an existing OSX application's <pre><code>dylib</code></pre> binary (few bytes to correct an obsolete URL). I do not have access to the application source code nor the code signing certificates. After patching the application everything works perfectly except it does not load its application <pre><code>plist</code></pre> file from <pre><code>~/Library/Preferences</code></pre>. \nEven without patching/modifying the application if I do:\n<pre><code>codesign -s \"Local Codesign\" -f ./lib<name>.dylib\n</code></pre>\nand execute the application it does not read its properties from\n<pre><code>~/Library/Preferences/<application id>.plist\n</code></pre>\nincluding previously opened files or connected servers. If I copy back the original (developer signed) <pre><code>dylib</code></pre> then everything works fine: properties are read back again.\nOne strange thing: even with my local signed binary which is unable to read the <pre><code>plist</code></pre> file if I change something the changes are written back. So if this is an OSX security related stuff seems it's only affects reads.\nNow my questions and assumptions:\n\nAm I right when I am assuming that this is some kind of OSX security mechanism that ensures application <pre><code>plist</code></pre> data cannot be accessed from a non-same-developer signed binary? If yes, why can it write and protects reads only?\nDoes any of you find similar issue when modified an OSX binary?\nHow can I debug this behaviour?  \nAnd yes: any solutions?\n\nAny comments and feedbacks are welcome.\n",

The linked answer suggests some workarounds.\n",
