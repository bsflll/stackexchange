    "content": "When in visual mode (command <pre><code>v</code></pre>) in radare, in the disassembly panel, I can press ; to add a comment at the location I am current seeked to (which is the top instruction in the disassembly view). I usually step through the software and would like to add comments at the current instruction pointer (<pre><code>rip</code></pre>) location.\nIs there a key for that? Can I define one or redefine the ; key?\n",
