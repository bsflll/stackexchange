    "content": "According to this post it is possible to run functions inside a shared library so long as they do not have a dependency on the JVM\n\nIt works by patching the .dynamic ELF section to remove unnecessary dependencies by replacing DT_NEEDED tags with DT_DEBUG tags. We also needed to remove constructors and deconstructors by changing the DT_FINI_ARRAYSZ and DT_INIT_ARRAYSZ to zero.\n\nSo how could this be implemented?\nThanks\n",
