    "content": "I'm reversing a firmware, that comes in one big binary chunk(<pre><code>.bin</code></pre> file). \nAfter some reversing, I could identify that the big bin has two segments - text and data. Now I want to split the original segment into those two segments. \nFor example:\nOriginal file segments:\n<pre><code>Name   start   end\nROM    0x0     0x21bd\n</code></pre>\nOne big segment containing all the code and data. \nDesired result segments:\n<pre><code> Name  start   end\n.text  0x0     0x11bd \n.data  0xc000  0xd000\n</code></pre>\nI want to split the one big segment into two nonadjusted segments, like this. \nthe <pre><code>.data</code></pre> section should hold the bytes from the original <pre><code>ROM</code></pre> section. In other words, 0x11bd - 0x21bd from the original <pre><code>ROM</code></pre> section should be copied to \n0xc000 - 0xd000 of the new data section.\nAny ideas how can I achieve this?\n",

Uncheck \"Move adjacent segments\" and \"Disable addresses\", this step is very important, it's what prevents the actual segment data from being deleted. Change the end address to be the end of the <pre><code>.text</code></pre> segment. Click ok and confirm the edit. Right click, and select \"Add segment\", set the name to <pre><code>.data</code></pre> and fill in the start and end addresses as the addresses it was previously loaded at. Then go to Edit -> Segments -> Move current segment to select the correct start address.\n",
