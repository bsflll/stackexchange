    "content": "I was trying to identify the following integrated circuit (marked with the codes 24CC MQRV819.1 1739).\n\nIt is mounted on the P6901 V2.6 board of a fingerprint presence recorder.\n\nGiven the function of the board and the other components on it I think that it is a microcontroller.\nI searched the codes but I didn't find a datasheet or any documentation.\nI also searched for a database with the pinouts of the IC to filter it using pin position/number (for example of GND, Vcc, etc...) but I didn't find anything useful.\nCould it be a proprietary chip? How can I find more information?\n",
