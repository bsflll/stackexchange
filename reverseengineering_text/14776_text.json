    "content": "I'm trying to reverse-engineer a function in <pre><code>IDA Pro</code></pre> that was originally identified by <pre><code>IDA</code></pre> as such (I was able to rename it into <pre><code>Device_CreateCloseIoControl</code></pre>):\n\nbut I know that this function was originally compiled as this:\n\nwhere <pre><code>DEVICE_OBJECT</code></pre> and <pre><code>IRP</code></pre> structs are defined in <pre><code>wdm.h</code></pre> from <pre><code>Windows Driver Kit</code></pre>.\nSo I'm curious, is there a way to rename this function to make <pre><code>IDA</code></pre> use those custom types? (Included in a specific header file.)\n",

            "content": "To do this you need to do the following:\n\nDefine or import structures involved in function definition if not defined yet. You can add a structure via Structures window (View-->Open Subviews-->Structures, or Shift-F9) , import the header file via File-->Load file-->Parse C header file, or Ctrl-F9 (this will also import typedefs if needed) or use a type library as described in How to import Windows DDK headers into IDA? .\nAfter that you should locate cursor at the function definition, press Y and enter C function prototype as it stated in the function definition.\n\nGood luck.\n",
