    "content": "I'm trying to identify the rating algorithm used to calculate the displayed average of a 1 star to 5 stars rating system. To analyze the data I collated the first and last 1000 ranks and added the real average.\nPlease see my EtherCalc table.\nHere is what I know about the underlying algorithm:\n\nIt is symmetrical.\nIt gives more power to the majority of votes.\nIt is pretty simple and not (intentionally) based on any known (complicated) mathematical method.\nNo information other than the respective number of votes is used for the calculation.\nIt tries to give supposedly dishonest votes (those allegedly submitted just to force the rating up (5 stars) or down (1 star)) less weight, so not every vote is worth the same. For example: If the vast majority of votes concentrate around 1 star and 2 stars votes with a smooth decline and a sudden jump at 5 stars votes, those 5 stars votes will count less (not necessarily 3.00 or 4.00, it could also be something like 4.88).\nTo detect outliers (suspected dishonest votes) a relative smooth rating curve is expected.\nItems with overwhelmingly favorable ratings get bonus points what gets them over 5 stars.\n\nI guess the easiest way to determine the algorithm is to analyze the items with the fewest numbers of total ratings. For example:\n\n\n\n\nrank\n5 stars\n4 stars\n3 stars\n2 stars\n1 star\ntotal\ndisplayed average\nreal average\n\n\n\n\n535.\n15\n1\n3\n0\n1\n20\n5.42\n4.45\n\n\n9802.\n2\n3\n10\n0\n0\n15\n3.11\n3.47\n\n\n9908.\n2\n1\n3\n2\n2\n10\n2.86\n2.90\n\n\n9944.\n0\n0\n3\n0\n1\n4\n2.71\n2.50\n\n\n9978.\n0\n0\n3\n0\n2\n5\n2.26\n2.20\n\n\n\n\nSince I've been thinking about this for too long and can't come up with the solution, I kindly ask for your valuable help.\n",

That might help to confirm those - or not.\nAm I correct that you cannot create a response from the site by creating specific input for your own defined combinations?\nThen I would try to attack the algorithm by\n\nselecting most simple combinations, and when displayed, and the real average is not the same. Like here:\n\n\n\nOr selecting combinations where only a single star rating is incrementing and the others keep the same\n\nEdit 10.04.22\nMeanwhile, I did a second approach: guessing an almost linear formula with a fixed factor for each star, so that the average is calculated by (number of 5 stars)*a+(number of 4 stars)*b+etc/total.\nThen I selected the ones with Zero 1 star, and Zero 2 stars and optimized the factors, resulting in\n\n5 stars: factor 5.705\n4 stars: factor 4.19\n3 stars: factor 2.335\n\nTotal difference of deltas of that model (<pre><code>abs(result - displayed average)</code></pre> versus average model is reduced, but not Zero => guessed formula is not good enough. This is expected from the information you gave for the algorithm. However the biggest deltas are found for good scored results => a new model is to be guessed to represent that non-linear impact.\nI think in that way you can come closer to a model that is good enough and get a final low delta, but it will never be the original algorithm.\nAlternatively, an \"automated formula guesser\" is needed, that combines the 5 variables to a result that comes close to the displayed average. However, this will also most probably not be the original algorithm.\n",

The patterns of residuals are very good indication of the existence of non-linear features which the question indicates.   In your example regression it's not surprising that you get a perfect fit as you've fitted a 5 parameter model to just 5 data points.
