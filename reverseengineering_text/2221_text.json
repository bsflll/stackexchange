    "content": "I recently heard about the \"control-flow flattening\" obfuscation which seems to be is used to break the structure of the CFG of the binary program (see Symbolic Execution and CFG Flattening).\nCan somebody make an explanation of what is its basic principle and, also, how to produce such obfuscation (tools, programming technique, ...) ? And, it would be nice to know if there are ways to extract the real shape of the control-flow of the program.\n",

Here's a typical graph of a function which had this obfuscation applied:\n\nAs you can see, all edges between basic blocks - both conditional and unconditional - has been redirected to a dispatcher node which uses a new artificial variable to decide which block should be jumped to next. This variable is updated at the end of each separated basic block.\nHere's the dispatcher node:\n<pre><code>LDR    R3, =0xF26A85D2\nADD    R3, R2, R3\nCMP    R3, #0x40 ; switch 65 cases\nADDLS  PC, PC, R3,LSL#2 ; switch jump\n</code></pre>\nIt uses <pre><code>R2</code></pre> as the control value.\nAnd here's one of the basic blocks:\n<pre><code>LDR  R2, =0x853FD863 ; jumptable 00532EFC case 33\nLDR  R1, [SP,#0x130+var_108]\nSTR  R2, [SP,#0x130+var_134]\nLDR  R2, =0xD957A31\nSTR  R1, [SP,#0x130+var_44]\nB    loc_532ED0\n</code></pre>\nIt updates <pre><code>R2</code></pre> with the value which will be used to jump to the next block.\nRecovering it shouldn't be too difficult in most cases - just track the control variable updates and replace jumps to the dispatcher node with jumps to the next block corresponding to the new control variable value.\n",

program.\nThere are a number of different ways that control flow flattening can be implemented, but the basic idea is to take the control flow of the program and transform it into a series of nested if-then-else\\while\\switch statements.\nThis can be done by replacing all of the branches in the original code with conditional statements, and then nesting these statements so that the overall control flow becomes much more complex.\nTo avoid automatic code simplification and folding we can use opaque predicates technique with known conditions.\nOne of the biggest benefits of control flow flattening is that it can make it much more difficult for an attacker to understand the code and figure out how it works. This can be especially useful for protecting against reverse engineering and tampering attacks, as it can make it much more difficult for an attacker to modify the code or to understand its internal logic\n",
