    "content": "I need an explanation about the term \"opcode\". I have found this : \n\nAn opcode is binary or hex value of the machine instruction in the cpu\n  instruction set.\n\nIf I understand correctly the definition, for instance :\n<pre><code>6A 03  push 3\n</code></pre>\n6A is the opcode et 03 the operand. But in several posts on different forums, people talk about 03 as if it was an opcode (for instance this \n\nHere, 3 is an immediate because it's included directly as part of the opcode (in the second byte).\n\n).\nDoes 03 is an opcode and an operand?\n",
