    "content": "My problem is: hexrays thinks that semicolon is visible character. \nIn IDAPython idaapi.is_visible_char(';') returns True\nIn picture you can see \"field_100C;\" highlighted, but \"field_100C\" not highlighted.\n\nIn ida.cfg I have following NameChars (this is ARM LE):\nNameChars =\n        \"_0123456789\"\n        \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n        \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\";  \nIn any other NameChars array semicolon is not added.\nSo, how can this behaviour get fixed? Is there idapython call of some sorts? Can plugins be a reason for this? Is there GUI option to check?\nFound this, but it didnt help\nhttps://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/sdkdoc/name_8hpp.html\n",
