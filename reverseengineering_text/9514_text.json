    "content": "In Ollydbg 1.1, when I create on the fly patches, they're automatically disabled when I restart the application (the debugged one, not Olly) and I have to enable them manually again.\nIs there a menu option I missed, or a script that can keep those enabled between restarts ?\n",

Last time I had a similar hassle where I wanted keep on the fly changes in olly, I just wrote up a dll patch and after injecting attached olly. But there was a significant number of patches so it was worth the effort.\n",

So it is the normal behavior that they don't load whenever you restart the program.\nIf you want to keep your patches between two executions, you've got two solutions :\n\nPatch definitely your binary, so you won't have to do the patches again :\nAfter you make a change to the code, highlight the changes, right click on it, choose 'Copy To Executable'. You can choose the current selection of what you just changed, or, you can choose to copy all changes to the executable.\nWhen you select one, it will popup a new window which is the new file, right click in the new window that popped up, and choose 'Save file' and it will save the changes to the given file that you choose.\nStep by step animation : http://i.imgur.com/G1J7EVP.gif\nUse a plugin such as Multiline Ultimate Assembler so you can write your patches, save them and load them whenever you want during execution time.\n",
