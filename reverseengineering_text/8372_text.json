    "content": "I am currently investigating firmware of an embedded system (car navigation) and have identified the OS as QNX.\nThe firmware has .ifs files which I was able to extract/unpack using QNX dumpifs tool and .img files. The .img files do not appear to be compressed, is there a file format or dump tool for QNX .img files?\n/edit: some extra information\nfile -sL file.img reports <pre><code>x86 boot sector</code></pre>\nMount attempt in Ubuntu <pre><code>mount -t qnx6 ./file.img -o loop/dev/loop1,blocksize=512 /media/qnx</code></pre> fails with wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loop1\ndmesg reports <pre><code>qnx4: wrong fsid in superblock</code></pre> or <pre><code>qnx6: invalid mount operation</code></pre>\n<pre><code>cat /proc/filesystems</code></pre> reports both qnx4 and qnx6\n",
