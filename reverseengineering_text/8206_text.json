    "content": "I've disassembled some C/C++ codes and realized the stack boundary is specified at beginning of a procedure, somehow like this :\n<pre><code>1. push ebp\n2. mov ebp , esp\n3. sub esp , <power> ; <power> is specified by mpreferred-stack-boundary=2^power\n</code></pre>\nThe above code is used to create stack frames, But What I need to know is why this subtract is used, Cause the stack grows down (by using push for local variables) and such the subtract causes :\n<pre><code>---------------------------- ^\nby sub esp,<power> <---- esp |\n.                            |\n.                            |\n.                            |\n---------------------------- |\nesp <---- esp                |\n---------------------------- |\nret address                  |\n---------------------------- |\n</code></pre>\nThe above picture shows that.So when in the rest of code if you have such the following codes:\n<pre><code>push var1\n</code></pre>\nIt should be taken at the top of it so it looks like this :\n<pre><code>-----------------------------\nvar1 (4 byte)                \n-----------------------------^\nby sub esp,<power> <---- esp |\n.                            |\n.                            |\n.                            |\n---------------------------- |\nesp <---- esp                |\n---------------------------- |\nret address                  |\n---------------------------- |\n</code></pre>\nSo the space between esp and var1 is going to be free without any use ?\nthat's what I want to know.\n",
