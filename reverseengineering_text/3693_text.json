    "content": "I'm trying to trace a system timeout (probably RPC related) that kills the debugging session. It occurs right after IDA loads and rebases an executable.\nIt happens only when debugging a 64-bit program using IDA's remote debugger in the same machine as the IDA cient. This on a Windows 7 SP1 system.\nI believe the JIT option in IDA (though it refuses to 'stick') takes effect only for the current executable. Assuming it even gets activated, it doesn't trap this particular error since it happens in some other non-debugged routine.\nI'm still not sure how a JIT debugging would help in this case, but I'd like to give it a try.\nSo, is there a way to set up IDA as the system's JIT debugger?\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\MICROSOFT\\WINDOWS NT\\CURRENTVERSION\\AEDEBUG points to vsjitdebugger now but I'm not sure if and how IDA can be defined there instead.\nThanks for any pointers.\n",

It accepts the parameter and starts up, but soon as I load up some *.i64 database, it pops up a complaint about the unrecognized parameter and exits. Maybe it can't be used in a 64-bit environment?</span>",
