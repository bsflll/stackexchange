I guess it is some kind of corrupted file, however not sure, so asking if someone has any references to <pre><code>SR</code></pre> files.\n",

I suspect the malware either restores <pre><code>MZ</code></pre> before actually running the file, or uses a custom loader (a la RunPE) to map and execute it, and of course the custom loader can be coded to handle the <pre><code>SR</code></pre> signature in addition (or instead of) <pre><code>MZ</code></pre>.\n",
