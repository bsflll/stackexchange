    "content": "I have a program which converts videos from a proprietary format into mp4.\nThe conversion is very slow and CPU utilization is less than 1%.\nI'm able to speed up the conversion process via Cheat Engine's \"Speed Hack\" feature.\nThis way, I can reach 100% CPU utilization, and the conversion is done within seconds.\nThe resulting mp4 file looks fine. There are no issues.\nI'm assuming that the developers of the conversion tool forgot to remove a sleep() in their program.\nIs there an easy way to search for sleep via IDA-Free or Ghidra or Ollydbg?\nI want to overwrite the sleep with NOP.\n",
