    "content": "over the past year, I provided an English patch to a community of thousands of players of a game I love and which is not available in English (just Chinese and Korean).\nSadly, besides me, other people created cheat tools for the game forcing and the developers to react by encrypting the files of the client.\nEven tho I am happy they make an effort to prevent cheating, I am sad I can no longer provide the community with my English patch.\nI spent the last few days trying to crack the files to be able to understand how I can decrypt them, replace the Chinese with my English content, and then encrypt it again. \nHowever I was not lucky with this, the files are super weird.\nwe have tried to identify the structure and came up with\n<pre><code>key (8byte) + filesize (4byte) + junk (0-6byte) + data\n</code></pre>\nbut we are not sure about the junk part\nHere's an encrypted new version and a decrypted old version of the same file.\nI picked this file as it seems to not have changed between encrypted and decrypted version.\nDoes anyone have any tips/pointers for me?\n",
