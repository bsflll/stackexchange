            "content": "\"File Size\" is the size of the file on disk, according to the file system.\n\"PE Size\" is the value of the <pre><code>SizeOfImage</code></pre> field in the <pre><code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER</code></pre> structure in the PE file. Its value is calculated as described here:\n\n<pre><code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER.SizeOfImage</code></pre> is the size of the loaded\n  executable/dll in virtual memory. It is not the same as the size on\n  disk.\nYou can calculate it with <pre><code>VirtualAddress + VirtualSize</code></pre> of the last\n  section.\n<pre><code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER.SizeOfImage</code></pre> is that value rounded up to the\n  value of <pre><code>IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER.SectionAlignment</code></pre> (usually the same as\n  the page size).\n\n<pre><code>SizeOfImage</code></pre> can be less than the file size if, for example, the file has an overlay appended to it.\n<pre><code>SizeOfImage</code></pre> can be greater than the file size if, for example, the sections' virtual sizes are larger than their raw sizes, as is often the case for compressed sections.\n",
