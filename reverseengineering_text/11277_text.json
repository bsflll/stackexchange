    "content": "Lets say I have this picture of some assembly:\n\nNow I know how to manual tranform this assembly into C code because it is small but is it possible for IDA to convert this into C code? Ideally I would write parts of the assembly or the entire thing and IDA would try to generate the C code for it. I don't have the binary, just pictures of various small programs (all linux x86). Also don't have any code segments etc (only the picture to guide me).\nRight now I only know how to generate C code if I have the compiled binary.\nI am using IDA Pro + Decompiler.\n",
