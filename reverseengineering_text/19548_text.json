    "content": "I have the instruction:\n<pre><code>add     edx, ds:dword_7BFC7A50[eax*4]\n</code></pre>\ni.e.\n<pre><code>add     edx, [eax*4+7BFC7A50h]\n</code></pre>\nAnd I decode it via <pre><code>decode_insn()</code></pre>. Then I try to get the information about the second operand. I can get <pre><code>7BFC7A50</code></pre> from <pre><code>insn_t.addr</code></pre>, but I can't get any information about  <pre><code>[eax*4]</code></pre>. I mean I expect register number to be in <pre><code>insn_t.ops[1].phrase</code></pre>, but there's an invalid value. And for some reason <pre><code>insn_t.ops[1].type</code></pre> is <pre><code>o_mem</code></pre>, not <pre><code>o_displ</code></pre>.\n",

In your cases it is quite relevant which disassembler you are using. Right now your question appears to be a question for the library developers and not really related to reverse engineering.\n",
