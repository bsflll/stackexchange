However, when I start the application with windbg, the breakpoint didn't work.\nAfter further digging I found the process is started by system service instead of the explorer, e.g\n\nAny ideas on how to debug UWP application and break on startup?\n",

Its worthwhile to add the check for an app-specific registry setting before calling DebugBreak, that way it is easy to turn on and off.\n",
