    "content": "I have been trying to reverse engineer the .goodnotes file format (a note taking app for iOS devices) and so far have discovered this:\n\nA .goodnotes file is simply a zip archive, an example file extracted has the following hierarchy:\n\n<pre><code>attachments/\n    1AF85389-413A-4C21-8EF5-C0603033CBF8\nindex.attachments.pb\nindex.events.pb\nindex.notes.pb\nindex.search.pb\nnotes/\n    30F8BBBA-710B-4BEC-A90B-49DFCEF05035\nsearch/\n    1AF85389-413A-4C21-8EF5-C0603033CBF8\nthumbnail.jpg\n</code></pre>\n\nIt is likely the strokes are stored within the notes/ directory and separated by page (if an empty page is added the corresponding notes file is zero bytes)\nThe files named by ID could be binary protobuf files, though I'm not sure and all efforts to reverse engineer the protobuf schema has failed\n",
