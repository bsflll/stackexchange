    "content": "I need to see how a DLL was written and I am using a x32dbg to do it at run-time. I am a newbie to this reversing stuff, so I am confused with this piece of code:\n<pre><code>push    ebp                          ; DllMain entry point\nmov     ebp, esp\nadd     esp, FFFFFFBC\nxor     eax, eax\nmov     dword ptr ss:[ebp-44], eax\nmov     eax, module.8BC3980\ncall    module.8BB8D54\nxor     eax, eax\n</code></pre>\nWikipedia says the following about function prologues:\n\nA function prologue typically does the following actions if the architecture has a base pointer (also known as frame pointer) and a stack pointer:\nPushes current base pointer onto the stack, so it can be restored later.\nAssigns the value of stack pointer (which is pointed to the saved base pointer) to base pointer so that a new stack frame will be created on top of the old stack frame.\nMoves the stack pointer further by decreasing or increasing its value, depending on whether the stack grows down or up. On x86, the stack pointer is decreased to make room for the function's local variables.\n[...]\nAs an example, here′s a typical x86 assembly language function prologue as produced by the GCC\n<pre><code>push   ebp\nmov    ebp, esp\nsub    esp, N\n</code></pre>\n\nBut I have encountered an <pre><code>add esp, N</code></pre> directive which adds a huge number to <pre><code>esp</code></pre> register. It seems something is wrong here, what should I understand from the code exactly?\nAnd the second question is about <pre><code>mov dword ptr ss:[ebp-44], eax</code></pre> directive. Why it is 44 that is subtracted from <pre><code>ebp</code></pre> address (11 ints!) and what does the <pre><code>ss</code></pre> item here?\nPS I suspect that the DLL is written in Delphi, but not 100% sure.\n",

EAX cannot be expected to stay the same after a call but your function does put a value in EAX before the call, therefore we can assume that EAX is one argument and the value on the stack is another one. Delphi may very well generate this unusual convention.</span>",
