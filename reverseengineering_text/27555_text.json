    "content": "I have attempted to do a ret2libc attack. It's a simple buffer overflow with the return address pointed to the system call with the string \"/bin/sh\" on the stack. For some reason, when I try to execute the program, although the program perform a system call with string \"/bin/sh\", but no shell was spawned, and I'm not sure why that is the case. Below snapshots of the stack before and after entering system call.\nThe stack before entering system call. (From left to right) red underlines emphasize the address of the system call, the address of the exit() function call, and the address to the string \"/bin/sh\". Note: the ebp (starts at 0xbffff7b8) had been overwritten with junk data.\nHere is what happen after I attempted to step through each instructions and reach the end. I try to type in id, and whoami, but nothing happen.\n",
