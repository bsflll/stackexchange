(although for function call graph it seems to be gen_simple_call_chart), but there are two big problems : 1. there is no difference between library nodes and local nodes in the generated DOT file (no color or anything), 2. CHART_IGNORE_LIB_FROM  doesnt work, i dont want to include nodes that are called by library calls :(</span>",

The graph being different from what you need is another issue. I suggest you contacting Hex-Rays support to confirm if issues you found are a bug and/or get a fix.</span>",
