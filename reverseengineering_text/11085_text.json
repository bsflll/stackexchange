    "content": "I'm interesting in reversing malware. The problem is, that if you analyse malware on your own you don't know how efficient you are, and with which techniques/tools/methods you can use for better results.\nThat is why I would like to see how other malware analysts do that. I would like to see a good reference of analyzing modern malware. I like the book Practical Malware Analysis from Sikorski and Honig with their detailed solutions to labs.  It would be great to find something like that, but about real modern malware in the Internet.\n",
