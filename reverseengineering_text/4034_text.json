    "content": "I am trying to extract the squashfs filesystem of my router. Here is firmware.\nFirst, I unzipped the file. Next, I ran <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre> to get some information about the file.\n<pre><code>DECIMAL     HEX         DESCRIPTION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n58          0x3A        TRX firmware header, little endian, header size: 28 bytes,  image size: 6656000 bytes, CRC32: 0x2B1713B2 flags/version: 0x10000\n86          0x56        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 65536 bytes, uncompressed size: 3614368 bytes\n1282426     0x13917A    Squashfs filesystem, little endian, non-standard signature,  version 3.0, size: 5367357 bytes,  853 inodes, blocksize: 65536 bytes, created: Wed Aug  7 05:08:47 2013 \n</code></pre>\nI then ran <pre><code>binwalk -e</code></pre> to extract the contents of the file. I got three files:\n<pre><code>.\n├── 13917A.squashfs\n├── 56\n└── 56.7z\n</code></pre>\nRunning <pre><code>unsquashfs</code></pre> on <pre><code>13917A.squashfs</code></pre> failed, saying it was unable to find the magic block. This was because the file was using a non standard magic. Changing the magic to a standard one made <pre><code>unsquashfs</code></pre> and <pre><code>file</code></pre> detect it as a squashfs file system. But <pre><code>unsquashfs</code></pre> did not complete successfully:\n<pre><code>caff@UbunutuX2:~/Netgear/test$ unsquashfs 13917A.squashfs \nReading a different endian SQUASHFS filesystem on 13917A.squashfs\nFilesystem on 13917A.squashfs is (768:0), which is a later filesystem version than I support!\n</code></pre>\nI also tried extracting the file system by using Jeremy Collake’s Firmware Mod Kit. This failed also:\n<pre><code>caff@UbunutuX2:~/Netgear/test$ /opt/firmware-mod-kit/trunk/unsquashfs_all.sh 13917A.squashfs \nAttempting to extract SquashFS .X file system...\n\n\nTrying ./src/others/squashfs-3.4-nb4/unsquashfs-lzma... Skipping others/squashfs-hg55x-bin (wrong version)...\nFile extraction failed!\n</code></pre>\nHow do I extract this squashfs file system?\n",
