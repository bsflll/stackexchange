    "content": "I compiled some [relatively complex] Java code into a .class file, then used jad to decompile it back into java. Of course, the code was obfuscated, which was to be expected. However, given that I had the original code, I thought I'd be able to look through the decompiled code fairly easily. However, I noticed differences in the code, such as where certain variables were defined (including differences of scope).\nIs there any main reason for this? I imagine it's one of those things that just happen in decompilation of code, but I'm more curious about what factors cause the change (e.g. complexity of code, whether it refers to other files, etc.).\nCould someone provide me with a good explanation on what factors cause the differences in the code before and after?\nEdit\nTechnically, the .class file is pulled from a jar. I extracted the contents and used the .class file in there.\nAs far as which obfuscator I used, I used the Retroguard obfuscator with the following options (I'm currently just exploring obfuscation and finding out what each thing does to the final result):\n<pre><code>.option Application\n.option Applet\n.option Repackage\n.option Annotations\n.option MapClassString\n.attribute LineNumberTable\n.attribute EnclosingMethod\n.attribute Deprecated\n</code></pre>\nDocumentation for the script can be found on their site. It's a little unorganized, but you should be able to find adequate explanations in there. It's also noteworthy that I stripped the generics and the local variable table.\nI have now also set up a way (inspired by the creators of the Minecraft Coder Pack) to rename the sources using data from a file (or files), which is passed to a dictionary of lists for packages, classes, methods, and fields.\n<pre><code># snippet from the MCP version (mine's slightly different) (all in Python):\nsrg_types = {'PK:': ['obf_name', 'deobf_name'],\n            'CL:': ['obf_name', 'deobf_name'],\n            'FD:': ['obf_name', 'deobf_name'],\n            'MD:': ['obf_name', 'obf_desc', 'deobf_name', 'deobf_desc']}\nparsed_dict = {'PK': [],\n               'CL': [],\n               'FD': [],\n               'MD': []}\n</code></pre>\nA line is then parsed from the file, and it is passed into the <pre><code>parsed_dict</code></pre> and then used to rename everything (back and forth). Implemented after compiling than decompiling the first time (after I noticd differences).\n",

Normal Java bytecode is actually surprisingly close to the original source, at least from the perspective of C or C++ (or even Scala). You'll always lose some information, but unobfuscated Java can be decompiled to something close to the original, especially if you compile with debug information.\nAll that goes out the window with obfuscation however, as obfuscators deliberately try to manipulate the structure of the code. When decompiling obfuscated code, you should be more amazed when you find similarities at all.\n",

You should try either JODE, or Fernflower (which I believe goes by Androchef).\nBefore decompiling, it might be a good idea to do some simple deobfuscation yourself. For example, you could try\n\nRemapping of Java keywords that have been used as class/method/variable names to legal Java identifiers. This task is very easy to do by using the Remapping adapters provided by the ASM library, http://asm.ow2.org/asm40/javadoc/user/org/objectweb/asm/commons/RemappingClassAdapter.html\nSome simple reorganization of blocks. Many obfuscators will stick gotos into awkward places that would be \"within a single expression\" in the Java source code, e.g. pushing something to the stack, then jumping, then storing it to a local variable in the destination is perfectly viable in bytecode, but understanding that the bytecode is simply doing var = value might give some decompilers a hard time.\n",
