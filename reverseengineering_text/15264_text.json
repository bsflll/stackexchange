    "content": "Currently I am stuck finding the base address for IDA to disassemble the boot image correctly.\nThe <pre><code>img</code></pre> file is coming from <pre><code>/dev/block/mmcblk0boot0</code></pre> (<pre><code>mcc_utils</code></pre> is executing: <pre><code>cat bootarea.img > dev/block/mmcblk0boot0</code></pre> to restore this image). And looking at the string output it shows that it prolly is U-boot <pre><code>U-Boot 2011.12 (Nov 04 2016 - 12:13:11)</code></pre> and the platform is running android 4.4.\n\nThe image starts with <pre><code>0x19034</code></pre> and then zero's until <pre><code>0x200</code></pre> which seem to contain some sort of checksum.Then at <pre><code>0x600</code></pre> certain address appear all starting with <pre><code>0xE004xxxx</code></pre>.\nAt <pre><code>0x660</code></pre> the first opcodes seem to placed and just before that <pre><code>0xBACODE</code></pre> is shown 3 times.\nI have tried to drop the image file until <pre><code>0x600</code></pre> and several different base addresses. But I don't seem to be able to get all offset correctly in IDA. There are a lot of strings at the bottom which could be matched.\nThe image file can be downloaded here.\nHopefully someone can help me finding the correct offset and base address.\n",
