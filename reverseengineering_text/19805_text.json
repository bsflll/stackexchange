    "content": "I have a floppy disk image which I am trying to load with Bochs Emulator.\nIt is from a CTF challenge and can be downloaded from here: http://squarectf.com/2017/floppy.img\nI am using Bochs version 2.3.9 on Windows 7 x64\nI started Bochs.exe and configured the memory and disk settings as shown below:\nMemory options:\n\nDisk and Boot options:\n\nHowever, when I start the emulator, it gives the following error:\n\nI have seen a writeup online for this CTF that describes the same method for loading the disk image and it worked.\nPlease let me know why it does not work for me.\nNote: I am able to load the disk image using qemu-system-x86_64 or qemu-system-i386 on Linux already. However, I want to understand why I cannot load it with Bochs.\nI even tried the method of creating a bochsrc file and loading it using bochsdbg.exe as shown below:\n<pre><code>bochsdbg.exe -f bochsrc -q\n</code></pre>\nHowever, I still get an error while loading it.\nUpdate: I am able to load the image in Bochs emulator by selecting floppy as the boot device under Boot options.\nHowever, I cannot load the image using bochsdbg.exe. Below is my bochsrc.txt file:\n<pre><code>romimage: file=$BXSHARE/BIOS-bochs-latest\nvgaromimage: file=$BXSHARE/VGABIOS-lgpl-latest\nmegs: 16\nata0: enabled=1, ioaddr1=0x1f0, ioaddr2=0x3f0, irq=14\nata0-master: type=disk, path=\"floppy.img\", mode=flat, cylinders=2, heads=16, spt=63\nboot: floppy\n</code></pre>\nAnd I get the following error message:\n<pre><code>Bochs is exiting with the following message:\n[      ] bochsrc.txt:5: ataX-master/slave: unknown type 'floppy'\n</code></pre>\nThe reason I want to have a proper bochsrc file is because I want to use IDA Pro to debug the boot sector.\n",

While I am able to get it working using the Bochs GUI, I still cannot get it to load properly using bochsdbg.exe. I have updated my question with my bochsrc file. Please have a look and let me know if it works for you.\n",

In your example, you're naming it to <pre><code>floppy.img</code></pre>, so you could try something else.\nIt's a bit of a guess, but seems like bochs doesn't like files with reserved words, like disk or floppy.\n",
