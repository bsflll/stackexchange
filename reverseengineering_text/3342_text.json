            "content": "Easy enough. In your case what you most likely want is <pre><code>commands</code></pre> which can be used to create \"routines\" that run whenever a breakpoint is hit. For your case roughly:\n<pre><code>break boost::uuids::detail::sha1::process_bytes\ncommands 1\nx/s $rcx\ncontinue\nend\n</code></pre>\nProblem is that you need to hardcode the breakpoint number. Depending on the GDB version you may get around this using the <pre><code>$bpnum</code></pre> convenience variable. So:\n<pre><code>break boost::uuids::detail::sha1::process_bytes\ncommands $bpnum\nx/s $rcx\ncontinue\nend\n</code></pre>\nAlso see this concerning the last example.\nNote: using this method can be quite taxing on the CPU depending on how often this gets called and whether a hardware breakpoint could be used by GDB.\n\nYou can also use the conditional form of breakpoints. Check out the actual authoritative reference here. The form looks like this:\n<pre><code>break ... if cond\n</code></pre>\nYou can also set the condition independent of setting the breakpoint, if you know the breakpoint number. Use <pre><code>info break</code></pre> to get the number of the breakpoint and then use that as <pre><code>bnum</code></pre> in:\n<pre><code>condition bnum expression\n</code></pre>\n",
