            "content": "You can use <pre><code>find_text</code></pre> in the <pre><code>ida_search</code></pre> module if you want to do a textual search. It's probably better to use a more intelligent search method, though. What I personally would do would be to use <pre><code>ida_ua::decode_insn</code></pre> to produce an <pre><code>insn_t</code></pre> object, compare its <pre><code>itype</code></pre> member against the platform-specific constant for the <pre><code>move</code></pre> instruction, and then inspect the register numbers to make sure they match what I want. Something like this:\n<pre><code># Decode instruction at ea\nins = ida_ua.insn_t()\nif ida_ua.decode_insn(ins,ea) == 0:\n    print(\"%#x: could not disassemble?\" % ea)\n    return False\n\n# Check to see if it's the \"movl\" instruction\nif ins.itype != ida_allins.ARM_movl:\n    return False\n\n# Is the first operand a register, internal register number 2?\nif ins.op[0].type != ida_ua.o_reg:\n    return False\n# Or whatever the register number for r2 is, might not be 2\nif ins.op[0].reg != 2:\n    return False\n\n# Is the first operand a register, internal register number 3?\nif ins.op[1].type != ida_ua.o_reg:\n    return False\n# Or whatever the register number for r3 is, might not be 3\nif ins.op[1].reg != 3:\n    return False\n\nprint(\"%#x: found movl r2, r3\" % ea)\n</code></pre>\n",
