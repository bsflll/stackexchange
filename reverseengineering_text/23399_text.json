    "content": "Basically, I cannot find which process is being written to when WriteProcessMemory is being called.\nCurrently I'm Setting Breakpoints on WriteProcessMemory and OpenProcess. However, the process handle being passed to WriteProcessMemory is different from that obtained from OpenProcess, so it appears that the process handle is being obtained in another way. Is there something I'm missing out on? Should I add more breakpoints on other functions?\n",

            "content": "It is also easy using x64dbg. When you break on the <pre><code>WriteProcessMemory</code></pre> the handle will be at <pre><code>[esp+0x4]</code></pre> in the memory.\n\nAfter you write down the handle (in this case 0xDC) you may go to the <pre><code>Handles</code></pre> tab in the x64dbg main window, then <pre><code>Right click -> Refresh</code></pre>. All the handles associated with your debugged process will be listed. Now you need to find the corresponding handle and that's it.\n\nAs you can see, in my case the <pre><code>WriteProcessMemory</code></pre> was writing to a process with PID 0x7A30.\nIf you don't use a debugger that lets you list handles (unlikely) you can use external tool like Process Explorer, which also has the ability to list all process associated handles.\n",
