And why is the EDX register chosen rather than a DX register or EAX register?\n<pre><code>mov     edx,len                             ;message length\nmov     ecx,msg                             ;message to write\n</code></pre>\nI also do not understand why we are moving 1 into the EBX register? And for that matter moving 4 into the EAX register?\n<pre><code>mov     ebx,1                               ;file descriptor (stdout)\nmov     eax,4                               ;system call number (sys_write)\nint     0x80                                ;call kernel\n</code></pre>\nWhy are we moving 1 into EAX? What is so significant about EAX compared to the other registers? And what happened to the 4 stored in EAX previously?\n<pre><code>mov     eax,1                               ;system call number (sys_exit)\nint     0x80                                ;call kernel\n\nsection     .data\nmsg     db  'Hello, world!',0xa                 ;string\nlen     equ $ - msg                             ;length of string\n</code></pre>\nHow does data in the individual register interact with each other?

            "content": "It would be more helpful to give a full sample program instead of bits and pieces. You could inline your questions using <pre><code>;</code></pre>-preprended lines.\n\n1) Why does the message length need to be put into the EDX register?\n  And why is the EDX register chosen rather than a DX register or EAX\n  register?\n<pre><code>    mov     edx,len                             ;message length\n    mov     ecx,msg                             ;message to write\n</code></pre>\n\nWhere (in which register) each parameter lands really is a matter of the architecture (seemingly here x86_64): ABI. The order usually is the same as for the C runtime functions which are the frontend to the syscalls, here <pre><code>write</code></pre>. It's a convention between the kernel and user mode.\n\n2) I also do not understand why we are moving 1 into the EBX register?\n  And for that matter moving 4 into the EAX register?\n<pre><code>    mov     ebx,1                               ;file descriptor (stdout)\n    mov     eax,4                               ;system call number (sys_write)\n    int     0x80                                ;call kernel\n</code></pre>\n\nOne is literally the file number of the standard stream named <pre><code>stdout</code></pre>.\nFour is the system call number (essentially an index into a table) and <pre><code>int 0x80</code></pre> is a call gate into the kernel. I.e. execution transitions into the kernel and the respective system call (here <pre><code>sys_write</code></pre>) knows where to take the parameters from.\n\nWhy are we moving 1 into EAX? What is so significant about EAX\n  compared to the other registers? And what happened to the 4 stored in\n  EAX previously?\n\nUsually the return value also ends up in EAX or EDX:EAX or similar. So the 4 would have been overwritten. It depends on the return type.\nOne in this case is the system call number of <pre><code>sys_exit</code></pre>, the kernel-side function for the libc <pre><code>exit</code></pre> function.\n\n<pre><code>    mov     eax,1                               ;system call number (sys_exit)\n    int     0x80                                ;call kernel\n\nsection     .data\n\nmsg     db  'Hello, world!',0xa                 ;string\nlen     equ $ - msg                             ;length of string\n</code></pre>\n3) How does data in the individual register interact with each other?\n  How do they know that data is stored within them?\n\nThey don't. The kernel picks them from these registers and the (user mode) developer simply has to know where to put these pieces of data.\nIn the normal case the user mode developer will, however, make use of a C runtime, like glibc.\n",
