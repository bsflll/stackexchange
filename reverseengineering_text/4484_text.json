    "content": "I am trying to alter a <pre><code>jnz</code></pre> in IDA but it wont allow me. It says:\n<pre><code>Cannot Reach Destination From current location\n</code></pre>\nAny reason for this problem ?\nEdit:\nThe Program is Trying to <pre><code>CreateFileA</code></pre>.\nIt Then makes a <pre><code>cmp</code></pre> between <pre><code>eax</code></pre> and <pre><code>0FFFFFFFFh</code></pre>( i am guessing it returns -1 if file doesnt exist ).\nMore Information <pre><code>jnz     short FileExist ; Jump if Not Zero (ZF=0)</code></pre> Changing that to <pre><code>jmp short FileExist</code></pre>\nEdit 2: \nSo I changed the hex code for the jmp and it works but when i do it by assembly it doesnt , still yet to find out why.\n",

There is another jnz (opcode 0x0f 0x85) that has a longer parameter, but if your current instruction is the 0x75, you have only 2 bytes, and you don't have space for the longer one.
