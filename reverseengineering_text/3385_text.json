    "content": "I'm looking for information on the _DEVICE_OBJECT->_DEVOBJ_EXTENSION structure.\nI'd like to know a bit more about this structure in genernal, like what it's actually used for. But specifically, I'd like to know about the <pre><code>_DEVICE_OBJECT* AttachedTo</code></pre> member and the difference between that and the <pre><code>_DEVICE_OBJECT* AttachedDevice</code></pre> member in the <pre><code>_DEVICE_OBJECT</code></pre> structure.\nGoogle is proving fruitless, and I can't find any reference to it in the Windows Internals book. Any resources or information would be greatly appreciated.\nEDIT:\nOk... After a bit of staring at WinDbg I found that the <pre><code>AttachedTo</code></pre> field seems to point to the device object at the top of the device tree. Can anyone confirm this?\n",
