There's a one letter code for each primitive type - B = Byte, C = Char, S = Short, Z = Boolean, I = Int, J = Long, F = Float, and D = Double. Object types are represented by L, followed by the classname, followed by a semicolon.\nSo for example, a <pre><code>String[][][]</code></pre> would have the descriptor <pre><code>[[[Ljava/lang/String;</code></pre>.\n",
