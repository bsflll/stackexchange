    "content": "I'm a beginner in reverse engineering, and as a beginner I started to read \"Reverse Engineering for beginers\".\nHere is the hello world program from the book (taken from chapter 3, page 12) :\n\nNow let’s try to compile the same C/C++ code in the GCC 4.4.1 compiler in Linux:\n  gcc 1.c -o 1 Next, with the assistance of the IDA disassembler, let’s see how\n  the main() function was created. IDA, like MSVC, uses Intel-syntax5.\n\n<pre><code>main proc near\n\nvar_10 = dword ptr -10h\n\n     push ebp\n     mov ebp, esp\n     and esp, 0FFFFFFF0h\n     sub esp, 10h\n     mov eax, offset aHelloWorld ; \"hello, world\n\"\n     mov [esp+10h+var_10], eax\n     call _printf\n     mov eax, 0\n     leave\n     retn\nmain endp\n</code></pre>\nThere are two lines I don't understand at all : \n\n<pre><code>and esp, 0FFFFFFF0h</code></pre>\n<pre><code>sub esp, 10h</code></pre>\n\nFrom what I understood from the book, we add <pre><code>0FFFFFFF0h</code></pre> (equals -16) value to ESP in order to align the stack to a 16byte boundary for optimisation.\n\nMy question is : why do we add -16 and then substract 16 to the stack? It seems pointless to me, can't we substract directly 32?\nSecond, if I'm understanding well:\n\nthe program starts with EBP = ESP, because nothing is on the stack. \nThen EBP is pushed to the stack. Assuming the program is 64bit, ESP is now EBP - 8 (because of the 64bits). So now we have ESP != EBP.\nThen we copy the content of ESP into EBP. So we have EBP = ESP, and EBP = fristEBP (EBP when the program started) - 8. \n\nWhy do we need to modify the value of EBP? PUSH instruction is supposed to change the value of ESP, not EBP, so why would there be any problem not modifying EBP value at the function prolog?\n\nSo now we have EBP = ESP, and both are fristEBP (EBP when the program started) - 8. So now we are adding -16 to the stack, so ESP becomes ESP - 16 (ESP - 24 if we consider that we've been adding -8 to the stack). \nWhat is -24 have to do with a 16byte boundary?\nWhy do we substract 16 again from the stack with <pre><code>sub esp, 10h</code></pre>?\n\nNotes : I'm sorry for the english, and sorry if I'm asking dumb questions, the book isn't clear enought and I failed to find explainations on the net.\n",

This is how the alignment is done and not by adding anything. Only later you <pre><code>sub</code></pre> 16 to have room for the local variables.\n\nWhy do we need to modify the value of EBP?\n\nWe use <pre><code>EBP</code></pre> to store the initial <pre><code>ESP</code></pre> value. <pre><code>EBP</code></pre> is pointing to the current stack frame. This is the place for local variables created withing the function. Before we modify <pre><code>EBP</code></pre> it is stored on the stack so that we can restore it before we leave the function.\n",
