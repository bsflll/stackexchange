            "content": "It's very likely what you're looking at is a virtual method call on a class. \nVirtual methods are usually implemented by the use of a pointer to a table of function pointers. The pointer is added at the beginning of the class data and is added transparently by the compiler if a class has a virtual method.\nFirst it casts v2 to a pointer to a DWORD, reads the DWORD (vtable pointer), adds 24 to the vtable base pointer, reads the pointer to the method at offset 24 in the vtable, casts that to a function pointer and calls it. \nSince v2 is both used to locate the vtable pointer and passed as the first argument it's likely the this pointer.\n",
