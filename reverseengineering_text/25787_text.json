    "content": "I'm a newbye, so sorry for the basic questions, before anyone downvote the question.\nI'm Learning reverse engineering, I've already learned assembly for mips on the computer science underdegree and I know the basic about computer architeture.\nI'm trying to make a macro bot for doing simple tasks on a unity game called pokemon trading card game online. It seens it ways built on unity 2018.4.11.\nI know I have to find the functions that call what I want, but don't know how to do it and what to do after this. The tutorials are very confusing on this area.\nSo being objective, can anyone help me what I have to search and what I have to do with what I found, like, if I'm trying to find the function that calls the button to start a play, how can I call it after I found it?\nThank you very much?\n",
