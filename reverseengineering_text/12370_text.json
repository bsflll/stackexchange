            "content": "That's undefined behavior. Aka the compiler/linker is allowed to break all the rules or make up their own.\nHowever the typical function call ABI will put the return value into EAX if it fits (which both bool and int will). With bool either being defined as 0 for false and non zero for true or as zero for false and a specific value (like 0xffffffff or 1) for true.\nSo after the function call the return register will contain <pre><code>0x100</code></pre> but the compiler could assume it was a specific value (if the ABI said so) and then use that assumption for further optimization. \nFor example if true was defined as 0xffffffff then a ternary <pre><code>returnDummy()?val1:val2</code></pre> can be implemented as \n<pre><code>int mask = returnDummy();\nres = (mask&val1) | (~mask&val2);\n</code></pre>\n",
