    "content": "I am learning <pre><code>PE32+</code></pre> (64 bit) files. I have added a new section to the <pre><code>PE32+</code></pre> file and made the new section as the entry point. Some simple instructions are added in the new segment. Now I want to go to the old entry point after executing the new segment, then continue execution from there. I read the articles for <pre><code>PE32</code></pre> that are using <pre><code>assembly</code></pre> language instructions. But I am not able get it working for <pre><code>64 bit</code></pre>(tried to add <pre><code>.asm</code></pre> files). Please help me with any useful information. Is it possible to do it in <pre><code>C++</code></pre>?\n",
