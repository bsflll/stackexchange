Technically this is also true for Windows at the NT native API level - much more so than it lets on - but this means first and foremost that a path can be accessed uniformly through a common root. This is true on Windows (<pre><code>\\ </code></pre> -> <pre><code>\\REGISTRY</code></pre> and <pre><code>\\GLOBAL??\\C:</code></pre>) as well as Unix. My guess is that a driver exists that populates whatever is in there and you can use standard read/write to interact with that data. <pre><code>/proc</code></pre> and <pre><code>/sys</code></pre> are not much different in that respect. But I didn't see that exact system, no.\n",
