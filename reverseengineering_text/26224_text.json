    "content": "I am using the websocket module for my client in python3, and I am trying to troubleshoot some errors I am getting that lead to the client disconnecting after seemingly random intervals.\nWhen I enabled trace with <pre><code>websocket.enableTrace(True)</code></pre> I can see some entries that I am not sure how to decrypt. Here is an example:\n<pre><code>Thread-3:send: b'\\x88\\x82\\xc1$\\xf7\\xa6\\xc2\\xcc'</code></pre>\nAny idea how to decrypt the message and see if this could explain the source of my problem?\nThank you!\n",
