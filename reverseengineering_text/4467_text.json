    "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/4467/what-is-the-difference-between-software-architecture-recovery-and-software-remod",
    "content": "In the reverse engineering scenario, after extracting a representation of the code, it is often useful to recover/ reconstruct the architecture of the software (for eg. when reverse engineering java programs, recovering packages from classes). I am particularly concerned with the modules view of Software Architecture. To my understanding when we try to recover the modular architecture of a software, it is same as software remodularization. Is there a difference?\n",
