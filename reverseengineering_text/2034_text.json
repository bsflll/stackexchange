    "content": "So I want to know is such tool exist without counting IDA PRO. And is there any GUI version of it if exist - because I really don't want to debugging with terminal. My OS X version is Snow Leopard. I want to disassemble and debug an PowerPC app which runs with Rosetta on OS X 10.6.\n",

It uses otool (object tool) to\n  disassemble a Mach-O executable file, then enhances the disassembled\n  output. Simple enhancements include adding the machine code of each\n  instruction and the offset of each instruction from the beginning of a\n  function. More complicated enhancements include displaying the names\n  and data types of Objective-C methods even if symbols have been\n  stripped, and adding comments that describe member variables, function\n  calls, static data and more.\n\nhttp://otx.osxninja.com/\n",
