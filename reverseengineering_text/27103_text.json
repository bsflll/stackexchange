From\nPractical Appcall examples:\n\nIn the following example we will change the PE header page protection\nto execute/read/write (normally it is read-only):\n<pre><code>virtprot = Appcall.proto(\"kernel32_VirtualProtect\",\n  \"BOOL __stdcall VirtualProtect(LPVOID addr, DWORD sz, DWORD newprot, PDWORD oldprot);\")\nr = virtprot(0x400000, 0x1000, Appcall.Consts.PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, Appcall.byref(0));\nprint \"VirtualProtect returned:\", r\nRefreshDebuggerMemory()\n</code></pre>\n\nPossibly other debuggers can do something similar (e.g. WinDbg has <pre><code>.call</code></pre>)\n",
