However, that doesn't mean we can't find the code behind these functions.\nYou can download the Intel Fortran Compiler from https://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers/try-buy\nYou can then extract the <pre><code>.obj</code></pre> files from the <pre><code>IFCORE</code></pre> library to find the code behind the functions you listed above. For example, the code for <pre><code>for__key_desc_test_item()</code></pre> is in <pre><code>for_desc_item.obj</code></pre> in <pre><code>libifcore.lib</code></pre>:\n\nDecompiling with Hex-Rays yields:\n",
