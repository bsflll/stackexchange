I have already checked with sites like Any.Run but most of their samples are .exe and binary files. Does any one have any leads to a place I can get the source codes especially for ransomware?\n",

Of course that is not wanted\nIt is possible that someone will find weaknesses, obviously that is possible for binaries aswell but usually it's easier with the source code, that could allow decryption without paying\nIf it's \"only for educational purposes\" it will get abused. I'm 100% sure on that one, so this has to be considered aswell\n\nA few years ago I saw a sample ransomware on GitHub, maybe that is a good starting point.\n",
