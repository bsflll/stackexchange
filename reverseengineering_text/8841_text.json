    "content": "I have the following call to a function.\n<pre><code>      ....\n      push eax\n      push prog.00401D19\n      call dword ptr ds:[&USER32.EnumWindows]\n      ....\n</code></pre>\nSo, as you can see, this is a call to <pre><code>EnumWindows</code></pre>. But I would like to analyze the code at <pre><code>00401D19</code></pre>. Do you know how to do that in ollydbg ? \nps: when I make <pre><code>00401D19</code></pre> as my new origin (Ctrl + Gray *), then I can not go back to the line after <pre><code>EnumWindows</code></pre> because side effects etc. can happen. Therefore, I search a different option.\n",
