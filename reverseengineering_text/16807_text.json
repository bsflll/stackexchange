    "content": "I would like to know how <pre><code>WinDbg</code></pre> extracts all the user, group, privilege information about a process from a <pre><code>token</code></pre> when given the <pre><code>!token 0xaddress</code></pre> command so I can implement it in my driver code.\nExample output of <pre><code>!token 0xaddress</code></pre> command\n\nAccording to this site token has the <pre><code>EX_FAST_REF</code></pre> structure which has a definition like this:\n<pre><code>typedef struct EX_FAST_REF {\n       union {\n              PVOID Object;\n              ULONG RefCnt : 3;\n              ULONG Value;\n         };\n }EX_FAST_REF, *PEX_FAST_REF\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>Object</code></pre> field points to the address of the token, the <pre><code>Value</code></pre> field holds the fist 4 bytes from the token address. I could not find the info I need from these fields but when I investigate the token address a little bit I am beginning to see strings like <pre><code>uid</code></pre>. What is the type of structure windbg uses to get all of this information? (Both debugger and debuggee have 32 bit architecture).\n",
