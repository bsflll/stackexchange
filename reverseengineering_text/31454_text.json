    "content": "Let's suppose an obfuscated binary program.\nThis programs loads a payload in memory.\nThis payload contains encrypted instructions.\nThe program decrypts this payload and jumps to it.\nI want to break the program in immunity debugger when the CPU runs a NOP instruction (this is an example).\nI can do it manually by running the program step by step and see if EIP points on a 0x90 byte. But I want to automate this task. Is there a way to do that in immunity debugger ?\nThanks a lot\n",
