    "content": "I want to hook functions in a library (<pre><code>lib.so</code></pre> or <pre><code>lib.dylib</code></pre>) from another process. I know that unlike windows libraries, libraries in Linux and Mac still have their symbols (function names and parameters).\nAPI Monitor allows you hook exported functions from other libraries but only for windows, which is somewhat of what I need.\nBasically I want to hook certain functions in either Linux or mac and see their parameters and order of calls.\nAny help is appreciated!\n",
