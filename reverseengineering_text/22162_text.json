I'm curious if there are tools which automate other useful tasks when reversing an APK, such as:\n\nRecognizing frameworks and SDKs built into the app\nClassifying the types of resources built into the app\nScanning for common security blunders\nFinding all URLs, emails, etc.\n\nI've come across super, though I haven't found it incredibly useful in my use cases.\n",
