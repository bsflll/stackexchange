    "content": "A co-worker gave me his mom's Linksys router that he is convinced has been hacked to include a MitM.  We could just upgrade the firmware, but that wouldn't be any fun and so I thought this might be a learning opportunity to play with Binwalk.\nAll of the tutorials assume you already have a binary and I am not even sure if there is a way to non-destructively extract the firmware out of an existing router.\nI ran a full port scan on it and only TCP/80 and TCP/1783 are active...so TFTP doesn't look like an option.\nAny pointers would be appreciated.\n",

            "content": "If you are able to get a shell on your router, it is possible that a good part of the read-only filesystem is stored as a squashfs file and overlaid on boot. Obtaining that, along with NVRAM settings should be a good representation of the firmware.\nAlso if you have hardware access, there is a chance of a UART console in form of pads/pins on your router's PCB. Connecting that to a cheap ~$5 USB serial might allow you to pause your router early in the boot process and extract the firmware out via tftp, assuming u-boot which is very common.\nhttp://www.devttys0.com/2012/11/reverse-engineering-serial-ports/\n(devttys0's blog is an excellent read on router-hacking)\n",
