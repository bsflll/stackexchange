    "content": "I want to know using IDAPython if an instruction at the end of a basic block is a jump/branch instruction (like <pre><code>B</code></pre> or <pre><code>JNZ</code></pre>) and also determine if it's conditional or not. I need it in a CPU agnostic way, without relying on mnemonics.\nI cannot find how to do so by grepping in the $IDA_DIR/python directory.\n",
