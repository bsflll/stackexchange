            "content": "Let me summarize the links given at https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/1993/12321 without going into serious disasembly analysis for now. \nWhen the Linux kernel + dynamic linker is going to run a binary with <pre><code>exec</code></pre>, it traditionally just dumped the ELF section into a known memory location specified by the linker during link time.\nSo, whenever your coded:\n\nreferenced a global variable inside your code\ncalled a function from inside your code\n\nthe compiler + linker could just hardcode the address into the assembly and everything would work.\nHowever, how can we do it when dealing with shared libraries, which must necessarily get loaded at potentially different addresses every time to avoid conflicts between two shared libraries?\nThe naive solution would be to keep relocation metadata on the final executable, much like the actual linker does and whenever the program is loaded, have the dynamic linker go over every single access and patch it up with the right address.\nHowever, this would be too time consuming, since there could be a lot of references to patch on a program, and then that program would take a long time to start running.\nThe solution, as usual, is to add another level of indirection: the GOT and PLT, which are two extra chunks of memory setup by the compilation system + dynamic linker.\nAfter the program is launched, the dynamic linker checks the address of shared libraries, and hacks up the GOT and PLT so that it will point correctly to the required shared library symbols:  \n\nwhenever a global variable of a shared library is accessed by your program, the compiler + linker emits instead two memory accesses:\n<pre><code>mov    0x200271(%rip),%rax        # 200828 <_DYNAMIC+0x1a0>\nmov    (%rax),%eax\n</code></pre>\nThe first one load the true address of the variable from the GOT, which the dynamic linker previously set, into <pre><code>rax</code></pre>.\nThe second indirect access actually accesses the variable indirectly through the address from <pre><code>rax</code></pre>.\nfor code, things are a bit more complicated.\nWhenever a function from a shared library is called, the linker makes us jump to an address in the PLT.\nThe first time the function is called, the PLT code uses offsets stored in the GOT to decide the actual final location of the function, and then:\n\nstores this pre-calculated value\njumps there\n\nThe next times the function is called, the value has already been calculated, so it just jumps there directly.\nDue to this lazy resolution mechanism:\n\nprograms can start running quickly even if the shared libraries have a lot of symbols\nwe can replace functions on the fly by playing with the <pre><code>LD_PRELOAD</code></pre> variable\n\n\nNowadays, position independent executables (PIE) are the default on distros such as Ubuntu 18.04.\nMuch like shared libraries, these executables are compiled so that they can be placed at a random position in memory whenever they are executed, in order to make certain vulnerabilities harder to exploit.\nTherefore, it is not possible to hardcode absolute function and variable addresses anymore in that case. Executables must either:\n\nuser instruction pointer relative addressing if those are available on the assembly language, e.g.:\n\n\nARMv8:\n\n\n<pre><code>B</code></pre> does 26-bit jumps, <pre><code>B.cond</code></pre> 19-bit\n\"LDR (literal)\" does 19-bit loads\n<pre><code>ADR</code></pre> calculates 21-bit relative addresses that other instructions can use\n\n\nuse the GOT / PLT otherwise\n",
