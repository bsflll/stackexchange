Can anyone tell me which code is suitable and which is not? For example mov eax,1 would not be a good choice. But what code would be a good criterion? What are the criterions for Yara rules based assembler codes?\n",

            "content": "Agree with Robert - The common way to avoid false positives is having a large software pool of known benign software you can check your rules with.\nIf you are just starting to write yara rules then concentrate on the easy way that is strings, write yara rules based on the unique strings.\nTo answer this:\nCan anyone tell me which code is suitable and which is not? What are the criterions for Yara rules based assembler codes?\nSome of the criteria which you can use:\n\nAny single line assembly code will be bad choice, you will need few lines of assembly code\nWrite yara rule based on custom encryption/decryption loop with\nunique key \nDon't take standard encryption/decryption like RC4 for\nyara rule, that's why I said custom in above point \nDon't include yara rule with too many address offset as it may not hit another hash \nWild card address offset to hit different hashes of the same malware family\nTake a code pattern which is performing some unique steps which is\nspecific to this malware sample\nMixture of few strings and assembly code should give you good result\n\nThis above list is not a comprehensive criteria but you will learn more by doing it and looking through existing Yara rules.\nCheck this repository for different type of Yara Rules, you will get some idea for strings and assembly code Yara rules: \nhttps://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules\n",
