    "content": "Challenge #64\nWhat does this code do?\nAn array of <pre><code>array[x][y]</code></pre> form is accessed here. Try to determine the dimensions of the array, at least partially, by finding y.\n<pre><code>_array$ = 8\n_x$ = 12\n_y$ = 16\n_f  PROC\n    mov eax, DWORD PTR _x$[esp-4]\n    mov edx, DWORD PTR _y$[esp-4]\n    mov ecx, eax\n    shl ecx, 4\n    sub ecx, eax\n    lea eax, DWORD PTR [edx+ecx*8]\n    mov ecx, DWORD PTR _array$[esp-4]\n    fld QWORD PTR [ecx+eax*8]\n    ret 0\n_f  ENDP\n</code></pre>\nAt first I think there is a mistake in the question. Because I only see three variables here, one for array address, the one x and one y, so I assume it's actually a 2d array of double, not a 3d as in \"An array of <pre><code>array[x][y]</code></pre>\".\nThen I was stuck because eventually the program loads <pre><code>array[8y+192x]</code></pre>, and x and y can be anything.\nSo I figured this must be a 3d array of double, with the third dimension given. I still couldn't figure it out so I tried to write my own program and use Godbolt to give me assembly. After a few trials I got something pretty close to the original program:\nSomething close\nHowever I'm still having difficulty to match my program with the original question. I think I'm pretty close but how do I proceed from here? I have a hunch that y is also 24 in the original question, but not 100% sure.\n",

If you execute code from start of the procedure, then just before ret these are the relevant changes to the state of the program - ignoring registers\n<pre><code>float_st0          = @64[array + (y + x * 0x78) * 0x8]\nfloat_stack_ptr    = float_stack_ptr + 0x1\n</code></pre>\nwhere <pre><code>st0</code></pre> has been loaded with a 64bit value from a location.\n<pre><code>array + (y + x * 0x78) * 0x8\n</code></pre>\nIn a 1D array the way you access any index is\n<pre><code>array + index * sizeof(member)\n</code></pre>\nThe size of the array member is 8 <pre><code>sizeof(double)</code></pre> here so the index is\n<pre><code>y + x * 0x78\n</code></pre>\n2D arrays are laid out linearly in memory. Accessing second dimension requires the size of first dimension to be known -\n\nIn the above example to access <pre><code>array[1][2]</code></pre> we need to access it like\n<pre><code>array + sizeof(int) * (2 + 1 * 3)\n</code></pre>\nIn the op <pre><code>x</code></pre> is getting multiplied by 0x78 - so the size of the <pre><code>y</code></pre> dimension is 0x78 members.\nAdditionally I could replicate the problem code to an extent here\nWith this code and x86 MSVC v19.0, optimization flag /Ox\n<pre><code>double load(double array[][0x78], int x, int y) {\n    return array[x][y];\n}\n</code></pre>\nwe get\n<pre><code>_array$ = 8                                   ; size = 4\n_x$ = 12                                                ; size = 4\n_y$ = 16                                                ; size = 4\n_load   PROC\n        mov     ecx, DWORD PTR _x$[esp-4]\n        mov     eax, DWORD PTR _y$[esp-4]\n        shl     ecx, 4\n        sub     ecx, DWORD PTR _x$[esp-4]\n        lea     ecx, DWORD PTR [eax+ecx*8]\n        mov     eax, DWORD PTR _array$[esp-4]\n        fld     QWORD PTR [eax+ecx*8]\n        ret     0\n_load   ENDP\n</code></pre>\nPS : I ran this through a miasm based simplification - code here\n",
