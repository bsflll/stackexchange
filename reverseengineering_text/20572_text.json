    "content": "I have a reverse engineering set up on a Mac machine. This set up does some reverse engineering on iOS applications(.ipa files). I'm migrating the setup from Mac to a linux machine.\nCurrently on Mac, I'm using OTOOL on ipa binary files and using the following commands:\n\notool -L /iOS/binary/path\notool -lv /iOS/binary/path\notool -hv /iOS/binary/path\n\nNow, I've to do the same operation, i.e reverse engineer the iOS applications, but now on the linux machine. AFAIK, OTOOL is not available for linux machine. \n\nI've come across JTOOL which I think is most relevant till now. I can                 use it on linux, and it does something similar to OTOOL, but not exactly same. E.g. while using the -L command on JTOOL, I also need to specify architecture. However, OTOOL gives the shared libraries for all the available architectures.\nI tried ldd, but I'm getting the error - \"not a dynamic executable\".\nI tried objdump, but it asks for the object file.\n\nI'm not sure which tool can I use. I to figure out the alternate tool which can do same as OTOOL. Or, if not same, then what changes do i need to make to use the alternate tool.\n",

Both are currently maintained and available for Linux:\nipsw from Blacktop\nand\nktool from cynder\nUpdate, September 2024\njtool is no longer supported, let alone for Linux. ipsw is the most actively developed cross-platform option and with new functionality being added.\n",
