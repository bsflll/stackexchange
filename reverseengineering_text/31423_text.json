    "content": "I'm a beginner in the reversing field, so apologize if the question is too dumb.\nWhen analyzing binaries I always had this idea of saving somehow an execution flow so I can compare with other saved flow and get the exact points where they differ so I can start analyzing from that point.\nHaving a tool capable of doing that would be awesome. I can think of a lot of stuff I could do with this that with my current skill level is simply not feasible.\nIs there a tool that already does that?\nIf not, how could I create such a tool?\n",

However when it was a commercial product it was easy to install and as it was packaged in a installer. It's better to search for the older commercial release to get work done. I think you understood what I mean.</span>",
