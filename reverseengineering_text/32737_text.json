    "content": "I am taking a intro to reversing course. After learning patching we got a home work to find the flag and write a writeup on how we did it. Part of the riddle is to figure out where exactly to find the flag. I was thinking maybe the pdf with the instructions on the home work has the flag in it. Is there a way to convert it to a executable format PE, so i can analyse it with IDA? If not what else can I do to find the flag if all I have is a pdf\n",
