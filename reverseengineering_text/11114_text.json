    "content": "Iâ€™m trying to write some basic ARM shell code that loads up the r0 register with 0. I cannot use null characters. I can see that\n<pre><code>subs r2, r2, r2\n</code></pre>\nsets r2 to 0 without using any null bytes.\nHowever, any attempts to move r2 to r0, results in shell code that uses null bytes. Any advice on what I could do?\n",
