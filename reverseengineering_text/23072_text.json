    "content": "I already asked this question on StackOverflow, but it is not getting attention; maybe here is a better place\nI am running the Android emulator that comes with the Android Studio software. I created an AVD based on Pixel 2. Opening the ADB shell I get:\n<pre><code>$ getprop ro.product.manufacturer\nunknown\n</code></pre>\nI would like to change the string returned as property <pre><code>ro.product.manufacturer</code></pre>, because I have an app the refuses to run on an \"unknown\" device. How can I do that?\nThe file <pre><code>config.ini</code></pre> for the AVD has a line\n<pre><code>hw.device.manufacturer=Google\n</code></pre>\nbut this does not seem to be the same thing.\n",
