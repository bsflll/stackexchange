I know that the name of these commands is slightly misleading, so <pre><code>dist-upgrade</code></pre> will not upgrade from disto version x to x+1 or so. But the package selection criteria differ. However, once you know exactly what you're trying to achieve, you can mix and match these commands as needed.\n",
