    "content": "I'm working with a 32-bit ELF binary that (I believe) has been statically linked against a few different third-party libraries. It has also been stripped, so I don't have much to go on with respect to its symbol table.\nI came across the old rsymtab tool that claims to be able to match object code from non-stripped libraries to code in your executable. It would then generate a symbol table file when it finds matches. Unfortunately, rsymtab is more than ten years old and build against a library that doesn't exist on modern Linux systems (libbfd). Is there any modern equivalent to this tool?\n(Is this even the right approach when reversing a static/stripped binary? Should the object code be expected to match exactly between the binary and the right version of the third-party lib?)\n",
