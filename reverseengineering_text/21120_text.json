            "content": "For IDA, it means this part of memory, at the address 0x004EDC58, doesn't have any types.\nIt's hard to be 100% sure with only one line of decompiled code, but I guess this code is typical from cl.exe (Microsoft C++ compiler) when it tries to inline a virtual method. To do so, it will directly check if the method (this + 8) is equal to the current method (0x004EDC58). If it's true, it will continue to the current code. Otherwise, the address of the method at <pre><code>this + 8</code></pre> is read and it jumps to this address.\nYou have different options to set a type to this memory part. Since it seems to be a pointer to something, go to this address address and type 'o' or <pre><code>Edit → Operand type → Offset → Offset (data segment)</code></pre>.\n",
