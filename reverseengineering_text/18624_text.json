    "content": "As a follow up to a self-answered question where I discovered <pre><code>-q</code></pre> and <pre><code>-Q</code></pre>\nRadare <pre><code>-Q</code></pre> is documented as,\n\n<pre><code>-Q</code></pre> quiet mode (no prompt) and quit faster (<pre><code>quickLeak=true</code></pre>)\n\n<pre><code>man radare2</code></pre> shows,\n\n<pre><code>-Q</code></pre> Same as <pre><code>-q</code></pre>, but exiting without freeing RCore, this produces leaks at exit time, but saves some precious ms to run the testsuite in fast mode.\n\nDoes not freeing RCore just mean that kernel does it for you when the processes terminates? Why would this even matter? Is there a downside to an app leaking on termination?\n",
