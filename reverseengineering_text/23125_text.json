    "content": "I've seen multiple posts about the subject, but mine is a little bit more specific about what I want to achieve.\nI have many times situations where Hex-Rays decompiler outputs 16 lines of code and I know this is a call to a inline structure function.\nSo the first step, I convert those 16 lines of code to a structure (i.e <pre><code>Matrix</code></pre>) which makes it a little bit more clear to understand what's happening\nThen I'm stuck where I want to make it show as 1 line, which will call to the underline inline structure function <pre><code>Identity()</code></pre>.\nSo those 16 lines of code:\n\nWould show as <pre><code>s_mtx.Identity()</code></pre> or maybe <pre><code>Identity(s_mtx)</code></pre>\nIs that even possible doing it within HexRays decompiler? Maybe some script I can write to do that?\nThis gets really tedious when you have a function with many matrix multiplications, vectors etc...\nMaybe @IgorSkochinsky?\nThanks a lot in advance!\n",
