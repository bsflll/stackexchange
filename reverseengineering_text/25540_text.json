    "content": "I understand that the relocation table exists for when an image isn't loaded at its preferred address, but if an image isn't loaded at its preferred address, doesn't everything need to be relocated relative to the actual load address? Isn't that the whole point of an RVA? What makes addresses that have entries in the relocation table different?\n(My first question, please point out mistakes if I made them. Thanks.)\n",
