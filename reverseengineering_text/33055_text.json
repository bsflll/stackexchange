    "content": "I recently decided to embark on the adventure of reverse engineering game save files and I am trying to modify the Eternium game data, I have tried to see similarities between the different saves but the only thing I have found is that they start with \"kdata1004\". I have tried using HxD to find values and I have been asking ChatGPT. It's probably almost impossible but I leave the files in case someone can think of something.\nThe structure i choose for the file names is as follows (the original was <pre><code>player.player.dat</code></pre>):\n<pre><code>player.player.bak<number of save>.<gems>.<gold>.dat</code></pre>\nthere can be saves in the middle of these but let's say they are in chronological order from 0 to 4.\nAs I said the files are probably encrypted or encoded with some technique so I would be interested to know if anyone knows how.\nFinally I would like to point out that although all the save files start with \"kdata1004.\" there are game files that start with \"kdata1002.\" so that must mean something.\nI leave here a link to the files and the game in stempor if you want to analyze the files on your own.\nSave files\nEternium on Steam\n",
