    "content": "I am trying to inject a jump instruction into another process (External injection), although the injection operation has been completed the address was not correct.\nFor example:\n<pre><code>unsigned int addr = 0x0048DA03;\nunsigned int jumpToAddr = 0x0048D9B2;\nunsigned char command[] = { 0xEA };\nWriteProcessMemory(hProcess, (void*)addr, (void*)command, sizeof(command), NULL); // this line for jmp\nWriteProcessMemory(hProcess, (void*)addr, (void*)jumpToAddr, sizeof(jumpToAddr), NULL); // this line for the address\n</code></pre>\nThe result:\n\nAs you see, after executing that code, the jump address is wrong.\nAlso, the same problem occurs with the following code:\n<pre><code>void* reservedMemAddress = VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, NULL, 100, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);\nif (reservedMemAddress) {\n    WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, (void*)addr, (void*)command, sizeof(command), NULL);\n    WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, (void*)addr, (void*)reservedMemAddress, sizeof(reservedMemAddress), NULL);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nHow can I write the address correctly?\nHow can I merge the two <pre><code>WriteProcessMemory</code></pre> lines into one to\nwrite the entire instruction ex:<pre><code>JMP 0x0048D9B2</code></pre>?\n",
