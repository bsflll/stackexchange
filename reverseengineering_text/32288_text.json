This is some kind of encoded file/string, possibly converted several times.\nHere's the encoded stroke - t‰„ЌЉ‚Ћ†™ќ‰ ›ќ–Ўљ§®°®¬·®»»·БАГЗЗАМНЛУТХЩЩТЬРуБЙРЪРдслТЫ\nAnd perhaps there are two different encodings broken into parts.\nFirst part - t‰„ЌЉ‚Ћ†™ќ‰ ›ќ–Ўљ§®°®¬·®»»·\nSecond part - БАГЗЗАМНЛУТХЩЩТЬРуБЙРЪРдслТЫ\nHere's what might be contained here - LS80 095116A8A881F030A7A7292E 22042022 05:34:09:52:C9:86\nPlease help me find an encryption method, I will be very grateful. I apologize right away if this is written stupidly, I'm weak in cryptography\nUPD : I found a program that processed this file. Here are the possible functions from IDA\n",

At a minimum you'd have to provide a hexdump or the Base32 (or similarly) encoded form of the data. By pasting some Cyrillic letters, you seem to have already assumed a certain encoding and removed the ability of all readers to look at raw data. Please update your question. Also, have you tried CyberChef?\n",
