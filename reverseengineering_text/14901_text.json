    "content": "My understanding is that .NET (C#) code compiles to Common Intermediate Language (CIL) code, which then (usually) gets Just-In-Time compiled to native machine code at run-time on the deployment machine in conjunction with the common language runtime.\nMy question is, how does the actual work that gets done on the deployment machine at runtime relate with standard native WinAPI calls, assuming we're talking about a Win NT deployment machine? If I were to open a .NET file in OllyDbg for example, am I going to still see system calls to ntdll and or Kernel32 showing up, coming from the JITC'd code? .NET is also occasionally said to be \"running in a virtual machine\" similar to Java Bytecode. But still, at the end of the day, must the program still leave a signature of system calls in memory, even though the binary itself may not be able to be viewed properly by IDA?\nI've been doing research into this and for example, I found this article on CryptGenRandom which is used by .NET's RNGCryptoServiceProvider . However, I've never heard of anyone using a native debugger to try to view these calls from JIT'd/interpreted/VM code.\n",

However you'll end up on having a lot of noise since you'll debug the virtual machine of the .NET runtime, losing what the original .NET code was intended to do.\nTo debug .NET code and assembly at the very same time you can use Visual Studio (provided you disable <pre><code>Just My Code</code></pre> and enable <pre><code>Allow .NET source stepping</code></pre> (or similar)).\nAlternatively, you can use WinDBG with <pre><code>sos</code></pre> (my personal choice). This way you can see the native calls of your code, and you can also inspect the .NET code.\n",
