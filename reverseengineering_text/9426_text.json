    "content": "Terminal app on OSX stores the information about its windows and content in its state files in <pre><code>Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Terminal.savedState</code></pre>.\nI did the backup of the file before the crash to be able to restore my data, but I don't know how to read it now (as Terminal refuses to use it). It starts with: <pre><code>NSCR1000</code></pre> as below:\n<pre><code>$ hexdump -Cn8 ~/Library/Saved\\ Application\\ State/com.apple.Terminal.savedState/data.data\n00000000  4e 53 43 52 31 30 30 30                           |NSCR1000|\n</code></pre>\nIt's used by <pre><code>windows.plist</code></pre> file which can be decoded by:\n<pre><code>plutil -convert xml1 -o windows.plist windows.plist\n</code></pre>\nWhat kind of method I can use to read that <pre><code>.data</code></pre> file? Or where do I start?\n<pre><code>$ strings data.data | head -10\nNSCR1000\np+5v\n0>[t\nkJX6X\n@NSCR1000\n</code></pre>\nThis file is automatically generated by Terminal app when you start and start typing something, so the terminal data is stored there.\n",

I believe i've stored/copied the needed files, but can't make sense of this seemingly easy statement: \"Quit Terminal, copy the contents of this folder from your backup, then open Terminal.\" from this SO: apple.stackexchange.com/questions/326108/â€¦ Files are copied, where do i put em? I'm using Zsh via terminal app..\n",
