    "content": "I have the following pseudocode generated by <pre><code>IDA Pro decompiler</code></pre>:\n<pre><code>__int64 *__usercall sub_155B5@<X0>(__int64 *a1@<X0>, unsigned int a2@<W1>, char **a3@<X8>)\n{\n  ...\n  result = sub_222E0((__int64 *)a3, 2 * a2, 0x20u); \n  return result;\n}\n</code></pre>\nUsing <pre><code>frida-trace</code></pre>, I could verify that <pre><code>sub_155B5</code></pre> is called for every API request. This is the command that I used:\n<pre><code>$ frida-trace -U com.app.name -a 'libname.so!0x155b5'\n</code></pre>\nTherefore, I thought I could safely assume that <pre><code>sub_222E0</code></pre> was also executed, because it's contained by <pre><code>sub_155B5</code></pre> which was obviously executed. However, it turned out that I was wrong. <pre><code>frida-trace</code></pre> failed to trace <pre><code>sub_222E0</code></pre> using the same command above.\nWhat are the possible causes for this outcome?\nThank you.\nEDIT\nHere's the declaration of <pre><code>sub_222E0</code></pre>:\n<pre><code>__int64 __fastcall sub_222E0(__int64 a1, __int64 a2, __int64 a3)\n{\n  return sub_4D2EC(*(_QWORD **)(a1 + 64), a2, a3);\n}\n</code></pre>\nAnd <pre><code>frida-trace</code></pre> does trace <pre><code>sub_4D2EC</code></pre> everytime <pre><code>sub_155B5</code></pre> is executed, but not <pre><code>sub_222E0</code></pre>.\n",
