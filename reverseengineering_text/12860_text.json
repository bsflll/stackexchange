            "content": "Yes, the <pre><code>sar</code></pre> instruction is at least similar enough to <pre><code>>></code></pre> to be valid in your code. Technically, <pre><code>sar</code></pre> is for <pre><code>shift arithmetric right</code></pre> which treats the carry/sign bit a bit different. But handling edge cases like overflow etc. can't be translated well from assembly to C anyway.\nThe question that's more interesting is \"what does this do\". In this case, the compiler is using a trick to replace an (expensive) float division by a (cheap) integer multiplication.\nFor example, calculating \n<pre><code>int something=get_an_integer_from_somewhere();\nint result=(int)((double)something/1.2345)\n</code></pre>\nis quite expensive.\nBut, since <pre><code>1/1.2345 = 0.810044552</code></pre>, this is the same as \n<pre><code>result=(int)((double)something*0.810044552)</code></pre>. \nWell, we replaced a division by a multiplication, but this is still expensive.\nHowever, we can write <pre><code>0.810044552</code></pre> as <pre><code>3479114859</code></pre>/<pre><code>4294967296</code></pre>. And <pre><code>4294967296</code></pre> \"happens\" to be 2^32. So we can rewrite the whole thing as\n<pre><code>result=something*3479114859/4294967296</code></pre>. And suddenly we don't need the floating point multiplication/division anymore; we just need an integer division, which is, in this case, very inexpensive, as it's just a shift right by 32 bits.\nAnd this is what your original C code seems to have been, which was then optimized by the compiler to not use a float division:\n<pre><code>result=input/8.619</code></pre>\nTry it with some example values.\n",
