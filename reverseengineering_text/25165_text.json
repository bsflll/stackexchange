    "content": "The Radare2 command line (I believe it's called \"interactive mode\"?) allows bringing back history and editing it with the arrow keys. However, I prefer to use vi/vim keybindings for this. How do I configure this?\nI do have a <pre><code>$HOME/.inputrc</code></pre> file which contains <pre><code>set editing-mode vi</code></pre>, and this works for many programs (presumably all that use GNU Readline or a compatible library).\nAlternatively, is there an option available to build Radare2 with Readline?\n",

            "content": "You can <pre><code>e scr.prompt.vi = true</code></pre> to enable a limited form of vi key bindings for command line editing. However, this is very limited; it's even missing basic movement commands such as f and t, and some commands such as cw do not appear to work properly. Searching with vi keybindings is unavailable; you must still use the Emacs Ctrl-R syntax to search backwards in your history. And a special warning: Enter in command mode will do nothing; you must enter insert mode and press Enter to enter the command you've just brought up or edited.\n(I found the setting by searching the configuration variables using <pre><code>e scr. ~vi</code></pre>; thanks to @blabb for mentioning this to me.)\nRadare2 uses its own command line editing code, in <pre><code>libr/cons/dietline.c</code></pre>.\n",
