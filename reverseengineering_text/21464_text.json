We know this because it gets the string as an argument (see x64 calling convention) and because the call is followed by the struct accesses, as we would expect.\nThe second call after <pre><code>0x401538</code></pre> is correctly identified as a call to <pre><code>getch</code></pre> (or possibly a wrapper function that <pre><code>jmp</code></pre>'s to the imported DLL function).\nThe call before <pre><code>0x401538</code></pre>, which is at <pre><code>0x401538</code></pre> and calls to <pre><code>0x40e760</code></pre>, is less obvious. Because it is part of <pre><code>main</code></pre> but precedes the print function, which is the first call we expect based on the known functionality of <pre><code>main</code></pre>, I suspect it is just some sort of convention with which I am unfamiliar. Look at the disassembly at <pre><code>0x40e760</code></pre>. What does that function do? Try compiling a binary with a no/different functionality. Is there always a call in <pre><code>main</code></pre> after the stack setup? Or are there always two calls for <pre><code>cout</code></pre>?\n",

The print function has to get a value to print somehow. Looking at the arguments to the function, you will eventually trace one of them back to a string, even if it is less local to the call or indirected somehow.</span>",

Debug symbols (2) is certainly a valid approach, which you might already have for free -- I don't know if OllyDbg displays them. As @bart1e suggests, another tool, such as IDA, might make this approach easier.</span>",

You should be able to find at least <pre><code>cout</code></pre> this way. To do this in <pre><code>x64dbg</code></pre>, set up the breakpoint in the <pre><code>main</code></pre> function and keep clicking <pre><code>Run</code></pre> until you see it highlighted this way (that is <pre><code>EIP</code></pre> blue arrow in the same line as your breakpoint):\n\nThen, keep clicking <pre><code>Step over</code></pre> until <pre><code>EIP</code></pre> is pointing on the first function call. Look at the console and click <pre><code>Step over</code></pre> once again. You should see that nothing happened there. Do the same thing with the subsequent function and after stepping over it, you will see the string being printed in the console.\n",
