    "content": "OK. So I am really trying to figure out how to use the \"Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual\" for myself, since it seems like the authoritative source for x86(_64) machine code.\nI am looking at a program in Ghidra (specifically, a dynamically linked .so file to the program I actually care about). File info for the .so file:\n<pre><code>ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked\n</code></pre>\nI come to the following instruction in Ghidra:\n<pre><code>ff 25 de ad be ef  --- deadbeef being a substitute for the real bytes.\n</code></pre>\nI have Ghidra set up so that I can right click on the instruction and go to the relevant page in the processor manual, which brings me to the JMP reference (p.590 in the version of the manual I have). Cool.\nFrom looking through the options there, I find the <pre><code>ff</code></pre> opcode rows that correspond to the instruction I am looking at. Further, I know that my <pre><code>ModR/M</code></pre> byte is <pre><code>25H</code></pre> which corresponds to <pre><code>MOD = 00B</code></pre>, <pre><code>REG = 100B</code></pre> and <pre><code>R/M = 101B</code></pre> so I know that this narrows it down to the <pre><code>FF /4</code></pre> rows in the <pre><code>JMP</code></pre> instruction description table. But how do I know if it is referring to <pre><code>JMP r/m16</code></pre> or <pre><code>JMP r/m32</code></pre> or <pre><code>JMP r/m64</code></pre>? Also what is the difference between those three? And further, I know from looking at tables 2-1 through 2-3 (combined with how Ghidra interprets the instruction) that <pre><code>de ad be ef</code></pre> actually ends up being a disp32 that gets added to the index. But how would I have known which table to reference in tables 2-1 to 2-3, and how does that information correspond to choosing between <pre><code>JMP r/m16</code></pre> or <pre><code>JMP r/m32</code></pre> or <pre><code>JMP r/m64</code></pre>?\n",

If mod is 11, <pre><code>r/m</code></pre> is interpreted as <pre><code>r</code></pre>, otherwise <pre><code>m</code></pre>. If the CPU were operating in 16-bit mode, only <pre><code>ff 25</code></pre> would contribute to the instruction, resulting in <pre><code>jmp [di]</code></pre> followed by four gibberish bytes. For differentiating 32/64, it depends on the operating mode -- it's probably going to be 64-bit based on your .so info and question tags.\n",
