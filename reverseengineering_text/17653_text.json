    "content": "I am reversing an x86 ELF shared object library. Perhaps because of position independence, all functions begin with loading a constant offset into a register:\n<pre><code>[... function prologue ...]\ncall    $+5\npop     eax             ; eax = eip = 0x4E2B\nadd     eax, 1009Dh     ; eax = 0x14EC8 = start of .got.plt section\nmov     byte ptr [eax+194h], 0ACh\nmov     dword ptr [eax+190h], 968CC5DEh\n[...]\n</code></pre>\nThe first two instructions set <pre><code>eax</code></pre> to the current instruction's address. Then a constant offset is added, this offset is probably calculated during linking. \nFrom there on, all addresses are referenced relative <pre><code>eax</code></pre> (in this case, they point into the <pre><code>.bss</code></pre> segment).\nI can manually calculate all addresses since the value of <pre><code>eax</code></pre> is fixed. Is there an automated way to resolve these fixed-register-offsets in IDA, such that IDA can properly resolve X-refs, etc?\n",
