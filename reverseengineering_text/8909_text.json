    "content": "I was analyzing a sample and the function <pre><code>CreateRemoteThread</code></pre> is called with <pre><code>dwCreationFlag = 0</code></pre>, so the created thread starts immediately after creation.\nOllyDbg jumps to beginning of the new thread. I analyze the new thread and at the end of that, it calls <pre><code>RtlExitUserThread</code></pre> and the thread is terminated.\nTo visualize, you can consider the following:\n<pre><code>  PUSH EAX                              ; dwCreationFlag = 0\n     .\n     .\n     .\n  CALL DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-28]           ; CreateRemoteThread\n     .\n  (lines which I would also like to analyze)\n</code></pre>\nAs I described, the new thread starts and it ends with a call to <pre><code>RtlExitUserThread</code></pre> but I would like to analyze the lines after the call to <pre><code>RtlExitUserThread</code></pre>.\nHow can I go back to the main thread, because there was a lot of lines to analyze (after the call to <pre><code>CreateRemoteThread</code></pre>)?\n",
