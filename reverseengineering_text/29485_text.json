    "content": "<pre><code>gdb-peda</code></pre> shows a very useful context each time it stops (<pre><code>b</code></pre>, <pre><code>si</code></pre>, etc.), but sometimes I don't want it.  Is there any way to quiet it so it won't show the context automatically (unless prompted <pre><code>context</code></pre>)?\n--\nUPDATE\nSince there's no out of the box answer, I'll take, for the bounty, a custom or roll-your-own solution (e.g. a script or special command).\n",

In the absence of that, we can invoke those commands manually.  Note that gdb doesn't seem to allow nested <pre><code>define</code></pre>s, so we can't script the (re)<pre><code>define</code></pre>s themselves.\n",
