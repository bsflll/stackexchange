            "content": "I had the same question.. Unfortunatly thre is no tool that can provides you the original source code. But the perfect solution that I found is to use OllyDbg or IdaPro. In this way you can navigate inside the code reading ASM lenguage.\nIf ASM is a problem for you.. IdaPro can probably help showing a sort of pseudocode, that is not exactly like the original source code, but it can give you an idea about the CodeFlow\n",

There is no solution  about this.. Because every decompiler will retrieve the code in Assembly.. If this solved your problme please check it as solved.</span>",
