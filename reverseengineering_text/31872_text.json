            "content": "I believe this information is not stored within the PDB files in any recent versions.\nMicrosoft's DIA SDK used for dumping information contained in PDB files does provide a method named <pre><code>get_virtualAddress</code></pre> (as opposed to <pre><code>get_relativeVirtualAddress</code></pre>) which should, in theory, return the real virtual address of a static symbol (segment, section, frame data etc.), however both of these methods currently return the same value (RVA) in all test cases I've tried. The implementations of two methods are different though, suggesting that there could be some use cases where the VAs are in fact stored within the data.\nKeep in mind that the PDB format dates back to 90s, so if I had to guess I'd say that the actual VA's were contained within PDB files back before ASLR was introduced. This is, of course, only speculation on my part.\n",
