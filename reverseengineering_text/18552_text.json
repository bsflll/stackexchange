    "content": "Hi I'd like to run a python command <pre><code>python -c 'print \"\\x90\"*52'</code></pre> when the program start in <pre><code>GDB</code></pre>, as I would do when I execute : <pre><code>python -c 'print \"\\x90\"*52' | ./myProg</code></pre> . Does anyone knows any way to acheive this?\nWhat I've tried so far : \n\n\n`python -c 'print \"\\x90\"*52' ` run\nrun `python -c 'print \"\\x90\"*52' `\n\nI really apologies if I'm not asking on the right StackExchange forum. Thanks.\nEDIT\nhere is a useful link I found talking about input payloads redirection : Managing inputs for payload injection?\n",
