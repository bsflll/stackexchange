    "content": "I've been playing around with RE for a bit now and a friend sent over a crackme. I figured mise well try and crack it. \nThe first thing I did was to put the executable into <pre><code>Exeinfo PE</code></pre> and there was nothing special there. So next I loaded the DLL into there and it came up with <pre><code>PEcompact ver.1.41 - v1.84</code></pre> and it said to unpack it.\nSo I found an unpacker called <pre><code>GUnPacker</code></pre> loaded it in there and it gave me <pre><code>Address : <0x0041E738> ---- Is OEP(FOEP) Possibly...</code></pre> Not sure what to do with this since I am fairly new to the whole DLL being packed.\nWhen you load the exe it gives me a ID #:<pre><code>00FF-7514-B10D</code></pre> and then it asks for a serial. I loaded the DLL into <pre><code>dllexp</code></pre> and there is a function named <pre><code>GetSerial</code></pre>. \nAlso I believe it is a VB6 exe.\nIs there any way to intercept that or something so that when I debug the program I can break when it is called and retrieve the serial?\n",
