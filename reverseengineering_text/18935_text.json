Unsurprisingly you will hardly find lawyers among this crowd and if you happened to find one, I doubt you'd get free advice. While we tend to be aware of legal implications of our actions in  jurisdictions relevant to us, advice you get from us may be severely flawed. So for example despite our saying otherwise, you may still end up being sued.\n",

If searching for legal advice you should really consult an expert in the relevant legal field instead of community-driven sites\nFirst of all, cracking a program is not the same as finding a vulnerability in it. Although cracking a program may cause financial damages to the manufacturer, it does not pose any risk to the users. Additionally, except for unique DRM-ed software and where advanced anti-theft features are in place, manufacturers do not tend to combat cracks too thoroughly, piracy is an accepted lost of revenue to some extent.\nI'll start by pointing at a relevant Israeli proverb - Peeing from the diving stand:\n\nThe statement is based on the fact that everyone knows that many pee in the swimming pool. While the general public prefers to ignore this wrongful act that it can not act against, the public will not stand in silence if someone does the same thing, peeing in the pool, from the diving stand.\n\nThis goes to say if you're doing something wrongful, which you're aware might have legal implications, you should at least do it in private and not boast about it.\nNow, for the legality of cracking a piece of software and reporting that to the manufacturer; Although this greatly depends on the laws in the country / state you live in, it is usually not illegal per say but does violate most End User License Agreements, which you're bound to by using the software. Most software EULAs explicitly forbid any type of reverse engineering of the provided software and any of it's components.\n",

This gives an attacker access to data and resources that belong to someone else. Cracking does let you use a software you're not suppose to, but does not put anyone in risk. In contrast, cracking is expected to be a cat and mouse game where the major advantage of anti-cracking is raising the bar.</span>",
