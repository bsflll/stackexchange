    "content": "I'm examining my Windows programs to determine which ones are written in Java, and if so, whether they import a log4j library affected by the log4shell vulnerability.\nPrograms that are packaged as JAR files and use the JVM to run are fairly easy to identify.\nHowever, I am less certain about <pre><code>.exe</code></pre> files. Usually these are compiled from say C++, but there are ways to compile Java code into <pre><code>.exe</code></pre> files.\nIs there a method to identify whether an <pre><code>.exe</code></pre> was written using Java? Is this method reliable?\n",

            "content": "Been a while since I went back to any Java reversing, but I seem to remember being able to use 7zip to open “Java executables” with a <pre><code>.exe</code></pre> file extension.\nMost (if not all?) <pre><code>.jar</code></pre>s have a <pre><code>META-INF</code></pre> folder within them, so this is usually a pretty easily identifiable folder to look for.\nThis could probably be automated fairly easily. You could write a script that tries to “extract” <pre><code>.exe</code></pre>s and if the base level directory contains <pre><code>META-INF</code></pre> then there is a good chance it's a packaged <pre><code>.jar</code></pre>.\nEdit for clarity:\nas 'masterX244' pointed out, I was referring to the .exe files that are essentially a Jar file with a small stub loader of an executable tacked on to the front of it (which handles all the JVM args, etc, internally).\nThe reference I have has the initial stub, and the Jar itself starts at offset <pre><code>0x12A00</code></pre> (location found via the PK magic number).\nI had not considered graalVM as suggested by 'Thorbjørn Ravn Andersen', so this only works under specific circumstances.\n",
