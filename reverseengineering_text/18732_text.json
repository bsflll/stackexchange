Well I know the kernel is missing but how can I know the correct kernel for this firmware. Has someone tried to open (emulate) a STB firmware in Qemu before? Do you think I need to create an image with bin files or emulate as rs232 flash ? \nSorry for all this questions I never used Qemu before.\n\nUPDATE #1\n\nSo i tested some differents emulators like Firmadyne and Qemu, and now i can point the *.abs is not a linux embedded firmware like dreambox, so i opened a issue ticket in the fimadyne and qemu about my issues to can do a emulation with the *.abs or *.bin files from STB Receivers like (Amiko,Openbox,Skybox,AZbox, Cryptobox,etc...). \nAnd now i just received some replies in Firmadyne Github.\nFirmadyne ticket issue about *.abs or *.bin emulation \nbecause when i tried to open binary and/or *.abs files he shows a error about extraction. \nSo here he go the issue i have in the Firmadyne\n\nTerminal OUTPUT:\n\n<pre><code>    root@ns2:/Firmware/firmadyne# ./sources/extractor/extractor.py -b Amiko -sql 127.0.0.1 -np -nk \"AMIKO_HD8150_2.4.43_emu.zip\" images\n\nroot@ns2:/Firmware/firmadyne# >> Database Image ID: 2\n\nroot@ns2:/Firmware/firmadyne/AMIKO_HD8150_2.4.43_emu.zip\nroot@ns2:>> MD5: 17c266121d5568340ef927c211fcc4f4\nroot@ns2:>> Tag: 2\nroot@ns2:>> Temp: /tmp/tmpOqzn89\nroot@ns2:>> Status: Kernel: True, Rootfs: False, Do_Kernel: False,                 root@ns2:Do_Rootfs: True\nroot@ns2:>>>> Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compressed size: root@ns2:4454941, uncompressed size: 8388608, name: AMIKO_HD8150_2.4.43_emu.abs\nroot@ns2:>> Recursing into archive ...\n\nroot@ns2:/tmp/tmpOqzn89/_AMIKO_HD8150_2.4.43_emu.zip.extracted/rlz_notes.txt\n        root@ns2:>> MD5: aa5c7dd374bf981442deb5fa67e7189e\n        root@ns2:>> Skipping: text/plain...\n\nroot@ns2:/tmp/tmpOqzn89/_AMIKO_HD8150_2.4.43_emu.zip.extracted/AMIKO_HD8150_2.4.43_emu.abs\n        root@ns2:>> MD5: dc6b86caa2c55d18a43ca9ad9053bc77\n        root@ns2:>> Tag: 2\n        root@ns2:>> Temp: /tmp/tmpBNDrbm\n        root@ns2:>> Status: Kernel: True, Rootfs: False, Do_Kernel: False,                 root@ns2:Do_Rootfs: True\n        root@ns2:>> Recursing into archive ...\n        **root@ns2:>>>> Extraction failed!**\n        root@ns2:>>>> LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x6C, dictionary size: root@ns2:8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: 11883876 bytes\n        root@ns2:>> Recursing into compressed ...\n</code></pre>\nAND A LOT OF OTHER MESSAGES ABOVE\nSo after this issue i opened a issue ticket in Gihub and they told me this *.abs or *.bin files is not a linux embedded device so i googled again about qemu to emulate non linux-embedded device and i found a other ask/question in Stackexchange talking about Unicorn Framework. so i going to test Unicorn Framework to check if the answer is here. \nPost about Emulating Non-Linux Embedded device.\nI found the bootloader generic code here.\nso if anybody have news or something to help me to go to the right way thanks you to give me answers.\nRegards,\n",

            "content": "Unfortunately QEMU is not well suited for your use case. As explained in your addendum, it is mostly used to emulate embedded Linux systems, that’s why there are many assumptions in its code: that the kernel is a Linux kernel (i.e. an ELF file) and the disk image contains a Linux rootfs. In addition, the specific hardware configurations (“machines”) emulated by QEMU are mostly limited to those that are supported by Linux. That does not mean that it can’t emulate non-Linux systems or hardware not supported by Linux, but to support anything unusual or non-mainstream you’ll probably have to do some coding, either to add support for your specific hardware or for the firmware layout you have so that QEMU can emulate it properly using the framework that already exists inside the code. However, using unmodified QEMU build is likely not enough for your use case. If you want to try your hand at extending QEMU I’d recommend you to contact the developers, e.g. on their mailing list for concrete recommendations. I’m afraid such work is outside of scope of this site so I’m finishing my answer here.\n",
