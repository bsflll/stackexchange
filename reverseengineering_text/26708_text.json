This can contain code or data and is governed by the PAGED_CODE macro, among others, at source code level.\nThat is, whatever gets stored in that section cannot be accessed at arbitrary IRQLs. Quote:\n\nIf the IRQL > APC_LEVEL, the PAGED_CODE macro causes the system to ASSERT.\n\nAlso see this for an entry point into the overall topic. But I reckon given the specific nature of your question you are aware of paged and nonpaged pool and so on.\n",
