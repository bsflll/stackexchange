    "content": "IDA's default x86 assembly syntax is not very clear about pointer dereferences. One of these is dereferencing the memory operand, and one is simply moving the address to the register:\n<pre><code>mov     ecx, offset dword_130B78\nmov     eax, off_130AF8\n</code></pre>\nYou can improve this slightly by selecting <pre><code>Borland TASM in Ideal Mode</code></pre> in Options > General > Analysis > Target Assembler:\n<pre><code>mov     eax, [off_130AF8]\n</code></pre>\nBut what I would like is to make it even less ambiguous by always displaying the size qualifier with <pre><code>ptr</code></pre>:\n<pre><code>mov     eax, dword ptr [off_130AF8]\n</code></pre>\nIs there a way to force IDA to do this? It does it in some cases but not others, and I'd like it to always do it.\n",

As a reverse engineer you really have to filter through a lot of information and adding this would distract from the important stuff, because the information is right there anyway. You can tell from the target operand what the size of the source must be, so there's no need for <pre><code>dword ptr</code></pre>. Things are different with something like <pre><code>movzx   eax, word ptr [eax+esi*2]</code></pre> where the source gets zero-expanded into the target. And then it's not evident whether it's a single or two byte source ...\n",

What I want is to make it clearer that the pointer is being dereferenced, which as you can see from the first two instruction example can be unclear in IDA’s syntax. It’s really only a problem with x86 (as opposed to RISC machines) because mov can move between both registers and memory.\n",

I have the issue the other way around, since I rarely read RISC assembly. But once you become accustomed to it, it's no issue.\n",

This pretty much happens when the size of data referenced by the operand is wrong, but can also happen since multiple instruction may access the memory address differently.\nSo, (technically) you can force IDA to display the size for each instruction operand by undefining all the data referenced by that operand that you're looking at. This literally undoes all the work that you and IDA did...but hey, why not?\nI wrote some IDAPython to do this pretty quickly for the current function. Hopefully you find it effective.\n<pre><code>for ea in idautils.FuncItems(ADDRESS):\n    for xr in idautils.XrefsFrom(ea):\n        if not xr.iscode:\n            idaapi.del_items(xr.to)\n        continue\n    continue\n</code></pre>\nOr better yet, if you want to \"fix\" your entire database:\n<pre><code>for sidx in range(idaapi.get_segm_qty()):\n    s = idaapi.getnseg(sidx)\n    for ea in idautils.Heads(s.start_ea, s.end_ea):\n        if idaapi.get_flags(s.start_ea) & idaapi.MS_CLS == idaapi.FF_DATA:\n            idaapi.del_items(ea)\n        continue\n    continue\n</code></pre>\n",
