    "content": "I try to extra the nt!_object_type of notepad.exe process. But seems like it's empty. Is it some process has no object type?\n\nCorrection for my screenshot above for using the EPROCESS address to extract TypeIndex instead of using the header of the process object.\nThis time I got the right, first I determine that the <pre><code>TypeIndex</code></pre> of process object belonging to the notepad is <pre><code>0x98</code></pre>.\nBy plugging the value <pre><code>0x98</code></pre> into the <pre><code>ObTypeIndexTable</code></pre>, I am seeing empty structure.\nAny idea why? Below is the updated screenshot.\n",
