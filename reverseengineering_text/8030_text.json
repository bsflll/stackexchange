They appear in the middle of subroutines and I believe don't serve alignment purposes. I am curious about the origins of this construct.\nThe program was packed, so I am not sure if call-nop pair was there initially or appeared after unpacking.\n",

Jumping to aligned targets is normally preferable both for better i-cache utilization and for better BTB predictions:\n\n11.5 Alignment of code\nMost microprocessors fetch code in aligned 16-byte or 32-byte blocks. \nIf an important subroutine entry or jump\n  label happens to be near the end of a 16-byte block then the\n  microprocessor will only get a few useful bytes of code when fetching\n  that block of code. It may have to fetch the next 16 bytes too before\n  it can decode the first instructions after the label. This can be\n  avoided by aligning important subroutine entries and loop entries by\n  16. \nAligning by 8 will assure that at least 8 bytes of code can be loaded with the first instruction fetch, which may be sufficient if\n  the instructions are small. \nWe may align subroutine entries by the\n  cache line size (typically 64 bytes) if the subroutine is part of a\n  critical hot spot and the preceding code is unlikely to be executed in\n  the same context.\n\nhttp://agner.org/optimize/optimizing_assembly.pdf#page=86\nThis would make that NOP just a padding to align the following instructions. As pointed out elsewhere, adding padding for this must be done carefully because adding padding blindly is likely to lead to worse i-cache usage and therefore a decrease in performance. Always measure.\n\nnote: in other architectures (i.e. not x86/x86-64) NOPs after calls are sometimes required; since the question is about x86-64 this shouldn't apply.\n",
