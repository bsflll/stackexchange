    "content": "I'm reversing a windows x86 binary that I can't figure out how the program is getting the keyboard input.\nI've searched for the windows api functions I was used to but the program doesn't call them.\nSo... Is there a function that every different method to get the keyboard input calls? If not, what should I do in order to discover how a given program gets the keyboard input?\n",
