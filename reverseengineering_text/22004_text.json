You can do this online or use a simple Python module like hashlib to hash things on your own.\nUsing both the online program and a simple python3 script I wrote, <pre><code>20030130</code></pre> doesn't match any of the hashes listed (instead producing the hash <pre><code>8fbaf5a8fedcebe1214b6fd23bec5db357ba4f6323630a1d59ffe86d948f0b81</code></pre>). There is a good chance a salt could be being used, which means the hashes would have a different word prepended that makes cracking a hash more difficult.\n",
