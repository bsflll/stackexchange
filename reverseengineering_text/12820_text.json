    "content": "I'm trying to unpack a binary packed with <pre><code>aspack</code></pre> I loadded it into ollydbg 1.0 with ollydump tool. I setup hardware breakpoint at <pre><code>ECX</code></pre> and then I step over it and it is stopping at this statement: MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EDI],EBX I bypassed it by shift+F8 but it keeps giving access violation error multiple times. How can I proceed further in UnPacking Binary. Binary is working fine when executed without debugger.\n",
