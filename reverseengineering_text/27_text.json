    "content": "I have several Solaris 2.6 era drivers I would like to reverse engineer.\nI have a Sparc disassembler which provides some info but it isn't maintained anymore so I think it may not give me all the information possible.\nThe drivers are for an Sbus graphics accelerator I own. Namely the ZX aka Leo one of the early 3d accelerators.\nSo what are some ways I can go about reverse engineering this driver? I can disassemble it but I am not sure what to make of the output. I also have Solaris of course so perhaps there are things I can do there as well.\nThe final goal is to have enough information to design a driver for an Operating System. There are drivers for NetBSD, although incomplete as the hardware documentation that does exist (isn't free to access) does not have the Window ID encoding as it is missing. Also, since the hardware uses an Sbus interface on a double wide mezzanine card, it would be impractical to use it on anything but a SparcStation or early UltraSparc machine.\n",

            "content": "Well, since it's a Solaris driver, first you need to find up some docs on how Solaris drivers communicate with the kernel (or kernel with them). A quick search turned up this:\n\n<pre><code>_init()</code></pre> initializes a loadable module. It is called before any other routine in a loadable module. <pre><code>_init()</code></pre> returns the value returned by\n  <pre><code>mod_install(9F)</code></pre> . The module may optionally perform some other work\n  before the <pre><code>mod_install(9F)</code></pre> call is performed. If the module has done\n  some setup before the <pre><code>mod_install(9F)</code></pre> function is called, then it\n  should be prepared to undo that setup if <pre><code>mod_install(9F)</code></pre> returns an\n  error.\n<pre><code>_info()</code></pre> returns information about a loadable module. <pre><code>_info()</code></pre> returns the value returned by <pre><code>mod_info(9F)</code></pre>. \n<pre><code>_fini()</code></pre> prepares a loadable module for unloading. It is called when the system wants to unload a module. If the module determines that it\n  can be unloaded, then <pre><code>_fini()</code></pre> returns the value returned by\n  <pre><code>mod_remove(9F)</code></pre>. Upon successful return from <pre><code>_fini()</code></pre> no other routine\n  in the module will be called before <pre><code>_init()</code></pre> is called.\n\nThere's a nice code sample below.\nThis guide also seems relevant.\nOnce you found the entry points, it's just a matter of following the calls and pointers. \nHere's how it looks in IDA:\n<pre><code>.text:00000000 _init:                                  !

End of function _init\n</code></pre>\nAt 0x60 you can see <pre><code>mod_install</code></pre> being called with a pointer to <pre><code>modlinkage</code></pre>, so you can follow there and see what the fields are pointing to.\nBut you don't even have to do that all the time. In this case, the programmers very thoughtfully left intact all the symbols and debug output. This should help you in your work :)\nDepending on situation, you may skip straight to the helpfully-named functions like <pre><code>leo_blit_sync_start</code></pre> or <pre><code>leo_init_ramdac</code></pre>. I personally prefer the first way, top-down, but to each his own.\nEDIT: one rather simple thing you can do is to patch the <pre><code>leo_debug</code></pre> variable at the start of <pre><code>.data</code></pre> section to 5 or so. That should produce a lot of debug output about the operations the driver is performing.\n",
