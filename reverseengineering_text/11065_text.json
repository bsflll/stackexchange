    "content": "I am developing a dynamic instrumentation tool using Intel PIN to analyze malware binaries in windows. From what I have learned so far is that I am able to use the tool with programs I write using C/C++.\nMy question is that, will the tool developed using PIN and C/C++, work fine for binaries developed in other languages? Or are there any special care I needed to be taken to analyze binaries developed in other languages?\n",
