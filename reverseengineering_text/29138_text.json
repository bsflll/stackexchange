    "content": "I have the code below, derived from the reversed function in the original application:\n<pre><code>gladius::world::World::create(*(gladius::world::World**)(*(char*)(this + 0x5e8) + 0x50));\n</code></pre>\nThe create function looks like this:\n<pre><code>void __thiscall gladius::world::World::create(World *this) {\n</code></pre>\nCould someone please describe the way the function is setup and may be simplify the notation above if possible?\nSo, this is a create function call, which takes as an argument the pointer to a particular address.\n\nHow the pointer address is calculated in this case?\nWhat is the exact meaning of (this + 0x5e8) + 0x50 - 0x5e8 offset to this and then 12th element of the structure (i.e. structure of 4 bytes - address 48? )\nWhat 0x5e8 represents in this case (apart of being an offset, I mean what this offset could possibly point to)?\n\nThis is how it looks further in the code:\n<pre><code>    this_01 = GUI::getWorld(*(GUI **)(this + 0x88));\n    gladius::world::World::create(this_01);\n</code></pre>\nwhere <pre><code>GUI::getWorld(*(GUI **)(this + 0x88));</code></pre> points to the following function:\n<pre><code>World * __thiscall gladius::gui::GUI::getWorld(GUI *this)\n\n{\n  return *(World **)(*(longlong *)(this + 0x5e8) + 0x50);\n}\n</code></pre>\nThis is where the address (this + 0x5e8) + 0x50) came from.\nI still don't understand the significance of these addresses, as create is a member function of World and it is called with an instance of that class as a parameter?\nAnd the address of that instance is stored in class GUI on the address: (this + 0x5e8) + 0x50)?\nOr I am confusing the above and this + 0x5e8 points to some structure in the World class, which must be somewhere at 58/4 or at 58/8 address and then within that structure I am looking at 50/4 member?\n",
