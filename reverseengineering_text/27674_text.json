    "content": "In short, I have a code that gets an input via stdin. Once it has the input string in memory, it verifies its integrity by calling a function for every condition, and <pre><code>exit</code></pre>ing the program if those conditions are not met.\nThere are 20 of those verifications, and I do not think it is efficient to reverse it manually considering the first is (according to Ghidra disassemblying), being <pre><code>param1 = (long) input;</code></pre> and <pre><code>input</code></pre> = the 32-byte array in which the input is stored,\n<pre><code>void verify1(long param_1){\n    if ((int)*(char *)(param_1 + 4) * (int)*(char *)(param_1 + 0xf) - (int)*(char *)(param_1 + 0xd) !=\n      0x349f) {\n        exit(-1);\n      }\n    return;\n}\n</code></pre>\nI think a program or plugin to automate this would be useful. However, I could not find anything useful at all.\n",
