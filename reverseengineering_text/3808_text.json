            "content": "Just about all the major tools will take source files / directories and produce namespace (a Package), class and interface definitions, attributes, properties, and operation signatures. For a variety of languages.\nHowever, not all dependencies nor all relationships between classes will be discovered as operation definition bodies are not parsed, thus Activity model of an operation cannot be derived ( nor its Activity Diagram ).\nMicrosoft in Visual Studio 2010 ( I believe, through to 2015 ) included an Operation to Sequence Diagram generator for any operation selected in the editor. It has since been dropped, probably due to it being restricted to managed languages.\nTo derive State Machine model / diagram would also need to be cognitive of the coding convention originally employed in the source to be meaningful.  Perhaps this is an area that Machine Learning might have impact.\nCollaboration Diagrams have been dropped from UML.\nI'm suprised that parsing op bodies has not been up taken by vendors, EA, MagicDraw, not even Eclipse Papyrus for Java.\nHope that helps,\nRegards\n",
