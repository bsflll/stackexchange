The target and host machine are Windows.\nI can run the process on the remote machine and debug it with IDA using remote debugging but I need that the process will run with high privileges.\nIn IDA I only have the option start the process (<pre><code>F9</code></pre> or the green play button) but it doesn't run it with high privileges.\nHow can I do it?\nI searched also in the options of the debugger and didn't see such option.\n",

I checked on Procmon and when I run it with privileges local on the system it call <code>RegSetValue</code> for some keys while with the remove debugging it doesn't happen although now it runs with <code>High</code> integrity. Oh, maybe it identify when I use the debugger.. I will need to check it.</span>",
