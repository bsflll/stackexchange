    "content": "I would like to automate a process of enabling buttons with <pre><code>cond bp</code></pre>.\nFirst, I found that function <pre><code>user32.EnableWindow</code></pre> is called from <pre><code>mfc110u.dll</code></pre>.\nSo I went there and set <pre><code>cond bp</code></pre> on the second arg of the function. \nThis <pre><code>arg2==0</code></pre> when you want the button to be disabled and <pre><code>arg2==1</code></pre> when enabled.\nSo what I did ?\n\nI set <pre><code>cond bp</code></pre> with condition <pre><code>[EBP+8]==0</code></pre> and now want to run something like this each time the bp is hit:\nA (EBP+8) DD 1. \nI downloaded the plugin <pre><code>CLBPlus!</code></pre> and for this plugin is identifier CLBP so final command become: CLBP A (EBP+8) DD 1.\n\nBut for some reason this does not work. Maybe the command A is not implemented. I downloaded the two another plugins \"Command Line v1.10\" and \"Command Bar v3.20.110\" but unfortunately I do not know the identifiers for these plugings.\nSo any ideas ?\n",

            "content": "Thanx Jason for the tip. I tried it before but it did not work. Now I tried it again and hopefuly it seems working. In olly command line when I wrote A (EBP+8) DD 1 I saw it worked. The syntax for script is asm eip, \"mov eax, ecx\", so I tried to write asm (ebp+8), \"dd 1\", but did not work. So I tried asm ebp+8, \"dd 1\" and it seems working. I put conditional breakpoints manualy and constructed this nice dirty code:\nSTART:\nasm ebp+8, \"dd 1\"\nrun\njmp START\nit works nicely. Thanx for the tip again\"!\n",
