    "content": "After reading a number of blog posts, forums, and watching tutorials I figured I would start learning to reverse software the old fashion way.  Creating simple C files and looking at their disassembly.  In my quest to truly understand reversing, I thought also comparing optimized and unoptimized code would be beneficial.  While looking through I came across a couple lines of code that appear to do nothing.\nI would love if someone can explain what the \"mov\"[es] in the unoptimized code is doing.  All of these were disassembled using Hopper v4.\nC Code:\n<pre><code> #include <stdio.h>\n\n int main(int arg, char** arg) {\n    printf(\"Hello World!\n\");\n    return 0;\n }\n</code></pre>\nUnoptimized Code (gcc -m32) :\n<pre><code>; Variables:\n        ;    arg_4: 12\n        ;    arg_0: 8\n        ;    var_4: -4\n        ;    var_8: -8\n        ;    var_C: -12\n        ;    var_10: -16\n        ;    var_18: -24\npush       ebp\nmov        ebp, esp\nsub        esp, 0x18\ncall       _main+11\npop        eax                            ; CODE XREF=_main+6\n\n-- What purpose do these moves serve? --\nmov        ecx, dword [ebp+arg_4]\nmov        edx, dword [ebp+arg_0]\n--                                    --\nlea        eax, dword [eax-0x1f5b+0x1fa6] ; \"Hello World!\\\n\"\n-- And what do these moves also serve? --\nmov        dword [ebp+var_4], 0x0\nmov        dword [ebp+var_8], edx\nmov        dword [ebp+var_C], ecx\n--                                    --\nmov        dword [esp+0x18+var_18], eax  ; method imp___symbol_stub__printf\ncall       imp___symbol_stub__printf\nxor        ecx, ecx                           \nmov        dword [ebp+var_10], eax\nmov        eax, ecx                                    \nadd        esp, 0x18                           \npop        ebp\nret\n</code></pre>\nOptimized Code (gcc -m32 -O3):\n<pre><code>push       ebp\nmov        ebp, esp\nsub        esp, 0x8\ncall       _main+11\npop        eax                             ; CODE XREF=_main+6\nlea        eax, dword [eax-0x1f6b+0x1f9e]  ; \"Hello World!\"\nmov        dword [esp+0x8+var_8], eax      ; \"%s\" for imp___symbol_stub__puts\ncall       imp___symbol_stub__puts\nxor        eax, eax\nadd        esp, 0x8\npop        eep\nret\n</code></pre>\n",

            "content": "First of all, I would advise you to read about the SystemV ABI for i386 and amd64. You can find the documents here:\n\nSystem V i386 ABI\nSystem V amd64 ABI\n\nThese documents define as precisely as possible how a compiler coder should translate some C/C++ code into i386/amd64 assembly code for a Unix-like system. \nThey are extremely important documents and you should refer to it as often as possible because they contain a lot of answers for most of your questions.\nNow, back to your original question, in your case the main differences between the two codes is that <pre><code>gcc</code></pre> has optimized data movements in the memory as we will see.\nFirst code snippet\n<pre><code>-- What purpose do these moves serve? --\nmov        ecx, dword [ebp+arg_4]\nmov        edx, dword [ebp+arg_0]\n--                                    --\n</code></pre>\nHere, <pre><code>ecx</code></pre> and <pre><code>edx</code></pre> are loaded with the arguments of <pre><code>main</code></pre> (very likely <pre><code>argc</code></pre> and <pre><code>argv</code></pre>).\nNote that, none of <pre><code>argc</code></pre> and <pre><code>argv</code></pre> are of any use in the <pre><code>main()</code></pre> function. But, the compiler does not know about it because it did not performed dead-code/dead-variables analysis at this level of optimization. Of course, this code will be removed when the appropriate analysis will be performed.\nSecond code snippet\n<pre><code>-- And what do these moves also serve? --\nmov        dword [ebp+var_4], 0x0\nmov        dword [ebp+var_8], edx\nmov        dword [ebp+var_C], ecx\n--                                    --\n</code></pre>\nHere, the program seems to store the arguments in the local memory frame (below <pre><code>ebp</code></pre>). Note that the arguments are above <pre><code>ebp</code></pre> and the automatic variables below (we say automatic variable for the variable which are within the function's scope).\nOf course, these data movements are totally unnecessary, but the compiler just apply a default template for starting a function which transfer a copy of the arguments in the local memory stack-frame. And, once again, when the compiler realize that these variables are of no use, then these moves will disappear.\n",
