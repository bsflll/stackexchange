    "content": "I know that kernel modules are practically part of the kernel since it gets loaded inside it. But I am not sure if it really gets all privileges the system has. Can it read/write code inside the kernel without segfaults, etc.? I want to use kernel module for unwinding the stack to kernel level to backtrace every function my program calls.\n",

Regarding if you can have segfaults on your module the response is yes, you can crash the kernel if your module is not written properly\n",
