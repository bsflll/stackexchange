    "content": "I want to debug an application which when opened, it will open a fork from it.\ne.g. program.exe will run 2 program.exe in the task manager\nthe software is EMS SQL Management Studio for PostgreSQL\nwhen I try to attach debugger to the first .exe file (trial Wizard) a Message Box shows as follows:\n\nThe debugger could not attach the selected process. This can perhaps\n  indicate the process was just terminated, that you don't have the\n  necessary privileges..\n\nI can attach the debugeer to the second .exe (Main Program Window) file. But it is useless.\nI think my problem is that one of them is the parent process and the other is the child process. Can I know how to open the child process alone (maybe inspect arguments) so I can attach debugger to it.\n\nMy Question: How can attach debugger to the application trial wizard??\nIn case of debugger protection, can I break it or skip it to be able to debug or unpack?\n",

            "content": "Depending on what you try to achieve, you can try to attach WinDbg in noninvasive mode: F6 -> select the process and select noninvasive mode down on left.\nOther suggestion is, to patch the executable on disk at the entery point, which you can locate for example by using CFF explorer with the infinite jump : 0xEB 0xFE. After you finish with the patch, just execute it and attach the debugger and restore the initial bytes back. You can continue from here to do what ever you want. As to bypassing debugger protection, there are plenty of plugins for debugger to help you: for OllyDbg - OllyExt, aadp and regarding Windbg\nIf Tls calls are present (you can also check it using CFF explorer) which will be executed before the entery point code, you can patch them too, and try to attach debugger too.\n\nTo debug child processes, you can use procmon to inspect the whole flow and get the information regarding the parameter that the child processes are executed with. Or, you can breakpoint on CreateProcessA(W) or similar and go from there.\nHxD could be used as a hex editor for the above.\n",
