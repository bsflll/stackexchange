            "content": "radare2 is not a source level debugger, thus there is no support for STABS. That said, you can always use <pre><code>gdb</code></pre> as a backend for radare2 either by connecting radare2 to a running <pre><code>gdb</code></pre> session or by using the <pre><code>gdbserver</code></pre>.\n\nradare2 allows remote debugging over the gdb remote protocol. So you\n  can run a gdbserver and connect to it with radare2 for remote\n  debugging. The syntax for connecting is:\n\n<pre><code>$ r2 -d gdb://<host>:<port>\n</code></pre>\n",
