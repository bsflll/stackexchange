    "content": "I have a script written to work with Ghidra. I am doing some analysis in the script and save the results in a file. Right now, I am passing the name when a prompt ask the file name to save upon running the script. Though this is ok for one, I need to run this script in more than 100 objects at once(using the headless analyzer) and I want the file name to automatically taken from the object name. How could I do this?\nFor example, let's say I have an object file called <pre><code>mqtt.o</code></pre>. I need to take this name (<pre><code>mqtt</code></pre>) while saving the file which contains the results. I looked through the API, but still could not find a way to get the name of the object of analysis. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.\n",
