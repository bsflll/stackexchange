    "content": "I know that pointer to the security cookie in Load Configuration Directory is 4 bytes long for 32-bit exe and 8 bytes long for 64-bit one (source), but what is the size of the security cookie itself?\nEdit: the accepted answer links to a long article, here's the quote from it:\n\nWhen /GS is specified, the compiler automatically links the object file built from gs_cookie.c source file. This file defines __security_cookie as a 64-bit or 32-bit global variable of the type uintptr_t on x64 and x86, respectively.\n\nAnd since I can't find any official source for gs_cookie.c online here's the important part, which also shows the default values:\n<pre><code>#ifdef _WIN64\n#define DEFAULT_SECURITY_COOKIE ((UINT_PTR)0x00002B992DDFA232)\n#else  /* _WIN64 */\n#define DEFAULT_SECURITY_COOKIE ((UINT_PTR)0xBB40E64E)\n#endif  /* _WIN64 */\n\nUINT_PTR __security_cookie = DEFAULT_SECURITY_COOKIE;\n</code></pre>\nAnd just for completeness the documentation for <pre><code>UINT_PTR</code></pre> shows it's just <pre><code>int</code></pre> for 32-bit and <pre><code>__int64</code></pre> for 64-bit (both unsigned).\n",
