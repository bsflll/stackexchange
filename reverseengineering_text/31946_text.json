    "content": "I have a USB device from a vendor (TRENDnet) that has the exact same chipset as a QNAP device with an available firmware patching tool.\nIt's my belief that this firmware patching tool should work perfectly fine with my TRENDnet device.\nHowever, when I run the firmware patching tool, it reports that it cannot find a suitable device and exits.\nI believe the firmware patching tool is looking for specific USB <pre><code>VIDs</code></pre> and <pre><code>PIDs</code></pre> to detect\nvalid USB devices. I've extracted from the drivers that these are the valid <pre><code>VID/PID</code></pre> combinations.\n<pre><code>VID_2ECA - PID_C101\nVID_2ECA - PID_C102\nVID_0B95 - PID_2790\nVID_0B95 - PID_2791\nVID_1C04 - PID_0015\nVID_1C04 - PID_0016\n</code></pre>\nI would like to see if it's possible to inject additional <pre><code>PID/VID</code></pre> values into the tool to allow my device to be detected and have the firmware upgraded.\nI've tried searching for the various <pre><code>VID/PID</code></pre> combos in a hex editor to no avail, and have also tried to decompile the app using IDA Free with no success (mainly because I have no idea what I am doing).\nCan someone either look at the file or offer some advice of what to do look for/try next?\nThe firmware patching tool can be downloaded from this link.\nThe tool is named <pre><code>aqusbupdate.exe</code></pre> and it reads in <pre><code>QNAP_QNA-UC5G1T_FW_3.1.6.bin</code></pre> when passed in as an argument.\n",
