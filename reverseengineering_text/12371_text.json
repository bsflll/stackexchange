    "content": "I'm pretty new to this stuff, so please excuse me if anything I ask is kinda stupid.\nI'm trying to inject a DLL into a QT application and call some of the QT functions. I got the injection working with notepad.exe or explorer.exe, but everything else I tried (Spotify, some QT apps, skype, ...) wont show my messagebox, although the injection intself doesn't throw any errors.\nHere's the code of my injector program:\n<pre><code>#include \"stdafx.h\"\n#include \"windows.h\"\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\nchar const path[] = \"C:\\\\InjectedDll.dll\";\n\nvoid setDebugPrivilege()\n{\n    HANDLE hToken;\n    TOKEN_PRIVILEGES privileges;\n    privileges.PrivilegeCount = 1;\n    privileges.Privileges[0].Attributes = SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED;\n\n    if (!OpenProcessToken(GetCurrentProcess(), TOKEN_ADJUST_PRIVILEGES | TOKEN_QUERY, &hToken))\n    {\n        std::cout << \"Failed to open process.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n    if (!LookupPrivilegeValue(0, SE_DEBUG_NAME, &privileges.Privileges[0].Luid))\n    {\n        std::cout << \"Failed to look up privileges.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n    if (!AdjustTokenPrivileges(hToken, false, &privileges, sizeof(privileges), 0, 0))\n    {\n        std::cout << \"Failed to adjust token privileges.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n    CloseHandle(hToken);\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv)\n{\n    setDebugPrivilege();\n\n    HWND hWnd;\n    hWnd = FindWindowA(0, \"Spotify\");\n    if (!hWnd) {\n        std::cout << \"Could not find editor window.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    DWORD pId;\n    GetWindowThreadProcessId(hWnd, &pId);\n    if (!pId) {\n        std::cout << \"Could not find process id.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    HANDLE hProcess;\n    hProcess = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, false, pId);\n    if (!hProcess) {\n        std::cout << \"Failed to open process.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    HANDLE allocatedAddress;\n    allocatedAddress = VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, 0, sizeof(path), MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);\n\n    WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, (void*)allocatedAddress, (void*)path, sizeof(path), 0);\n\n    HANDLE hRemoteThread;\n    hRemoteThread = CreateRemoteThread(hProcess, 0, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandleA(\"kernel32.dll\"), \"LoadLibraryA\"), allocatedAddress, 0, 0);\n    if (!hRemoteThread) {\n        std::cout << \"Failed to create remote thread: \" << GetLastError() << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    WaitForSingleObject(hRemoteThread, INFINITE);\n    VirtualFreeEx(hProcess, allocatedAddress, sizeof(path), MEM_DECOMMIT);\n    CloseHandle(hProcess);\n\n    system(\"Pause\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\nAnd here is my basic DLL.h:\n<pre><code>#pragma once\n#include \"windows.h\"\n\n#ifdef INJECTEDDLL_EXPORTS\n    #define INJECTED_DLL_API __declspec(dllexport)\n#else\n    #define INJECTED_DLL_API __declspec(dllimport)\n#endif\n\nINJECTED_DLL_API LRESULT CALLBACK newWndProc(HWND hWnd, UINT msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam);\nINJECTED_DLL_API DWORD WINAPI creation();\nINJECTED_DLL_API int WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, DWORD reason, LPVOID reserved);\n</code></pre>\nAnd DLL.cpp:\n<pre><code>#include \"injected_dll.h\"\n\nDWORD WINAPI creation()\n{\n    MessageBoxW(HWND_DESKTOP, L\"Failed to subclass window.\", L\"Noez!\", MB_OK);\n    return TRUE;\n}\n\nint WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, DWORD reason, LPVOID reserved)\n{\n    if (reason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)\n    {\n        CreateThread(0, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)creation, 0, 0, 0);\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n</code></pre>\nSo can anyone tell me why this isn't working? I tried both, using MessageBoxA(..) and MessageBoxW(..) and just MessageBox(..), they all worked on notepad.exe, but none worked on the other programs.\n",

I'm compiling the DLL and the injector 64bit, so this should work even with 32bit applications, shouldn't it? EDIT: okay this was in fact the problem, sorry that this didn't come to my mind earlier, I thought 64bit > 32bit works, only the other way around doesn't. Now, lets say I want to support injection into both platforms, how would I do that? Is there no way around offering two seperate .exes and .dlls then?\n",
