Unloading a plugin might happen at different occasions depending on the value returned by your <pre><code>init(self)</code></pre> method when the plugin was loaded.\nYou should note the plugin may be loaded and unloaded several times during the execution of a single IDA instance, though. For example a plugin may be loaded once when IDA first starts without a loaded binary, and then be unloaded and reloaded when a binary is loaded (either an IDB or a binary loaded and analyzed for the first time).\n",
