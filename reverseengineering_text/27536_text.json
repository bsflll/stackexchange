    "content": "I am working on an IDAPython script that is supposed to fix the disassembly of a firmware, by resolving it's symbol table.\nThe core of the script is working fine, but I have some issue when it comes to editing the way IDA is displaying stuff in the disassembly panel.\nThe idea is the following:\nI have an original instruction like:\n<pre><code>LDR          R1,=0xAAAAAAAA\n</code></pre>\nAfter the execution of my script, the offset 0xAAAAAAAA is resolved into it's current value, let's say 0xBBBBBBBB, and it adds a comment next to the original instruction:\n<pre><code>LDR          R1,=0xAAAAAAAA ; symbol_address=0xBBBBBBBB, symbol_value='DummyString'\n</code></pre>\nBut since I'm only adding a comment, I'm loosing the xRefs to and from the strings.\nWhat i want to achieve is to edit the instruction itself, so IDA can create the xRefs to the Strings. Something like:\n<pre><code>LDR          R1,=aDummyString \n</code></pre>\nI used this snippet to edit the operand address, which is working:\n<pre><code>create_strlit(resolved_addr, 0, STRTYPE_C) # Defined the resolved string's addr as a proper string\nnew_inst = original_ins.replace(hex(original_addr), hex(resolved_addr))  # Simplified for clarity\nset_manual_insn(addr, new_inst)            # Edit the instruction with the new resolved addr\n</code></pre>\nBut my disassembly view does not make the link between the address and the string itself.\n<pre><code>LDR          R1,=0xBBBBBBBB\n</code></pre>\nWhen i hover my cursor on 0xBBBBBBBB, i can see the correct string; When I click on this address, IDA takes me to the string's location. But it has not created any proper xRefs, and the display does not inform me that this is a string location.\nI tried theses functions to turn the operand into a string reference, but without success:\n<pre><code>op_plain_offset(addr, 1, 0)\nop_offset(addr, 1, REF_OFF32)    # I also tried REF_OFF8 and REF_OFF16, just in case\n</code></pre>\nBut it does not update the disassembly view as I want.\nAnd when i try to do it by hand by doing \"right click\" -> \"Enter the current operand manually\", it works fine :/\nAny suggestion how to do that ?\nThanks\n",
