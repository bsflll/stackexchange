    "content": "While reversing a bootloader, i have a lot of msr/mrs instructions, but i cannot find in the arm documentation the meaning of the parameters.\nFor example in IDA i have things like :\n<pre><code>MSR             #4, c6, c0, #4, X0\n</code></pre>\nor\n<pre><code>MSR             #5, #0\n</code></pre>\nCould someone explain how to parse these instructions and point me to the right documentation ?\nMaybe there is a script or plugin to automate the process ?\n",

            "content": "The presence of X0 and the use of MSR to access a system register tells me that you are on 64-bit ARM / ARMv8.\nThe reference manual for this architecture can be found here\nSection C6 describes the instructions.  You can find <pre><code>MSR (register)</code></pre> at C6.2.131 and <pre><code>MSR (immediate)</code></pre> at C6.2.130. These both access system control registers.\nSection D7 describes the generic ARMv8 system control registers. In D7.2.34 you can find the information that your <pre><code>MSR</code></pre> instruction is accessing the <pre><code>HPFAR_EL2</code></pre> register which contains the \"Hypervisor IPA Fault Address.\"  (see the table at the bottom of the section that shows the values of op0/op1/CRn/Cm/op2 that correspond to this register.)\nThe two instructions you show above are therefore -\n<pre><code>MSR HPFAR_EL2, X0</code></pre>\n<pre><code>MSR PSTATEField_SP, #0</code></pre>\n",
