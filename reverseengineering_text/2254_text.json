    "content": "I have a challenge compiled in C# .net 4.0. I can see the source completely fine in Reflector. I'd like to change the source. I guess I do this by patching some bytes in the binary.\nThe problem I'm facing is when loading the binary in Ildasm.exe I cannot convert these ID_xxxx addresses to RVA or find their corresponding bytes in CFF Explorer. What is the typical way to patch a .net exe in this fashion? I read some of lena's tutorials so normally I'd load it in Olly, and I tried this but I cannot see any useful code and most actions seem to happen in various Windows .dll's and not in the .exe itself. \nI would most appreciative if someone could give advice or point me to a tutorial. Thank you.\n",

We will start by loading the executable (File->Open). Once done : dump it (File->Dump). Ildasm respond with a nice dialog full of checkboxes, since we want as much information as it's possible, check everything!\nNow let's have a look at our disassembled IL instructions, fire up your preferred editor and open the previously generated dump. We are especially interested in the <pre><code>if</code></pre> statement since it controls if the supplied password is correct; note that you can easly spot it using the generated comments.\n<pre><code>//000009:             if (args.Length > 0 && args[0] == \"Secret\")\nIL_0001:  /* 02   |                  */ ldarg.0\nIL_0002:  /* 8E   |                  */ ldlen\nIL_0003:  /* 69   |                  */ conv.i4\nIL_0004:  /* 16   |                  */ ldc.i4.0\nIL_0005:  /* 31   | 12               */ ble.s      IL_0019\nIL_0007:  /* 02   |                  */ ldarg.0\nIL_0008:  /* 16   |                  */ ldc.i4.0\nIL_0009:  /* 9A   |                  */ ldelem.ref\nIL_000a:  /* 72   | (70)000001       */ ldstr      \"Secret\" /* 70000001 */\nIL_000f:  /* 28   | (0A)000011       */ call       bool [mscorlib/*23000001*/]System.String/*01000013*/::op_Equality(string, string) /* 0A000011 */\nIL_0014:  /* 16   |                  */ ldc.i4.0\nIL_0015:  /* FE01 |                  */ ceq\nIL_0017:  /* 2B   | 01               */ br.s       IL_001a\nIL_0019:  /* 17   |                  */ ldc.i4.1\nIL_001a:  /* 00   |                  */ nop\nIL_001b:  /* 0A   |                  */ stloc.0\nIL_001c:  /* 06   |                  */ ldloc.0\nIL_001d:  /* 2D   | 08               */ brtrue.s   IL_0027\n</code></pre>\nI let to the reader the task to reverse and analyse the instructions. We will continue by looking at the last one. Long story short : if the first argument isn't the string <pre><code>\"Secret\"</code></pre> we will take the branch and end up at <pre><code>IL_0027</code></pre> : \n<pre><code>IL_0027:  /* 28   | (06)000003       */ call       void ReversingMSIL101.Program/*02000002*/::Anonymous() /* 06000003 */\n</code></pre>\nPretty bad heh? So we will simply tweak a bit that last instruction, moreover by replacing it by <pre><code>brfalse.s</code></pre> :\n<pre><code>IL_001d:  /* 2B   | 08               */ brfalse.s   IL_0027\n</code></pre>\nAnd that's it, we are done! Save the file and open a shell, navigate to the folder containing the IL dump and issue <pre><code>ilasm ReversingMSIL101.il</code></pre> inorder to reassemble the dump into an executable!\nNow it's the time to verify our work :\n<pre><code>C:\\Users\\dna\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2012\\Projects\\ReversingMSIL101\\ReversingMSIL101\\bin\\Debug>ReversingMSIL101.exe IdoNotKnow\nGold for the people!\n</code></pre>\n",

I ended up using the bytecode charts at <a href=\"http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/dot-net-reverse-engineering-part-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">resources.infosecinstitute.com/â€¦</a>. From there, it's an odd scheme but you can rebuilt the sequences of bytes displayed in ILDasm.exe and search for them in a hex editor and change them, but if they aren't changed to an acceptable byte it messes up the program. Still never got the call to nop out properly and will continue searching. Crazy how in these .net programs you can just view the bare source code!!</span>",

I don't like this intermediary language so much.

Dumping something, changing it and \"recompiling\" is error-prone, especially in obfuscated assemblies and so on.\nI would suggest you download Reflexil, it's a Reflector plugin: you can see the IL of the functions you're viewing through Reflector, change whatever you need to change in a very simple way and then just save the modified exe. This is much much less error-prone, since you're not dumping and rebuilding the program from scratch. Also, you can inject anything into the assembly this way, be it classes, new methods, structures.\n",
