I have a deep interest in both and want to become expert in both of them.But I wonder if it is possible for a human to be able to be expert in multiple fields? Are there people who are very good in RE and in Pentesting? some people told me to stop chasing multiple fields because I wouldn't be able to become expert.\nWhat do you think?\nThanks in advance.\n",

Although both reversing and pentesting may seem manageable at first, you'll notice that they run deep on some topics.\nedit: Nontheless, I'm voting to close this topic because its mainly opinion based. No one can make this decision for you. You could try reddit for other opinions.\n",
