    "content": "So this is from some \"Reversing with Lena\" tutorial series on how to start out with reverse engineering and OllyDbg. (Found here https://tuts4you.com/download.php?view.124) It's a bit old but should still work fine I believe.\nPart 1 and 2 worked just fine, but when I try to load the Binary of Part 3 into OllyDbg it complains about a corrupt breakpoint and the assembly shown doesn't look like the assembly in the tutorial at all.\nWhen I choose \"Select module => RegisterMe\" in the context menu it looks like it should. However it still doesn't really run (even when I do \"New origin here\" it only runs a view lines before the same thing happens.\nIt kind of just does nothing anymore, OllyDbg says \"Running\", the assembly either goes blank (when I didn't change origin) or shows some RtlAllocateHeap function.\nAlso there are Access violation errors and exceptions I have to tell it to pass to the program.\nThe log: http://pastebin.com/mCV7Pkxh My only idea is that maybe BitDefender has something to do with it. But it didn't block anything and tried to turn it off too.\n",
