    "content": "If I change any character in the firmware file and try to flash it, it will failed. But it will successfully flashed if I changed the string with the same number of character if it's not a function.\nAfter further searching, I found out about the checksum and that in order to flash the custom firmware, you need to calculate it and modify it in the firmware.\nThis is the firmware:\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/ok2c0qodao5fld1/Nokia_215_4G_readed_test.pac/file\nI use HxD to read the file.\nIf I search for checksum, I got some results ->\n\nAlso, I searched for sha ->\n\nSo here, I tried to change <pre><code>==</code></pre> with <pre><code>!=</code></pre> and also I changed it to <pre><code>1 == 1</code></pre> but, It always failed to flash\nI am lost. I don't know what to search for or from where to start.\nI hope that someone could help me out!\nNote: I can provide access to my PC to try the flash tool (nokia tool v0.060 using easybox) and maybe debugging in the phone.\n",
