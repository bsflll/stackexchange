    "content": "So i have written a python tool using capstone that disassembles the code section of a ELF binary using capstone.\nnow i want to also create and show the call-graph of this binary in a dot format, I tried googling but couldn't find how to do this with capstone or if its possible with it or not, i also heard about some other frameworks like radare2 and such but I'm still not sure which framework is good for this purpose \nso what do you guys suggest? how can i make the call-graph by using some framework in my own code? ( i don't want a tool for this, i already know there are tools/programs for this out there, and i dont want to copy their code for this i want to write my own) \nis it even possible with static analysis, meaning just by reading the file? considering some function calls might be indirect? ( i only need to do this using call and ret instructions)\n",

However, if you want to make it on realtime or on a fancy UI I will suggest you use networkx (https://networkx.github.io/)\n",
