    "content": "I find that I can write to memory as\n\n[addr] = value\n\nAs given by the documentation at http://help.x64dbg.com/en/latest/introduction/Input.html\nAnd while I could work around my problem as dividing the string into several byte writes, that looks kind of ugly! Every character would be:\n\nbyte:[addr] = charactercode\n\nI have not found any way except for manually entering into the memory editor to write a string/unicode string into memory. Am I missing something or is this really basic feature missing from X64dbg ?\nIn case there is another workaround.\nThe problem I am trying to solve is I want to set a value for GetEnvironmentVariable() for a variable that does not exist by writing a string into the buffer. I want this to happen when a breakpoint is reached by breakpoint commands.\nSo basically if there was any way to force setting environment variable or write a string into memory when a breakpoint is hit. I could work with that!\n",

Since I have you here :-) Would features like this make it into master if I were to submit a PR at some time in feature? Been meaning to have a look at the x64dbg source as well. I usually prefer to extend base program functionality over plugins as I always forget which plugins I need but the base program is always there.\n",
