    "content": "Ghidra uses <pre><code>.cspec</code></pre> files like <pre><code>x86win.cspec</code></pre> to define compiler related information, which are imported in the <pre><code>.ldef</code></pre> files like <pre><code>x86.ldef</code></pre> that define a processor language.\nHow can I add a new <pre><code>CompilerSpec</code></pre> via a <pre><code>.cspec</code></pre> file to Ghidra without editing the existing <pre><code>.ldef</code></pre> file which is inherently part of the Ghidra core, but also without adding a new processor (with a new <pre><code>.ldef</code></pre> file)? This should also work with <pre><code>analyzeHeadless</code></pre>, so no just adding it in the GUI.\nThis will probably end up requiring an extension which isn't an issue, I just don't know where to either put the file so it gets automatically loaded, or which API functions to call as part of the extension initialization to add the new <pre><code>CompilerSpec</code></pre>. The classes that implement the <pre><code>CompilerSpec</code></pre> interface have public constructors, that take the <pre><code>.cspec</code></pre> file as a parameter, but this doesn't look like it will be automatically added then after just creating an instance of it.\n",

            "content": "It's not possible currently (Ghidra 9.2.2) to do what you're asking.  Each processor is identified by a 4-tuple of architecture, endianness, size, and variant.  You can only specify an ID once.  So unfortunately, you can't just add another .ldefs file somewhere and \"open up\" the language (internal name for a processor) to add new compiler spec entries and .cspec files.  This is a limitation of the way Processors are loaded by the SleighLanguageProvider.\nAside:  I'm assuming what you want to do is, for instance, add a new compiler spec to x86:LE:32:default so that it shows up in the list along with clang, gcc and Visual Studio.\nThe best you can do right now is add an Extension with a new processor that has the same architecture, endianness and size, but a different variant name.  This might have serious ramifications for future official Processor upgrades though; you'd probably have to watch the version numbers carefully and duplicate the .trans files if any.\nYou might want to consider making your changes directly in the Processor directory, and sharing your additions with the official team.\n",

If you want to e.g. define a callfixup that tells the decompiler to treat some function as a <pre><code>NOP</code></pre> if called, you can write a file like this:\n<pre><code><callfixup name=\"objc_retain\">\n    <target name=\"_objc_retain\"/>\n    <target name=\"_objc_retainAutorelease\"/>\n    <pcode>\n      <body><![CDATA[\n      x0 = x0;\n     ]]></body>\n    </pcode>\n  </callfixup>\n</code></pre>\nIt seems like you can only define one extension per file, and can't import multiple files at once. Though at least in my case the actual replacement is often the same, just for different functions, so you can just add multiple targets.\n",
