    "content": "OK, so basically I want to re-use the content from dumped <pre><code>.rodata</code></pre> <pre><code>data</code></pre> and <pre><code>bss</code></pre> section from ELF on Linux 32bit.\nThe dump command:\n<pre><code>objdump -s -j .text elf_binary\nobjdump -s -j .rodata elf_binary\nobjdump -s -j .data elf_binary\n</code></pre>\nand for the <pre><code>.bss</code></pre> section, I am preparing to re-use a bunch of <pre><code>00000000</code></pre> which has the same size of the <pre><code>bss</code></pre> section.\nIt works fine when I re-use it in <pre><code>nasm</code></pre> assembler in this way.\n<pre><code>.section rodata\nS_label1: db 0x01\n         db 0x02\n         ....  \n.section data\n        db 0x01\nS_label2:  db 0x02\n         ....\n.section bss\nS_label3: db 0x00\n         db 0x00\n         ....\n\nnasm -f elf test.s\n</code></pre>\nBut basically my question is that:\nhow to re-use these dumped sections in <pre><code>gas</code></pre> asssembler?\nBasically <pre><code>gas</code></pre> has a different assemble style, and apparently the data sections representations are different...\nI tried for several times and I still can not find the solution..\nDid I clearly demonstrate my question..? Could anyone give me some help?\n=======update==========\nSo basically I want to re-use the <pre><code>rodata</code></pre> <pre><code>data</code></pre> and <pre><code>bss</code></pre> sections dumped from another binary.\nFor example, here is the content of <pre><code>rodata</code></pre> section\n<pre><code>03000000 01000200 0a0a556e 736f7274\n65642061 72726179 2069733a 20200020\n25642000 0a0a536f 72746564 20617272\n61792069 733a2020 00\n</code></pre>\nand I can re-use it in this way:\n<pre><code>label1: \ndb 0x03\ndb 0x00\ndb 0x00\ndb 0x00\nlabel2: \ndb 0x01\ndb 0x00\ndb 0x02\ndb 0x00\n.....\n\nmov eax, label1      // of course I will guarantee that I use it correctly\n....\n</code></pre>\nBasically in <pre><code>nasm</code></pre>, I can easily re-use them in the above way, but my question is that , how can I re-use it in <pre><code>gas</code></pre> (or directly use <pre><code>gcc</code></pre>) in a similiar way?\nIs it possible?\n",

            "content": "As an assembly programmer I would say that <pre><code>gas</code></pre> is rarely used to assemble external code. The task of calling <pre><code>gas</code></pre> is usually left to the compiler, and most of the assembly that <pre><code>gas</code></pre> has to handle in real life is either <pre><code>inlined</code></pre> inside <pre><code>C</code></pre> or <pre><code>C++</code></pre> code or comes from a compiler. But, I believe this document by Dean Elsner, Jay Fenlanson & friends is by far the best reference I managed to rely on for quite sometime. It has been updated many times and it covers the 2.19.51 version.\nThe easy way would be to use GCC I would say :\n<pre><code>  //Just to avoid make a point :]\n  typedef unsigned char byte;\n\n  //\n  byte lbl1[] = { 0x03, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, ... }, \n       lbl2[] = { 0x01, 0x00, 0x02, 0x00, ... };\n\n  //I prefer Intel syntax rather than AT&T, it's somehow cleaner !\n  __asm__(\"intel_syntax noprefix                 ;\"\n          \"mov eax, %0                           ;\"\n          \"mov ebx, %1                           ;\"\n          \"att_syntax prefix                     ;\"\n          :                        //output\n          : \"r\" (lbl1), \"r\" (lbl2) //input\n          : \"%eax\", \"%ebx\");       //clobber\n</code></pre>\nWell, this is a nice way if you want to concentrate on the assembly code (which is how I do it when I optimize code by hand). \nNow, let me explain it a bit. First, you have two arrays containing the retrieved data, nothing fancy. Then you get the assembly code. If you're not familiar with <pre><code>inlined</code></pre> assembly I would recommend you this link, though I'll briefly go over my code.\nThe <pre><code>__asm__</code></pre> directive lets you insert assembly instructions anywhere in a code. At first I tell the assembler that I'll be using Intel's syntax (no % prefix for registers, ...), then I move the content of the register %0 in <pre><code>eax</code></pre>, and then the content of %1 in <pre><code>ebx</code></pre> (%0 is the pointer for lbl1, %1 is the pointer for lbl2). Then, I switch to AT&T syntax for the rest of the parameters. After the first : you can specify output variables. After the second : you can specify inputs. In here I passed lbl1 & lbl2 and I used \"r\" to let the compiler handle register allocation. You can specify the registers if you know what you're doing. After the last : you have to declare the registers used inside the code so that the compiler frees them & uses them for the remaining code generation steps.\n",

Especially if data is mixed up with instructions (shellcodes for example). You should trust none of tools you're using blindly, cross-reference their output if you want to efficient. Each one has its flaws &amp; its strengths. I can assure you that using <code>NASM</code> with <code>GNU</code> tools wouldn't affect your work, though it your final choice. And, using multiple tools is a good way to learn.</span>",

Yes, I know the difference in disassemble algorithm, so actually in the  current project, I was trying to use <code>IDAPro</code> because it is believed the best, however, even though it is an excellent tool, I still find some un-match between the goal we want to achieve and <code>IDAPro</code> can support (disassemble binary for analysis).</span>",
