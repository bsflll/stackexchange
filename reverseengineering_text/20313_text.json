    "content": "Introduction\nSo I have a peer to peer app that allows customers to request jobs at their own price and have the job fulfilled by a freelancer in the community. The common jobs requested as of recent are home improvement gigs and lawn care things. We plan on releasing a new feature that allows customers to request groceries through the app to be delivered to them as well. \nSummary of The Problem\nThe grocery company we are using has open source documentation for parts of their api, however some of the documentation is missing components we need to successfully integrate the feature into our app. So for the missing components I have reverse engineered some components of the software that aren't included within the public documentation and plan on integrating it into our app. I haven't fully finished the reverse engineering, as I am a quarter of the way done but: \n\nWhat legal implications does this hold?\nIf it is unlawful, what is the severity of the repercussions? \nHow long can I utilize this reverse engineering software before being\ncaught?\nWill I the implementer of the software be held accountable, or would\nthe company be accountable on my behalf?\n\nThanks in advance.\n",

Consider checking law for the first one (and possibly the second) of your questions. Keep in mind that any answer will be specific to the jurisdictions in which you act. Third one is pure guess work and not a good fit for Q&A. That said, for interoperability purposes RCE is often allowed.\n",

Do they explicitly prohibit/allow all/some parts of the API?\nis the API you're using internal or merely undocumented?\ndepending on the country/jurisdiction you might not be able to use the results of RE. It can be questionable how much of an RE it is to guess the API endpoint.\ncontact the grocery API authors, maybe they're planning a public API for the features you need or maybe they can point you in the right direction without the need to call their private API.\ntalk to a lawyer. I don't want to make assumptions when I can end up with a fine or in jail.\n\nAs @Amirag mentioned the private API might be very unstable and if they break the compatibility your users will suffer blaming your app. And most likely leave a negative review and uninstall it.\n",
