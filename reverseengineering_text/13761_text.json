This provides a prebuilt package and shows how to properly install it, together with additional scripts you seem to be using.\nIt is not too clear from your question, but it might be the case that the missing package is <pre><code>pydbg</code></pre>, depends on how I interpret your text.\nIf that's the case, the second aforementioned link also describes how <pre><code>pydbg</code></pre> can be installed, and additionally google is your friend.\nIf these links does not work, providing the output of <pre><code>pip freeze</code></pre> will be a good start of additional info.\n",

I deleted everything and followed the steps in the second link you posted and it worked! Must have been the old pydasm.pyd file that came with pydbg.</span>",
