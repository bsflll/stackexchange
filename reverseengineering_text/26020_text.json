If you want more information about <pre><code>execve()</code></pre> then you can simply type <pre><code>man execve</code></pre> from your shell. It will come from section 2 of man where all the system calls are. To summarize, it will set up a stack for you, and push onto it <pre><code>argc</code></pre>, <pre><code>argv</code></pre>, and <pre><code>envp</code></pre>. The file descriptions 0, 1, and 2, (<pre><code>stdin</code></pre>, <pre><code>stdout</code></pre>, <pre><code>stderr</code></pre>), are left to whatever the shell set them to. The loader does much work for you setting up your relocations, and as we'll see much later, calling your preinitializers. When everything is ready, control is handed to your program by calling <pre><code>_start()</code></pre>.\n",
