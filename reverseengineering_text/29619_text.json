    "content": "I have read Flash memory and analyze with <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre> and find out Squashfs that I can extract with <pre><code>dd</code></pre> and open with <pre><code>unsquashfs</code></pre> .\nWhen I open this FS I want to add some file into this FS and edit some shell script then pack this squashfs again and put it back into flash system.\nThe problem is :when I pack again the squashfs it bigger then the original fs. Then I can't put it exactly in the location into flash memory because it's overlap the next partition in FS.\nWhat can I do please?\n",
