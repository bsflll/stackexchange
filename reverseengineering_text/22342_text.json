I see this having 2 possible meanings:\n\nYou want to return to where the function was called from. You may be able to do this by patching that instruction with a <pre><code>ret</code></pre> or <pre><code>jmp</code></pre>, making sure things line up.\nYou want the program to execute the next instruction immediately following the <pre><code>call exit</code></pre>. In this case, you want that instruction to have no effect, so \"no-operation\". Thus, <pre><code>nop</code></pre>.\n",

            "content": "If this is the entire function, it seems you would want to nullify it. Make it just not call <pre><code>exit()</code></pre>.\nYou could do that by simply replacing the <pre><code>call _exit</code></pre> instruction with multiple <pre><code>nop</code></pre> opcodes. In IDA, you'll need to use the patch program feature Under the <pre><code>edit-> patch bytes</code></pre> sub-menu (Notice that in older versions of IDA you had to manually turn it on before it was available, this is no longer the case, though). \nYou could either <pre><code>nop</code></pre> the <pre><code>call</code></pre> instruction, the entire function (both <pre><code>call</code></pre> and <pre><code>xor</code></pre>) or even completely remove the <pre><code>call loc_BA060</code></pre> that leads to the function at <pre><code>0xBA060</code></pre>.\nyour mileage may vary, however, depending on the surrounding code. It may be the case the prior to the call (and the following <pre><code>exit()</code></pre>), eax contained a meaningful value that is used further down the code execution line. If that's the case and you leave the <pre><code>xor eax, eax</code></pre> instruction intact, you'll only avoid the <pre><code>exit()</code></pre> to hit a crash. It's therefore important to review the code surrounding the instruction you wish to remove.\nAdditionally, in this specific case, <pre><code>exit()</code></pre> is a no-return-function. This means the compiler is not required to make sure code following the <pre><code>exit()</code></pre> call will function properly because it is never expected to execute and <pre><code>_exit</code></pre> is not expected to return. You may wish to make sure you modify the code in a way that handles that well, although that behavior depends on the compiler and optimizations used.\n",
