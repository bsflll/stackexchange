I've seen this done before using <pre><code>gdb</code></pre> but haven't had any luck doing this on windows. I've tried disassembling executable in free version of IDA but structures tab doesn't show any classes.\nEDIT:\nI found this tool, but it only works for <pre><code>C</code></pre> structs: https://github.com/wbenny/pdbex\n",
