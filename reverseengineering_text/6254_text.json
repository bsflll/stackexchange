    "content": "When I load most windows NE/PE executables, IDA first warns me about the file being possibly packed, then it warns me with this dialog: \"The input file has extra information at the end (tail < hex >, loaded < hex >), continue?\". It loads the file, but only shows the \"This program cannot be run in DOS mode.\" DOS stub and that's it. No import/export tables, structs, etc. \nHow can I force IDA to recognize the PE header and load that instead of the DOS stub?\n",
