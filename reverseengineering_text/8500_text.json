What I mean is; the application requests a site, the site returns a huge base64-encoded string and then the .sys file is built via this string.\nI'm intrigued and interested (for educational purposes) as to how I could go about building the .sys file via the string I have.\nAny guidance is appreciated,\nCheers.\n",

However, i'd like to add that this only works if the file is <i>just</i> the base64 decoded string; it might be encrypted/randomized some more, in which case your file will be nothing but garbage, and you'd have to break that extra encryption.</span>",

Once you convert it back to binary, you get the original file you are looking for. There is nothing extra involved.
