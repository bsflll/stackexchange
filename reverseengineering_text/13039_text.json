It's just not what I am good at. I have an old windows3.1 tts engine called Keynote Gold multimedia application that I would like to decompile and make work on a modern computer system and also on android. If I send someone the dll files could you take a look and see if it can be done, please?\n",

QEMU probably the best option.\nPorting Windows software the way you're suggesting is generally too painful to be realistic, and virtualization provides almost perfect results with little effort.\nIf it is just a DLL it might be more realistic than a full software package, depending on how complex the code is. Still a lot of work, and if you want it to run on Android you still have to emulate it somehow. Payoff/work ratio very low imho.\n",
