This is similar to step, but function calls that appear within\n  the line of code are executed without stopping. Execution stops when\n  control reaches a different line of code at the original stack level\n  that was executing when you gave the next command. This command is\n  abbreviated n.\nAn argument count is a repeat count, as for step.\nThe next command only stops at the first instruction of a source line.\n  This prevents multiple stops that could otherwise occur in switch\n  statements, for loops, etc.\n",
