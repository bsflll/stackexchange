You can change the target compiler/architecture or the flags being passed to the compiler, or add multiple panes with other compilers. Are you familar with x86? The <a href=\"https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-sdm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Intel Software Developer Manuals</a> are a verbose reference, but you can probably find briefer summaries. I'm not familiar with tools that will automatically do the conversion for you.</span>",
