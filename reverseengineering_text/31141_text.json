    "content": "So let's say we have the following code:\n<pre><code>0: lea rax, [rbp+8]\n1: mov rcx, rax\n2: mov rdx, 5\n3: call my_fun\n</code></pre>\ni want to get the actual argument of the my_fun call, which would be the <pre><code>[rbp+8]</code></pre> local var in this case.\nI tried getting the addresses of the arguments with:\n<pre><code>addrs = idaapi.get_arg_addrs(3)\n</code></pre>\nbut that returns the address of <pre><code>mov rcx, rax</code></pre>. From that i would need something like the use-definition chain on rax, which i couldn't find if supported by ida.\nmy ultimate goal is to cast all the arguments to my_fun calls to a specific type.\nso here, i want to change the type of the local var [ebp+8] to another type\n",
