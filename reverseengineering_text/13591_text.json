    "content": "I'm trying to emulate a snippet of ARM assembly I have in IDA pro using QEMU. However I do not understand the output of the program.\nWhen I start debugging the firmware, windows pop up for QEMU.\nHowever all the data in IDA turns into zeros, as can be seen in the picture below.\nWhy is this happening?\nIs this normal behavior of the program?\n\nOther information:\n\nWindows 8.1\nIDA 6.8\nQEMU 2.7.0 (32 bit) from http://qemu.weilnetz.de/\n\nthe binary I am trying to emulate is for a device with:\n\narmv7-m architecture\n\nthe gdb debug configuration command line is:\n<pre><code>\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\qemu/qemu-system-arm\" -S -gdb tcp::%p,ipv4 -kernel \"%e\" -M versatilepb -cpu cortex-a8\n</code></pre>\nThe initial SP is 0x20000000\nand the memory map looks like this\n",
