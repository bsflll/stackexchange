    "content": "I want to launch IDA debugger for one 64-bit exe file and it fails, have tried with more samples, but result always the same. \nHere is that I do.\n\nLaunch <pre><code>IDA Pro (64-bit)</code></pre>\nSelect <pre><code>Debugger</code></pre> -> <pre><code>Run</code></pre> -> <pre><code>Local Windows Debugger</code></pre> from top menu.\nSelect my file.  and click <pre><code>OK</code></pre>.\nAt this point getting such prompt.  and click <pre><code>Yes</code></pre>.\nFinally got such error: \nAnd after that this-one: \n\nIt happens all the time, have tried it on a few different VMs on my actual machine. I'm using full version of IDA v6.7.141229.\nI believe something has to be configured, as the last error says something about wrong parameters, can someone advice?\n",

So, \"Run -> local windows debugger\" is wrong. Start the win64_remotex64 server manually, then have IDA connect to it.\n",

Once the debugger is running, you can connect to it \"remotely\" and debug. You can check this tutorial for more specific details.\n",

            "content": "I write this mostly for myself as I'm tired of going thru this over and over again. Here's how you can debug x64 processes on a local machine with IDA Pro:\n(1) Create a .bat file with the following:\n<pre><code>\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA 6.5\\dbgsrv\\win64_remotex64\" -Pnh8sy261\n</code></pre>\nin this case it's the location of <pre><code>win64_remotex64</code></pre> or remote debugger and <pre><code>nh8sy261</code></pre> is just some random password. You pick it. Make sure though not to put any spaces after the <pre><code>-P</code></pre> parameter and the password.\n(2) Run batch file from (1) as admin.\n(3) Open 64-bit version of IDA Pro as admin. (File <pre><code>\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA 6.5\\idaq64.exe\"</code></pre>)\n(4) Pick <pre><code>Go</code></pre> to work on your own. Then in the blank IDA Pro window, in the menu go to <pre><code>Debugger -> Run -> Remote Windows debugger</code></pre>. Then in the <pre><code>Application</code></pre> pick your application with the <pre><code>...</code></pre> button. Specify debuggee parameters and directory, if needed. Then in the <pre><code>Hostname</code></pre> add <pre><code>127.0.0.1</code></pre>, port as <pre><code>23946</code></pre> and password as what you typed above in the batch file:\n\nYou can also check to <pre><code>Save network settings as default</code></pre> for later access. Then click OK.\n(5) At this point the debugger should load the <pre><code>debuggee</code></pre> process and you should be able to step through it.\n",
