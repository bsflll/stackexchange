    "content": "I have an APK that has assemblies in a single blob file. I could extract them successfully using decompress-assemblies.\nIs there anyway I can compress them again into assemblies.blob file or at least modify the APK to allow loading the the extracted DLL like older Xamarin APKs?\nI seem to have found that the application checks for application_config.have_assembly_store value, if it's true, it only continues if there's an assembly blob. Any idea how to change this value inside the APK?\n",
