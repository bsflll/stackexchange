The specific way that you're searching for is called Stack Telescoping and you can print it like this:\n<pre><code>pxr @ esp\n</code></pre>\nUse <pre><code>sp</code></pre>, <pre><code>esp</code></pre>, and <pre><code>rsp</code></pre> according to your system.  \n<pre><code>pxr</code></pre> stands for Print heXadecimal References, you can see its description by using <pre><code>px?</code></pre>: \n<pre><code>[0x7f8a672ee4]> px?\n<...truncated...>\npxr[j]            show words with references to flags and code\n</code></pre>\nHere are some other options to print the stack using radare2:\n\n<pre><code>pxa @ rsp</code></pre> - to show annotated hexdump\n<pre><code>pxw @ rsp</code></pre> - to show hexadecimal words dump (32bit)\n<pre><code>pxq @ rsp</code></pre> - to show hexadecimal quad-words dump (64bit)\n<pre><code>ad@r:SP</code></pre> - to analyze the stack data\n",

If you want a view similar to PEDA's you can use <code>e dbg.slow = true</code> and then use <code>Vpp</code>. That's way you'll see a Visual Mode as well as Stack Telescoping.</span>",
