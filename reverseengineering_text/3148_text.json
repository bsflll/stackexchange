    "content": "I read that question here (How do you set registers as structs within a function in IDA?) but this applies only to individual lines.\nIs it possible to set a register as a basepointer for a scope so that all usages of this register will be using the structure you assigned it to?\n<pre><code>mov     eax, [ebx+C]\nxor     [ebx+1C], eax\nmov     eax, [ebx+24]\nxor     [ebx+68], eax\nmov     eax, [ebx+C]\nxor     [ebx+30], eax\nmov     eax, [ebx+24]\nxor     [ebx+48], eax\n...\n</code></pre>\nOr do you have to apply <pre><code>T</code></pre> on each occurence individually?\n",

The dialog shown will allow you to select the register, the offset delta to add to the displacement, and the struct you want to apply.\nThe dialog does some preparation work/struct analysis before showing up. If you have a large selection or a lot of structures it can take a while to appear, you just need to be patient. When you change the register/delta inside the dialog, the analysis needs to be updated, which again takes time. Placing the selection cursor over an occurrence of the register you want to change before calling up the dialog is a good idea.\n",
