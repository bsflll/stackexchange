What does <pre><code>$r</code></pre> do in that? It's also not explained in <pre><code>pd?</code></pre>\n",

            "content": "<pre><code>$r</code></pre> is one of the variables available in radare2. More specifically, <pre><code>$r</code></pre> is a variable which holds the height of the console. This command is shown on Visual Disassembly mode (<pre><code>Vp</code></pre>) and usually is not executed by the user. The command is used by the mode in order to show N instructions from the binary where N is the height of the console (number of lines). This provides the user with a better, and more interactive, reverse engineering experience.\nTo show the full list of variables you can use the command <pre><code>?$?</code></pre>. Here is a truncated list:\n<pre><code>[0x000008cc]> ?$?\nUsage: ?v [$.]\n| flag          offset of flag\n| $$            here (current virtual seek)\n| $$$           current non-temporary virtual seek\n| $?            last comparison value\n| $alias=value  alias commands (simple macros)\n| $b            block size\n...\n| $c,$r         get width and height of terminal\n...\n| $l            opcode length\n| $m            opcode memory reference (e.g. mov eax,[0x10] => 0x10)\n| $M            map address (lowest map address)\n| $MM           map size (lowest map address)\n| $o            here (current disk io offset)\n| $p            getpid()\n| $P            pid of children (only in debug)\n| $s            file size\n| $S            section offset\n| $SS           section size\n...\n| ${ev}         get value of eval config variable\n| $r            get console height\n| $r{reg}       get value of named register\n| $k{kv}        get value of an sdb query value\n| $s{flag}      get size of flag\n...\n</code></pre>\n",
