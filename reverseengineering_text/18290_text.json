Understand that it's taking the value of <pre><code>eax</code></pre> in hex then shifting it to the right by <pre><code>6</code></pre> and the same for the next operation by <pre><code>0x1f</code></pre>. See what the end result is, but still looking to better understand what's happening with these Shift Operations.\nSay eax was <pre><code>0x3338e3e0</code></pre>, how exactly does it get to <pre><code>0x00cce38f</code></pre> step by step?\n",
