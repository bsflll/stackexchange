I found something on the radare2 github \n\n\"These ptrace (PT_ATTACH): Operation not permitted messages seem to\n  happen because of subsequent PT_ATTACH calls to the same pid, even\n  though it is already attached. This should be fixed, but it probably\n  shouldn't cause any major issues right now.\" ~thestr4ng3r\n\nIn my case i also did some mistake with radare2 (i forgot to analyse <pre><code>aaa</code></pre>), thats the reason it \"didnt work\". I ignored this message, proceeded and solved this beginner crackme.\n",
