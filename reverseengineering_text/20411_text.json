    "content": "How can I set a conditional breakpoint based on the argument of a function?\nI am trying to break on the windows function <pre><code>LoadLibraryExW</code></pre>: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibraryexw\nI want to break on this function only when the first argument (<pre><code>lpLibFileName</code></pre>) is equal to <pre><code>L\"Test.dll\"</code></pre>. When I break on the function I can see that <pre><code>L\"Test.dll\"</code></pre> is <pre><code>esp+4</code></pre>.\nI've tried a few different variations without success. They either break on every <pre><code>LoadLibraryExW</code></pre> calls or none. Variations like:\n<pre><code>Break Condiditon: [esp+4]==L\"Test.dll\"\nBreak Condition: esp+4==L\"Test.dll\"\netc..\n</code></pre>\nWhat is the proper way of setting a conditional breakpoint based on function arguments? Or register offsets?\n",
