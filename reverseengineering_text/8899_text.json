    "content": "How can I search for a sequence of instructions in IDA Pro? \nI did manage to search for a single instruction using text search string <pre><code>li.*r4.*-1</code></pre> (for instruction <pre><code>li r4, -1</code></pre>), but I failed to match multiple instructions or newline character. \nIt seems to be possible to this by using the binary search, but this requires converting the assembly to the corresponding binary opcodes.\n",

I have a feeling that IDA uses POSIX regex, thus the '?' and similar markers won't work. Also this might be somewhat related. I guess you have to stick to idapython to find multiline instructions.\n",
