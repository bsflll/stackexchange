    "content": "can you tell me why objdump does not correctly disassemble the firmware for the C-SKY (ck803s) processor? what is .long: between the lines, unknown instructions? or am I setting the parameters for objdump incorrectly? here are mine: ./objdump -D -b binary -m csky:cs803 -EL firmware.bin\n\nfrom off. sources use CK803S processor\n\nthis is how the bootloader works\n\nThe firmware is launched from the specified address at offset 0x04, look at the dump merged from the flash drive\n\nobjdump output\n",

I don't know that version of <pre><code>objdump</code></pre> enough to comment on whether its a bug or missing option.\nHowever, I can explain how the 32-bit instructions work.\nThe c-sky instruction stream is a series of 16-bit words.  If bits 15 and 14 of the instruction word are NOT both <pre><code>1</code></pre>s then it's a 16-bit instruction.\nHowever, if bits 15 and 14 of the instruction word are both <pre><code>1</code></pre>s then it's a 32-bit instruction with the low 16-bits of the instruction in the following word.\nConsider a hypothetical instruction with hex coding <pre><code>C1234567</code></pre>.\nThis will be stored as two 16-bit words <pre><code>C123</code></pre> and <pre><code>4567</code></pre> in that order\nIn a big-endian environment, this will be stored as the following bytes -\n<pre><code>C1 23 45 67\n</code></pre>\nIn a little-endian environment, this will be stored as the following bytes -\n<pre><code>23 C1 67 45\n</code></pre>\n\nIn your firmware above the instruction at <pre><code>3001000</code></pre> is correct but the following instruction at <pre><code>3001002</code></pre> is actually <pre><code>C0016420</code></pre>\n<pre><code>03001000: 112c      lrw     r1, 0x80000100\n03001002: c0016420  mtcr    r1, cr<0,0>\n</code></pre>\nWriting to control registers is very plausible in boot/init code.\nThe later 32-bit instruction with .long in the objdump output also seem to make sense.\n",
