    "content": "I launch a game process then I suspend the process and restore the hooks in ntdll.dll then I attach debugger to the process and resume the process. Next I see debugger catch the 0xC0000005(access violation) exception on thread [DbgUiRemoteBreakin] and did not break on any breakpoint I seted (I had set a break point on [DbgUiRemoteBreakin]). And can not single step debug. So is there any infomation about how to solve it here?\n",
