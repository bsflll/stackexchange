    "content": "what happens if I tampered the serial number in the bios of a laptop? This laptop was issued to us by our company and what happened was we were laid out without any compensation for what happened so I decided to keep this laptop however after installing windows OS it was frozen because it was reported as stolen or lost, Is there a way to bypass this? I successfully made a reset in the BIOS admin password and now this is my current problem. By the way the handset was HP elitebook 840 g8\n",

I also found out that it was equipped with absolute computrace persistence and several sources mentioned that once the computrace is enabled it can't be disable even with reflashing. however i'll still try to change the serial number as I generated several serial numbers from the orig serial number.\n",

You could block access to the servers with a firewall or check with something like Wireshark what connections are made during the setup. You could also try to edit the BIOS with something like UEFITool and remove computrace.\n",
