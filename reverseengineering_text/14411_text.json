    "content": "I'm learning assembly and I have one question.\nExample:\n<pre><code>int main()\n{\n    foo(a);\n}\n\nint foo (x)\n{\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\nwhen the <pre><code>foo</code></pre> function returns to <pre><code>main</code></pre> the <pre><code>ret</code></pre> instruction is executed. How does the <pre><code>ret</code></pre> instruction knows where the pushed <pre><code>EIP</code></pre> register is saved?\nI know that before the <pre><code>foo</code></pre> function is called the <pre><code>EIP</code></pre> is pushed to the stack, but when <pre><code>ret</code></pre> in <pre><code>foo</code></pre> is executed, what the <pre><code>ret</code></pre> really does? \nThanks for your help\n",
