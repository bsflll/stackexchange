    "content": "I'm taking part in this reverse engineering lab at college and we have this final big homework project. I have a part of the binary that changes it's own asm code by iterating through it's own bytes and <pre><code>add</code></pre>-ing or maybe <pre><code>xor</code></pre>-ing and then rewriting them back to memory. \nI'm stuck at this function that I managed to decompile using x64dbg to the following (variable naming changed by me)\n<pre><code>uint8_t fun_401c05(uint8_t argument) {\n    uint8_t counter;\n\n    counter = 0;\n    if (argument) {\n        do {\n            counter = (uint8_t)(counter + 1);\n            argument = (uint8_t)(argument & (uint8_t)(argument - 1));\n        } while (argument);\n    }\n    return counter;\n}\n</code></pre>\nI'm trying to understand what exactly this function does. I know the function is called 3 times, each time with a letter from my input file. Each of the results is then processed using <pre><code>xor</code></pre> and some <pre><code>sar</code></pre> instruction (it's my first time seeing it) to calculate an int key that grants access to the next part of the challenge and I need to understand what the function does in order to give it the right input. I can see what it does but can't really get the meaning of it just yet..\nEDIT: I know the name of the question is bad but I have no idea what other generic name to give it. If someone can help I'll be very grateful\n",
