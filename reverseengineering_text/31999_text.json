    "content": "I'm working on the challenges on ROP Emporium. For the ARMv5 version of the callme challenge, we are given two binaries and two shared libraries: <pre><code>callme_armv5</code></pre> with <pre><code>libcallme_armv5.so</code></pre> and <pre><code>callme_armv5-hf</code></pre> with <pre><code>libcallme_armv5-hf.so</code></pre>. The first pair appears to be using the armel EABI, while the second pair is using the armhf EABI.\nIn Appendix B of ROP Emporium's Beginner's Guide, they show how to set up an environment for cross-platform debugging for ARM like so:\n<pre><code>$ sudo apt install qemu-user libc6-armel-cross gdb-multiarch\n$ sudo mkdir /etc/qemu-binfmt\n$ sudo ln -s /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi /etc/qemu-binfmt/arm\n</code></pre>\nThat works great for armel, but it doesn't work for armhf. So I found this post, showing how to set up an environment for cross-platform debugging of armhf binaries.\n<pre><code>$ sudo apt install qemu-user libc6-armhf-cross gdb-multiarch\n$ sudo mkdir /etc/qemu-binfmt\n$ sudo ln -s /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf /etc/qemu-binfmt/arm\n</code></pre>\nThis works fine for armhf, but not for armel ...\n<pre><code>$ qemu-arm ./callme_armv5-hf  # Okay\n...\n$ qemu-arm ./callme_armv5     # FAIL\n./callme_armv5: error while loading shared libraries: libcallme_armv5.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n</code></pre>\nThe problem is that both setups create the same symlink, but to different directories, so I can debug armel and armhf binaries individually, but each time I want to switch, I have to change the symlink. Is there some way to set up an environment so I can debug both binaries simultaneously?\nIn case it's relevant, I'm running Ubuntu 20.04 under WSL2.\n",
