    "content": "Is there any way to leave 2D flow chart graphs and go to 3D model?\nI mean something like that:\nUsual 2D graph:\n \n3D graph:\n\nThe only one solution I've seen is using UbiGraph + Linux on VM (to use UbiGraph) + some X-server for Win (the process of making all that stuff to work is described at Cr4sh's blog). That's kinda perverted solution, up to me. \nAlso it would be brilliant if there could be displayed disasm in nodes, like in ordinary 2D IDA graphs.\nPerhaps there are some more elegant solutions?\n",
