    "content": "I am wondering what the crypto, linenum, pcalign, relocs and va values mean in the output of rabin2.\nI took a look in the source code of radare2 and it seems for ELF va is always true, I assume it means virtual addressing?\nhttps://github.com/radareorg/radare2/blob/1d3698bc96a09e45c4fff4c090278623f146929c/libr/bin/format/elf/elf.c#L2132-L2134\n<pre><code>int Elf_(r_bin_elf_has_va)(ELFOBJ *bin) {\n    return true;\n}\n</code></pre>\nI would assume relocs refer to the presence of the relocation table however from my testing that does not seem to be the case.\nFor linenum I think it refers information relating to the line numbers in the source code? But this still seem to appear true when there is no DWARF information on the ELF binary.\nAs for the other 2 I have no idea what they are referring to.\n<pre><code>arch     x86\nbaddr    0x0\nbinsz    6618\nbintype  elf\nbits     64\ncanary   true\nsanitiz  false\nclass    ELF64\ncrypto   false\nendian   little\nhavecode true\nintrp    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2\nladdr    0x0\nlang     c\nlinenum  true\nlsyms    true\nmachine  AMD x86-64 architecture\nmaxopsz  16\nminopsz  1\nnx       true\nos       linux\npcalign  0\npic      true\nrelocs   true\nrelro    full\nrpath    NONE\nstatic   false\nstripped false\nsubsys   linux\nva       true\n</code></pre>\n",
