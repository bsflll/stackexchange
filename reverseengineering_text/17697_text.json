    "content": "I want to remove a <pre><code>LOAD_COMMAND</code></pre> from my iOS app binary.\nI tried jtool:\n<pre><code>jtool -rC 3 my_app_binary\n</code></pre>\nThis worked when I was removing a dynamic library.  But it generated an empty binary file and the original binary was not altered when I wanted to remove: \n<pre><code>LC 03: LC_SEGMENT_64          Mem: 0x100007000-0x100007000  __RESTRICT\n</code></pre>\nI found the same with optool.  I could delete a <pre><code>dylib</code></pre> but not this <pre><code>RESTRICT</code></pre> load command.\nNext stop is Hopper...\n",
