    "content": "I'm learning about stenography and found this example.\nI've followed the instructions but when I write out a new zip file after changing the filename inside the file I get this:\n<pre><code>unzip nospaces.zip\nArchive:  nospaces.zip\n  End-of-central-directory signature not found.  Either this file is not\n  a zipfile, or it constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive.  In the\n  latter case the central directory and zipfile comment will be found on\n  the last disk(s) of this archive.\nnote:  nospaces.zip may be a plain executable, not an archive\nunzip:  cannot find zipfile directory in one of nospaces.zip or\n        nospaces.zip.zip, and cannot find nospaces.zip.ZIP, period.\n</code></pre>\nI found that I could use <pre><code>zip -FF --out</code></pre> to 'fix' the zip file and extract the embedded contents but would like to understand what I might be doing wrong when saving the contents of the original file between 0x504B0304 and 0x506B0506\nI got the same results in WinHex (32bit Windows 10 VM) and HexFiend (OSX 10.10.5 - 64bit.)\nCan anyone suggest what I might have done wrong when editing the file?\n",
