    "content": "This question is similar to: List arrays (de-reference pointers) in Ollydbg\nI have an array of pointers that point to character arrays. I followed the above link and can view the ASCII values from the dereferenced pointers, but I would like to be able to dump it to a file. The only options I see are:\n\nBinary copy (these are the addresses, rather than values).\nCopy as Table (copies all the data...not needed)\n\nAny idea? I use both ollydbg and x32dbg so either is fine for a solution\n",
