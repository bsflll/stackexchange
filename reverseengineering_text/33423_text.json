    "content": "I’m analyzing a firmware image dumped from a Ubiquiti device with UART, and I’m running into issues trying to extract user-modified configuration files from what appears to be a JFFS2 partition.\nGoal:\nAccess the writable partition (JFFS2) to extract actual user data (credentials, configs). I’ve already extracted the squashfs successfully, but that only contains factory defaults.\nWhat I’ve done so far:\n\nIdentified JFFS2 signature (0x85 0x19) at offset 0x55686.\nTried extracting from both:\nUsed jefferson (latest version from GitHub):\nNo error messages, but the output folder is empty.\nTried a 130 MB full extract from 0x55686 to EOF – same result.\n\nThings I’ve tried:\n\nTried older Jefferson versions\nBinwalk with --extract, still no usable JFFS2 filesystem, same result empty folder\n\nQuestions:\n\nHas anyone encountered similar issues with Ubiquiti firmware and Jefferson?\nCould it be a fragmented or raw NAND layout that Jefferson cannot parse?\nAny tools or techniques recommended to recover real user data from this type of dump?\n\nAny insight would be really appreciated.\nThanks in advance!\n",

            "text": "Hi, thanks for your reply!  You’re right — I spotted JFFS2 by the 0x85 0x19 signature, and yes, it could be a coincidence. But first I also ran binwalk on the full image, and it detected a JFFS2 filesystem.  However, running binwalk -e firmware.bin just gives me an empty folder, same as Jefferson.  Any idea what I should try next? Could this be a Ubiquiti-specific layout issue?  Thanks again!\n",
