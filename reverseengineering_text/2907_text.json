    "content": "Original question asked on Stackoverflow: Can the 'r' be removed from a function stack ?\nI am trying to modify the processor for the Fujitsu FR, and IDA by default inserts the return variable <pre><code>r</code></pre> on each stack, but the Fujitsu FR processor does not put <pre><code>r</code></pre> as the first item, so this stuffs up the stack.\nWhat I can't workout is: in the processor plugin, what needs overriding to resolve this, or if any of the example processors have solutions to copy.\n",
