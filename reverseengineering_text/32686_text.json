    "content": "・I am analyzing an Android app that was in the CTF.\n(https://github.com/TRkizaki/cryptoverse2023/tree/main/reverse_java_not_interesting)\n・In this app, the input string is checked by the checkvaild function in the native library (libhello-jni.so).\n　Then, if the input string is correct, a flag is displayed.\n・Since debuggable is set to True in this app, I would like to use 「lldb」 to do the dynamic analysis.\nHowever, libhello-jni.so is not displayed when I use the \"image list\" option after attaching with lldb.\nWhy is this?\n・The host environment is Windows and the application is installed on a physical device.\n",

            "content": "Looks like your APK is compiled with android:extractNativeLibs=false (look at the manifest).\nMy experience is that this flag will stop the libraries from loading in the usual way you'd expect from shared libraries and you will not be able to find them in the process memory map or identify their symbols as you would normally.\nYou can try to modify the manifest, recompile the apk (you will likely need to align it and sign it) and then run it / attach to it with your debugger and see if it solved your problem.\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#extractNativeLibs\nhttps://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element#extractNativeLibs\n",
