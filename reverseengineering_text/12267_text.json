    "content": "I'm trying to extract the firmware from my set-top box (STB) because I realized its port 22 is open and running dropbear, and I'd like to login to it. Well, because it's there. I've tried binwalk, but that's coming up blank:\n<pre><code>$ binwalk apollo_fw4_full_p_1.1.32_nand.bin \n\nDECIMAL     HEX         DESCRIPTION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n$ \n</code></pre>\nLikewise Firmware Mod Kit fails:\n<pre><code>$ ./extract-firmware.sh ../apollo_fw4_full_p_1.1.32_nand.bin \nFirmware Mod Kit (extract) 0.99, (c)2011-2013 Craig Heffner, Jeremy Collake\n\nPreparing tools ...\nScanning firmware...\n\nScan Time:     2016-03-21 15:05:55\nSignatures:    193\nTarget File:   /home/ob1/apollo_fw4_full_p_1.1.32_nand.bin\nMD5 Checksum:  b100590cbe030628d97e6d39c6f7fde8\n\nDECIMAL     HEX         DESCRIPTION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExtracting 0 bytes of  header image at offset 0\nERROR: No supported file system found!

            "content": "The firmware image is likely to be encrypted.\n\nEntropy scan reveals that it is mostly comprised of random bytes which happens if the firmware is compressed and/or encrypted. Since the binary lacks common compression magic signatures, it is most likely to be encrypted.\nTo decrypt the firmware you need to obtain more information about the product that uses this firmware. You can refer to this blog post for some ideas.\nAs you say port 22 is open running a FTP service you can try connecting to it with default user/pass combos. You can try finding other open ports via nmap.\n",
