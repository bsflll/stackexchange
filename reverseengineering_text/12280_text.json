    "content": "I've spent the past 4 months trying to bypass certificate pinning in the Facebook android application so I can understand how it works, but I'm having trouble doing so. \nI have tried using android SSL trust Killer and cydia substrate, but there seems to be some other verification mecanism. I have tried altering the smali code as explained here:\nhttp://blog.dewhurstsecurity.com/2015/11/10/mobile-security-certificate-pining.html\nI was able to view two requests (one of which is shown in the last screenshot of the provided link), however the app seems to apply some other protection mecanism because when trying to login to an account, it gives an error message saying: \"ssl3_get_server_certificate certificate verify failed\"\nI have tried every public tutorial I could find online to no avail, I would appreciate any input on how to do this. \nI'd also be happy to provide the decompiled source code, apk, and the modified apk if needed.\n",

You might end up having to recompile SSL libraries for your Android, or do something along the lines of nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2015/â€¦. I am not too familiar with how pinning is set up in client code, but I bet there are ways to disable it even without replacing SSL libs. Nop it all out, not just the parts described in the blog post :)\n",

According to JustTrustMe explanation on github, it should have worked, so I'm assuming there is a custom pinning functionality implemented.  Thanks for your suggestion, I will try and make time to study this. If you have any book/tutorial recommendations to get me started please let me know.</span>",
