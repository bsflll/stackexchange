    "content": "I've a huawei envizion 360, which doesn't provide any API for other application. But I want to read raw data from this device, to an android or to a raspberry-pi for debugging and development purpose. I need an android application to record video or take picture from this external device.\nBut when I tried to debug this application using Android Studio, I got :\n<pre><code>Missing debug symbols\n                    To debug the APK, native libraries (*.so files) must have debug symbols.\n                    The following libraries are missing debug symbols:\n                    * libViewController.so\n                    * libijkffmpeg.so\n                    * libijkplayer.so\n                    * libijksdl.so\n                    * librtmpClient.so\n</code></pre>\nI was told that I can't get those debug symbol, due to r8 processing.\nSo my question is how can read raw frames/data from this device. Any idea ?\nI just have to read data so that I can embed data directly in my application. So my main goal is to decode how those data are being read.\n",
