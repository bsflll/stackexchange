    "content": "I was recently working on a (seemingly) simple CTF challenge where the input was a base64 encoded file and the binary would check for correctness in one function call. The catch is that the checking function was about 88k basic blocks long, but is entirely linear. So each block would check for a single byte and, if incorrect, would branch to a smaller block that would call an exiting function. The operation in each block is simple:\n<pre><code>if(RANDOM_CONST0 == mem[i] ^ RANDOM_CONST1){\n    goto next_basic_block;\n}else{\n    exiting_function()    //no return\n}\n</code></pre>\nThe constants used are different for each basic block. So, it seemed like a great target for angr!\nAttempts (using <pre><code>call_state</code></pre>):\n1)\n\nUses <pre><code>SimulationManager.explore</code></pre>\nDrops <pre><code>avoid</code></pre> and <pre><code>deadended</code></pre> states after each step (using <pre><code>step_func</code></pre>)\nRuns of out memory after ~10 minutes (8GB)\n\n2)\n\nUses <pre><code>SimulationManager.step</code></pre>\nManually prunes off 'bad' state after each step (e.g. one that leads to calling the exiting function)\nEvaluates a single byte of the solution after each block\n\n\nSets the memory to concrete value 0 (for memory reduction)\n\nStill churning after 20 hours (65k bytes of solution)\n\n\nDramatic slowing at this point -- about 1 byte/3 seconds\n\nUses <pre><code>SimulationManager.simplify</code></pre> to reduce memory overhead per step\n\nOther misc things:\n\nAbsolutely no constraints on the symbolic memory (containing the solution)\nThe buffer is ~88k and constraints on that much memory alone consumes a lot of RAM\n\nQuestions:\n\nWhy is so much memory be taken up?\n\n\nThe only symbolic register is <pre><code>eax</code></pre> in each basic block (because it reads a symbolic byte from memory), but it does not compound complexity with each step (it gets set to another symbolic value in the next basic block)\n\nWhy has angr slowed so dramatically?\n\nI uploaded the CTF binary here for those interested.\n",

All this binary does is tell you whether or not the file you fed into it is 'correct'. So patching won't help here. So my intention was to use angr to symbolically derive what the necessary input condition was such that this <pre><code>check</code></pre> function returned success. It does technically work, it just take many hours and GB of RAM to get there.\n",
