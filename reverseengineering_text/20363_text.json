    "content": "I have just converted this piece of code in assembly:\n<pre><code>#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n    return (1);\n}\n</code></pre>\nHere are my questions:\n\nOnce you push the base-pointer value on to the stack, RSP will decrement automatically (to a lower address). This will also happen when memory was allocated for argc and argv (\"mov dword\" and \"mov qword\"). Is this correct? I don't see any instruction to move the stack-pointer up the stack, so I am assuming this is done implicitly.\nThe instruction \"mov dword [rbp-4H], edi\" is 4 bytes less than the address in RBP, this is as expected since DWORD is 4 bytes in length. What I am confused about is why \"mov qword [rbp-10H], rsi\" is 10H (16 bytes)? Isn't QWORD 8 bytes in length? I was expecting the instruction to be \"mov qword [rbp-CH], rsi\", since 4+8=12 bytes.\nCan you explain to me what the comments on the right-side are? \n\nBelow is the assembly code generated from my c program:\n<pre><code>SECTION .text   align=1 execute                         ; section number 1, code\n\nmain:   ; Function begin\npush    rbp                                     ; 0000 _ 55\nmov     rbp, rsp                                ; 0001 _ 48: 89. E5\nmov     dword [rbp-4H], edi                     ; 0004 _ 89. 7D, FC\nmov     qword [rbp-10H], rsi                    ; 0007 _ 48: 89. 75, F0\nmov     eax, 1                                  ; 000B _ B8, 00000001\npop     rbp                                     ; 0010 _ 5D\nret                                             ; 0011 _ C3\n; main End of function\n\n\nSECTION .data   align=1 noexecute                       ; section number 2, data\n\nSECTION .bss    align=1 noexecute                       ; section number 3, bss\n</code></pre>\n",

            "content": "Variables are aligned to some extent to help faster access to them. The alignment value is usually an implementation detail, but compilers usually follow Intel's recommendations to align/place variables next to each other.\nAccording to Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual, section 3.6.7 Stack Alignment*:\n\nPerformance penalty of unaligned access to the stack happens when a\nmemory reference splits a cache line. This means that one out of eight\nspatially consecutive unaligned quadword accesses is always penalized,\nsimilarly for one out of 4 consecutive, non-aligned double-quadword\naccesses, etc.\nAligning the stack may be beneficial any time there are\ndata objects that exceed the default stack alignment of the system.\nFor example, on 32/64bit Linux, and 64bit Windows, the default stack\nalignment is 16 bytes, while 32bit Windows is 4 bytes.\nAssembly/Compiler Coding Rule 55. (H impact, M generality) Make sure\nthat the stack is aligned at the largest multi-byte granular data type\nboundary matching the register width.\n\nIn your case on x64 the registers are 8 bytes wide and <pre><code>argc</code></pre> being an <pre><code>int</code></pre> is 4 bytes wide. Following the guideline above the variables are aligned to 8-byte boundary.\n<pre><code> ► 0x5555555545fe <main+4>                   mov    dword ptr [rbp - 4], edi\n   0x555555554601 <main+7>                   mov    qword ptr [rbp - 0x10], rsi\n   0x555555554605 <main+11>                  mov    eax, 0x2a\n   0x55555555460a <main+16>                  pop    rbp\n   0x55555555460b <main+17>                  ret    \n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>edi</code></pre> stores <pre><code>argc</code></pre> a 32 bit value - packed in a 64 bit boundary with the upper 32 bits of no use for you.\n<pre><code>pwndbg> tele rbp-0x10\n00:0000│          0x7fffffffdf10 —▸ 0x7fffffffe000 ◂— 0x1\n01:0008│          0x7fffffffdf18 ◂— 0x0\n02:0010│ rbp rsp  0x7fffffffdf20 —▸ 0x555555554610 (__libc_csu_init) ◂— push   r15\n</code></pre>\nSo the <pre><code>argv</code></pre> starts 8 bytes above <pre><code>argv</code></pre>\n",
