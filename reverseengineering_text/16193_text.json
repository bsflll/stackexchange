    "content": "I'm new with IDA. Say I have a variable which is created in some function and it is argument to other functions.\nMy question is how to monitor this variable? In monitor I mean is there any way to set some kind of breakpoint and stop execution every time something is written or read from this variable? Or somehow trace the read/write operation on it? thanks.\n",
