            "content": "Well, while it's definitely possible to jump to the entrypoint of the program to try restarting it, there may be various consequences preventing correct execution, e.g.:\n\nlibrary initialization has been run already, and running it a second time is not something most libraries expect\nvarious resources may have been allocated and variables initialized, so doing it again may not work.\n\nSo what you can do is to cause the program to simulate termination without actually exiting and then jump to the entry point. Microsoft CRT provides functions <pre><code>_c_exit</code></pre> and <pre><code>_cexit</code></pre> for such cpurpose, but it seems glibc does not have anything similar. So you may have to simulate calling of the <pre><code>atexit</code></pre> handlers manually to perform cleanup.\n",
