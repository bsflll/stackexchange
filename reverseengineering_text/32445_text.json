    "content": "I'm new to IDC scripts and would like some help at trying to apply and offset to a binary I have in loaded in IDA. Sorry not sure if my terminology is correct but I have a reference in my file \"fp\" that is the memory offset and is shown like\n<pre><code>ld24    fp, #0x808000\n</code></pre>\nall of the references in the file show something like,\n<pre><code>lduh    R0, @(-0x2700, fp)\n</code></pre>\nwhich make it difficult to link the memory addresses. If I press Ctrl-R I can correct these offsets in the file line by line but I would like a script that can do the whole file in one go if possible.\n\nthis gives me what I am looking for\n<pre><code>lduh    R0, @((unk_805900 - unk_808000), fp)\n</code></pre>\nAny help would be appreciated, thanks\n",
