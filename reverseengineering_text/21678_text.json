    "content": "So I have an ehi file, which is a configuration file for an Android App called HTTP Injector.\nOf course when I try to see it as a simple text, I just get random characters.\nWhat tool could I use to start trying to decrypt it?\nI don't even know how to start and if someone could point time what type of encryption or obfuscation method was used I would be hugely grateful.\nHere is a ehi file for demonstration: https://transfer.sh/91tbh/1_4999527475131187330.ehi\nThank you so much, and if my question is not accepted, please delete it.\n",
