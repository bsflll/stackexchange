    "content": "I am new to malware analysis, and I'm learning how to detect malware that uses process injection to execute PE files from memory. I chose a ransomware sample that uses process injection to load the actual payload in memory and took a crash dump at the point where the executable is loaded into memory. Is it safe to open (and not run) the crash dump file in WinDbg in a trusted environment? I will be using WinDbg commands to list peb, TIDs etc.\n",
