    "content": "Currently I'm trying to get past Enigma's loader, which asks you for a name & key, as an excercise.\nI have very little progress, as I haven't worked too much with packers.\nWhat I did was breakpoint on <pre><code>CreateWindowExA</code></pre>, and then I put random data at key / name, and then click <pre><code>Register</code></pre>, which effectively breaks at <pre><code>CreateWindowExA</code></pre>.\nFrom there, I'm able to check the stack and go back a few calls, but I'm really lost as there's a lot of bloat code (short functions with x87 instructions), and I don't know where to continue.\nI also know that the routine that checks the serial is virtualized, so I should patch the places which check the return of the function that checks the serial instead of the function itself, but then again, I get lost when looking at the stack.\nHere's my progress so far:\nThe breakpoint on <pre><code>CreateWindowExA</code></pre>, which gets called when you input an invalid serial\n\nThe function that calls it:\nhttp://screenshotuploader.com/i/1502/t_q0c.png\nAnd that function, before and after calling <pre><code>CreateWindowExA</code></pre>, calls these two weird x87 functions:\n\nthe function that is marked in the previous screenshot\n\nthis one gets called a few instructions after <pre><code>CreateWindowExA</code></pre>\nAfter going one more function back, I see:\n\nThe problem with that function is that it's using some tricks to change the return address (I guess), like this:\n\nWhich then leads to weird code which expects a function pointer in <pre><code>edx</code></pre> returned by a funtion that is dereferencing a pointer to a <pre><code>word</code></pre> (2 bytes)!\nHere's the code that calls the function that returns a pointer to a function:\n\nAnd here's the function that returns a pointer in <pre><code>edx</code></pre>:\n\nIt is really weird, as it 1) derefs a <pre><code>word</code></pre> (2 bytes, not enough for a function pointer!), and 2) <pre><code>FLDCW</code></pre> loads a x87 FPU control word... what's happening here?!\nAlso, that's the last return I can see in the stack, as the rest of the values are zeroed, and there's no branch which checks the serial at this depth, so I don't know where to continue looking at.\n\nAnd if not enough, the program closes each time I input an invalid serial, which makes it harder, because the next time the offsets are totally different and I can't find the code so I breakpoint a bit before, so I'm really lost!\nDumping the executable at runtime does absolutely nothing, as it's still packed as it was before, it just makes it 4x bigger (50MB -> 200MB), and doesn't help at all.\nAny help would be great, even a simple idea, like a hint on what to do next, where to breakpoint, where to look at, or whatever you can think of, would help a lot.\n",
