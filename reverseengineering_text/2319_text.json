In addition, I am using it to crack some small Windows application. However, it does not work with all Win32 Application, especially with those that are zipped by <pre><code>.exe</code></pre> compressor.\nAre there any other open source applications, that I can use to crack and extract resources out of <pre><code>.dll</code></pre> and <pre><code>.exe</code></pre> files?\n",

(One big section) and adjusting Raw/VirtualSize and Raw/VirtualOffset accordingly.\nUse Resource Hacker.\n\nN.B.: You can try with more than one Resource editor e.g. ResEdit since many resource editors out there follow weird rules for PE header as they only expect typical PE headers.\nIronically, one resource editor expects the resources to be embedded in a section named <pre><code>.rsrc</code></pre>, otherwise it rejects them. Others don't see resources if embedded in a section marked as <pre><code>IMAGE_SCN_CNT_UNINITIALIZED_DATA 0x80</code></pre>.\nOne the other hand if you can attach to the running process without problems (No or bypassed Anti-Attaching tricks), you can use OllyDbg v1.10 for that as follows:\n\nAfter attach, Select \"View\" then \"Memory\" Alt+M). You will get list of sections beside other memory blocks.\nSpot the resources section. e.g. <pre><code>.rsrc</code></pre>. Right-Click the target section and \"View all resources\". You will then a list of well-sorted resources.\nRight-Click whichever resource you want and select \"dump\". A new window will pop up.\nRight-Click inside the hex view of the new window and select \"Backup\" and \"Save data to file\".\n\nHope it helps\n",
