    "content": "I have C# binary. I was able to use <pre><code>dnSpy</code></pre> to decompile it, and analyze. The binary was obfuscated with <pre><code>xenocode</code></pre> obfuscator.\nI figured out that I can directly manipulate IL instructions if I just find correct instruction offset, and replace instruction byte(s).\nOriginal bytes and C# code (replaced with letters so it is readable):\n<pre><code>a.b().c.d = (int)e.f;\n\n 06 6F A0010006 6F 9302000A\n ^  ^  ^        ^  ^-------- T2\n |  |  |        \\----------- callvirt to set_d\n |  |  \\-------------------- T1\n |  \\----------------------- callvirt to get_f\n \\-------------------------- ldloc.0\n</code></pre>\nWhat I want to achieve and resulting bytes:\n<pre><code>a.b().c.d = 6;\n\n 1C 00 00000000 6F 9302000A\n ^  ^           ^  ^-------- T2\n |  |           \\----------- callvirt to set_d\n |  |  \n |  \\----------------------- 5x nop, so the length of file is same\n \\-------------------------- ldc.i4.6\n</code></pre>\nI am able to decompile changed binary without error, and I can observe my changed instructions, but when binary executes this region, it dies. Any ideas?\n",
