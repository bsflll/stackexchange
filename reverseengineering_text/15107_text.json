You can find the software documentation here.\nAlso there seems to be a broad range of integrations to parse and read the data here.\nPlease also know that the system uses a WriteKey and a ReadKey apparently, but I can not deduce which one you have.\n\nIf you want to write your own REST client, please refer to\n  StackOverflow for programming-guidance.
