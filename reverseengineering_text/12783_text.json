    "content": "I currently try to figure out, what actually happens to a <pre><code>PE File</code></pre> in memory. To reword it: How could <pre><code>PE files</code></pre> differ, when they run on different computers and what are the mutable parts of a PE file, when they are loaded into memory? \nMy overall goal is to understand, what a normalization process of memory dumps of specific processes could look like (as mentioned here for example).\nMy understanding so far:\n\nSections getting mapped to different locations\nSections get page-aligned\nIAT gets updated\nBase relocations are performed\n\nDid I miss anything?\n",
