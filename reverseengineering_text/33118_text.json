    "content": "I am a total beginner doing RE and have been learning a lot thanks to this community, and I want to thank you. I already looked for something similar in the other questions, but I don't know if it is because of my lack of knowledge or something different that I couldn't find.\nSo basically I'm doing an exercise that the goal is to find the references by looking at the strings(\"the instructor called black wizard\") based on the error code, so when I open with win32dasm and search for the error string \"Registration failed\" the wind32dasm found the reference \"00413c7f\" without problem that's how it looks like:\n\nSo all good at this point, the problem is when I try it to open with IDA and search for the string:\n\nAs you can see the string references are missing my question is why, What am I missing? I have been reading about encoding options because that's my best guess but yeah... I could not find the answer yet so yeah, some ideas here about how to do these in IDA??.\n",
