    "content": "I'm trying to decompile a function with ghidra 9.0. After a (short) while, I get :\n<pre><code>Exception while decompiling 140062b00: process: timeout\n</code></pre>\nI already \"succesfully\" decompiled this function using IDA hexrays and snowman. Both return a massive function with several thousand lines of code. I use quotes because I didn't validate the whole output, but the parts that I analysed made sense.\nI'm thinking that this timeout error could be solved by increasing the time limit, but I haven't found any way of configuring this.\nIs there any way to use ghidra to decompile this function anyway?\n",
