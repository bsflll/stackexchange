            "text": "Under Windows XP, binaries tend to get loaded at their preferred load address if there aren't any conflicts (e.g. between DLLs bound for the same load address), which avoids the need for relocations to be applied. Vista introduced Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR), which causes load addresses to be randomised within certain limits. Also, /LARGEADDRESSAWARE programs can see an extended address space if a 32-bit Windows is started with the /3GB switch; for Wow64 it's about 4GB. Shared/system DLLs tend to go to 7xxxxxxx\n",

The memory space layout is randomized when ASLR is enabled.\nIf you want to disable it for a particular executable, you can do it with the tool setdllcharacteristics.
