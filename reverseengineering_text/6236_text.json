    "content": "The following is a simple program I wrote to be debugged in OllyDbg:\n<pre><code>main(){\n    exit(0);\n}\n</code></pre>\nI compiled the program and opened it in OllyDbg. The program pauses at some weird location in ntdll. I went into options and set a breakpoint at the entry. The program still paused at the same location in ntdll. I then set a breakpoint at main. And it still pauses at some location in ntdll. \nWhat am I doing wrong here?\n",
