    "content": "I'm currently working on an iOS app to replicate a signature which looks to be generated with a MD5 hash. I'm currently using Frida, but haven't had any luck replicating it. I've used the script to hook on to general crypto functions, but nothing MD5 related seems to go on here. I've also hooked onto the CC_MD5 function, but it isn't displaying me the correct hash, so I'm guessing the app is using another library. I've had success with Android, as I can 1) see the source code with Jadx 2) Easily hook onto the MD5 class.\nAny tips on how I can approach this? It would be greatly appreciated!\n",
