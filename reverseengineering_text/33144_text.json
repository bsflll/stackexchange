    "content": "My current script for connecting to debugger is this, however if there's a debugger is already running then it gets disconnected, but new one does not start, have to run script second time to connect.\nProblem is if i add <pre><code>time.sleep(3)</code></pre> it does not just adds wait to the script it also puts ida to sleep same as <pre><code>idc.qsleep(3)</code></pre> so debugger does not exit until 3 seconds wait.\n<pre><code>import ida_idd, ida_dbg, time\n\nif ida_dbg.is_debugger_on():\n    print(\"Debugger already running.\")\n    print(\"disconnected successfully\" if ida_dbg.exit_process() else 'failed to disconnect')\n    time.sleep(3)\n\nprocess_name = \"my_process_name\"\npis = ida_idd.procinfo_vec_t()\ncount = ida_dbg.get_processes(pis)\n\n#print(f\"Found {count}\")\nfor p in pis:\n    #print(f\"{p.pid}: {p.name}\")\n    if process_name in p.name:\n        #print(f\"Attaching to process {p.name}\")\n        ida_dbg.attach_process(p.pid)\n        break\n</code></pre>\n",
