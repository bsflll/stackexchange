For example,\n<pre><code>0x000006b5      64488b042528.  mov rax, qword fs:[0x28]    ; [0x28:8]=0x1978 ; '(' ; \"x\\x19\"\n</code></pre>\nI want to find all lines that reference <pre><code>fs:[0x28]</code></pre>, like the one above. This address is used as a stack canary, and I'm especially interested to see what is reading from it.\n",
