If so how? \nThe file I want to recover the key from is a xml that looks like this without encryption. It has a xml element called Test.\n<pre><code><?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<Test />\n</code></pre>\nWhen it is encrypted with the key <pre><code>stackoverflow</code></pre> (73868cb1848a216984dca1b6b0ee37bc = md5 hash) and the initialization vector below, the file look like this <pre><code>¥4!¬Hw[î!71ôtž|!¢¬TÞ;u?þª-†•ÈÏ‰eßŽKtSsbZ®ÕµR©Ù«í‹</code></pre>:\n\nInitialization vector:\n<pre><code>byte[] iv = new byte[]\n{\n    55, 66, 77, 192, 57, 100, 11, 111,\n    25, 86, 96, 66, 22, 122, 133, 43\n};\n</code></pre>\nIs it possible to reverse the key from that or are it bulletproof?\n",
