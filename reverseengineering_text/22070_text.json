    "content": "I came upon this question : \nCan we hook the Nt or Zw functions using IAT hooking, or just inline hooking?\nand it got me wondering, lets say for some reason some function was not in the IAT of our target PE in virtual memory, like the above question which is Zw/NtQuerySystemInformation (I'm still not sure why this is not included in IAT tho), so in this case if we wanted to hook the IAT, would it be possible to hook the export table of kernel32.dll or ntdll.dll and do it like that instead? because i assume this function has to be there at least\nso this takes me back to the question, will the loader fill our IAT when its loading the PE into memory by checking the export tables, or when our program uses it? because if its the first case then I assume there is no way to hook the export table right?\nalso does anyone know why functions like ZwQuerySystemInformation dont get included in IAT but stuff like Sleep and GetProcAddress Does?\n",

            "content": "When does the PE loader fill in the IAT?\nThe IAT is updated at load time by the PE Loader [1], this is called Load-time dynamic linking, as opposed to Run-time dynamic linking, where <pre><code>LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress</code></pre> are necessary.\nHooking an API not included in Import Address Table\nThere are several ways to do that actually, and Export Address Table hooking is one of them. However, your hook must be installed before the target application looks up the API you want to hook.\nInclude Nt/Zw APIs in the IAT\n\nalso does anyone know why functions like ZwQuerySystemInformation dont get included in IAT but stuff like Sleep and GetProcAddress Does?\n\nThe only reason <pre><code>ZwQuerySystemInformation</code></pre> is not included in the IAT is because you didn't tell your linker to do it for you. You need need to link against ntdll import library (available by default in VS2017), or you can build you own.\nOn my system with <pre><code>mingw</code></pre> and <pre><code>clang</code></pre> installed, I was able to take the code from [2], remove any <pre><code>GetProcAddress/LoadLibrary</code></pre> calls, and build it. This gives:\n<pre><code>#include <stdio.h>\n#include <windows.h>\n#include <winternl.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n    \n    /* load the ntdll.dll */\n    PVOID Info;\n    /* create the string in the right format */\n    UNICODE_STRING filename;\n    RtlInitUnicodeString(&filename, L\"C:\\\\temp.txt\");\n\n    /* initialize OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES */\n    OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES obja;\n    InitializeObjectAttributes(&obja, &filename, OBJ_CASE_INSENSITIVE, NULL, NULL);\n\n    /* call NtOpenFile */\n    IO_STATUS_BLOCK iostatusblock;\n    HANDLE file = NULL;\n    NTSTATUS stat = NtOpenFile(&file, FILE_WRITE_DATA, &obja, NULL, NULL, NULL);\n    if(NT_SUCCESS(stat)) {\n        printf(\"File successfully opened.\n\");\n    }\n    else {\n        printf(\"File could not be opened.\n\");\n    }\n\n    getchar();\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\nTo build, I use:\n<pre><code>clang -target x86_64-w64-windows-gnu toto.c -o toto.exe -lntdll\n</code></pre>\nThen, IDA Free 7.0 allows us to see that <pre><code>NtOpenFile</code></pre> was successfully included in the IAT:\n\nReferences\n[1]: The Rootkit Arsenal, Bill Blunder, Chapter 11, p.480\n[2]: Calling NTDLL functions directly, https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/calling-ntdll-functions-directly\n",
