The console version of this tool (<pre><code>dnSpy.Console.exe</code></pre>) works on all platforms via <pre><code>mono</code></pre>.\nFor deobfuscation of most standard obfuscators, de4dot will help. Supported obfuscators/packers enumerated in README.\nIt should be noted that dnSpy supports the debugger with which you can unpack most non-standard packers by hands.\n",
