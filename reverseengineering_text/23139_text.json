    "content": "I have buffer overflow in a program i check(it is an array of pointers, and i can overflow the data in the first pointer), but the data i can write is not on the stack, it is on a space the system allocated(it does not have name in /proc{id}/maps). and it is not the heap. \nIs there any option to perform code execution via this scenario ? \nAs well as, is there option to overflow different segments ? \nThanks,\n",
