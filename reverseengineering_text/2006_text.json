            "content": "Kernel perspective:\nI will try to answer from the kernel perspective, covering various OS's.\nMemory segmentation is the old way of accessing memory regions.\nAll major operating systems including OSX, Linux, (from version 0.1) and Windows (from NT) are now using paging which is a better way (IMHO) of accessing memory.\nIntel, has always introduced backward compatibility in its processors (except IA-64, and we saw how it failed...)\nSo, in its initial state (after reset) the processor starts in a mode called real mode, in this mode, segmentation is enabled by default to support legacy software.\nDuring the boot process of the operating system, the processor is changed into protected mode, and then in enabled paging.\nBefore paging, the segment registers were used like this\n\nIn real mode each logical address points directly into physical memory\n  location, every logical address consists of two 16 bit parts: The\n  segment part of the logical address contains the base address of a\n  segment with a granularity of 16 bytes, i.e. a segments may start at\n  physical address 0, 16, 32, ..., 220-16. The offset part of the\n  logical address contains an offset inside the segment, i.e. the\n  physical address can be calculated as <pre><code>physical_address := segment_part × 16 + offset</code></pre> (if the address line A20 is enabled),\n  respectively <pre><code>(segment_part × 16 + offset`) mod 220</code></pre> (if A20 is off) Every segment has a size of 216 bytes. [Wikipedia]\n\nLet's see some examples (286-386 era) :\nThe 286 architecture introduced 4 segments: CS (code segment) DS (data segment) SS (stack segment) ES (extra segment)\nthe 386 architecture introduced two new general segment registers FS, GS.\ntypical assembly opcode (in Intel syntax) would look like:\n<pre><code>mov dx, 850h\nmov es, dx     ; Move 850h to es segment register\nmov es:cx, 15h ; Move 15 to es:cx\n</code></pre>\nUsing paging (protected mode) the segment registers weren't used anymore for addressing memory locations.\n\nIn protected mode the <pre><code>segment_part</code></pre> is replaced by a 16 bit selector,\n  the 13 upper bits (bit 3 to bit 15) of the selector contains the index\n  of an entry inside a descriptor table. The next bit (bit 2) specifies\n  if the operation is used with the GDT or the LDT. The lowest two bits\n  (bit 1 and bit 0) of the selector are combined to define the privilege\n  of the request; where a value of 0 has the highest priority and value\n  of 3 is the lowest. [wikipedia]\n\nThe segments however still used to enforce hardware security in the GDT\n\nThe Global Descriptor Table or GDT is a data structure used by Intel\n  x86-family processors starting with the 80286 in order to define the\n  characteristics of the various memory areas used during program\n  execution, including the base address, the size and access privileges\n  like executability and writability. These memory areas are called\n  segments in Intel terminology. [wikipedia]\n\nSo, in practice the segment registers in protected mode are used to store indexes to the GDT.\nSeveral operating systems such as Windows and Linux, use some of the segments for internal usage. for instance Windows x64 uses the <pre><code>GS</code></pre> register to access the TLS (thread local storage) and in Linux it's for accessing cpu specific memory.\nUser perspective:\nFrom the user perspective, in recent operating system that uses paging, the memory works in so called \"flat mode\".\nEvery process access its own memory (4GB) in linear fashion, so basically the segment registers are not needed.\nThey are still registers, so they can of course be used for various other assembly operations.\n",

I don't know about linux, but as you later pointed out in your answer, NT still use segments, for protection (on x86 at least). Privilege levels, or rings, are linked to segments. Hence the subdivision of the address space in (at least) four segments. The address space still look like 4gb flat, but the lower 2 (or 3) GB are one segment with ring 3 access, the upper 2(or 1) is a segment with ring 0 access.</span>",

            "content": "FS points to the exception handling chain, CS and DS are filled from the OS with code and data segment. SS is the battery/stack segment. From what I remember, GS and ES are free.\nIt shouldn't matter much if kernel or user mode (they are used by some instructions like XLAT, MOVS, and some others, so you have to use them in the same way), but just in case I'm talking about programming in user space.\nI had not noticed before, but you're using the notation %fs, not FS, so probably you're meaning Linux, which is another story (also you could be more clear on protected/real mode). You can see also from other answers on stackexchange that linux apparently gives you, in FS and GS, 'thread local storage' and 'processor data area'. CS, DS, and SS should still be code/data/stack.\nFor the sake of the argument, I have no idea how on a Mac you use those registers.\nFor 64 bit it depends: if not in compatibility mode (where you can execute 64 and 32 bit code) then DS, ES, and SS are ignored, and instructions like POP SS give an error. There is no segmentation (the memory model is flat), there should be no real mode (but I think you only mean protected mode?), and if I'm not wrong there isn't hardware task switching.\nThere are further details on CS, FS, and GS (expecially the hidden part) in 64 bit mode, but since it's not used often maybe it's better to omit them.\nYou can check the manuals for the AMD family of processors especially in the case of 64 bit legacy mode:\nhttp://developer.amd.com/resources/documentation-articles/developer-guides-manuals/\n",
