    "content": "Here is a very basic golang program:\n<pre><code>package main\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    var s1 string\n    fmt.Scanln(&s1)\n\n    if s1==\"goodpassword\" {\n        fmt.Println(\"Good\")\n    } else {\n        fmt.Println(\"Wrong\")\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\nI have compiled this program (elf64 linux binary).\nI have diasssembled the binary and i have found the addresses of the 2 fmt.Println calls: \n<pre><code>...\n0x00490d4f     lea rax, obj.main.statictmp_1    ; wrong\n...\n0x00490d99     lea rax, obj.main.statictmp_0    ; good\n...\n</code></pre>\nNow, i have wrote this python program:\n<pre><code>import angr\nfrom angr.state_plugins import SimSystemPosix\n\np = angr.Project('./mybinary')\n\nsm = p.factory.simulation_manager()\nsm.explore(find= 0x00490d99, avoid= 0x00490d4f)\n\nprint(sm.found[0].posix.dumps(0))\n</code></pre>\nI do not understand why angr does not return \"goodpassword\" string.\nI have something wrong but i do not understand what...\nThanks for your help\n",

            "content": "The Go run time is fairly complicated that symbolic solvers will not run out-of-the-box as-is. You are asking <pre><code>angr</code></pre> to figure out everything on it's own which may be feasible for simple and uncomplicated C programs but not for something like Go binaries.\nFor example, the <pre><code>fmt.Scanln</code></pre> function will call multiple Go functions before you reach <pre><code>libc.read</code></pre>. Angr has SimProcedures for <pre><code>read</code></pre> but not for <pre><code>fmt.Scanln</code></pre>. To figure out what <pre><code>fmt.Scanln</code></pre> does it has to symbolically execute after which only it may able to discover the dependency between <pre><code>stdin</code></pre> and the program output. Symbolically executing <pre><code>Scanln</code></pre> is by no way a simple task.\nInstead, you should break down the problem in parts which you can ask <pre><code>angr</code></pre> to solve. Like if you have identified the buffer where the user input is stored you can mark that as symbolic and instruct <pre><code>angr</code></pre> to find the path to the \"good password\" branch.\nFurther resources on Go reversing:\n\nhttps://r3xnation.wordpress.com/2018/01/11/reversing-go-binaries-part-1/\nhttps://2016.zeronights.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/GO_Zaytsev.pdf\nhttps://rednaga.io/2016/09/21/reversing_go_binaries_like_a_pro/\n",
