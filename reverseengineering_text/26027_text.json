    "content": "I have found a function with Cheat Engine that I like to show in IDA:enter image description here\n\nbut the function is not present in IDA.\nProbably I have a bit confusion becouse I don't have experience with this tool.\nCan you help me ?\nThanks !\nUPDATE:\nI have tryed to add image base 400000:\n119EDD + 400000 = 519EDD\nBut 519EDD not exist to IDA:\n\nThere is somthing wrrong ?\n",

            "content": "Have you noted the term <pre><code>battlezone2.exe + </code></pre> before the address? That denotes the (usually random) base address of the executable.\nIn IDA this base address is a fixed value e.g. <pre><code>0x400000</code></pre>. Scroll to the beginning of the IDA View and check the <pre><code>Imagebase</code></pre> value (hexadecimal). This value you have to add to every address shown in the Cheat engine.\nIf debugging a process directly with IDA the database is automatically relocated to the correct address so you don't have to do the math yourself.\nNote: If I interpret the screen shots correctly 0x119EDD (0x519EDD) is the target address of the conditional jump command. Jump commands are used inside a sub, hence you don't leave the current sub and won't find this address in the sub list\n",
