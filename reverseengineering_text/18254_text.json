    "content": "Hi, I would like to edit one compiled java class file & like to insert & edit a couple of lines. I'm trying to make a patch for a software & when I compare this two file the only change I have seen in line 12 & 26. \nAs I'm not a java coder so I don't know how to do that but I read some articles & it suggests that to change a compiled java class there is only two way either get the source code or edit with bytecode editor. I tried to decompile the jar file but it shows huge error. So java byte editor is the only option.\nI want to know how to change these parameters without decompiling the class file in java byte editor.\nPlease help me.\n",
