    "content": "i have been doin ctf challenge and came across a problem when i have to push the address of a function into eip{instruction pointer} by overflowing the buffer but the main problem here is that the address of the function is 0x401199 and in other to push the address i have to push it in reverse order like \\x99\\x11\\x40\\x00 and i have been using python to do so , but the main problem here is that some the these value like \\x99 and \\x11 are associated with non printable character and i cannot guess any other method to do so please some one with time can clear my request\ni hope i explained my query briefly\n",

            "content": "You're describing encoding a Python int into bytes. In this case, the int is a 32-bit unsigned integer.\nUse struct.pack for this:\n<pre><code>>>> struct.pack(\"<I\", 0x401199)\nb'\\x99\\x11@\\x00'\n</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code><</code></pre> means <pre><code>little endian</code></pre> (=smallest byte goes first)\n<pre><code>I</code></pre> means <pre><code>unsigned int</code></pre> (=32-bit on most desktop platforms)\n\nFor the reasons you've describing, these bytes cannot generally be converted into a string: <pre><code>b'\\x99\\x11@\\x00'</code></pre> is not a valid utf-8 encoding.\nFor converting bytes into strings, use the <pre><code>binascii</code></pre> module (+<pre><code>.encode</code></pre> to convert <pre><code>bytes</code></pre> into a Python string)\nFor example:\n<pre><code>>> binascii.b2a_hex(b'\\x99\\x11@\\x00').decode()\n'99114000'\n</code></pre>\n",
