One was to detect <pre><code>ptrace</code></pre> which <pre><code>pwndbg</code></pre> evaded easily but now the when the program expects an input <pre><code>pwndbg</code></pre> interprets it as its own command rather to pass input to the program. Am I missing something??\nExample:\n<pre><code>Waiting to initialize.\nStarted.\nEnter a prompt: e\nAmbiguous command \"e\": eb, echo, ed, edit, egrep, elfsections, emulate, en, enable, end, entry, env, environ, envp, eq...\n</code></pre>\n",
