My small list of plugins that I have found extremely valuable to me are:\n\nHex-Rays Decompiler (commercial) - convert program to pseudo-C\nIDA Toolbag - Adds too much awesome functionality to IDA to list. Just see/read about it.\nIDAscope - Function tagging/inspection, WinAPI lookup, Crypto identification\n\nGranted, this is a very short list. What IDA Pro scripts/plugins do you find essential?\n",

There is a reimplementation as a plugin (but I haven't tried it).  \n<pre><code>memcpy.idc</code></pre> from IDA's idc directory. Very simple but useful when dealing with firmwares that copy code around.\n<pre><code>renimp.idc</code></pre> when doing PE unpacking. Though recently it's been supplanted by UUNP's manual reconstruct feature.\na tiny script to save selected bytes to a file. Useful for extracting embedded binaries from droppers.\n\n\n<pre><code>#include <idc.idc>\nstatic main()\n{\n  auto s,e,f,name;\n  s = SelStart();\n  e = SelEnd();\n  if (s==BADADDR || e==BADADDR)\n    return;\n  name = form(\"dump_%08X.bin\", s);\n  f = fopen(name,\"wb\");\n  Message(\"Saving %a-%a to %s...\", s, e, name);\n  savefile(f,0,s,e-s);\n  Message(\"done.\n\");\n  fclose(f);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nAlso, I often write small IDC or Python snippets that do something specific to the binary I'm reversing, e.g. parsing a custom symbol table, or converting some specific byte sequence to code. These are usually not reused much.\n",
