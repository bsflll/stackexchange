            "content": "Based on the code screenshot you posted it appears you are looking for differences between two memory snap shots. That is you want to know what all changed in the process address space after you step over the call to <pre><code>test.test()</code></pre>.  \nI hope you understand anything can change anywhere when you step over a single unknown arbitrary function over the whole process memory.    \nFor example,\n\nA global variable may be modified  which would normally reside in the writable section of a binary.   \nStack contents may be modified. \nA third / nth module/s  may be loaded and  whole blocks of memory may be added which didn't exist prior to executing the function. \n\netc ..... etc ....  \nYou can't reliably look for what changed between one single step of a function.   \nx64dbg on the trace window provides you what changed on each execution,  you have to scroll and look what changed for each instruction.   \nOr, if you can limit your lookup to a certain memory range you can dump the memory to a file and diff them.   \nx64dbg provides you one command to save a block of memory  \n<pre><code>savedata :memdump: , 0x400000 , 0x1000  \n</code></pre>\nor for that matter all debugger will provide you a mechanism to dump raw data at some address of some size to a file. \n<pre><code>windbg .writemem \nida makesnapshot\nollydbg binary -> backup  or dump in memory map gui\nx64dbg savedata (scriptcommand) or dumpmem in GUI memory map\n</code></pre>\nYou can use a hexeditor like hxd to byte compare two dumps for looking at all changes to a certain region of memory.\nAs a real world example you can set a breakpoint as you have set in the specific code on the screenshot.
