Why is that?\nExample from line 70:\n(**(code **)(*(longlong *)metaStream + 0xd8))(metaStream)\nCall in assembly:\nqword ptr [RAX + 0xd8]\nHow can I make ghidra show me which function is being called?\n",

            "content": "The problem is that Ghidra for whatever reason cannot determine what the actual target of this call is. This might just be a limitation of the C++ support in Ghidra. There are plugins that try to support this better:\n\nhttps://github.com/astrelsky/Ghidra-Cpp-Class-Analyzer\nhttps://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/using-ooanalyzer-to-reverse-engineer-object-oriented-code-with-ghidra/\n\nbut you can also do this manually if you already know the target function via manual reverse engineering:\n<pre><code>ref = program.referenceManager.addMemoryReference(\n                    callsite, # FROM, the address of the call instruction\n                    func_address, //TO, the address of the function being called\n                    RefType.UNCONDITIONAL_CALL,\n                    SourceType.USER_DEFINED,\n                    0)\nprogram.referenceManager.setPrimary(ref, true)\n</code></pre>\n",
