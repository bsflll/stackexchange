I need to perform the analyisis with Ghidra Headless in order to put it in an analysis workflow with other tool. I can't found any guide/tutorial on how to correctly use eclpise to launch ghidra headless and run the current developing script. I had already installed the ghidraDev extension and it can correctly run Ghidra Gui\n",
