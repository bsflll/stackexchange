            "content": "Yes, you can do it.\nIf you are seeked on a given memory address you can get the current function where you are with:\n<pre><code>afi.\n</code></pre>\nNow if you want to seek to the beginning of the function you can make it with:\n<pre><code>s `afi.`\n</code></pre>\nIf you just want to get the address of the beginning of the function but don't want to seek into it, just use the temporary modifier <pre><code>@</code></pre>:\n<pre><code>s @ `afi.`\n</code></pre>\nThis will return the memory address where the function is located.\nOf course you can get that information on any memory address without having to be seeked by using again the <pre><code>@</code></pre> modifier.\n<pre><code>s @ `afi. @ 0x????????`\n</code></pre>\nWhere 0x???????? is any memory address you want to know where the function it is contained in begins. This approach can be pretty useful while scripting with r2pipe, for example.\nPS: backticks are used to get as input the output of command between them.\n",
