Let's try to decode them.\n<pre><code>>>>x = [a.decode('base64') for a in using]</code></pre>\n<pre><code>'2', '105', '78', '82', '73', '68', '79', '98', '88', '67', '68', '83', '19', '17', '16', '22']</code></pre>\nSo they decode to string representations of some numbers. Not sure if this means anything, we need to see how they're used.\n2) The <pre><code>BZ</code></pre> sequence hints at Bzip2. We can try to decompress it as such:\n<pre><code>>>> import bz2\n>>> bz2.decompress(secret)\n'base64'\n</code></pre>\nAnd we're back to square one.\n",

The strange thing about the EXE program that I don't understand is when I using debugger like Olly or Immunity it does not show the strings that the program is using like: \"please enter the password\" or \"wrong password\". I thing that is somehow encrypted so the strings cannot be seen, and this is what give me a hard time to RE this program. Can you suggest how to decrypt the content of the program?</span>",
