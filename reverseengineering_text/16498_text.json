    "content": "Say I have the byte array <pre><code>c1 83 2a 9e f9 ff ff ff</code></pre> (just an example) and I have no idea what the format is. It could be characters in ASCII, UTF-8, could be WORD/DWORD integers in Little or Big Endian, could be 2 floats or 1 double or just anything else. I feel like that would be a situation that occurred extremely often to every reverse engineer.\nSo my question is: Is there a commonly used approach for that kind of problem? Most likely a command line tool that takes the array and displays it in all the different possible representations? Or do people just rely on the given representations of the programs they currently use (ollydbg, cheat engine, hex editor or what ever they happen to use)?\n",

So I guess what you are trying to do is to address this specific example so that I can get an impression of the general concept. Is that right? Your general approach would be to narrow the possibilities by taking in the context? In that case, let's say it's the first 8 bytes of a resource file of unknown type.\n",

Maybe these are just flags. Maybe it's meant to be disassembled for PowerPC. Maybe it's the score variable in a Pacman game. You can try to deduce the meaning by interpreting it in numerous ways, but often that won't cut it.\n",

I miss a sentence in your answer like \"Therefore I would not even try to read the value without knowing how it is used\". Alternatively I hoped for some heuristics, like \"50 52 4F 50 45 52 54 59 00\" has <i>almost</i> no chance of being interpreted as anything but the ASCII string \"PROPERTY\". But how do people find out, that it even <i>can</i> be read as \"PROPERTY\"? Or do they just not?</span>",

For example, if all byte values range between 0x40 and 0x7e its probably ascii code. Even if the values are higher, you could assume its some kind of extended ascii, but there are numerous tables to try. Basically you try 'brute force' by applying every formating you may now. Depending on the context, I would assume 0x50 is an ia386 push eax instruction...</span>",
