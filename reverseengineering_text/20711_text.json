    "content": "This might be a stupid question, but I am trying to learn by myself and I encountered a problem which I cannot solve for the life of me. I tried googling and I can't find anything relevant, so here goes:\nWhen I use the aaa command while not in debug mode, it works fine, but as soon as I go into debug mode and I go into the main function and type aaa, the following shows up:\n[ ] Analyze all flags starting with sym. and entry0 (aa)\nIf I press enter nothing happens and I can just type freely without any effect.\nHow am I supposed to proceed?\n",
