    "content": "I'm trying to reverse a malware that builds its IAT at runtime. Due to my inexperience, I'm having trouble to understand this function that accepts into EAX a dword (maybe some sort of hash) and into EDX the base address of kernel32.dll. Could you point me how can I work it out? I can't use the decompiler right now.\n",

            "content": "The function parses the PE header to locate the <pre><code>IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY</code></pre> which has the structure\n\n<pre><code>NumberOfNames</code></pre> contains the number of symbols exported by this PE and is located at an offset of <pre><code>0x18</code></pre>.\n<pre><code>AddressOfNames</code></pre> is a pointer to an array of null-separated list of exported function names. This is located at offset <pre><code>0x20</code></pre>.\nUsing the <pre><code>NumberOfNames</code></pre> value it iterates over the list of exported function names and calculates a hash value for each.\nThe algorithm to calculate hash is something like.\n<pre><code>#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n    // The name to hash\n    char name[] = \"GetModuleFileNameA\";\n\n    unsigned int hash = 0;\n    unsigned char ch, cl;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<strlen(name); i++)\n    {\n        ch = ((hash >> 8) & 0xFF) ^ name[i];\n        hash = (hash & 0xffff00ff) | (ch << 8);\n        hash = _rotl(hash, 8);        \n        cl =  (hash & 0xFF) ^ ((hash >> 8) & 0xFF);\n        hash = (hash & 0xFFFFFF00) | cl;\n    }\n    printf(\"%08X\", hash);\n}\n</code></pre>\nIf the calculated hash matches, it returns the corresponding address of the API.\nThe above code calculates the hash of <pre><code>GetModuleFileNameA</code></pre> which comes out to <pre><code>416F346F</code></pre>. The code can thus be assumed to be correct.\nCheck here: https://rextester.com/NIBW6473\n",
