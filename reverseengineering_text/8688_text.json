    "content": "I'm usibng IDA 6.5.140116 and cannot seem to get a breakpoint to break.\nMy workflow is:\n\nOpen the Imports subview\nDouble click on the Name column for the row representing GetProcAddress. This jumps to the IDA View-EIP window.\n\n\n\nWith the GetProcAddress line selected, I press F2 to set a breakpoint\n\n\nWhen I run the application, these breakpoints NEVER get hit.  The application isn't using ASLR.  I'm wary about the breakpoint being in .idata when perhaps I need it on the first instruction of GetProcAddress in kernel32.  I'm not sure how to set that exactly.\nI just want to have a breakpoint thrown whenever a certain API call (in this case GetProcAddress... but also RegQueryValueExA for example)  but the press F2 on the address obtained via the Imports window doesn't seem to be working.  What am I missing?  How can I improve my workflow for this?\n",
