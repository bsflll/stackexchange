    "content": "This question sounds rather simple, but I can't seem to find any option for this.\nI'm basically re-creating another database instance of the same binary I already reversed and I want to copy some of the structures I previously created in the previous instance to my new fresh IDA database instance.\nIs there any way of doing so?\nThanks!\n",
