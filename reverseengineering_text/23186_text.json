Can anyone tell me if there is any way to reverse engineer the exe genertaed by nexe?\nThanks in advance!!!\n",

Here's a simple example\n<pre><code>root@67989c78b131:/tmp# echo \"console.log('habibibibi');\" | nexe --build\nℹ nexe 4.0.0-beta.17\n✔ Already downloaded...\n✔ Compiling result\n✔ Entry: '[stdin]' written to: tmp\n✔ Finished in 0.24s\nroot@67989c78b131:/tmp# ./tmp\nhabibibibi\nroot@67989c78b131:/tmp# strings tmp | grep habibi\n    })();;console.log('habibibibi');<nexe~~sentinel>\nroot@67989c78b131:/tmp#\n</code></pre>\nSo a simple hex editor would be enough to extract js code from it and defeat nexe. <pre><code>javascript-obfuscator</code></pre> on the other hand would be a bit trickier but motivated attackers can do that too.\n",
