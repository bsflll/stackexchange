    "content": "I'm looking for an IDA free version previous to 7.0 so I can use it in x86 systems, the current one being only x64, but can't seem to find one and it doesn't look like I saved one neither.\nDoes anyone know where to get one? Or perhaps mind sharing one? (Kind of risky actually, but...)\nIt's great that even the free version is x64 now, but my RE VMs are mostly x86 so it's quite unconvenient for myself.\n",
