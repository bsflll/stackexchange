    "content": "I have the following line (I use IDA PRO) :\n<pre><code>   ...\n   push (offset aPstorec_dllwne+0Ch)      ; lpProcName\n   push esi                               ; hModule\n   call GetProcAddress_0\n   ...\n</code></pre>\nWhen I click on (offset aPstorec_dllwne+0Ch) I use:\n<pre><code>   seg001:004012F0 ; char aPstorec_dllwne[] \n                   aPstorec_dllwne db 'pstorec.dll, 0 , 'WNetEnumCachedPasswords', \n                   0 , 'MPR.DLL' , 0 , 'SeDebugPrivilege', 0 , 0 , 0 , 0\n</code></pre>\nSo my question is: \nHow should I read it to get the info which process is meant? I know that each field of an array is 4 byte and the db at the beginning indicates that.\nBut when I count from zero, I come to the 0 after WNetEnumCachedPasswords. It is wrong, right?\nbest regards\n",

Parameter 2 is \"The function or variable name, or the function's ordinal value.\" Looking at your offset only one of those things is a function name, WNetEnumCachedPasswords.\nYou can verify this as the comment in your post said, by counting 12 (0xc) bytes from aPstorec_dllwne. db stands for databyte and you can also see that \"char aPstorec_dllwne[]\" designates a character array, also 1 byte per element.\n",
