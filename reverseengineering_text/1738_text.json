If you check the <pre><code>kernel32</code></pre> <pre><code>DebugActiveProcess</code></pre> function called by the debugger, OllyDbg or ImmunityDebugger, you will see a call to the <pre><code>CreateRemoteThread</code></pre>, <pre><code>CreateRemoteThreadEx</code></pre>, or <pre><code>ZwCreateThreadEx</code></pre> function depending on your OS.\nSo, i guess one way to bypass breaking is:\n\ndebug the debugger itself\ngo to the <pre><code>DbgUiIssueRemoteBreakin</code></pre> function and spot the call to the function creating the remote thread.\nchange the <pre><code>lpStartAddress</code></pre> parameter in case of <pre><code>CreateRemoteThread</code></pre>/<pre><code>CreateRemoteThreadEx</code></pre> to <pre><code>DbgBreakPoint</code></pre>+1 <pre><code>RETN 0xC3</code></pre>\n\nPlugin\nI created an OllyDbg v1.10 plugin which <pre><code>NOP</code></pre>s the <pre><code>INT3</code></pre> in <pre><code>DbgBreakPoint</code></pre> in the process with the PID you choose. It has only been tested on Windows 7.\nUsage\nPlace SilentAttach.dll in OllyDbg directory, fire OllyDbg, Press Alt+F12, and then enter process Id of the process you want to silently attach to.\nN.B.\nSince no break occurs, OllyDbg does not extract many piece of info. e.g. list of loaded module. So, you have to activate the context by something like Alt+E then Alt+C\n",

It's a common anti-debugging trick.\n",

            "content": "I don't think this is possible without doing something extremely invasive. Either patching OllyDbg to use an alternative ZwXX/NtXX function which accepts some flags or patching the kernel. The initial break is done by the operating system so that the debugger can gather information about the process it is being attached to.\nI haven't verified but my guess is that OllyDbg is calling DebugActiveProcess in order to attach to it. The documentation for it states:\n\nAfter the system checks the process identifier and determines that a valid debugging attachment is being made, the function returns TRUE. Then the debugger is expected to wait for debugging events by using the WaitForDebugEvent function. The system suspends all threads in the process, and sends the debugger events that represents the current state of the process.\n\nAnd later on\n\nAfter all of this is done, the system resumes all threads in the process. When the first thread in the process resumes, it executes a breakpoint instruction that causes an EXCEPTION_DEBUG_EVENT debugging event to be sent to the debugger. All future debugging events are sent to the debugger by using the normal mechanism and rules.\n",
