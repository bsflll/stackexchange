    "content": "I'm learning a bit about <pre><code>PE files</code></pre>. The thing I've struggling a bit now it the <pre><code>First Thunk</code></pre> and <pre><code>Original First Thunk</code></pre> fields. To understand the difference between them I've read this post and that article. To test the problem \"live\" I've opened said <pre><code>shell32.dll</code></pre> or <pre><code>notepad.exe</code></pre> files in <pre><code>PE-bear</code></pre> and <pre><code>IDA</code></pre> BUT that appears the there is NO <pre><code>import binding</code></pre> in case of that files in contrast to what the articles say. Here are my question now:\nWhy there is NO <pre><code>import binding</code></pre> in these files?\nHere are the first and the second article.\nPlease don't down-vote the question if it appears to lame because I'm just newbie in the topic.\n",
