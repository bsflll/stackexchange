            "content": "If it is ARM architecture that may use THUMB encoding it can be result of the following issue:\nIf I remember correctly, calls to the virtual functions can be executed with assembly command similar to <pre><code>BLX</code></pre> as indirect jump, which allows switching between ARM and THUMB encoding. In this case this <pre><code>+ 1</code></pre> means that the target of the jump is encoded in THUMB.\nSee here for more information about this mechanism.\n\nAll these instructions cause a branch to label, or to the address\n  contained in Rm. In addition:\n\nThe BL and BLX instructions copy the address of the next instruction into lr (r14, the link register).\nThe BX and BLX instructions can change the processor state from ARM to Thumb, or from Thumb to ARM. BLX label always changes the state. BX\n  Rm and BLX Rm derive the target state from bit[0] of Rm:\nif bit[0] of Rm is 0, the processor changes to, or remains in, ARM state\nif bit[0] of Rm is 1, the processor changes to, or remains in, Thumb state.\n",
