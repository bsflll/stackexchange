    "content": "I'm interested in patching ELF files using IDA and the following PE utilities have proven very useful for patching PEs.\nDoes anyone know if there are some publicly available IDA scripts similar to Atli Mar Gudmundsson's set of PE utilities, but for ELF binaries instead of PEs? It doesn't matter if they are IDC or IDAPython.\n",
