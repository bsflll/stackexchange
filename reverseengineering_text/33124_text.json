    "content": "I have a fairly large function that I'm trying to decompile in Ghidra. There's a local variable (that either I have incorrectly typed, or Ghidra did it itself) that I try to retype to <pre><code>int</code></pre>. They are the same size in memory. It has some incorrect <pre><code>enum</code></pre> type.\nI right-click on it and select \"Retype variable\" and then type \"int\" and click OK:\n\nGhidra starts churning something and then after a second or two ... nothing changes.\nWhy is it refusing to change the type this local variable?\n",
