    "content": "Suppose you have code like this (and you don't want to shell out the amount for the HexRays decompiler plugin):\n<pre><code>loc_4BEEEF:                             ; CODE XREF: DriverEntry+28j\n                push    50505050h       ; Tag\n                push    1234h           ; NumberOfBytes\n                push    ebx             ; PoolType\n                call    ds:ExAllocatePoolWithTag\n                cmp     eax, ebx\n                jz      short loc_4BEEFF\n</code></pre>\nNow for these cases I tend to write IDC scripts that collapse the <pre><code>push</code></pre>, <pre><code>push</code></pre>, <pre><code>push</code></pre>, <pre><code>call</code></pre> into a single hidden area.\nHowever, since the hidden areas in IDA seem to be based on the address and the first <pre><code>push</code></pre> is a \"named location\", the indication that this is a label gets lost when I \"name\" my hidden area with descriptive pseudo-code, like this:\n<pre><code>; eax := ExAllocatePoolWithTag(ebx, 1234h, 'PPPP')\n                cmp     eax, ebx\n                jz      short loc_4BEEFF\n</code></pre>\nand if I can deduce the value of <pre><code>ebx</code></pre>, as would be possible here, I'd even convert that into:\n<pre><code>; eax := ExAllocatePoolWithTag(NonpagedPool, 1234h, 'PPPP')\n                cmp     eax, ebx\n                jz      short loc_4BEEFF\n</code></pre>\nIs there any way, short of starting my hidden area after the first <pre><code>push</code></pre>, that would allow me to hide the instructions and replace them with more descriptive pseudo-code, while at the same time retaining the label/name that coincides with the passing of the (last) argument?!\nThat is, my goal is to have it something like:\n<pre><code>loc_4BEEEF:                             ; CODE XREF: DriverEntry+28j\n; eax := ExAllocatePoolWithTag(NonpagedPool, 1234h, 'PPPP')\n                cmp     eax, ebx\n                jz      short loc_4BEEFF\n</code></pre>\n(the comment behind the <pre><code>loc_4BEEEF</code></pre> label is not important to me, though)\nOf course allocation is but one of the cases where this applies and where the first pushed (i.e. last) argument ends up at a named location.\n",

You could then put the remaining <pre><code>push</code></pre>es and <pre><code>call</code></pre> into a hidden area, or alternatively, set manual instructions for those <pre><code>push</code></pre> and <pre><code>call</code></pre> instructions with <pre><code></code></pre> (blank space) as the manual instruction value.\n",
