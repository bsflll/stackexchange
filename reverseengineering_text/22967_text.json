            "content": "J5 looks like a UART connector and the <pre><code>JT_</code></pre> pins are likely JTAG. UART should give you console access to manufacturing/diagnostic commands, and JTAG should allow you to the debug the code (firmware) running on the controller CPU.\nAs for J3, at a guess, ROM/FW allows you to switch from the firmware stored in the flash to the built-in CPU boot ROM (e.g. in case flash is corrupted and firmware can't boot properly).\n",
