    "content": "Has anybody gotten Immunity Debugger to work on windows 10 yet? I downloaded it on Windows 10, launch it as administrator, and the GUI opens for about half a second and then it exits, no errors or messages. I have python installed, I reinstalled immunity multiple times, and I tried running it in Windows 7 compatibility mode. Nothing seems to work. My theory is that some dll is missing or changed. Any ideas or is it just my computer? Also, Ollydbg does work on 10, but I find Immunity debugger more useful.\n",

I am using Python 2.7.11 which is the currently latest release for the 2.x series. \nSo, to make Immunity Debugger work on Windows 10 modify(and ADD if necessary) the following environment variables(assuming Python is installed at <pre><code>C:\\Python27</code></pre>):\n\n<pre><code>PATH=\"C:\\python27;%PATH%\"</code></pre>\n<pre><code>PYTHONHOME=\"C:\\python27\"</code></pre>\n<pre><code>PYTHONPATH=\"C:\\Python27\\DLLs;C:\\Python27\\Lib;C:\\Python27\\Lib\\site-packages\"</code></pre>\n\nThe following changes made it work for me.\n",

Right-click on the Start button and select system, then on the right select advanced options, then at the bottom of the next window select environment variables, then you should be able to edit and add to the PATH variable.
