I'm considering two 5 hour sessions.\nThe objective is for the students to be able to use linux tools and and reverse engineering tools (specifically radare2/GDB) to start doing CTFs and crackmes to practice. The target audience is software engineers, developers and students. Having said that and after a few conversations with potential participants, quality here is mediocre at best so I rather prepare for the worse and assume some participants won't even know the behind the scenes of a compilation process.\nWhat I have so far is the following:\n\nLinux usage\nMemory map\nBinary sections\nPassing function arguments\nRadare installation\nQuick intro to x86 assembler\nGdb\nStacks - return address\nstack canaries\nBuffer overflows\nShellcode\nNop slides\nCTFâ€™s challenges\n",
