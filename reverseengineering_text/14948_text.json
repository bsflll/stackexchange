    "content": "My lecturers have requested that I debug <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre> in order to understand how it works and develop new features so that it can extract more. I tried to use <pre><code>gdb</code></pre> to debug <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre> but it results in the error message \"/usr/bin/binwalk\": not in executable format: File format not recognized\". What other tool can be used to debug it?\n",

Since <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre> is written in Python and interpreted by the Python interpreter instead of being compiled in to an executable binary that conforms to one of the aforementioned formats, <pre><code>gdb</code></pre> cannot be used to dynamically analyze <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre>.\n\nMy lecturers have requested that I debug binwalk in order to understand how it works and develop new features so that it can extract more.\n\nIf your primary goal is extending the functionality of <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre>, then dynamically analyzing it may not be as productive as looking at \n\nthe the source code\n\nas well as documentation on \n\nThe signature file format\nCreating custom signatures\nCreating custom plugins\nScripting with the API\n\nBut if \"debugging\" <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre> is the primary focus, then pdb or using a Python IDE will work.\n",
