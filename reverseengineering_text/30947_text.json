    "content": "I'm working on a localization project and have a few trampoline hooks to translate some text in an online game. Periodically throughout gameplay, there are checks that run in the background to ensure the <pre><code>.text</code></pre> section of the game hasn't been modified. Of course I've done this with the existence of trampoline hooks, so the check fails and I'm met with what looks like a custom error code of <pre><code>INVALID_CALL_1</code></pre>.\nI've attempted for months to figure out how this checksum is calculated, but I don't believe I have the skills necessary to figure this out, so I'm looking at other options.\nI'm wondering if this logic seems reasonable, but would you theoretically be able to re-direct how the exception is handled using something like SetUnhandledExceptionFilter to check if the exception matches <pre><code>INVALID_CALL_1</code></pre> and have it return <pre><code>EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION</code></pre> instead? I don't mind doing the work, but wanted to know if my logic is flawed as I haven't worked with the Windows API all that much and am unsure where to ask this question.\nThanks.\n",
