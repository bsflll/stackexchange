    "content": "I'm trying to create UART cable for A520F phone with USB type-c. Seems, there is no UART debug modes S8+ either.  On Samsung phones with micro USB one may access UART JIG mode with  619K resistor, connected to micro USB ID pin. \nHow I test:\nI can dump MUIC registers. I have raw usb type c plug(mounted on board with solder pads), with cable soldered, which maps usb type c pins on breadboard. So I assemble test scheme and analyze MUIC registers and MUIC linux kernel module log output upon attachment.\nWhat I currently find:\n\nThe receptacle is managed by s2mu004 kernel module. Module is capable to manage non type-c receptacles (see CONFIG_MUIC_S2MU004_NON_USB_C_TYPE option)\nReceptacle has non standard pinout: B12 (considering, A row facing top, B row facing bottom side of the phone) pin is not connected to the ground.\nDevice can detect water in usb receptacle, by measuring resistance between B12 pin.\nDevice can detect plug attach, with ALL pins unconnected, including GND and VBUS pins. How?\nAttaching 619K resistor to B12 pin results in ADC_JIG_UART_ON value in ADC register, during water detection sequence.\nAttaching 619K resistor to one of CC pins result in no device connected.\nEnter UART mode by attaching resistors should be possible in NON type-c mode. (file s2mu004-muic.c ,lines 2835,2797)\nDevice has no USB type-c debug accessory mode(tried both with rd/rd and rp/rp resistors on CC pins) - rd/rd results in OTG mode.\n\nWhat else can I try?\nIf you were this device developer, how would you hide UART debug mode from users?\n",
