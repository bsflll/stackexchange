    "content": "Is there a way to display all the open handles of a process in IDA Pro while debugging it?\nI'm debugging a 64-bit binary on Windows OS with the win64_remotex64.exe as the debugging server.\nI want to display the list of all the open handles in the process:\n<pre><code>Open file handles\nOpen registry handles\nOpen socket handles\n</code></pre>\nDebuggers such as Olly Debugger allow to see the complete list. Is it possible to see the same in IDA Pro?\nInformation should be as shown below:\n<pre><code>handle_id - path to the file\n</code></pre>\nThanks.\n",
