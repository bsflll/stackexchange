    "content": "In viewing the diff for two files, a method in the original file starts with:\n<pre><code>push    ebp\nmov     ebp, esp\n</code></pre>\nand in the modified file, it starts with:\n<pre><code>push 0\npop rax\nretn\nendp\n</code></pre>\nIn essence, the modified file is patched to avoid running the method. My question is, what byte do I need to patch in IDA to achieve the same effect?\n",

You might want to sort that out before proceeding.\nThat said, in IDA:\n\nlocate the method in the graph view, or disassembly view. The bottom line in this view will show you the load address of the current instruction as well as the offset in the loaded file, this will help you finding the correct address\nput the cursor on the <pre><code>push ebp</code></pre> instruction`\nfrom the menu, use 'Edit/Patch program/Assemble'\nenter your assembly code, line by line\nwhen done, use 'Edit/Patch program/Apply patches to input file' to save back your changes\n",
