    "content": "I'm debugging an obfuscated android application. I use Android Studio's debugger. I attach it remotely to my physical device via adb. I can set a breakpoint in the app smali code, but when I try to step into a function in an external library, the code browser stays at the caller's place (I expected it to show me the called function's disassebly smali output), but stack trace and the variables output follows the called function as expected. Why is that? Can't java debugger inform Android Studio about the instructions to which the code jumped even though they are in an external library?\nAlso, I know the app calls some functions <pre><code>com.android.conscrypt</code></pre>. Can I set a breakpoint in an external library like this one? If Android Studio can't do that, what other tools can?\n",

I am not sure if AS is capable of debugging arbitrary native libraries you don't have the source code. Also most native libraries come stripped, so without debugging data which makes debugging difficult. For reverse engineering Android apps that make use of native libraries I would recommend to use frida.re in combination with a good decompiler/disassembler like Ghidra or IDA Pro.\n",
