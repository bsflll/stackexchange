    "content": "Some times IDA's decompiler translates more than variables into a single variable or an array of varibles, for example, I have 2 variables\n<pre><code>A a; // size = 30h\nB b; // size = 60h\n</code></pre>\nbut IDA gives\n<pre><code>A arr[3];\n</code></pre>\nhow can I split them out?\n",

Afterwards, IDA will automatically create new variables that will fill in the remaining stack space, you can also redefine their type if needed.\n",
