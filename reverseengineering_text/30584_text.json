    "content": "I was working with an old ios game, and found that it saved most of its data (players, worlds, anything in-between) in <pre><code>MDB</code></pre> files.. titled <pre><code>data.mdb</code></pre> and <pre><code>lock.mdb</code></pre>. There is a pair for every object type (A players save data, world settings and config, world data (terrain))\nAt first I thought it was some strange microsoft database thing, but apparently they are <pre><code>PSI</code></pre> binary files after doing some more digging. I could be wrong.\nI am trying to understand how these formats work and if there is a particular known way to decompile them into something readable? Or are these a type of cryptographically sealed binary file, where they are compiled with a hash / password / key?\nI honestly have no clue where to start.\nHere is a sample from \"world_db\" which I assume represents the save data of the entire worlds terrain and items: https://github.com/MisterSirCode/world_db\nIf anyone could give me some clues or potentially has any information about these <pre><code>MDB</code></pre> files or <pre><code>PSI v1</code></pre> binary files I would appreciate it.\nAll I can assume is that <pre><code>lock.db</code></pre> is the binary passcode / hash if it is a sealed binary file, since its so much smaller than the <pre><code>data.db</code></pre> file\n\nThe <pre><code>lock.db</code></pre> file just looks like a 4 letter term repeated randomly\n\nSomething else that might be related? https://github.com/LMDB\n",
