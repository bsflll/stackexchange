    "content": "Is there a way to ascertain - without special equipment (other than what a \"layman electronics enthusiast\" may have around) - how many layers a PCB has?\nIs there some sort of marking or a technique to deduce it?\nOnly other requirement: it should not damage the PCB.\nThis question is loosely related to that one, but hardly a duplicate.\n",
