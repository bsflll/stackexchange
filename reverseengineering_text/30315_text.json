    "content": "I am a beginner in RE. I compiled some code (x86 32bit), and opened it up in Ghidra.\nI come across the following instruction right before a call:\nMOV dword ptr [ESP], 0x3c\nWhere 0x3c is the offset to the start of a string in .rdata, so this acts as a parameter to the proceeding function call which takes a char* data type as an argument.\nThe question is, why does the compiler decide to do this instead of a simple PUSH 0x3c?\nThanks!\n",
