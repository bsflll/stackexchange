I've managed to use it for a router that uses the same encryption key (ZXHN H267A V1.0) and the re-encrypted file seems byte-perfect.\nIt's not instantly obvious (at least with this particular key), but the answer is quite simple: RouterPassView gives you the key's hex representation, whereas zcu wants it in plain text. If you convert the key you wrote into text you get: <pre><code>402c38de39bed665</code></pre>\nBtw, since I saw people ask for the config.bin, before you share it, keep in mind that the file probably contains a bunch of sensitive info (passwords used by the router and potentially your phone number if it supports VoIP).\nGood luck, have fun!\n",
