    "content": "I found this post stating that Radare can work with Boomerang. However when I try do exactly as they say, I get the following error: <pre><code>sh: 1: rsc: not found</code></pre>.\nFrom what I can see, <pre><code>rsc</code></pre> is an extra utility that would have come in with Radare1. See here.\nI understand that ! causes Radare to execute a shell command so I therefore need the <pre><code>rsc</code></pre> utility. However I cannot find it anywhere!\nI'm using Radare2 0.10.0 compiled from git and Boomerang compiled from git as well.\nDoes anyone know what the state of these two tools working together is?\n",

            "content": "Hello o/ this is the radare1book concerning radare1, use the radare2book for radare2. Boomerang hasn't been yet added to r2 in this version, you can use <pre><code>pdc</code></pre> and retdec (see r2pm). We are actually working on radeco. But you can always contribute and maybe add back this support to r2 ? That would be interesting\n",
