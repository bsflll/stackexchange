Each of them do have a specific syntax to specify  your program. But, they share a lot on assembly instructions.\nThen, Intel and AT&T are specific syntax to write x86 assembly programs. In fact, <pre><code>nasm</code></pre> and <pre><code>masm</code></pre> use the Intel syntax, where <pre><code>gas</code></pre> is using the AT&T syntax.\n",
