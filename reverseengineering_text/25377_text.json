            "content": "The dashed line is added by IDA to denote code flow boundaries. For example, you can see another one after the unconditional <pre><code>jmp</code></pre>, and there should be one after each <pre><code>retn</code></pre> instruction. In graph view they correspond to the end of function graph nodes.\nThe most probable cause for the one after call is that the called function has been detected as non-returning.\nYou can go inside the call and see if \"Attributes: noreturn\" is printed in the function header. If the function does, in fact, return, you can clear the flag by editing the function properties (Alt-P).\n",
