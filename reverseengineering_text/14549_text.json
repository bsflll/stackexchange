    "content": "This windows application checks the available disk space when an attempt is made to enable a feature.\nThe error message can be translated into \"You need 2145461018 more bytes to load this tileset.\nChoosing other tilesets might even yield a message claiming that a negative amount of bytes is needed. This could indicate a buffer overflow. Notice the window title \"Error space on disk\".\nI would like to disable that memory check using the simplest method possible, but I am willing to disassemble it despite having next to zero knowledge which winapi calls are using to check the free disk space. I am grateful for any hint!\nI already tried the compatibility options on the shortcut properties, which didn't help.\nThe error can also be reproduced in a vm guest with windows.\nPE Explorer shows this is a WIN32 GUI app with a subsystem version 3.10\n",
