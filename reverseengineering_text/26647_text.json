    "content": "As part of challenging my self I was trying to run a program that doesn't exist on Catlina taken from Big Sur.\nI had to extract the dylibs from the shared cache by using this tool.\nThe library called ChatKit, after the extraction it seems there are missing values under the Dynamic Loader Info and isn't expanded, see an example:\n\nIn addition, trying to open the program or by import it externally, e.g:\n<pre><code>#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <dlfcn.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv)\n{\n    void *handle;\n\n    handle = dlopen(\"./Chatkit\", RTLD_LAZY);\n    if (!handle) {\n        /* fail to load the library */\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Error: %s\n\", dlerror());\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    }\n\n    dlclose(handle);\n\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\ndyld throwing an error: Overlapping segments, because the segments' address lower is bigger than the higher? https://opensource.apple.com/source/dyld/dyld-360.21/src/ImageLoaderMachO.cpp\n<pre><code>...\n    if ( this->segmentsCanSlide() && this->segmentsMustSlideTogether() ) {\n        bool needsToSlide = false;\n        bool imageHasPreferredLoadAddress = segHasPreferredLoadAddress(0);\n        uintptr_t lowAddr = (unsigned long)(-1);\n        uintptr_t highAddr = 0;\n        for(unsigned int i=0, e=segmentCount(); i < e; ++i) {\n            const uintptr_t segLow = segPreferredLoadAddress(i);\n            const uintptr_t segHigh = dyld_page_round(segLow + segSize(i));\n            if ( segLow < highAddr ) {\n                if ( dyld_page_size > 4096 )\n                    dyld::throwf(\"can't map segments into 16KB pages\");\n                else\n                    dyld::throwf(\"overlapping segments\");\n            }\n            if ( segLow < lowAddr )\n                lowAddr = segLow;\n            if ( segHigh > highAddr )\n                highAddr = segHigh;\n                \n            if ( needsToSlide || !imageHasPreferredLoadAddress || inPIE || !reserveAddressRange(segPreferredLoadAddress(i), segSize(i)) )\n                needsToSlide = true;\n        }\n</code></pre>\nyou can retrieve ChatKit dylib from here\n",

            "content": "It seems the tool you are using is optimized for getting correct disassembly/symbols and not necessarily getting a runnable(acceptable by dyld) binary. Besides, the readme mentions that it does not support format changes in Beta 9 and later so it probably won’t work with the final release.\nThe dyld cache format is highly optimized and a lot of information is shared by multiple libraries so it’s not easy to extract just the information used by the one you need (and put it back in correct locations). You can try opening an issue on GitHub but I expect you’ll have to implement it yourself if you really want to get this working.\n",
