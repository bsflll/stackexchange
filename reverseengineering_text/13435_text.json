    "content": "I have a set of data bytes and their CRC values available to me. I want to know the CRC algorithm used by it.\nCRC is 16 bit long.\nfirstly I tried to find out using CRC RevEng but that is showing \"no model found message\".\nThen I followed CRC Reverse Engineeing paper written by Greg Ewing.\nThen I found that my data set is following the superposition principle\nso I came to the conclusion that it is using some standard algorithm to calculate CRC.\nAccording to Greg's paper: \n\ntwo CRC values obtained from two 1-bit messages, where the 1 bits are in adjacent positions, will have thier resulting CRCs differ by just one shift-xor cycle. To be precise, if C1 corresponds to the message with a 1 in position <pre><code>i</code></pre>, and C2 corresponds to the message with a 1 in position <pre><code>i+1</code></pre>, then C1 is derived from applying one shift-xor cycle to C2. (If this seems backwards, it's because the further the 1 bit is from the end of the message, the more shift-xor cycles get applied to the CRC.)\nThere are two possibilities. If the leading bit of C2 (the one about to be shifted out) is 0, then C1 will be equal to C2 shifted by one place. If it is 1, then C2 will be equal to C1 shifted one place and xored with the polynomial.\"\n\nIn my case polynomial is not coming same every time.\nI have printed CRC values for different messages, their LSB and CRC value after right shift operation and polynomial value to be XORed in order to drive C1 from C2\n\nI have observed that I can get C1 from C2 by three polynomial values which are shown in above image 0x9008, 0x8000, 0x1008\nI don't know why it is coming different.\nI am stuck at this point\nI'm hoping that I can get more hints here on Reverse Engineering Stack Exchange.\nRoy\n",
