            "content": "Depending on what you're looking to accomplish, you have a handful of options:\n\nUse RL!dePacker 1.5, which supports unpacking Stone's PE Encryptor 2.0. The technology at the core of this unpacker, TitanEngine, has been immensely improved since its implementation back then, and is available as open source via ReversingLabs. Official video tutorial from RL can be viewed here.\nFUU utilizes TitanEngine and has signatures for multiple versions of Stone's PE Encryptor, including v2.0.\nUse The aPE, which allows for patching of supported packed binaries--Stone's PE Encryptor v2.0 being one of the supported packers.\nA code search on GitHub for \"PE Encryptor v2.0\" yields additional results you may want to sift through in case any of the solutions above don't pan out.\n",
