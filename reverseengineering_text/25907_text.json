    "content": "from past few days i am fiddling with the firmware file of dvb s2 receiver of gx6605s processor.\nmy preliminary purpose is to read the hidden menu password for given firmware.(password used to hide-unhide menu)\nDump.bin extraction gives 7 other bin files boot.bin,data.bin,info.bin,kernel.bin,logo.bin,root.bin,table.bin..\nKernel.bin is lzma compressed so using a hex editor i removed the lzma header to search the menu password but could'nt find it may be due to a lay man's approach.I also used binwalk with various commands to further extract the fragments but now clueless what to do next.\nI request the group members to help me & guide me in choosing the appropriate approach.\nThank you..\nfirmware link is shared below\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1c2SyGaHu5I9P1jRCWKQomAYNQBYbgmg4/view?usp=sharing\n",
