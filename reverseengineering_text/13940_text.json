There are companies who have worked out how to on certain ECUs and supply the data. Often the solution is just to change one or two bytes of data. \nIm struggling to understand how they would go about finding what bit of data to change, obviously they don't just each bit of data bit by bit and hope for the best as there would be millions of combinations.\nHow would you approach reverse engineering such system?\n",

That would be a good place to start if you can get hold of it. Alternatively would it be possible to monitor the pins when the chips is in place and work out what values the control devices read from the EEPROM up to and including engine start? That might narrow down the candidates to try changing.\n",

Monitoring reads/writes as @Rup mentions may work in some cases but the only 100% reliable way IMO would be to RE the code (e.g. ECU/immobilizer firmware) which reads and writes this data to see how it's processed.\n",
