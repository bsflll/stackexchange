            "content": "This is not anti-debug but the standard way the Win32 debugging API implements process attaching. The thread with <pre><code>DbgBreakPoint</code></pre> call is injected by the OS to ensure that the process gets stopped, since it could be in unknown state otherwise. Most debuggers should handle it transparently, but if yours does not, just set breakpoints on some APIs youâ€™re interested in and resume the process. The breakpoint thread will exit but the other threads will continue to run and will hopefully hit your breakpoints. Alternatively you can just switch to main or another thread once paused, and inspect the call stack to see what the program is doing.\n",
