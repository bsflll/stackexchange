            "content": "After decompressing and loading the kernel, you need to find a couple of tables that encode the compressed symbol table. These are (in the usual order they are placed in binary):\n\n<pre><code>kallsyms_addresses</code></pre> - a table of addresses to all public symbols in the kernel\n<pre><code>kallsyms_num_syms</code></pre> - not a table but just an integer with total number of symbols (should match previous table)\n<pre><code>kallsyms_names</code></pre> - a list of length-prefixed byte arrays that encode indexes into the token table\n<pre><code>kallsyms_token_table</code></pre> - a list of 256 zero-terminated tokens from which symbol names are built\n<pre><code>kallsyms_token_index</code></pre> - 256 shorts pointing to the corresponding entry in <pre><code>kallsyms_token_table</code></pre>\n\nThey're not hard to find with some experience. A good way to find the first one is to look for several 0xC0008000 values in a row, because a typical kernel symbol table starts like this:\n<pre><code>C0008000 T __init_begin\nC0008000 T _sinittext\nC0008000 T _stext\nC0008000 T stext\n</code></pre>\nAfter locating the tables the symbol recovery is trivial. I made a script for IDA that does it automatically, you can find it here (<pre><code>kallsyms.py</code></pre> in the tools zip).\nFor more the details of how it's implemented in the kernel, see <pre><code>kernel/kallsyms.c</code></pre>.\n",

            "content": "This is a bit tricky to answer without getting my hands on the file and verifying a few assumptions based on the question and the linked answer. However, let me try, perhaps we can extend it further if you elaborate more on some aspects of the file.\nWe know it's an ARM file and from your description this pretty much sounds like an ARM kernel image for U-Boot. Now the problem is that I cannot know whether that's true, but you could run the oft mentioned <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre> or <pre><code>firmware-mod-kit</code></pre> on the file to see what that gives you.\nIf this is an ARM kernel image for U-Boot, you can likely get to the <pre><code>gzip</code></pre> data by skipping the first 64 Bytes of the image (see this answer over at StackOverflow). The gist is:\n<pre><code>dd if=<image> of=<recovered file> bs=64 skip=1\n</code></pre>\nThis skips 1 block of 64 bytes and otherwise writes the data from <pre><code><image></code></pre> into <pre><code><recovered file></code></pre>. Essentially it reverses - in part - the effects of the <pre><code>mkimage</code></pre> tool, which is part of U-Boot.\nNow, assuming everything so far works - and that is a huge assumption - you should be able to decompress (<pre><code>gzip -d</code></pre>) the resulting file and end up with something you can hopefully <pre><code>grep</code></pre>. If I was you I'd then use <pre><code>file</code></pre> to check what kind of file it is and process it further if I happened to get anything meaningful out of it. If not, I would treat the file with <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre> again and failing that run <pre><code>strings</code></pre> on it.\n\nEdit x+1:\nOkay, tried the process myself. Downloaded this Debian package, unpacked it, got a <pre><code>zImage-2.6.28.10-power51</code></pre> which I then looked at in 010 Editor and it's true, this is an ARM kernel image according to the marker (see reading section below):\n\nAfter that I tried to skip the first 64 Byte and then decompress the rest, to no avail. Investigating a bit more.\nIf you manage to get more information using this incomplete answer, please edit your question and I'll amend my answer once I notice your edit, to add more (hopefully useful) information.\nEdit x+2:\nOkay, for the zImage in question it turns out <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre>, mentioned in my original answer, can at least handle the file and outputs:\n<pre><code>12900           0x3264          gzip compressed data, from Unix, last modified: Mon Jul 23 13:41:37 2012, max compression\n</code></pre>\nLovely. Do let's run <pre><code>dd</code></pre> to extract the <pre><code>gzip</code></pre> stuff and then extract it:\n<pre><code>dd if=zImage-2.6.28.10-power51 of=extract.gz bs=12900 skip=1 && gunzip extract.gz && ls -l extract\n</code></pre>\nOnce I extracted it, I ran <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre> again after noticing that <pre><code>file</code></pre> didn't yield a result:\n<pre><code>DECIMAL         HEX             DESCRIPTION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n135456          0x21120         gzip compressed data, from Unix, last modified: Mon Jul 23 13:38:47 2012, max compression\n973460          0xEDA94         ELF\n1070320         0x1054F0        CramFS filesystem, big endian size 2126262976 CRC 0xdc0a0e1, edition 4040895977, 78662882 blocks, 271618533 files\n</code></pre>\nHowever, I don't want to  proceed now without further input from you. Just an example how it could be investigated. One more thing <pre><code>strings</code></pre> does produce a list of symbols, but since I presume you want symbols and their addresses, I reckon there is more to be investigated.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nthis documentation to verify whether this indeed is an ARM kernel image in the format we expect/assume. In particular check the assumption that <pre><code>0x016F2818</code></pre> can be found at offset <pre><code>0x24</code></pre>.\nthis forum entry, in particular the post by user fattire, which mentions\n\nThere's a 64 byte header you have to cut off of uRamdisk/uRecRam:\n<pre><code>dd if=uRamdisk of=uRamdisk.cpio.gz bs=64 skip=1</code></pre>\n<pre><code>gunzip uRamdisk.cpi.gz</code></pre>\n<pre><code>cpio -i -F uRamdisk.cpio</code></pre>\n\nwhich essentially implies that you have to expect an <pre><code>initrd</code></pre> (hence the CPIO format) at offset 64. That is, the \"kernel image\" would actually turn out to be the old kernel format which embedded the <pre><code>initrd</code></pre> (also see <pre><code>mkimage</code></pre> man page under \"Create old legacy image\").\n",
