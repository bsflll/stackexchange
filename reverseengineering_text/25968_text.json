    "content": "I'm decompiling a binary file for a Infineon Tricore processor, the code is incomplete and only contains part of the code so will not execute. The auto analysis did a great job and the code is readable but I have 1 snag with the address offsets.\nCurrently a large part of the code uses a static address offset which are set into [a0]. I know this to be a value of 0xd0008000 and it never changes but can't figure out a way of forcing this during the analysis.\nFor example, the code will load an address register like this:\n[a0]0x50f0\nI know this should should be 0xd000d0f0 but the auto analysis will just show [a0]0x50f0.\nI can force each reference on a local basis by hitting Ctrl+R and manually adding the offset but I'm interested to know what the correct method is.\nThanks,\nDave\n",
