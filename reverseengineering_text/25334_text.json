    "content": "I'm reversing some stuff that has RTTI, so finding vftables is easy.\nI have an instance of some class <pre><code>some_object</code></pre>, there is a method being called through its <pre><code>__vftable</code></pre>. The <pre><code>method_4</code></pre> has a type of <pre><code>data_struct *(__thiscall *method_4)(void *not_sure, data_struct *data_struct, int a3)</code></pre>. It looks like this:\n\nIs there a way to actually click on <pre><code>method_4</code></pre> here and go to the pointer in the vftable/the underlaying <pre><code>sub_<something></code></pre>? I seem to be stuck just having to go back to the vftable manually when I want to see what that function does.\nIt feels like I need to somehow link the instance of <pre><code>some_object</code></pre> or rather its <pre><code>_vftable</code></pre> to the actual vftable memory location but not sure if that's a thing? Do I want too much? :)\n",
