    "content": "Hex-Rays, providers of IDA Disassembler, offers a companion product called Hex-Rays Decompiler (not to be confused with HexRaysCodeXplorer, a plugin for the Decompiler plugin rather than for IDA itself).  I would like to evaluate Hex-Rays Decompiler, but have found no means of doing so without purchasing a license for IDA Disassembler.  And the lowest price I can find for that is $589 or $1129 for 64 bit support.\nHex-Rays states that IDA is also the solid foundation on which our second product, the Hex-Rays decompiler, is built. But while Hex-Rays offers both a demo version of IDA and IDA 5.0 Freeware, neither comes with the Decompiler, and I haven't found the Hex-Rays Decompiler available for sale or download separately.\nMuch of what attracts me to Hex-Rays is its decompiler, but it's difficult to justify purchasing IDA Disassembler just to evaluate Hex-Rays Decompiler.  So, how do I evaluate Hex-Rays Decompiler without purchasing IDA Disassembler for $589?  Thanks.\n",

            "content": "I suggest you look for decompiled code samples posted on the internet. That should give you a good indication of the decompiler's capabilities.\nYou can interactively decompile. Or also decompile in bulk. It decompiles a 22M binary containing 57k functions, totalling about 4.3M lines of code in about 1 hour. The decompilation can also be modified using pytbon scripts.\nWith some tweaking of variable and function types you can get very readable code. Also of c++ or objective-c with lots of virtual function calls.\n",
