            "content": "Not all views of IDA offer breakpoints. You should be able to set breakpoints on certain views, for example <pre><code>IDA View</code></pre>. Other views do not offer breakpoints and automatically disable them. Such views include, but not limited to <pre><code>Hex View</code></pre>, <pre><code>Structures</code></pre>, <pre><code>Enums</code></pre>, <pre><code>Imports</code></pre>, and <pre><code>Exports</code></pre>. \nThis is how the process of setting breakpoints is described in IDA-Pro Book:\n\nBreakpoints are set in IDA by navigating to the location at which you want execution to pause and using the F2 hotkey (or right-clicking and selecting Add Breakpoint). Addresses at which breakpoints have been set are highlighted with a red (by default) band across the entire disassembly line. A breakpoint may be removed by pressing F2 a second time to toggle the breakpoint off. A complete list of breakpoints currently set within a program may be viewed via Debugger->Breakpoints->Breakpoint List.\n",
