    "content": "I want to open the watch view and add watch in code. Do you know how? I didn't find open_window_ for it. I couldn't understand which function to use with <pre><code>BWN_...</code></pre> or <pre><code>IWID_...</code></pre> constants (<pre><code> IWID_WATCH</code></pre> seems like watch view).\nThanks\n",
