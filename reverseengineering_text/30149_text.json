    "content": "I have an ELF64 binary that comes with <pre><code>*.sym</code></pre> and <pre><code>.debug</code></pre>. From my understanding this is something akin to PDB. While IDA loads it automatically, it fails to process it. I was wondering if Ghidra will fare better but I can't seems to find a way to do so. This issue does say it should be in but I cant figure it out:\n<pre><code>Skipping DWARF import because a precondition was not met:\nTheMainBinary has more DIE records (2018267) than limit of 2000000\nManually re-run the DWARF analyzer after adjusting the options or start it via Dwarf_ExtractorScript\n</code></pre>\n",

It also gives you the two options to explicitly run the analysis nonetheless:\n\nRunning the Auto Analysis Step with custom configuration\nRunning a separate script.\n\nThe first option specifically means:\nIn the CodeBrowser view of the specific binary, click <pre><code>Analysis</code></pre> in the top bar, then <pre><code>Auto Analyze '$binaryname'</code></pre>. In the resulting list of analyzers scroll down to DWARF which should then look like this screenshot\n\nchange the <pre><code>2000000</code></pre> highlighted to anything higher than <pre><code>2018267</code></pre>, hit analyze, and Ghidra should now rerun the auto analysis but properly import the DWARF information and not skip it like before.\n",
