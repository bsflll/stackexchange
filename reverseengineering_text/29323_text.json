Going to attribute that to brain tired. It still isn't any more clear what's happening after the jump instruction.\n--EDIT 2--\nIt was pointed out that I was using LW incorrectly, loading the value in the register instead of the value in memory indicated by the address in register. Updated the math and still no more clear.\n--EDIT 3--\nThanks to mumbel for pointing out my incorrect use of the MSEL value. I treated as 0x1111 instead 0f 0b1111 = 0xF. I swear I know hex and binary.\n",

Basically, whatever address is calculated using MSEL will have the value in the \"Reset address\" field. So, it's not an address to value mapping, but since it's the only variable in the algorithm, it alone determines what address will be jumped to in the final instruction, so the mapping is still valid.\nAnother way to look at it is that MSEL is an index into a jump table, and the base is calculated in the rest of the algorithm.\n\nTable 9: Target of the reset vector\n\n\n\n\nMSEL\nReset address\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\n0000\n0x0000_1004\nloops forever waiting for debugger\n\n\n0001\n0x2000_0000\nmemory-mapped QSPI0\n\n\n0010\n0x3000_0000\nmemory-mapped QSPI1\n\n\n0011\n0x4000_0000\nuncached ChipLink\n\n\n0100\n0x6000_0000\ncached ChipLink\n\n\n0101\n0x0001_0000\nZSBL\n\n\n0110\n0x0001_0000\nZSBL\n\n\n0111\n0x0001_0000\nZSBL\n\n\n1000\n0x0001_0000\nZSBL\n\n\n1001\n0x0001_0000\nZSBL\n\n\n1010\n0x0001_0000\nZSBL\n\n\n1011\n0x0001_0000\nZSBL\n\n\n1100\n0x0001_0000\nZSBL\n\n\n1101\n0x0001_0000\nZSBL\n\n\n1110\n0x0001_0000\nZSBL\n\n\n1111\n0x0001_0000\nZSBL\n",
