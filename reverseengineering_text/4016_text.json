    "content": "It is common to set a breakpoint on <pre><code>oleaut32!DispCallFunc</code></pre> to catch the function call to the ActiveX component and it worked for me until recently. I tried to reverse engineer a ActiveX component I got from some web file storage site and IE does not stop on <pre><code>DispCallFunc</code></pre>. Any other tricks to catch function call to ActiveX ?\n",
