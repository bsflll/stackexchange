    "content": "Let's say I have lots of breakpoints at some <pre><code>push</code></pre> instructions.\nI am trying to dereference the operand (if address) - get the actual relevant value for each one in a script, handling immediate, base + index, register, etc. Can I do this in any other way than:\n\nRead it with ESP after <pre><code>Step Into</code></pre> (executing the instruction at breakpoint) (<pre><code>DbgRead()</code></pre> of <pre><code>IDC</code></pre>, <pre><code>idaapi.dbg_read_memory()</code></pre>)\nRead the operand and manually evaluate it in the script with respective calls to <pre><code>DbgRead()</code></pre>, <pre><code>GetRegValue()</code></pre>, etc.\n\nThis, if possible, I guess would imply a particular <pre><code>idaapi</code></pre> function.\n",

On other architectures without this complexity (e.g. ARM) it is a bit easier.\nIf it helps any, I have already implemented this functionality in <pre><code>pwndbg</code></pre> for exactly the same purpose.\nYou can see the implementation here:\nhttps://github.com/zachriggle/pwndbg/blob/master/pwndbg/disasm/x86.py\nNote that I am not using IDA's API, but rather pwndbg's internal API which relies on GDB.  You will have to make some small changes to the way in which you fetch register and memory values from that code (e.g. <pre><code>pwndbg.regs.pc</code></pre> gives me the value of EIP or RIP as appropriate).\n",
