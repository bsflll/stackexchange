This time IDA was able to display both KiSwapContext and SwapContext functions very similar output as WinDbg. On the PC which is not displaying these two functions in IDA I tried uninstalling Norton Security but that didn't help. Doing a search for SwapContext in IDA displays the following two functions:\nSwapContext_PatchStMxCsr and\nSwapContext_PatchLdt\nDoes anyone know why this is the case ? Could this be a windows update patch by Microsoft and the real SwapContext is hidden somewhere else ?\n",

            "content": "KiSwapContext is not an exported function, so the mapping between its address and its name is only available either through your own manual guesswork or the PDB (which contains debug symbols).\nYou may have had a transient issue loading the PDB file from Microsoft's Symbol Server (which provides symbols over the public Internet); without knowing exactly which mismatched PDB file you did have, and what choices you made on those dialog boxes, it's not 100% clear what went wrong.\nMicrosoft patching Windows does cause the symbol table and PDB to change as updates do change the layout of functions, exact addresses, etc., but the PDB's metadata (signature and age) should catch the issue of a PDB for a different version of the binary than the one you have (as they seem to have done here).\n",

I decided to take your advice and got IDA to reload the symbol file for ntoskrnl.exe (namely ntkrnlmp.pdb) and this time all is working. Both KiSwapContext and SwapContext functions were displayed properly in IDA.</span>",
