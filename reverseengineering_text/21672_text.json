    "content": "<pre><code>lea     ebp, dword_403638\nlea     ebx, [ebp-4]\nmov     edi, ss:[ebx]\n</code></pre>\nI understand the first instruction setting ebp to the address of the byte sequence. What I don't understand is what ebx will then be set to. And since ebx is being treated as an address on the stack, will edi refer to an address as well\n<pre><code>dword_403638    dd 0\n</code></pre>\n",
