    "content": "I used binwalk to extract <pre><code>firmware.bin</code></pre> image, the extracted content is <pre><code>squashfs-root</code></pre> dir, and a separate <pre><code>dpc.squashfs</code></pre> file. Then I used sasquatch utility to extract content of dpc.squashfs file, and I got the same <pre><code>squashfs-root</code></pre> directory. I compared content of both <pre><code>squashfs-root</code></pre> directories and find, that the squashfs-root dir extracted with binwalk have <pre><code>www</code></pre> and <pre><code>www_safe</code></pre> folders, whereas in squashfs-root dir extracted with <pre><code>sasquatch</code></pre> that folders are missing. Why the extracted content differs?\n",

You can try forcing the compression type in sasquatch with the -c option instead of letting sasquatch try to guess, which might help. It's probably best to submit this as an issue on the sasquatch github page you linked to, along with a copy of the firmware image.\n",

Again, if you're having bugs with either of these tools, it should probably be reported to the binwalk / sasquatch project pages rather than here.\n",

I tested sasquatch more times, and in my tests it extracts full content of the .squashfs file, include www and www_safe dirs, even without the <pre><code>-c lzma</code></pre> option. Don't know why this happen when I tested first time. Maybe this somehow related to file permissions, as sometimes these directories been extracted with <pre><code>drwx--x--x (711)</code></pre> permission, and this prevents accessing them. Sometimes it been extracted with <pre><code>drwxr-xr-x (755)</code></pre> permission. It extracted fine with binwalk, in fact, it wasn't necessary to use sasquatch tool, but I didn't know content of this squashfs-root.\n",
