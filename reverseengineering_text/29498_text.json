    "content": "I've been working on figuring out the stack from a minidump [1]; but have put that on hold as I had other things to figure out.  Coming back to this problem, I figured I'd go back and use Windbg to help me with this.  I think I am on the right track.\nUsing Windbg and showing the call stack, I don't understand a few lines that do not have addresses not associated to any known modules in the <pre><code>lm</code></pre> list.\nFor example:\n<pre><code>...\n2a 0017ce64 61500ad3 cxt+0x3280ad3\n2b 0017ce98 61500ad3 cxt+0x32c0d8e\n2c 0017d500 0f026cf0 0x168d6f12\n2d 0017d56c 168d094f 0xf026cf0\n2e 0017d5a8 6154b791 cxt+0x32cb781\n...\n</code></pre>\nFrom <pre><code>lm</code></pre> it shows a list of available modules, amongst which <pre><code>cxt</code></pre> is there with base image.  But the address listed in frame <pre><code>2c</code></pre> and <pre><code>2d</code></pre> don't belong to any particular module.  There are similar lines further down in the call stack.\nI don't have the symbols available. I doubt this is the issue since a module has a base image and a size (and thusly an ending address).  If the two strange addresses don't belong to the range within the module in memory, it isn't part\nof the module.  (I would think).\nThere's a lot of knowledge I'm missing, so I appreciate if someone can enlighten me as to what I'm missing.\nThanks!\nEd\n",
