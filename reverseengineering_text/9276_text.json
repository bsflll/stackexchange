    "content": "When I define data as a structure with IDAPython, it appears in IDA View in a collapsed view. Out of curiosity, is it possible to programmatically expand the view of the structure?\nFor example, if I run <pre><code>MakeStructEx(0x400000, -1, \"IMAGE_DOS_HEADER\")</code></pre>, I see:\n<pre><code>IMAGE_DOS_HEADER <5A4Dh, 90h, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0FFFFh, 0, 0B8h, 0, 0, 0, \\\n                  40h, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0E0h>\n</code></pre>\nBut I would like to see:\n<pre><code>dw 5A4D                ; e_magic\ndw 90h                 ; e_cblp\ndw 3                   ; e_cp\ndw 0                   ; e_crlc\n... (lines removed) ...\ndd 0E0h                ; e_lfanew\n</code></pre>\nI am using IDA 6.2.\n",

            "content": "Unfortunately I don't have IDA 6.2, but if this version supports IDAPython and corresponding APIs you can try to do the following:\n<pre><code>import idc\nidc.Jump(address)\nidc.ProcessUiAction(\"UnHide\", 0)\n</code></pre>\nThis will move the cursor to the \"address\" ea and replay user action associated with \"UnHide\" string, which is Ctrl+Numpad+, which does what you requested in IDA 6.8. I think that it should work in IDA 6.2 too. There is a chance good chance that there is some IDAPython API designed specifically for that, but I was unable to find it. \nThis definitely works in IDA 6.8.\nGood luck\n",
