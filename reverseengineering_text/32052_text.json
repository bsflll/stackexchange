    "content": "I am doing security research, my target application includes some JNI libraries which implements some native java methods I am interested in. This app is obfuscated, I can't directly find the library by unpacking the APK archive.\nSearching on the Web I found I can use ART's GetNativeMethods() from a JNI function, then use the native method's JNI pointer to find the shared library where it is located. But ART is a private API and latest Android versions block the loading of <pre><code>libart.so</code></pre>, I can't use it.\nI am using Xposed to instrument the target application at runtime.\n",

As you can see on the linked web site <pre><code>RegisterNatives</code></pre> is not an exported method but a method that belongs to a struct. So you first have to find the struct then calculate the offset to the method pointer in the struct to get the final pointer you can hook.\n",
