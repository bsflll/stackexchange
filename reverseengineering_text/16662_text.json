    "content": "I have a <pre><code>.bin</code></pre> file (It's a firmware belongs to a hardware (Cisco Access-Point) ). All I need to do is modifying that <pre><code>.bin</code></pre> file.\nAs you know, <pre><code>.bin</code></pre> files aren't human readable. I need to convert it to either assembly or C (to make it readable and also changeable). Any idea how can I do such a thing? \nNoted that this is the file I'm talking about.\n",

            "content": "The contents of that archive is not a single file, and so it cannot be \"converted\" to assembly. It'd only appear as a very long list of literal <pre><code>db</code></pre> statements.\nFrom a cursory look, the file starts with some kind of header indicating which part go where. The parts themselves appear to contain a complete file system, as well as some sort of checksum at the end of each file (block?). \nUnless you know the following point, then you cannot make it changeable.\n\nwhat the meta-structure of this single file is,\nwhat the file structure of the <pre><code>rootfs</code></pre> is, and\nhow the checksum is calculated,\n\nPlain \"readable\" could possibly be already out of your league.\n",
