            "content": "Projects has been disabled in debugger mode because not all metadata is rebased when aslr is involved which may result on confusing analysis/comments information. If you disable aslr, or your target is always loading in the same place you can do a couple of things:\n\n<pre><code>Ps saving@e:cfg.debug=false</code></pre>\n\nor just save the comments into a file:\n\n<pre><code>CC* > comments.r2</code></pre>\n\nyou can reload the script with the <pre><code>. comments.r2</code></pre> or starting the session with <pre><code>r2 -i comments.r2 ...</code></pre> to get the comment lines loaded into the session.\nSame goes for all the analysis information. if you append <pre><code>*</code></pre> to any command you get the output in r2 commands script.\n",
