    "content": "I have a classic Mac OS executable where control is given to an instruction whose hex encoding is $FBE6. I have been unable to find documentation for this F-line instruction, and it doesn't appear to be a m68881 coprocessor instruction given that the coprocessor ID, which is in bits 9-11, is 0b101 = 5.\n",

            "content": "This is not a complete answer, but maybe I can shed some more light on this interesting question.\nDigging through the 68030, 68040, 68851 (PMMU) and 68881/2 (FPU) manuals, it seems that the $FBE6 opcode is not a valid opcode for any known Motorola coprocessor.\nAs stated in the 68030 UM/AD chapter 10, coprocessor ID #5 is reserved for Motorola use. The only two IDs used by Motorola seem to be 0 (PMMU AFAIK) and 1 (FPU).\nThe \"type\" bits (8-6, see p. 10-4) have the value 7. This value does not seem to be defined, so - if I understand the documentation correctly - the CPU will throw an exception.\nLooking at some proprietary source code (which I can obviously not show here) derived from Motorola's fpsp040 code indicates that coprocessor IDs other than 1 are ignored in the FPU emulation F-line handler (this excerpt is from the Motorola-licensed code):\n<pre><code>  movel   L_SCR1(%a6),%d0  |d0 contains the fline and command word\n  bfextu  %d0{#4:#3},%d1   |extract coprocessor id\n  cmpib   #1,%d1           |check if cpid=1\n  bne     not_mvcr         |exit if not\n  ...\nnot_mvcr:\n  moveml     USER_DA(%a6),%d0-%d1/%a0-%a1 |restore data registers\n  frestore (%a7)+\n  unlk   %a6\n  addl   #4,%a7\n  bral   real_fline\n</code></pre>\nThe proprietary code, however, replaces the last instruction with a jump to a user-defined F-line handler. So, there is a chance that the application or OS  installed its own F-line handler for the $FBE6 opcode. It seems that the 68k emulator on PPC machines used several F-line opcodes; the article linked describes the opcode $FE02 which returns from 68k emulation to PPC code. However, this uses a coprocessor ID of 7, so $FBE6 might not be related to the emulator after all.\n",
