    "content": "I am using Ida Pro 7.0 and working with a binary (firmware) written in C++ .Fortunately there are  symbols in the firmware and I know function names but Ida didn't manage to demangle all function names. I saw in the firmware ASCII string gcc2. Likely the binary was compiled using gcc2 compiler. There are a lot of important funcitons in the mangled form.\nHelp me out please. How Can I resolve this problem???\nI tried to use idc.Demangle() func but unfortunately It can't demangle correctly.\nP.S.\nI found that c++filt utility works correctly\n",

Maybe I need to play with Compiler submenu (Options->Compiler) or Demangled names. The only thing I remember that my device works under vxworks os.\n",
