    "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/3108/physically-auditing-the-layout-of-transistors-inside-a-processor-made-at-22mm-pr",
    "content": "What is necessary to check that the layout of all the 35000 transistors on a given physical processor was not tampered with, assuming the normal layout and its dispositions on the die are extensively documented?\nMicroscope ? Specialized imaging software ? Chemical reagents, and others that are to buy for each check ? How much man-hours of work ? What else ?\nIf it is easier to provide an answer for a particular case, you can assume that it is a K-machine but made on a die at modern 22nm process.\nIf you prefer a processor you are more familiar with, you can assume an armv6 processor but made on a die at modern 22nm process.\nYou can assume that I will have access to all details of the fab to produce the processor, but that the particular physical processor I want to audit was made on the same fab line by the NSA.\n",
