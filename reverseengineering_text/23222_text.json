    "content": "I want to get more information from this dump I have:\nhttp://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=42095249658483515063\n<pre><code>binwalk dump.bin\n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n56368         0xDC30          U-Boot version string, \"U-Boot 1.1.4-2  (Jun 10 2016)\"\n56400         0xDC50          CRC32 polynomial table, big endian\n65536         0x10000         uImage header, header size: 64 bytes, header CRC: 0x4FD6C064, created: 2016-10-12 09:53:26, image size: 3729430 bytes, Data Address: 0x80060000, Entry Point: 0x80064CE0, data CRC: 0x6B3A6FD3, OS: Linux, CPU: MIPS, image type: OS Kernel Image, compression type: lzma, image name: \"runtime\"\n65600         0x10040         LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 33554432 bytes, uncompressed size: 12767476 bytes\n</code></pre>\nI already used <pre><code>binwalk -Me dump.bin</code></pre> and got <pre><code>_10040.extracted/cpio-root/</code></pre> with the main content. But it looks somehow incomplete.\nAfter reading around in the files eg <pre><code>init</code></pre> I see, that there are multiple mtd \"partitions\" which would be nice to separate them from the dump. I hope that it will help me to understand the firmware and how update process works.\nAlso I found in the hexdump some PRIVATE information about the device like device_pass, device_wpapass and so on, which I replaced all with a 1. But it is also niceto  know where this information's are stored on the device to see how they are queried. \nThe problem for me is to separate all partitions/information from this dump. At least I want to see, if it is possible to disconnect the device from the cloud and only use it locally - but it looks like the firmware builds only a connection between the interface (connected to the heater) and the cloud server - so all logic is on the cloud.\nMaybe it is possible to mod the firmware with a remote shell or make a MITM possible to investigate on runtime state.\n",

It holds\n  device specific wireless calibration data, thus using a generic or the\n  wrong firmware causes FCC incompliance and poor wireless performance.\n  Usually the firmware is stored in an ART partition located at the last\n  64KiB of the flash. If the ART partition is missing or corrupt, ath9k\n  (wireless driver) won't come up anymore.\n",
