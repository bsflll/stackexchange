    "content": "When decompiling an exe file, I have defined two structs <pre><code>struct A</code></pre> and <pre><code>struct B</code></pre> that are of the same structure. They appeared under different contexts, thus I assumed that they were different structs. However, as the contexts merge, I realize that these are in fact the same struct.\nNow I would like to get rid of <pre><code>struct B</code></pre> and replace all its occurance with <pre><code>struct A</code></pre>. Is it possible to do that without manually changing everything?\nI know that I can define <pre><code>struct B</code></pre> as containing just one <pre><code>struct A</code></pre> as its member, but this feels less optimal and creates unnecessary syntax in decompiled code.\n",
