    "content": "I'm currently working on an IDAPython script that aims to remove various rogue-byte from the malware that I'm reversing. \nI'm in a case where some portions of my code contain this type of anti-disassembly trick:\n\nThe fact is that without patching the rogue byte, I can't define this undefined blob as a proper function (P shortcut).\nSo the script is basically doing this:\n\nFind the following opcode: \"90 C3 FE\" (for \"nop, retn, FE\", FE is the rogue-byte).\nPatch the \"FE\" byte and replace it by a NOP (0x90).\nDefine the new NOP as code.\n\nAs all the function having this rogue-bytes in it are undefined, I now need to define them as proper function.\nBut I don't know how to go back to the address of the beginning of the undefined function. For instance, that's the result after executing my IDAPython script:\n\nThe rogue-byte is indeed patch, but now I just need to find the address of \"loc_410687\".\nHow can I get this address within my IDAPython script? \n(I specify that not all of the function that contains the rogue-byte start by those 3 xors, that's a coincidence. So I can't look for them in order to get the start of the function.)\nAny idea?\nThanks!\n",
