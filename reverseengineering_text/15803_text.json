    "content": "During my current project I found such code:\n<pre><code>move.w  (0xFFFC0C).l, d0 | read SCSR\nandi.w  #0x100, d0       | add 256 to d0\nbeq.s   location         | branch if LSB = 0x00\n</code></pre>\nI cannot get the idea of this fragment. I guess author tried to check the status of the UART, but how does <pre><code>andi.w</code></pre> and <pre><code>beq.s</code></pre> serves the purpose, when SCSR may contain maximum of 9 bits?\n",
