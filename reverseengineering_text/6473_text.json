    "content": "An application I'm reversing frequently outputs debug strings. Some of them could aid me in locating the code I'm looking for, but somehow, the app doesn't seem the be using OutputDebugString at all (I've used IDA's Imports window, Olly's Search for intermodular calls, and <pre><code>dumpbin /IMPORTS</code></pre>). The program only imports native Windows DLLs and one custom library which does call the function, but I've checked it and all its debug strings are internal stuff, there's no exported logging function for my exe.\nAdditionally, the debug strings being printed cannot be found inside the exe (again, tried both Olly and IDA). \nIs it possible that the call is somehow hidden by not using WinAPI? Since the program is in no way protected, I find the use of any such techniques highly unlikely, but could that be why I can't find anything using \"ordinary\" methods?\n",
