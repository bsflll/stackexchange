    "content": "I would like IDA to remember my default load file settings instead of presenting the load file dialog on every start. \nThe documentation says there is a -T command line switch that should take a 'file type prefix' argument and then not display the load file dialog, but I don't know what a valid 'file type prefix' would be. I tried -TPE but a warning popped up saying 'PE' was not recognized. \nAny suggestions?\n",
