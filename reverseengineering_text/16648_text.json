    "content": "I have a malware sample that wraps <pre><code>LoadLibrary</code></pre> & <pre><code>GetProcAddress</code></pre> duo to dynamically resolve functions. After this wrapper is called the value stored in <pre><code>eax</code></pre>(which is the function name)immediately gets called. The strings are encrypted and it's too difficult for me to reverse the encryption algorithm. Instead I wrote a python script which sets breakpoints where a <pre><code>call eax</code></pre> instruction is mentioned. Everyting's fine, I get the addresses of the functions from <pre><code>eax</code></pre> that are dynamically imported. The problem is I need them to be readable. I know how to resolve the address to a function name in widbg by calling <pre><code>ln address</code></pre>. But I don't want to sit all day and copy all of the 649 imports one by one to the <pre><code>windbg</code></pre> console. I looked up the <pre><code>windbg</code></pre>'s scripting capabilities but I could not write anything that would do the job.\nThanks\n",
