    "content": "By analyzing a piece of assembly code of a Trojan, I found a string <pre><code>\"ZwQueryInformationThread\"</code></pre>. I assume that it is an anti-debugging technique because the process terminates after hitting that line. \nBut, I could not find any good explanation for <pre><code>\"ZwQueryInformationThread\"</code></pre> stopping the process. For me, the purpose is clear: it tries to make my work harder, but I would like to get more information about that. \nSo, my question would be:\n\nIs there someone who can tell me what <pre><code>\"ZwQueryInformationThread\"</code></pre> does?\n",

            "content": "I believe what you are seeing is the NtSetInformationThread detection of anti-anti-debug tools. The technique is documented at https://ntquery.wordpress.com/2014/03/29/anti-debug-ntsetinformationthread/#more-6.\n\nWe call NtSetInformationThread two times with wrong parameters and\n  this will reveal most anti-anti-debug plugins. Since Vista it is\n  possible to use NtQueryInformationThread and this makes it much more\n  powerful. Currently no anti-anti-debug plugin is hooking\n  NtQueryInformationThread to prevent this check.\n",

            "content": "ZwQueryInformationThread is low-level API with deals with querying information about threads.\nMalware related you can hide from a debugger just like evlncrn8 said.\nYou could also use this to hide a thread like a rootkit would by hooking the API.\nHow about you set a breakpoint on all the common exit APIs and look back to what actually calls the exit so you can work your way back to what's actually happening? There no point just looking at ZwQueryInformationThread and guessing it's that API.\nBreakpoint the following:\n\nExitProcess\nTerminateProcess\nNtTerminateProcess\nLdrShutdownProcess\nExitThread\nTerminateThread\nNtTerminateThread\nLdrShutdownThread\nSetThreadContext/ NtSetContextThread setting EIP/RIP to 0.\n\nSoon as it exits you'll able to follow it all back to whats actually closing the program.\n",
