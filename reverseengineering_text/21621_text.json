    "content": "So I have an embedded machine from the late 80s I want to mess around with. It uses a NEC v20HL which is an 8088 compatible with some extra 80186 instructions tossed in. I know it uses 64k code segments, reset vector at 0xFFFF0 and ISRs at 0x00 on even addresses.\nI have tried a bunch of different architectures and the only one that looks like 8088/x86 old school is the x86 real 16bit.\nI don't understand how to actually use that information as IDA disassembled even the reset jmpl wrong (EA 0000 FDAF) is clearly a far jump to seg 0 add 0xFDAF but IDA makes it seg000:0xDAF0. What is even worse is 0xFDAF jumps to a faulty instruction?..\n",

            "content": "So, it's a little difficult to describe it without the actual file but I'll try. For proper disassembly, you should load code so that it matches the expected addresses. For example, last 64K should normally be loaded into segment F000, so that the first byte of that segment is at F000:0000, or linear address 0xF0000 (seg<<4 + ofs).\nSome simple rules of thumb:\n\n64KB binary: load at F000:0000 (0xF0000)\n128KB binary: load at E000:0000 (0xE0000) \n256KB binary: load at C000:0000 (0xC0000) \n512KB binary: load at 8000:0000 (0x80000) \n\nNext, you'll need to create segments based on far jumps and calls, for example:\nEA 00 00 FD AF    jmp     far ptr 0AFFDh:0\nmeans there is a segment with the base 0xAFFD, so, create the following segment:\n<pre><code> start address: 0xAFFD0 (base<<4)\n end address: 0xBFFD0 (maximum 64KB long)\n base: 0xAFFD\n (*) 16-bit\n</code></pre>\nnext, go through disassembly and look for other far jumps/calls to gather other possible segment bases (a good source for that is the problems list). Create corresponding segments (you will likely have to truncate some of the previously created ones; this is normal as segments using full 64KB are not very common). You may also need to use a start address not at seg:0 but small offset, e.g. seg:7 (so seg<<4 + 7). \nFor most BIOS ROMs it may be be useful to create at least the last two segments (E000 and F000) straight away.\nFor more info on how segmentation works in IDA, see here.\nRelated question: Segments in IDA.

I.e., the case you mention in your reply to Igor's comment did not materialize for me.\" Essentially the asm/ld is just being efficent, unless the coder is trying to obfuscate manually it should have no overloaps.</span>",

Then keep wandering the code making  segments and shrinking as I go. Once I run out of far jumps I can expand the tail end of segments to the start of the next? It would be easier if you could just have a bazillion overlapping segments by paragraph and then have IDA mark the only ones used...</span>",
