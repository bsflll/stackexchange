            "content": "The difference is that Windows 8 requires all regular structures (exports, imports, TLS, exception handlers, relocations... that is, everything described by Data Directory entries) to be located wholly inside a section.  The only exception is the Bound Import Table, which is stored external to any section, to avoid \"polluting\" the contents, since the Bound Import Table data are discarded after use.  The Bound Import Table is also meaningless in the presence of ASLR, anyway, since the addresses will almost never match.\nIn the absence of any section, you have to find the DLL bases and resolve the imports yourself.\nIf you create a single section to hold your import table, then it will load in both environments.\n",
