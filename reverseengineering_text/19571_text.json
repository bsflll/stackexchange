    "content": "So before we come to the main function, it looks we are in a function with a name __libc_start_main\nand before we come to our main function we obviously push EBP value in the stack ( the value of EBP before main function, in the __libc_start_main function)\nso first off is this value important? after the execution of main function, will the __libc_start_main function need this value?\nis there any function that gets called before __libc_start_main therefore making this EBP value important? \ni tested it and even if i overwrite this value(in the stack) with overflowing, the program finishes with no problem but i don't get how and why? shouldn't it result in error or page fault?\n",

            "content": "<pre><code>__libc_start_main</code></pre> is called by the entry point code (usually in a file called <pre><code>crt0.S</code></pre> or similar) and that code usually sets up the initial <pre><code>EBP</code></pre> value (usually to 0, to denote end of the call stack for the debuggers). Here's a sample entry point code from a random ELF binary:\n<pre><code>_start:\n     xor     ebp, ebp\n     pop     esi\n     mov     ecx, esp\n     and     esp, 0FFFFFFF0h\n     push    eax\n     push    esp             ; stack_end\n     push    edx             ; rtld_fini\n     push    offset __libc_csu_fini ; fini\n     push    offset __libc_csu_init ; init\n     push    ecx             ; ubp_av\n     push    esi             ; argc\n     push    offset main     ; main\n     call    ___libc_start_main\n     hlt\n</code></pre>\nWhile <pre><code>__libc_start_main</code></pre> itself could initialize <pre><code>EBP</code></pre> to 0, this would make it appear as if it's the first code in the binary when looking at the call stack, which is not correct (the execution begins at <pre><code>_start</code></pre>, the entry point).\nBesides, <pre><code>__libc_start_main</code></pre>  can be (and often is) written in C instead of assembly, and it's easier for the compiler to generate the standard prolog code for it instead of making some kind of special case exception.\nAs for overwriting the value, you don't get a crash because:\n\n<pre><code>ebp</code></pre> is not actually used by the caller of <pre><code>___libc_start_main</code></pre> (the entry point code)\n<pre><code>___libc_start_main</code></pre> does not actually return, since it calls <pre><code>exit()</code></pre> with the return value of <pre><code>main()</code></pre> to directly exit to the OS, so your corrupted <pre><code>ebp</code></pre> does not matter\n\nIn the unlikely event that <pre><code>___libc_start_main</code></pre> does return (e.g. due to a bug in libc), the entry point code will execute the <pre><code>hlt</code></pre> instruction which is privileged so the process will be killed by the OS.\n",
