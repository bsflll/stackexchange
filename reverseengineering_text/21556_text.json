    "content": "I want to set breakpoint on the <pre><code>recv</code></pre> function to replace the received packets. But, I can not put breakpoint on any instruction in the program, the process simply closes with code 4000001f. I also tried a hardware breakpoint, but that doesn't help.\nI have installed TitanHide plugins etc. but also without result.\nI use x32dbg (32 bit target program). And recently read this article.\nBut x64 debugger does not allow to open x32 application. What could be the problem?\n",
