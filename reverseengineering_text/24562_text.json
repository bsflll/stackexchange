Because when i run idapythonswitch, it doesn't detect my python2, and that readme says its only for python3.. and the force path requires a python3.dll which that or python2.dll are not present in python2. It gives this error \"Cannot determine python library version for \"C:\\Python27\": No \"python3.dll\" \"</span>",

In theory, you can try building an old version of IDAPython with Python 2 support but I don't know if it will work with 8.x.</span>",
