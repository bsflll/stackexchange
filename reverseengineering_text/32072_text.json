    "content": "I am attempting to write a script to parse a function table containing structs that look like this:\n<pre><code>struct func_table_entry {\n    void (* func)(void *);\n    byte unknown1;\n    byte unknown2;\n    byte unknown3;\n    char * func_name;\n};\n</code></pre>\nI made a script already to define the stucts, but I am having trouble cleaning up the automatic analysis Ghidra does. I have fixed func_name where sometimes Ghidra thinks that the strings are code. I want to  define the functions pointed to by <pre><code>func</code></pre>.\nMost of the time this works, but sometimes I get an error:\n<pre><code>Function newFunction = functionManager.createFunction(func_string, funcAddress_real, new AddressSet(funcAddress_real), SourceType.USER_DEFINED);\n</code></pre>\nThe error:\n<pre><code>ghidra.program.database.function.OverlappingFunctionException: Unable to create function at 0113c4e due to overlap with another namespace\n</code></pre>\nSo the question ultimately is that if there is already something labeled \"LAB_WXYZ\" how do I remove that and define my own function.\n",
