How can I locate its install location, and possibly read the source code of the extension?\nAlso, is there an easy way to tell if an extension either came from the developer site, the app store, and/or is part of the Apple developer program?  \nBased on what I observed so far, I will need to report this developer to apple somehow.\n",
