    "content": "This is a from a CTF problem I'm working on. Hopefully it's appropriate to ask this question here.\n\nAbove is the GDB output when the segfault goes off. <pre><code>movaps</code></pre> is the offending instruction, meaning that <pre><code>rsp+0x40</code></pre> is most likely pointing to unmapped memory.\nHowever, a closer look at the memory allocated for the stack\n\nand <pre><code>rsp=0x00007ffde19d78a8</code></pre> from the GDB output, shows that <pre><code>rsp+0x40</code></pre> is well within the allocated bounds. This is really confusing for me, is there something I'm missing here? Something else I can look into to debug this?\nFinally the output when running this under <pre><code>strace</code></pre>\n<pre><code>[pid 32671] --- SIGSEGV {si_signo=SIGSEGV, si_code=SI_KERNEL, si_addr=NULL} ---\n[pid 32671] +++ killed by SIGSEGV (core dumped) +++\n</code></pre>\nshows that it's apparently a null pointer dereference (<pre><code>si_addr=NULL</code></pre>), which doesn't make any sense to me because the offending instruction <pre><code>movaps XMMWORD PTR [rsp+0x40],xmm0</code></pre> isn't accessing a NULL pointer?\n",
