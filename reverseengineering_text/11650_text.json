    "content": "The source file is in intel 32 bit .hex format, it was built for a nuvoton NUC220LE3AE. I want to decompile it to C++, or at least assembly. I have some experience with assembly, but mostly with MIPS and that was years ago - so high level code is preferred. \nLink to .hex file: http://www.3fvape.com/images/3fvape-blog-img/20150806-4384-xcubeII-upgrade/SMOK_X_CUBE_II_firmware_v1.07.hex\nThe device it resides in is a SMOK Xcube 2 (e-cig box mod.)\nMy goal is to add an option to control the LED color based on the atomizer temperature.\nI searched but could not find an applicable how-to.\n",

            "content": "Short answer: You can't.\nAt least, don't expect a readable, and compilable, C source code. There's discussion why elsewhere on this site, so i won't get into details.\nAlso, note there's not an easy walk-through or how-to. You need to experiment, and you'll need some experience as well. \nTo get you started, you might:\n\nconvert the .hex file into a raw binary file, for example using Hex2bin\nuse that binary file with the retargetable Decompiler selecting \"raw machine code\" and probably \"ARM+Thumb\" as architecture\nIf the results of of the retargetable decompiler are unsatisfactory (it didnt work well for me, last time i tried), you might want to try the Online Disassembler to get assembly code\nOf course, the ultimate tool is IDA, but the freeware version can't handle ARM, and the price is probably a bit steep for a hobby project.\n",
