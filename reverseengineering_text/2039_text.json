    "content": "I was trying to change the values of a Flash game which loads the SWF and some JSON over a HTTPS site. So changing the values of JSON was not possible using browser cache.\nI changed the values of that JSON by editing the memory of the Adobe Flash process by loading it in HxD. Still I wasn't able to see the changed values inside Firefox.\nCan anybody guide as to what protects the changed values from reflecting?\n",
