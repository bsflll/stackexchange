    "content": "I'm looking for a good front-end to GDB and looks like Hopper is a good alternative. Unfortunately, I wasted several hours but still couldn't make it working with gdbserver. Here are the steps I'm following:\nNote that, I actually need to attach the GDB, I can't run the program using GDB for several reasons.\n\nI run <pre><code>hopper-gdb-server-v3</code></pre>. As far as I can see it's not possible to pass any parameters to this, it just doesn't care about arguments. So I think there's nothing to do wrong here.\nI run <pre><code>hopper-v3</code></pre> and opening the ELF binary I want to reverse.\nI'm running <pre><code>Show debugger screen</code></pre> and it wants me to choose GDB server. Unfortunately, the list is always empty.\n\nI am stuck at this point. Basically I can't select the <pre><code>hopper-gdb-server-v3</code></pre> in the Hopper itself. I cannot see any documentation in its webpage.\nCan anyone help me with this?\n",

If i remember correct the gdb connection could be configured under Window->Open Debugger Selector.\nAnyway how about giving idapro or radare2 a try. Both are also able to connect to a gdbserver instance.\n",
