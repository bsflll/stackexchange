You need to specify a number prefix if you want to stick with decimal (<pre><code>0n</code></pre> ; e.g. <pre><code>0n17</code></pre>) or use the <pre><code>n</code></pre> command to change the default radix. Best way to not deal with this kind of errors is to always prefix your numbers with <pre><code>0x</code></pre> even if you know the default radix is 16.\n",
