Everywhere its written as follow.\n\n\"It's difficult to know the starting address of the shellcode\"\n\nWhy do we need to know the address of the shellcode? Why does stack not execute the shellcode as it is?\nsay we inject our shellcode this way\nour shellcode -- some padding -- our choice of saved return\naddress\nshould the shellcode not be executed by default by the stack? Why do we add NOP sleds and complicate things.\n",
