    "content": "I have no idea how, when or why, but now, the \"default address\" (the one executed when pressing F9) is <pre><code>0x77960884</code></pre>. It should be <pre><code>0x00401000</code></pre> (when I manually go to <pre><code>0x00401000</code></pre>, everything works).\nThe problem is, I manually have to change the Origin every time I run any program.\nAdditionally, restarting Windows / reinstalling OllyDBG doesn't fix it. A few hours ago it was working fine, but now... \nI have no idea.\n",
