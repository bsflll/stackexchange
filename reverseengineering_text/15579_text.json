Those operations are bitwise operations. These operations are the basis of Boolean Algebra and  they're used whenever bit level manipulation is required. Applications may include bitfield/flag manipulation, working with hardware devices, network protocols, decoding/encoding, compression and many other uses. \nAdditionally, logical shifts have the interesting property of being efficient ways to perform multiplication or division of unsigned integers by powers of two. This is a side-effect and not the purpose of those operations. This property is also true for arithmetic shift operations and signed integers.\nSimilarly, rotation bitwise operations have their own applications such as in cryptographic models (encryption, hashing), for example.\n",

It can be seen as a multiplication and an addition like that (<pre><code>n</code></pre> is the size of the bitfield):\n<pre><code>rotate-left (a, 0) = a\nrotate-left (a, 1) = 2^(1).a + 2^(-n).a\nrotate-left (a, 2) = 2^(2).a + 2^(1-n).a\n...\nrotate-left (a, n-1) = 2^(n-1).a + 2^(-1).a\nrotate-left (a, n) = a\n</code></pre>\nIn C language you might interpret this with only bitwise operators as follow (see the Wikipedia article about circular shift):\n<pre><code>uint32_t rotl32 (uint32_t value, unsigned int count) \n{\n  return ((value << count) | (value >> (32 - count)));\n}\n</code></pre>\nAnyway, the rotations are often neglected in most of the programming languages. You cannot find it easily in C for example. But, this is mainly because:\n\nOnly cryptography is using it (and few other very low-level domains).\nIt can be implemented as a function with the provided operators (it does not increase the expressive power of the language to add it to the language).\n\nYet, all the assembler languages propose rotations operators because they can be source of a lot of optimizations at low-level.\n",
