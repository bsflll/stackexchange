    "content": "Let's assume we have a function which has a following variables in it:\n\nLocal variables on stack of different types, including types defined in local types window\nLocal variables of different types mapped to registers\nFunction parameters of different types\n\nI have 2 IDBs with the same function based on the same binary and I want to pass this data from one IDB to another.\nLet's also assume that I have a solution of passing related data types between databases.\nI know that I can iterate the local variables in decompiled function by using  user_lvar_visitor_t class. \nI also know that there is a function save_user_lvar_settings these variables by using of the same iterator class user_lvar_visitor_t.\nI have the following questions regarding this:\n\nWhich data should I gather from the first database to create these variables in second database correctly (with IDAPython, IDA version is 6.8)?\nHow can I create these variables in the second database to make use of save_user_lvar_settings or restore_user_lvar settings (with IDAPython, IDA version is 6.8)?\n\nUpdate: Before asking this question I reviewed the following IDA collaboration solutions:  \n\nCollabreate\nida2sql\nIDA toolbag\nIDAsynergy\nIDAsync\n\nOne more update\n\nDiaphora\n\nAnd was not able to find solution for my problem in any them.\n",
