    "content": "I've been trying to hook a function using Detours 1.5, but when <pre><code>DetourFunction()</code></pre> is called, it throws access violation.\nThis is the original function:\n<pre><code>int greeter(char *name) {\n    printf_s(\"%s, %s!\n\", greetings[rand() % ((int) sizeof(greetings) / (int) sizeof(greet_t))], name);\n    int rerun = strcmp(\"Gabriel\", name);\n    if (!rerun) printf_s(\"Have a nice day!\n\");\n    return rerun;\n}\n</code></pre>\nWith the program compiled and running properly, I used IDA Pro to see the trace and found my function beginning on address <pre><code>0x004010B0</code></pre>.\nThen I set the variable <pre><code>DWORD orig_greeter = 0x4010B0</code></pre>. And wrote the following code:\n<pre><code>#include \"sky.h\"\n\nint myGreeter(char* name);\nint (__cdecl* origGreeter)(char*);\n\nbool __stdcall DllMain(HINSTANCE hInst, DWORD dwReason, LPVOID pvReserved) {\n    if (dwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) {\n        // Start Hook Sub-Routine\n        origGreeter = (int (__cdecl*)(char*))DetourFunction((PBYTE)orig_greeter, (PBYTE)myGreeter);\n        origGreeter(\"sir\");\n    }   \n    return true;\n}\n\nint myGreeter(char* name) {\n    printf_s(\"You've been hooked, %s!\", name);\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\nOnce DetourFunction tries to access the given offset it throws Access Violation and the function is not hooked. What am I missing?\n[Edits removed. No relevant for the question]\n",

            "content": "The problem is that I was considering the base address given by IDA Pro instead of process actual base address.\nThe IDA Base was <pre><code>0x400000</code></pre>, thus the offset really was <pre><code>0x10B0</code></pre>. Once I updated <pre><code>orig_greeter</code></pre> to this value, I call it as follows.\n<pre><code>HMODULE hModule = GetModuleHandle(NULL);\norigGreeter = (int (__cdecl*)(char*))DetourFunction((PBYTE)hModule+orig_greeter, (PBYTE)myGreeter);\n</code></pre>\nThe code itself still doesn't behave as expected, but it detours properly. The callstack showed it called <pre><code>myGreeter</code></pre> when it was supposed to. Therfore, I consider this question answered.\n",
