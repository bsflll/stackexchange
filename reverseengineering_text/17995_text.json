    "content": "I am stuck on making (my little self-task for learning) that thing:\n\nBasically it should be something like Themida or VMProtect (do mutation, virtualization, etc.), but in my case,\ni want to take ASM code between pointers, obfuscate it etc, and write it to some DLL. On original application, \nwe have a patched trampoline with generated by our \"disasm tool\" function... Hmm, any example how to make that? =)\nMaybe it is not a good idea of protection software code or something like that, i just do that for learning. I know how ASM pointers\nworks in theory. For example, i can do all of that manually with Olly, but how to do that programatically like VMProtect, Enigma or Themida\n\"compiler tools\" do this? Never tried to make a something like that by my self. And did not find any examples, because that is \"arcane\" level\nof programming, and also such things hard to find on opensource =(\nSo to questions:\n1)How to search programmatically ASM pointer inside compiled application?\n2)How to \"cut\" & disasm code between 2 ASM pointers programmatically?\n3)How to paste them back (after edit) programmatically?\n",

If you own the source code of the program, which you want to protect, it's even easier, because you'll be able to compile it via LLVM and have higher level of code manipulation.
