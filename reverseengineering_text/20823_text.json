It is not currently accepting answers.\n                                \n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Questions on software development are off-topic here, but can be asked on Stack Overflow.\n\n\nClosed 6 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Improve this question\n                    \n\n\n\nI am trying to look under the hood of libnotify, and ran <pre><code>strace notify-send 'hello'</code></pre> and one of the system calls is:\n<pre><code>sendto(5, \"AUTH\\r\n\", 6, MSG_NOSIGNAL, NULL, 0) = 6</code></pre>\nSurrounded by a:\n<pre><code>sendmsg(5, {msg_name=NULL, msg_namelen=0, msg_iov=[{iov_base=\"\\0\", iov_len=1}], msg_iovlen=1, msg_control=[{cmsg_len=28, cmsg_level=SOL_SOCKET, cmsg_type=SCM_CREDENTIALS, cmsg_data={pid=2555, uid=1000, gid=1000}}], msg_controllen=32, msg_flags=0}, MSG_NOSIGNAL) = 1</code></pre>\n<pre><code>sendto(5, \"AUTH\\r\n\", 6, MSG_NOSIGNAL, NULL, 0) = 6</code></pre>\n<pre><code>recvfrom(5, \"REJECTED EXTERNAL\\r\n\", 4096, 0, NULL, NULL) = 19</code></pre>\n(Full paste https://pastebin.com/wi9Ecvmk, the above is on lines 322 - 324)\nWhat is causing windows-like carriage returns here? I tried to look into Desktop notifications specs and to local installed libnotify's manual but found no explanation. No explanation in man pages of <pre><code>sendmsg</code></pre> or <pre><code>recvfrom</code></pre> either. And no component of this is ever going to run on any type of Windows.\nSo why is purely Linux program leveraging this type of newline?\n(I'm running Arch Linux if that makes any difference)\nEdit: I'm new in this so I'm sorry if it's really obvious and remove the question if needed.\n",
