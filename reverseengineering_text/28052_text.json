    "content": "I have a Huawei EchoLife EG8145V5 for which I am trying to build some software. It has a built-in Linux distro of some sort, but I would like to add to it, as there is \"plenty\" of storage space available. The system is built around BusyBox.\nHowever, to build the software, I need to set up a build environment that matches the CPU architecture, and this is where I come up short, as I am unable to find a kernel that I can use with QEMU. I did find one kernel, but it did not produce a compatible binary.\nThe only thing I know is what I get from <pre><code>cat /proc/cpuinfo</code></pre>:\n<pre><code>processor   : 0\nmodel name  : ARMv7 Processor rev 1 (v7l)\nBogoMIPS    : 1594.16\nFeatures    : swp half thumb fastmult edsp thumbee tls \nCPU implementer : 0x41\nCPU architecture: 7\nCPU variant : 0x4\nCPU part    : 0xc09\nCPU revision    : 1\nCPU physical    :0\n\nprocessor   : 1\nmodel name  : ARMv7 Processor rev 1 (v7l)\nBogoMIPS    : 1594.16\nFeatures    : swp half thumb fastmult edsp thumbee tls \nCPU implementer : 0x41\nCPU architecture: 7\nCPU variant : 0x4\nCPU part    : 0xc09\nCPU revision    : 1\nCPU physical    :1\n\nHardware    : Hisilicon A9\nRevision    : 0000\nSerial      : 0000000000000000\n</code></pre>\nI am unable to find the kernel image itself stored anywhere, which would make this a whole lot easier. So, what should be my next step? Anything else I can do to find the details I need to set up a good qemu dev environment?\nI do have a setup based around the <pre><code>cortex-a9</code></pre> and the <pre><code>vexpress-a9</code></pre> machine, plus some kernel I found somewhere (can't remember where) and it is working to some degree. It's just that dynamically linked binaries won't work, even after patching it with <pre><code>patchelf --set-soname</code></pre> and <pre><code>patchelf --set-soname</code></pre> - I either get segfault or permission denied.\nEDIT 1:\nI did manage to find the kernel config. It's a bit too long to paste here, but are there any lines I should look for that should lead me on the right track?\nEDIT 2:\nI've managed to extract the busybox binary from the router. <pre><code>file busybox</code></pre> produces this:\n<pre><code>ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /mnt/jffs2/app/output/ld-linux.so.3, for GNU/Linux 2.6.26, BuildID[sha1]=736041808c34871ed689d38e7cacfe18b1e65736, stripped\n</code></pre>\n",
