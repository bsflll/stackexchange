    "content": "I'm a RE beginner and I decided to start writing my own simple code for practice.\nI wrote a simple code which uses a winAPI function called CreateProcess to start a calc.exe, I've wrote it in C and compiled it using with the official Microsoft SDK with visual studio 2019 as a Release version.\nThe exe file works with Windows 7 and Windows 10 without any issue.\nI searched through IDA and went to the start function which should point where the main user code is, so here are my problems:\n\nThe start function's analysis has failed and I have failed to find where the code redirects to the CreateProcess function which I used in the code, this is how it looks:\n\n\n\nWhen I look up \"calc.exe\", I find it in a different section, where I'm not used to see it (as compared to the Practical Malware Analysis book examples).\nThis is how it looks:\n\n\nI have IDA pro 6.8 installed.\nThis is how the original code looks, the main function only contains a call to the Create() function:\n<pre><code>void Create()\n{\n    STARTUPINFO si;\n    PROCESS_INFORMATION pi;\n\n    SecureZeroMemory(&si, sizeof(si));\n    si.cb = sizeof(si);\n    SecureZeroMemory(&pi, sizeof(pi));\n\n    if (!CreateProcess(L\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\calc.exe\", NULL, NULL, NULL, FALSE, 0, NULL, NULL, &si, &pi))\n    {\n        printf(\"failed, error: %d\", GetLastError());\n    }\n    else {\n        printf(\"Process successfuly started!\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\nEDIT:\nI added to linked PDB file that was in the Release folder and IDA works great and it immediately detects the main function!\nBut I say to myself, if I'm a malware analyst, I will get the EXE file without any PDB file, so what am I to do?\n",
