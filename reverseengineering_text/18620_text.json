    "content": "I've stumbled upon Inno Setup installer with additional separate Arc archives (commonly with <pre><code>.bin</code></pre> extension) that I was unable to extract using normal methods:\n\nthe installer didn't work for an obscure reason (e.g.\n<pre><code>Runtime Error (at -1:0): Cannot Import EXTRACTFILENAME.</code></pre>),\nextracting the Arc file with FreeArc was impossible due to <pre><code>ERROR: unsupported compression method srep</code></pre>,\nalso, the archive was apparently password-protected (trying to open it with FreeArc UI resulted in Enter decryption password dialog box).\n\nHow can one deal with such a situation?\n",

            "content": "There are three main steps here:\n\nyou'll have to decompile/dissect the IS installer itself; the easiest way is to use Inno Setup Decompiler ; essentially, you'll need to get <pre><code>CompiledCode.bin</code></pre> from your <pre><code>.exe</code></pre> file, and then disasm it, possibly finding a code that handles the unpacking - it usually calls <pre><code>ISArcExtract</code></pre> or a similar library function, and is placed in a method named <pre><code>CURSTEPCHANGED</code></pre>.\nyou have to get SREP (SuperREP) extractor (for more info, see e.g. http://krinkels.org/resources/superrep-srep.107/ and https://www.fileforums.com/showthread.php?p=460707) - the easiest way is to get a pack called <pre><code>SrepInside0.33.7z</code></pre> (available for download in various places), as it has all the required files bundled (essentially, you'll get an <pre><code>unarc.exe</code></pre> with <pre><code>CLS-srep.dll</code></pre> lib and <pre><code>cls.ini</code></pre> config).\nin your Inno Setup's disassembly, locate the variable that holds the password itself (in case of <pre><code>ISArcExtract</code></pre> it's the 7th parameter passed), and pass it to your <pre><code>unarc</code></pre> call - note that it may contain non-printable characters (e.g. <32 ASCII codes), so that passing the password using a script is advisable.\n\nNote that there are different versions/variants to both Arc and SREP; the above method should work in most cases, though.\n",
