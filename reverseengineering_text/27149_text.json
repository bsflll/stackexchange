    "content": "So I run radare2 from the command line with <pre><code>r2 -</code></pre> and attempt to display the help with the <pre><code>?</code></pre> command. I read this line which says:\n<pre><code> ?[??][expr]             Help or evaluate math expression</code></pre>\nI am not sure how to read this. I assume the first <pre><code>?</code></pre> is <pre><code>Help</code></pre> command. And the rest <pre><code>[??][expr]</code></pre> is evaluate math expression. However, something like this <pre><code>?? 0xa</code></pre> does not return anything. So, my question is how to correctly interpret this output from the help.\n",
