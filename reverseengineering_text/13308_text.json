    "content": "I'm working on a reverse engineering project with fat executables on OS X. So far I have established the structure of the <pre><code>fat_header</code></pre>, <pre><code>fat_arch</code></pre> and <pre><code>macho_header</code></pre>, but am having trouble finding documentation about the ordering of the <pre><code>fat_arch</code></pre> sections. Right now my project works by assuming that <pre><code>fat_arch</code></pre> sections appear in order of ascending offset fields. Is this assumption correct, or can the <pre><code>fat_arch</code></pre> sections appear in any order?\n",

            "content": "There is no reliable resource which gives an answer to the concrete question if a order exists or not. The question is why would you expect a fixed order of <pre><code>fat_arch</code></pre> sections?\nThe kernel simply loads the Universal Binary at execution time, parses the <pre><code>fat_arch</code></pre> structure(s) and selects a matching architecture type. So in my understanding there is no need for a fixed (or expectable) order of the <pre><code>fat_arch</code></pre> sections.\n",
