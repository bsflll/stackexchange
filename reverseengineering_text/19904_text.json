    "content": "So there is <pre><code>win32k.sys</code></pre>, <pre><code>win32kbase.sys</code></pre>, <pre><code>win32kfull.sys</code></pre> in Windows 10\nDoes <pre><code>verifier /driver win32k.sys /flags 0x1</code></pre> enable special pool on all three drivers? (win32k.sys is kinda like stub to other drivers)\nBecause I have a crash that occurs only when enabling special pool specifically on <pre><code>win32kfull.sys</code></pre> by <pre><code>verifier /driver win32kfull.sys /flags 0x1</code></pre>. It doesn't crash when enabling special pool on <pre><code>win32k.sys</code></pre> or <pre><code>win32kbase.sys</code></pre>. Is this case weird?\nAlso, what would be the general setup regarding turning on the special pool when fuzzing <pre><code>win32k*.sys</code></pre>?\n",

Of course you may want to cut down on the notion that you're fuzzing stuff ;)\n",

After all the inquirer was asking <i>whether</i> enabling special pool on <code>win32k.sys</code> <i>also</i> affects the other two \"companion\" drivers.

The reason I asked is because I couldn't get all 3 drivers to have special pool turned on so was wondering whether turning it on <code>win32k.sys</code> will have similar affect. Now I got all 3 to have special pools turn on, but still the other question I must find out.</span>",

It looks like your memory corruption is in a memory chunk allocated in <code>win32kfull.sys</code>, that's why enabling special pool on this driver alone leads to a crash, and enabling it on other drivers does not.</span>",
