    "content": "Receipts from McDonald's in the UK include a code that allows you to complete an online survey as shown in the attached image (in the green box):\n\nAfter gathering and comparing several receipts I have deduced that the codes use a base 25 alphanumeric system consisting of the following characters:\n<pre><code>C M 7 W D 6 N 4 R H  F  9  Z  L  3  X  K  Q  G  V  P  B  T  J  Y\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n</code></pre>\n25 would therefore be <pre><code>MC</code></pre>, 26 <pre><code>MM</code></pre>, 27 <pre><code>M7</code></pre>, etc.\nThe code for this receipt is <pre><code>7MXW-NLH4-ZQ3K</code></pre> and can be broken down as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCode\nDecimal\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n<pre><code>7MX</code></pre>\n1290\nStore ID.\n\n\n<pre><code>W</code></pre>\n3\nNot sure, but the vast majority of receipts always seem to have <pre><code>W</code></pre> here.\n\n\n<pre><code>NL</code></pre>\n163\nOrder ID: last two digits + 125, so can be reversed by <pre><code>163 % 125</code></pre> which is 38.\n\n\n<pre><code>H4ZQ3K</code></pre>\n90,823,491\nProbably the date/time of purchase - more below.\n\n\n\n\nI have noticed that the last number (i.e. what I assume is the purchase date/time) increases with time when comparing receipts.\nFor example, another code's last 6 characters are <pre><code>H4F6XN</code></pre> (90,784,756) and the order was placed on 2022-12-27 19:10:05, just over a day before. A quick comparison:\n\n\n\n\nOrder 1\nOrder 2\nDifference\n\n\n\n\n90,823,491\n90,784,756\n38,735\n\n\n2022-12-28 20:59:51\n2022-12-27 19:10:05\n92,986 (seconds)\n\n\n\n\nDividing the difference of seconds by the difference of the 6 character number:\n<pre><code>92,986 ÷ 38,735 = 2.4 (approx.)\n</code></pre>\nIt would therefore seem that the number increases by 1 every 2.4 seconds. The result of 60 ÷ 25 also happens to be 2.4 which means 1/25th of a minute can be represented by a character from the base 25 system.\nFollowing the assumption of the number increasing by 1 every 2.4 seconds it seems that the first datetime (or \"epoch\") is approximately <pre><code>2016-02-01 00:00:00</code></pre>.\nTherefore to decipher the final value of <pre><code>H4ZQ3K</code></pre> in the first receipt:\n\n90,823,491 × 2.4 = 217,976,378.4 seconds\n2016-02-01 00:00:00 + 217,976,378.4 seconds = 2022-12-28 20:59:38.4\n\n...but note how the predicted timestamp is incorrect - off by 12.6 seconds (the other receipt comes out at 2022-12-27 19:10:14.4 - 9.4 seconds ahead).\nI'm stumped as to what's causing the error - does anyone have any ideas?\nSome more codes for reference (note how the predicted timestamp is never more or less than 60 seconds):\n\n\n\n\nCode\nLast 6 chars (decimal)\nPurchased\nPredicted\nAhead by (seconds)\n\n\n\n\n<pre><code>7MXW-NLH4-ZQ3K</code></pre>\n90,823,491\n2022-12-28 20:59:51\n2022-12-28 20:59:38.4\n-12.6\n\n\n<pre><code>M3NW-YRH4-F6XN</code></pre>\n90,784,756\n2022-12-27 19:10:05\n2022-12-27 19:10:14.4\n+9.4\n\n\n<pre><code>MNKW-M6H4-7FQX</code></pre>\n90,662,940\n2022-12-24 09:57:46\n2022-12-24 09:57:36\n-10\n\n\n<pre><code>CRGW-ZYHN-KHBP</code></pre>\n90,490,545\n2022-12-19 15:01:03\n2022-12-19 15:01:48\n+45\n\n\n<pre><code>CQMW-L9HN-KNC7</code></pre>\n90,488,127\n2022-12-19 13:25:56\n2022-12-19 13:25:04.8\n-51.2\n\n\n<pre><code>M9JW-QCH6-PT3Z</code></pre>\n90,170,362\n2022-12-10 17:34:42\n2022-12-10 17:34:28.8\n-13.2\n\n\n<pre><code>7NLW-NFH6-7XLV</code></pre>\n89,884,719\n2022-12-02 19:08:02\n2022-12-02 19:08:45.6\n+43.6\n\n\n<pre><code>MLZW-Y3HD-YTP9</code></pre>\n89,842,386\n2022-12-01 14:55:38\n2022-12-01 14:55:26.4\n-11.6\n\n\n<pre><code>MBQW-RCHD-YNQ9</code></pre>\n89,832,311\n2022-12-01 08:12:04\n2022-12-01 08:12:26.4\n+22.4\n\n\n<pre><code>MP4W-6DHM-QNNC</code></pre>\n88,550,775\n2022-10-26 17:51:16\n2022-10-26 17:51:00\n-16\n\n\n<pre><code>7HGW-RFRG-9JX9</code></pre>\n85,342,886\n2022-07-29 15:15:30\n2022-07-29 15:15:26.4\n-3.6\n\n\n<pre><code>MJFW-YNRK-P66H</code></pre>\n84,690,759\n2022-07-11 12:30:01\n2022-07-11 12:30:21.6\n+20.6\n\n\n<pre><code>CRFD-NZRZ-JZGP</code></pre>\n83,179,845\n2022-05-30 13:13:26\n2022-05-30 13:13:48\n+22\n\n\n\n\nPython functions for encoding/decoding:\n<pre><code>CHARS = \"CM7WD6N4RHF9ZL3XKQGVPBTJY\"\nBASE = len(CHARS)\n\ndef encode(num):\n    encoded = \"\"\n    while num >= BASE:\n        encoded = CHARS[num % BASE] + encoded\n        num //= BASE\n    return CHARS[num] + encoded\n\ndef decode(encoded):\n    num = 0\n    for x, c in enumerate(encoded):\n        exp = len(encoded) - x - 1\n        num += (BASE**exp) * CHARS.find(c)\n    return num\n</code></pre>\n",

Does the survey website validate and reject codes if you change the last letter to ‘correct’ the timestamp?

It appears to be calculated using the Luhn algorithm with 25 as the base instead of 10.\nUsing the code in photo as an example:\n\nThe code without a check digit: <pre><code>7MXWNLH4ZQ3</code></pre>.\nConvert to decimal: <pre><code>[2, 1, 15, 3, 6, 13, 9, 7, 12, 17, 14]</code></pre>.\nStart from the right and double every number in an even position.\nIf a number exceeds 24, re-encode it and sum the digits (e.g. 14 × 2 = 28, which becomes <pre><code>MW</code></pre>, which becomes <pre><code>[1, 3]</code></pre>, which becomes 4).\nSum all the digits.\nIf <pre><code>(total % 25) > 0</code></pre>, the check digit is <pre><code>25 - (total % 25)</code></pre>, otherwise it's <pre><code>0</code></pre>.\nIn this case, it's 16, or <pre><code>K</code></pre> in the base 25 character set.\n\n\nUpdate: I've created a script to do all this, available on GitHub here.\n",

As you've got there numbers that overflow end up as even too so the doubled digits will only end up even, meaning that you could swap the trailing 3 for a 7 and the checksum wouldn't change. But glad you've solved it!</span>",
