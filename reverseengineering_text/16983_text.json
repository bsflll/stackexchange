            "content": "Let's have a look of the function's description in MSDN:\n\nDetermines whether the calling process is being debugged by a\n  user-mode debugger\n\nAs you guessed, this function is commonly used as an anti-debugging trick with the aim to break the process whenever the program detects that it is being debugged. <pre><code>IsDebuggerPresent</code></pre> checks for the BeingDebugged flag in the PEB (Process Environment Block) and will return a non-zero value if it is indeed being debug.\nYou have several options to bypass this trick, some of them are:\nRuntime patching: \n\nSet EAX to zero after <pre><code>IsDebuggerPresent</code></pre> being called\nModify the PEB itself by injecting this code:  \n<pre><code>mov eax,dword ptr fs:[18]\nmov eax,dword ptr ds:[eax+30]\nmov byte ptr ds:[eax+2],0\n</code></pre>\nThis will patch the <pre><code>BeingDebugged</code></pre> flag in the PEB, ensuring <pre><code>IsDebuggerPresent</code></pre> always returns 0.\nYou can use a plugin like idastealth\n\nPermanent Patching: \n\nYou can fill the call to IsDebuggerPresent with NOPs or something similar to skip the check\n",
