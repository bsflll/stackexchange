    "content": "To evaluate different Java obfuscators, I want also consider if the obfuscators use preventive techniques against common tools used for automated deobfuscation.\nTherefore I plan to obfuscate a test program with different obfuscators and check, if deobfuscators have an impact on the obfuscated programs. \nSo I'm searching for common tools for automated deobfuscation to use them in my evaluation. Can you suggest some tools? Thank you!\n",
