    "content": "I know that there are differently methods to do a reboot.\nI'm working on a simple hyper-visor and I have a little problem when I want to reboot a multi-processor aware x86 Windows 7 Guest. \nThe main steps the OS does seem to be: Task Switch - Task Switch - Triple Fault. This happens on all CPUs except one which does not initiate a Task Switch at all and hangs somewhere. The last exit I get from it is a CPUID with EAX = 1 so I really don't know (yet) where or why it does not get to do a Task Switch like all the others. I'm a bit stuck on understanding this - maybe some details about what should normally happen will help me. \nWhat is the actual method that is used for a reboot by a x86 Windows 7? \nEDIT I figured this out a few days ago, but I haven't got time to update the post. I'm not going to answer my own question because I don't think this is a full and definitive answer, but for someone who might have the same problem this will make things a bit easier.\nTurns out, that the missing CPU was halted. The flow is, more ore less, this: Task Switch, Triple Fault (for n-1 CPUs) and halt (for the n-th CPU). After this there should be an init on each one and then everything is reset.\n",

There may be other scenarios that would cause Windows 7 to reboot through other mechanisms when performing a planned reboot. Perhaps others on this site can contribute with their expertise...\nâ€‹\nAt the lowest level, Windows calls <pre><code>hal!HalReturnToFirmware()</code></pre>, which calls <pre><code>hal!HalpReboot()</code></pre>, which is pretty well documented in ReactOS.\nIn both Windows 7 and ReactOS, the final instructions that actually cause the reboot are effectively:\n<pre><code>mov al, 0xFE\nout 0x64, al\n</code></pre>\nThis writes the system reset command to the keyboard controller's IO port.\n",
