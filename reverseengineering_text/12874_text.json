    "content": "I paid a freelancer programmer for an app to tun my clinic. He got about 95% of the project done, but then got a job elsewhere and vanished into thin air, along with my source code... So, I have a semi-working program and I need to finish it. How can I recover the source code (Visual Studio, C#) to a point I can finish what I need and then recompile it again? Is this possible? I'm willing to buy/pay...\n",
