    "content": "I'm trying to decompile and analyze the firmware for a D-Link router. I downloaded the firmware from their website, but when I run <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre> on it, I get:\n<pre><code>DECIMAL     HEX         DESCRIPTION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0           0x0         Ubicom firmware header, checksum: 0xCDED3035, image size: 1441792\n</code></pre>\nwhich is the complete size of the actual binary:\n<pre><code>-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1441792 Jun 10  2013 firmware.bin\n</code></pre>\nSo I assume that means binwalk wasn't able to find any tags to delimit the different parts of file right? \nI tried taking a hexdump next and looking for asterisks. I found a few, but no real apparent tags could be found.\nIs it possible the binary is encrypted or obfuscated in some way? What would be my next step here?\n",

            "content": "That is correct. Given the size of the firmware image, I'd guess that this is not a Linux based firmware, but probably an RTOS (IIRC, Ubicom had their own RTOS called IPOS).\nTry doing an entropy analysis (<pre><code>binwalk -E</code></pre>) and running <pre><code>strings</code></pre> on the firmware image. Low/medium entropy and the presence of ASCII strings would suggest that the firmware is not encrypted or compressed.\nYou can also try <pre><code>binwalk -A</code></pre> to search for common opcodes (Ubicom32 opcodes are supported), and will give you an idea if there are valid executable instructions in the firmware image.\n",
