    "content": "A very similar (or exact) question was asked here, though it was not answered properly. \n\nI am debugging a process in IDA and am unable to view the dynamic contents of the stack because its value points beyond the address shown in IDA's <pre><code>Stack view</code></pre>. My ESP is shown as pointing to <pre><code>0xFFFFD95C</code></pre> upon entry at <pre><code>main</code></pre>, while the largest address shown by IDA is <pre><code>0xFEFFFFFC</code></pre>.\nIs there a way to expand this memory range to the end of memory (i.e. <pre><code>0xFFFFFFFF</code></pre>)? \nFor those interested, the binary under test is the <pre><code>ELF Crack Me 1 - Time to learn x86 ASM & gdb</code></pre> challenge over at ringzer0team.com.\n",

            "content": "It seems you're using the GDB debugger backend. It does not provide enough information to IDA about available memory ranges, about which you usually get  a warning on startup:\n<pre><code>---------------------------\nInformation\n---------------------------\nThe current debugger backend (gdb) does not provide memory information to IDA.\nTherefore the memory contents may be invisible by default.\nPlease use the Debugger/Manual memory regions menu item to configure the memory layout.\nIt is possible to define just one big region for the whole memory\n(IDA will display question marks for missing memory regions in this case).\n---------------------------\nOK   \n---------------------------\n</code></pre>\nSo IDA defaults to 0-0xFF000000 (addresses above 0xFF000000 are used by IDA for internal netnode IDs and may lead to issues if used in actual program). So there are two solutions:\n\nEdit the memory regions made by IDA (Edit-Manual memory regions...) and add  a new one covering the regions you need (e.g. 0 to 0xFFFFFFF0, or a few smaller ones).\nInstead of GDB, use IDA's own Linux debugger which can properly query the OS about available memory regions.\n",
