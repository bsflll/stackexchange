    "content": "I was under the impression that reverse engineering can mainly be legally prohibited in two ways: via copyright law forbidding the making of copies; and via an end-user licence agreement (EULA) specifically prohibiting reverse engineering.\nI've come across a software licence that permits unlimited software copying (under certain conditions) & doesn't explicitly prohibit reverse engineering. I'm based in the UK, and thought that if UK law governed the agreement, that I would then be able to reverse engineer the software (under the certain conditions).\nIt just so happens that Californian law governs the licence so I'm slightly unsure as to whether I can legally reverse engineer the software.\nAnyone have any answers on the overall question of this post?\n",

Even if you get professional legal counsel, the counsel can end-up being wrong although I suppose legal insurance can help mitigate the damage in such situations.\n",
