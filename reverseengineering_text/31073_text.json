    "content": "I am using <pre><code>gdb-gef</code></pre> and I've searched the manual several times for the answer to this question. Sometimes I run a lot of commands and I would like to re-draw the current program state the way gef displays it when I step through the program (registers + stack + list view, etc...). Yes, I am able to get much of the same info with the <pre><code>info registers</code></pre>, <pre><code>info frame</code></pre>, etc... But I have not found a way to do this and it would be helpful.\n",
