    "content": "I have a small program that I wanted to debug.\nI run OllyDbg version 2 and attached the program to the debugger.  \nI received this window:\n\nYou can see that the addresses are from the Kernel memory.\nI want to see the code of the program, I tried to double click on all the opened thread but everyone are in a kernel memory.\nI noticed that the header is:  \n\nCPU - main thread, module USER32\n\nMaybe the problem is that it showing me the module's memory and not the program's memory.  \nAny idea how I can switch to the program's memory (user-space memory)?\n",
