I've encountered many times Windows functions that are supposed to return a Handle, and if they don't they return NULL.  Why do the checks afterward check against zero?  Zero isn't equal to NULL.\nAs an example:\nGetModuleHandleA:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getmodulehandlea\n",

For that reason if you'll attempt to \"See definition\" for <pre><code>NULL</code></pre>, many IDEs will drop you in a line <pre><code>#define NULL 0</code></pre> or something similar.\nThis has the additional benefit of <pre><code>NULL</code></pre> evaluating to <pre><code>false</code></pre> making conditional statements readable and intuitive.\nThe proper way, from a strict standard following perspective, would be to use <pre><code>NULL</code></pre> and not 0, and that's what most developers do. The compiler (or pre-processor in the case of <pre><code>#define NULL 0</code></pre>) will however translate that to a <pre><code>0</code></pre>.\nSome higher level languages (such as javascript and C++) use special expressions to signify null. One example is C++'s <pre><code>nullptr</code></pre>, that since C++11 is the required definition of <pre><code>NULL</code></pre>. Javascript uses a special object, <pre><code>null</code></pre>.\n",

            "content": "ISO C and C++ allow implementations to use a non-zero bit-pattern as the object representation for a null pointer, despite requiring that a literal <pre><code>0</code></pre> or <pre><code>(void*)0</code></pre> in the source (in a pointer context) is evaluated as a null pointer, equivalent to <pre><code>NULL</code></pre>.  Reasoning based on source definitions like <pre><code>#define NULL 0</code></pre> is not sufficient in C or C++.\nBut fortunately for everyone's sanity, all modern C and C++ implementations for x86 (and other modern ISAs) do use <pre><code>0</code></pre> in asm as the bit-pattern for NULL.  This makes non-portable code like <pre><code>memset(ptr_array, 0, size)</code></pre> work as expected, equivalent to a loop that sets each element to <pre><code>NULL</code></pre>.\nWhen was the NULL macro not 0? is asking about source-level non-zero definitions, but I think that's not allowed in modern C.  The answers mention several historical machines that had non-zero null pointer bit-patterns.  (i.e. what you'd see in the asm for code like <pre><code>do {...} while(p = p->next);</code></pre>)\n\nRemember that in asm, pointers are just 64-bit (or 32-bit) integers.  The whole idea of <pre><code>NULL</code></pre> is in-band signalling, not some special thing that isn't even a pointer-sized integer.  So we have to pick some constant.\n<pre><code>0</code></pre> is a convenient sentinel value because many ISAs can branch slightly more efficiently on a value being non-zero than checking for any other value.  e.g. ARM has <pre><code>cbnz</code></pre> to branch on non-zero without needing a <pre><code>cmp</code></pre>.  x86 has a minor code-size optimization of <pre><code>test eax, eax</code></pre> / <pre><code>jnz</code></pre> instead of <pre><code>cmp eax, 0</code></pre> / <pre><code>jnz</code></pre>.  (Test whether a register is zero with CMP reg,0 vs OR reg,reg?).  If FLAGS are already set by another arithmetic instruction, no <pre><code>test</code></pre> would be needed, but that's unusual for null pointer tests: usually you don't do math on a pointer and then test for NULL.\n(You're not seeing that optimization in your asm because your debug build stores to memory before testing.)\nAlso, <pre><code>0</code></pre> is easy to generate.  Some large number might take a larger instruction, or more instructions on some ISAs, to create in a register.  (e.g. x86 <pre><code>xor eax,eax</code></pre> instead of <pre><code>mov eax, imm32</code></pre>).  And zero-initialized static storage like <pre><code>static int *table = NULL;</code></pre> can be in the BSS instead of <pre><code>.data</code></pre> - modern systems zero-init the BSS.\n\nOn some systems (especially embedded) the <pre><code>0</code></pre> address isn't special, and you actually have system-management stuff there, like the start of a table of interrupt handlers.  So <pre><code>0</code></pre> can be a valid address, as well as being equal to <pre><code>NULL</code></pre>.  This kinda sucks, so this is where one might actually want a non-zero object representation for null pointers.  @Simon Richter comments about hacking an ARM compiler to use <pre><code>0x20000000</code></pre> as the NULL bit-pattern.\nOn systems using virtual memory (like Windows), we can simply avoid ever mapping the page containing that address, which helps detect bugs by making sure NULL-dereference actually faults.  (Remember that undefined behaviour in C and C++ is not required to fault, but it's certainly convenient if it does.)\n",
