    "content": "Today my AV found an antique piece of malware called Win9X.CIH.dam.\nInstead of just removing it I would like to make a little research for fun.\n\nWhat does \"data0513\" exactly mean? I can't understand what the 0513 is. I suppose it's some kind of offset but can't figure out from where.\nI'd like to dump the malware out of the host executable and disassemble it.\n",

A few possibilities come to mind:\n\nan archive member in case the exe has an embedded archive\noverlay area (data beyond the area covered by sections)\nPE resources\n...something else...\n0513 seems to be too small to be an offset so I suspect it's a sequence number. To know more you'll probably need to RE the AV engine to figure out what naming scheme it uses and how the numbers are assigned.\n",

Maybe yours does, but it is not likely the case because the regular user would never use that feature and it may be risky. \nYou can use a tool like: Virustotal\nTo preprocess your file and get some more insight on what the file is.\nVirusTotal it is not a tool just for scanning for malware as one may think. It has a very decent amount of automatic static binary analysis which you may find useful. That tool may throw you the offsets of the regions on which the malware lives, letting you extract it, for example.\nThen continue your research with your own tools.\n",

CIH inserted itself into spaces between the end of the file header and the start of the section, and between the end of one section and the start of the next, etc.  It changed the PE entrypoint field to point to itself so that it ran immediately.  If you use a disassembler such as IDA, you will be able to see the code, and from there you can extract it with a hex editor or similar.\n",
