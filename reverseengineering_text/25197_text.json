    "content": "I have a fairly large obfuscated program, and I need to mark all of the lines as code. I was able to do this in IDC by iterating through the lines and running <pre><code>MakeCode</code></pre>. It works for small amounts of code, but when I tried it on the entire program I waited for hours and nothing happened. Is there a more efficient way to mark every line as code?\n",
