            "content": "It's just a convoluted function call via function pointers.\n<pre><code>(*(int (__cdecl **)(int))\n</code></pre>\ncasts a given number to a pointer to a function pointer (note the <pre><code>**</code></pre> so second degree function pointer) and dereferences it so you end up with a regular function pointer. The calling convention in use being <pre><code>cdecl</code></pre>. The target function would look like:\n<pre><code>int __cdecl do_something(int some_arg) { ... }\n</code></pre>\nThe number being cast and dereferenced then is the address of <pre><code>etext</code></pre> plus 1. So at <pre><code>etext + 1</code></pre> is an address, that points to another address that points to a function.\nThat function then is called with <pre><code>a5</code></pre> as the argument, storing the return value in v5.\nIf I had to make up a C snippet, it would be something like this, the last line being what you posted:\n<pre><code>typedef int (_cdecl *fptr2)(int);    //first degree function pointer typedef\ntypedef int (_cdecl **fptr1)(int);   //second degree function pointer typedef\n\nint _cdecl do_something(int arg)\n{\n    return arg+5;\n}\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    struct\n    {\n        char unused;             //this is for the etext + 1\n        fptr2 pp_func;           //stores a fptr to a fptr\n    } etext;\n\n    fptr1 func = &do_something;  //first degree function pointer\n    etext.pp_func = &func;       //second degree function pointer\n    (*etext.pp_func)(1337);      //the actual call and the equivalent of your line\n}\n</code></pre>\nA more real-world example would probably be <pre><code>etext+1</code></pre> storing a pointer to a list of function pointers. Outside of that I rarely see second degree function pointers.\n",
