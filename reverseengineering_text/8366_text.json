    "content": "Some old games have a very simple text encoding in which:\n<pre><code>0x00 = '0'\n0x01 = '1'\n...\n0x09 = '9'\n0x0A = 'A'\n0x0B = 'B'\n0x0C = 'C'\n...\n0x22 = 'Y'\n0x23 = 'Z'\n...\n0xFF = string terminator\n</code></pre>\nI figure this encoding must be pretty common due to its extreme simplicity so I was wondering if there's a correct/de facto name for it.\n",
