    "content": "I have a Winbond W25Q64JVSSIQ flash chip that supports SPI. I've connected BusPirate through a SOP8 cable to the memory chip. <pre><code>PWR</code></pre> and <pre><code>VREG</code></pre> LEDs are on, so they're connected. BusPirate is connected to a Kali Linux VM on my host. I'm using the command, <pre><code>sudo ./flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0</code></pre> to identify the chip, but <pre><code>flashrom</code></pre> isn't able to.\n<pre><code>root@malnet:/opt/flashrom# sudo ./flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0\nflashrom v1.1-rc1-121-g8962267 on Linux 4.19.0-kali5-amd64 (x86_64)\nflashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org\n\nUsing clock_gettime for delay loops (clk_id: 1, resolution: 1ns).\nBus Pirate firmware 6.1 and older does not support SPI speeds above 2 MHz. Limiting speed to 2 MHz.\nIt is recommended to upgrade to firmware 6.2 or newer.\nNo EEPROM/flash device found.\nNote: flashrom can never write if the flash chip isn't found automatically.\n</code></pre>\nHow do I get the firmware dumped from the chip? Any ideas as to why <pre><code>flashrom</code></pre> may not be working or alternate methods to dump?\n",
