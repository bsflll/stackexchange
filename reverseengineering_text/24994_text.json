    "content": "Are there anyways I can learn what packageInfo.signatures[0] is so I can use it to apply the same algorithm in Python.\nTo further explain:\n<pre><code>    private static SecretKeySpec a(Context context) {\n        try {\n            PackageInfo packageInfo = context.getPackageManager().getPackageInfo(context.getPackageName(), 64);\n            if (!(packageInfo == null || packageInfo.signatures == null || packageInfo.signatures.length <= 0)) {\n                return new SecretKeySpec(Arrays.copyOf(packageInfo.signatures[0].toByteArray(), 16), \"AES\");\n            }\n        } catch (NameNotFoundException e2) {\n            ThrowableExtension.a(e2);\n        }\n        return null;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis android app is sending some sort of a key that is changing based on timestamp with every request it is sending. And it is using the above code for creating a SecretKeySpec which then gets used in below.\n<pre><code>    @NonNull\n    private synchronized String d(String str) {\n        byte[] digest;\n        try {\n            byte[] bytes = str.getBytes(\"UTF-8\");\n>>>>>>>     this.r.init(2, this.l);\n            byte[] doFinal = this.r.doFinal(this.k);\n            byte[] a2 = Bytes.a(doFinal, this.j, bytes, doFinal, this.n.a().getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));\n            digest = this.q.digest(a2);\n            Arrays.fill(a2, 0);\n            Arrays.fill(doFinal, 0);\n        } catch (Exception e2) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(e2);\n        }\n        return jl.a(digest);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSo, I know that the function argument <pre><code>str</code></pre> is for some reason <pre><code>currentTimeMillis * 1151</code></pre> which gets used in <pre><code>byte[] a2 = ...</code></pre> line then gets hashed with sha1 there comes the time based changing part. What I can't find is what signatures[0] is in this context and how can I achieve it, in the construction of the class, <pre><code>this.l</code></pre> is assigned with SecretKeySpec ( signature[0] ). <pre><code>this.r</code></pre> is an AES Cipher. From the readings I made, I think the \"2\" in <pre><code>init(2, this.l)</code></pre> means decode mode.\nAnd Can you please explain to me what is the effect of filling <pre><code>a2</code></pre> and <pre><code>doFinal</code></pre> variables with <pre><code>0(zeroes)</code></pre> in this context as it doesn't get used anywhere else.\n",

Meaning, this is the first signature file that the Android system has read from the <pre><code>META-INF/</code></pre> folder inside the APK.\nBasically, what you'll need to do is unzip the APK, look inside the <pre><code>META-INF/</code></pre> and grab whatever file has the extension <pre><code>.RSA</code></pre> (unlikely, but it could be <pre><code>.DSA</code></pre>). This essentially what the <pre><code>packageInfo.signatures[0]</code></pre> is returning, with the <pre><code>.toByteArray()</code></pre> making a <pre><code>ByteArray</code></pre> object of the data.\nIf you have any doubts, or are having issues further, I'd sugged using Frida to hook this function call and watch what is actually returned.\n",
