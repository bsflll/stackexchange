    "content": "After I group nodes in IDA in the Graph View and name them, I can't change the name. I tried <pre><code>Edit group text</code></pre> button:\n\nAnd <pre><code>Rename</code></pre> button:\n\nI also tried anterior, posterior, normal comment and repeatable comment.\nI tried it in 2 different versions of IDA: 7.2 and 7.6 and on 2 different unrelated executables.\nHere's the video in real time which demonstrates the problem:\nhttps://i.sstatic.net/2o4U5.jpg\n",
