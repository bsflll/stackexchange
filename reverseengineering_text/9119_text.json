    "content": "On the internet, it always shows that each pin of the IC has its own Boundary Scan register (the yellow boxes)\n\nBut looking at BSDL files there are actually more BS registers than pins.\nSo for the questions:\n\nIs it right to say that there are always more BS registers than pins?\nWhat are the other BS registers used for OR Why are they there?\nHow can we use JTAG(TAP controller, state machine etc) to find out which are the pin's BS register?\n",
