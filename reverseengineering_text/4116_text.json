    "content": "I am looking at an unstripped ARM elf firmware file using IDA Pro. There is an <pre><code>init()</code></pre> function and a <pre><code>main()</code></pre> function. From my understanding of the logic, it's probably structured like this:\n<pre><code>init()\nwhile (1) {\n   main();  \n}\n</code></pre>\nor the <pre><code>main()</code></pre> itself contains a super loop. However, the strange things are 1) I am not able to find any calling references for the <pre><code>main()</code></pre>. 2) Nor can I identify a super loop structure inside <pre><code>main()</code></pre>.\nThe <pre><code>main()</code></pre> is like this:\n<pre><code>  B1: PUSH    {R3-R7,LR}\n  ...\nRN_end_of_main:\n  B2: POP     {R3-R7}\n  B3: POP     {R3}\n  B4: BX      R3\n  (end of main)\n</code></pre>\nThe <pre><code>init()</code></pre> is like this (directly following main()):\n<pre><code>  A1: PUSH    {R3-R7,LR}\n      ...\n  A2: LDR     R0, main+1    # This is the only place that references main()\n  A3: B       RN_end_of_main\n  (end of init)\n  (data)\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>A1, A2, .. B3</code></pre> are line numbers added by myself here for easier explanation.\nFirst off, IDA Pro shows \"Three are no refs to main()\" when using \"Jumps to xrefs to operand...\" function. And line A2 is the only place in the whole firmware disassembly that references <pre><code>main()</code></pre>. However , it put address <pre><code>main+1</code></pre> to <pre><code>R0</code></pre> which I don't understand. It looks like <pre><code>R0</code></pre> is not used after jumping to <pre><code>RN_end_of_main</code></pre>, and the <pre><code>init()</code></pre> will just return using the originally pushed <pre><code>LR</code></pre> which will go nowhere.\nAnything missing in my understanding of this code? And is there some hidden way that <pre><code>main()</code></pre> can be called?\n",

            "content": "Finally I think I might have one explanation for this.\nThe ARM elf format firmware file is further converted to a hex bin file which is used by the boot loader to program into the on board flash. So my speculation is that both <pre><code>init</code></pre> and <pre><code>main</code></pre> probably are actually called by the boot loader code.\nThis speculation is possible because the elf file is still fully relocatable. The elf-->bin step might do a relocation process to make it callable by the already-present bootloader.\nWith this speculation, the <pre><code>init</code></pre> function doesn't call the <pre><code>main</code></pre> actually. Both just are called and returned normally by the bootloader.\n",
