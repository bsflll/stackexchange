    "content": "With conditional breakpoints I'm able to alter the return value of a function. For example, when setting a breakpoint on the return instruction, the following IDC expression ensures that the function always returns false:\n<pre><code>EAX=0\n</code></pre>\nNow I would like to override the second argument that the function receives with a value of zero. The breakpoint is set on the first instruction of the function (<pre><code>push 1Ch</code></pre>). Unfortunately, I cannot get the following IDC expression to work as intended:\n<pre><code>(ESP+8)=0\n</code></pre>\nWhen the function is called, the value located at <pre><code>ESP+8</code></pre> refers to the size of the buffer that is about to receive a bunch of values. By purposely setting the buffer size to zero, the function won't return any values.\nHow can I configure a conditional breakpoint with IDA that sets the value at <pre><code>ESP+8</code></pre> to zero? And is it possible to do this by simply editing the breakpoint instead of running a script?\n\n\nYou have to use IDC functions to write to memory addresses. I\n  recommend write_dbg_memory() function.\n\nI still can't get the script to run successfully. When using the <pre><code>write_dbg_memory</code></pre> function, I get the following error message:\n<pre><code>Runtime error at _idc+0x00000022: Attempt to call undefined function 'write_dbg_memory'\n</code></pre>\nIt also seems that the <pre><code>write_dbg_memory</code></pre> function that is listed here and here, uses different arguments (long ea, string data).\n",

So it has to follow the rules of writing a script. <pre><code>EAX = 0</code></pre> is a simple line you've used before.\nIf IDC is not working you can use idaapi.dbg_write_memory api. I've tried the following line as a condition and it works fortunately! Choose \"Python\" for the \"Scriptinng Language\" menue bar.  \n<pre><code>daapi.dbg_write_memory(GetRegValue(\"ESP\")+8,\"HELLO\")\n</code></pre>\n",
