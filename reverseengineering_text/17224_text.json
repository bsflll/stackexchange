    "content": "I just started learning about reconstructing C code from assembler instructions.\nI have the following piece of assembler code:\n<pre><code>mov eax dword ptr [ebp+8]\nadd eax, dword ptr[ebp-4]\nmovsx ecx, byte ptr [eax]\ntest ecx, ecx\njne XXXXX\ncomp dword ptr [ebp-4], ffh\njle XXXX\n</code></pre>\nI want to reconstruct the condition of these lines but I have some problems or things I am not sure about:\nI re-constructed the following:\nLet,<pre><code>ebp+8= param1</code></pre> and <pre><code>ebp-4 = i</code></pre>\n<pre><code>if(param1[i]!=’\\0’ || i<=0xff){\n…\n}\n</code></pre>\nBut I am wondering about this line:\n<pre><code>movsx ecx, byte ptr [eax]\n</code></pre>\nAs I understand <pre><code>movsx</code></pre> it moves a signed value into a register and sign-extends it with 1. Thus, <pre><code>ecx</code></pre> shouble look something like <pre><code>0xFFFFFF<eax></code></pre>. Because only the lower bytes (<pre><code>byte ptr eax</code></pre>) of eax are moved and ecx is 1 extended. Where am I wrong?\n",

            "content": "You may want to familiarize yourself with two's complement notation. It will only extend the sign bit (msb) into the larger register. So, the msb will be extended into all the additional bits -- sxxxxxxx -> sssssssssssssssssssssssssxxxxxxx\nFor example, if the byte value pointed to by <pre><code>eax</code></pre> was 1 (0b00000001), <pre><code>ecx</code></pre> would be 1 (0b00000000000000000000000000000001). Similarly, if it was the most positive number possible in a two's complement byte, 127 (0b01111111), <pre><code>ecx</code></pre> would be 127 as well (0b00000000000000000000000001111111). \nWhere the sign extension is needed is to maintain the value for negative numbers. If the value were -1 (0b11111111), then if you just simply zero-extended into a 32-bit value you would get 255 (0b00000000000000000000000011111111) in <pre><code>ecx</code></pre> instead of -1 (0b11111111111111111111111111111111).\n",
