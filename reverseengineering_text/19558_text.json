    "content": "I've found a bunch of obfuscated PHP scripts in my server but it seems I cannot deobfuscate them to follow the code flow. I came to the conclusion that the files have been obfuscated with https://www.php-obfuscator.com/ and no deobfuscate tool that I know can convert php goto/labels to loops so I strongly think this is not a duplicate question. Can goto/labels be converted to while/foreach loops?\n",
