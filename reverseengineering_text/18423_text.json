    "content": "When I place my cursor on an instruction (on the address, opcode or operand) in the IDA-view, and switch immediately to HEX-view, I expected the hex bytes corresponding to the instructions to be selected. However, IDA 7.0.171130 (x86_64) is not behaving as expected.\nAs an example, I have selected the address <pre><code>0x8000328</code></pre> in the IDA view (the cursor is not visible in the screenshot) which is a <pre><code>mov</code></pre> instruction. However, the HEX-view shows <pre><code>E8 D9 04 00 00</code></pre> highlighted with the cursor on it; which is a <pre><code>call</code></pre> instruction.\n",

One might want to see the assembly in the IDA View and at the same time to open the Hex View on this structure of bytes.</span>",
