    "content": "I overcame recent issues with a redefinition and finished my Plugin.\nIn short this plugin uses Hex-Rays Decompiler to decompile a given file, analyzes properties of the pseudocode and then appends the results to a <pre><code>.csv</code></pre>\nNow I tried to use this in batch mode, but was stumped as the following happened:\nCmd input to call IDA:\n<pre><code>idaw -A -c -Srecompile.idc input_file\n</code></pre>\nThe <pre><code>recompile.idc</code></pre> file:\n<pre><code>#include <idc.idc>\nstatic main() {\nWait();\nMessage(\"Hello world from IDC!\n\");\nRunPlugin(\"REcompile vs Hexrays\",0); \n//Exit(0);\n}\n</code></pre>\nI obviously need to <pre><code>Wait()</code></pre> for Auto-Analysis. <pre><code>Exit()</code></pre> is commented since it's for use when this is all fixed.\nNow i do get the following output on execution:\n<pre><code>The initial autoanalysis has been finished.\nHello world from IDC!\n\nLoadLibrary(C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA\\plugins\\REcompile vs Hexrays.plw) error: Das angegebene Modul wurde nicht gefunden.\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA\\plugins\\REcompile vs Hexrays.plw: can't load file\nHex-Rays Decompiler plugin has been loaded (v1.6.0.111005)\nHex-rays version 1.6.0.111005 has been detected, REcompile vs Hexrays ready to use\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see the script is executed before the plugins are loaded. I assume this is the reason why I get the <pre><code>LoadLibrary</code></pre> Error.\nIf you have any other input or experience with plugin batch execution i'd be happy to hear from you.\nGreetings, \nViktor\n",
