            "content": "You can use ghidra's Overlay memory blocks to achieve this. How much work this involves will depend on how many such memory locations are involved and whether they are in contiguous range(s).\nTo get you started for your specific case, the following instructions should help:\n\nUsing the Memory Map window, create two Overlay memory blocks, both located at <pre><code>0xFF8800</code></pre>, allocating to each the larger number of bytes (if they aren't the same) required for either the read or the write version of the register, making the block names something like <pre><code>PSGRead</code></pre> and <pre><code>PSGwrite</code></pre>,\n\nIn the Listing window:\n\nPress <pre><code>g</code></pre> (for \"go to address\") and enter <pre><code>PSGRead::FF8800</code></pre>, then,\nPress <pre><code>l</code></pre> (for \"label\") and enter a label name of your choice--perhaps <pre><code>ReadData</code></pre>.\n\n\nRepeat those two steps in the Listing window using the address <pre><code>PSGWrite::FF8800</code></pre> and a label something like <pre><code>RegisterSelect</code></pre>.\n\nFor each instruction in the Listing window that accesses address <pre><code>FF8800</code></pre>:\n\nClick on the operand that references that address.\nPress <pre><code>r</code></pre> (for \"reference\") to open the Reference Editor window, where, depending on whether the access is a <pre><code>read</code></pre> or a <pre><code>write</code></pre>, you can either:\n\nAlter an existing reference to the corresponding label, or,\nAdd a new reference to the corresponding label.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf that, supplemented by Ghidra's built-in help, doesn't get you there, reply here and either I or someone else can give additional help.\n",
