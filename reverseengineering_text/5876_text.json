    "content": "I'm running two virtual machines with Windows 7 (host OS Mac) using Virtualbox which I'd like to use to analyze malware. I have configured Visual Studio debugging and WinDBG, as well as other tools.\nWhat's the best way to save a backup of the victim machine to quickly recover from damage caused by malware? Should I make a .zip of the entire Virtualbox folder and store it elsewhere?\n\nAdditional question: is it safe to run malware on a virtual machine with bridged adapter network settings for VS remote debugging?\n",

At any later time, you can revert to that state, even\n  though you may have changed the VM considerably since then. A snapshot\n  of a virtual machine is thus similar to a machine in \"saved\" state, as\n  described above, but there can be many of them, and these saved states\n  are preserved.\n\n\nPlease create a separate Stack Exchange question for your second question.\n",
