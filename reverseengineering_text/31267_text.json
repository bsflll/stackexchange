    "content": "There is this old Windows application I've been using for more than a decade now: DesktopEarth. It got its last update in 2015 and the author's website is offline now, but it's been running fine on Windows 10. Recently, I upgraded to Windows 11 and now it won't start anymore, it crashes instantly. Compatibility mode doesn't fix the issue. I really like this application, it shows you the face of the earth with the correct day/night cycle, seasons, clouds, city lights at night, etc. - I don't feel at home on my Desktop without this background. And I can't find an adequate replacement for this app. So I want to try and fix it.\nHere's what the Windows application log is saying (sorry, couldn't figure out how to change the language, it's in German):\n<pre><code>Name der fehlerhaften Anwendung: DesktopEarth.exe, Version: 3.2.42.0, Zeitstempel: 0x553f6b3b\nName des fehlerhaften Moduls: ntdll.dll, Version: 10.0.22621.755, Zeitstempel: 0x42b70e75\nAusnahmecode: 0xc0000005\nFehleroffset: 0x000653f5\nID des fehlerhaften Prozesses: 0x0x435C\nStartzeit der fehlerhaften Anwendung: 0x0x1D90E747D1A2A1D\nPfad der fehlerhaften Anwendung: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\DesktopEarth\\DesktopEarth.exe\nPfad des fehlerhaften Moduls: C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\ntdll.dll\nBerichtskennung: 1b12aa9f-2912-4517-8b57-dfa6f8eeb950\nVollst√§ndiger Name des fehlerhaften Pakets: \nAnwendungs-ID, die relativ zum fehlerhaften Paket ist: \n</code></pre>\nLooks like it crashes in <pre><code>ntdll.dll</code></pre>... maybe if I revert that to an older version, it will work again? So I downloaded an older version of <pre><code>ntdll.dll</code></pre> from the internet (hopefully not some randomware), placed it next to <pre><code>DesktopEarth.exe</code></pre> and... same error. It's still using <pre><code>C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\ntdll.dll</code></pre>. So I added <pre><code>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\DesktopEarth</code></pre> to my PATH, hoping that this would make <pre><code>DesktopEarth.exe</code></pre> prefer my custom <pre><code>ntdll.dll</code></pre> but still nothing. Is the path to the dll hardcoded in the exe? I was kinda getting my hopes up, because someone on the internet had a similar issue and placing an old version of <pre><code>ntdll.dll</code></pre> seemed to have helped. But I don't want to replace <pre><code>C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\ntdll.dll</code></pre>, it will probably break some other stuff on my system...\nHow can I make <pre><code>DesktopEarth.exe</code></pre> use my custom <pre><code>ntdll.dll</code></pre>? I heard there's a thing called dll hijacking that may help here? Does anyone know how to do that?\n",

Also, it's not a screensaver, it updates your desktop background every few minutes. That's not what a static image can provide, but thanks for the link to the source images.</span>",

You can download the application from archive.org and install it (in a VM) on Windows 10 or lower and see for yourself. There is a separate alpha layer for clouds that is updated from a webservice. Yes, the ground textures are static (including the snow), and they are stretched over a sphere, but the sphere rotates in sync with earth and shows the correct day/night cycle. There's some more post processing going on to make it seem like the sphere has an atmosphere and so on. If it were that trivial to re-implement, I might give it a try myself.</span>",

            "content": "A tool like Enigma Virtual Box might help, since it can be used to pack DLL-dependencies into a single executable. I would use it on a system where everything works to pack the system's DLLs (including at least <pre><code>ntdll.dll</code></pre>) into a new DesktopEarth.exe, so they are virtually in the same directory (and DLLs are first loaded from the local directory).\nIf <pre><code>ntdll.dll</code></pre> is only loaded from <pre><code>DesktopEarth.exe</code></pre> and not indirectly, it would be possible to simply put a working version of the DLL into the directory of the executable. (But I highly doubt that's the case.)\nIt depends on the dependency tree and which of Win11's DLLs are incompatible with Win10's DLLs, on how many files you'd have to include. It would be trial and error.\nDependencies can for example be checked with shell scripts like\n<pre><code>objdump -p DesktopEarth.exe | grep \"DLL Name\"  \nfor FILE in *.dll; do objdump -p $FILE | grep \"DLL Name\"; done\n</code></pre>\nor by using a PE viewer, such as PEExplorerV2.\nGood luck.\n",
