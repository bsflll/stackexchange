    "content": "I have patched a loadable object (an .so file) from this:\n<pre><code>xor eax,0x304b7c0\n</code></pre>\nto this:\n<pre><code>mov eax,0x0\n</code></pre>\nWhen I try to run my binary with these modifications, the application loads the .so file and then it adds the base address of the .so file to every memory address in the binary so that instruction ends up looking like this in my gdb debugger (intel flavor):\n<pre><code>0xf463cd95: mov    eax,0xf44ae000\n</code></pre>\nHow do I make it not do that? Thanks in advance for the help!\n",
