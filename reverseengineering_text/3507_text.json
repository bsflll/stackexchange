    "content": "I know some binary diff tool like VBinDiff and others.\nCurrently I have a large number of binary, around 500.\nSo I am looking for a binary tool to quantitatively evaluate the difference of binaries..\nLike evaluate the difference of binary 10 and binary 100 is 56%. Difference of binary 50 and binary 200 is 78%.\nIs there any tool like this? \nThank you!\n",

So tools like VBinDiff can highlight all the different bytes in hex, and I am thinking to find a tool to sum up all the highlighted bytes, thus can get the number of different bytes... Do you know certain tools like this..?</span>",
