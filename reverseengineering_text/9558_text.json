Try to compile/link <pre><code>php</code></pre> with <pre><code>-O0</code></pre> and <pre><code>-g</code></pre>. Also, unless you cut some parts of the backtrace, your stack is probably broken, as <pre><code>execute_ex</code></pre> seems to have been called out of thin air.

I wonder how up-to-date the site is you linked to. But as the value of <pre><code>executor_globals</code></pre> is wrong, and your PHP site says \"Important!
