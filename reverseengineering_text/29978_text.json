    "content": "I am trying to create an instance of a class of an iOS app using Frida.\nIn the past I have successfully done this using a command such as:\n<pre><code>var instance = ObjC.chooseSync(ObjC.classes.TestClass)[0];\n</code></pre>\nHowever, in this instance, the class that I would like to create an instance of has a <pre><code>.</code></pre> in the name so if I try the same command as above I understandably get an error:\n<pre><code>var instance = ObjC.chooseSync(ObjC.classes.Test.Class)[0];\nSyntaxError: expecting field name\n</code></pre>\nI had identified the class from the output of:\n<pre><code>Object.keys(ObjC.classes).filter(function(m){ return m.toLowerCase().includes(\"test\") });\n</code></pre>\nThe output of this lists a number of classes, all of which are either mangled Swift names, or have a <pre><code>.</code></pre> in them so I'm not sure if I simply don't understood a concept here about how Frida handles class names in a Swift and Objective-C app, or there is something I've missed in attempting to create the instance.\n",
