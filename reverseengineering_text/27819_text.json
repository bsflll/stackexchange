I know that the IV might be at the front of the encrypted text and its size is probably 12 bytes but I don't know how to get it from the encrypted text.\n",

The nonce is also public and therefore my be prepended to the cipher text. Note that the nonce has a variable length and not a fixed like an IV. But if you don't have the nonce GCM decryption is as far as I know not possible.\n",
