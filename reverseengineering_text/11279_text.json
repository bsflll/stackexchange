All I remember is that the format was easily readable, not hex.\n",

            "content": "i believe this cant be done easily without debug information \\ symbols. \nStatically linked libraries means that part of the code of the program contains the functions of the third party libraries.\nLets take for example an open ssl library.\nOnce you compile your code with the openssl code attached (as part of your code solution), in the assembly you cant really know which part of the code is part of the library and which one is the code of your main program.\nIf you want a way to figure out if a library is linked into your program, you might want to try to look for debug strings that were left behind during compilation that would help out.\nAlso for future reference and finding dynamically linked libraries, i would suggest CFF-explorer\n",
