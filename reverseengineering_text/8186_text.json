    "content": "I found an assembler instruction: <pre><code>mov [esi+2F],dl</code></pre>. I think ESI is a reference to a struct or class. <pre><code>0x2F</code></pre> is the offset that references a property of the struct/class. Is it possible to find the value of the ESI register? I think this class or struct is initialized when the game is started.\nFor example, I tried to reverse GTA San Andreas. A lot of memory addresses of the GTA SA here.\nI've found such information in this site: 0xB6F5F0 - Player pointer (CPed).\nI think it's address that I finding now. But how I can find it with debugger like cheat-engine without pointer scan? I'd like to find addresses in asm code. It's possible?\nI tried to set a breakpoint to the instruction. But I think it's useless because ESI address is dynamic. As I understand CPed struct/class uses dynamic memory allocation.\nI am sorry for my bad English and thanks in advance.\n",

            "content": "Yes, it is possible\nI'm going to explain you a bit how most games do it (I have never reversed any GTA but I suppose it's something like this anyway).\nI'm going to cover static and dynamic allocation of structures.\n\nThe static way:\n<pre><code>GlobalGameInfo g_info;\n// ...\ng_info.some_data = 1;\n</code></pre>\nThis is what ends up being a static offset in IDA, like so:\n<pre><code>lea eax, [g_info + 0xAABB] ; suppose 0xAABB is the offset for 'some_data'\nmov [eax], 1;\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>g_info</code></pre> is always going to stay at the same offset, so once you find it, you can just use <pre><code>g_info + offset</code></pre> to get your data.\nThe dynamic way:\n<pre><code>Player* players; // can be defined as Player* players[<count>] or Player** players;\n                 // it's the same\n// ...\nplayers = new Player[players_count];\n// ...\nplayers[1].alive = false;\n</code></pre>\nWhich then results in:\n<pre><code>; this is a static location which is actually the \"players\" variable\n; and it contains an address which points to the offset in memory of the\n; actual players structure\ndword_xxxx dd ?\n</code></pre>\nSo to use it in e.g. Cheat Engine, you <pre><code>Add a new address</code></pre>, check <pre><code>Pointer</code></pre>, add the <pre><code>xxxx</code></pre> part of <pre><code>dword_xxxx</code></pre>, and in offset, put your desired offset.\nFor example, to get <pre><code>players[1].alive</code></pre>, with <pre><code>alive</code></pre> being on offset e.g. 0x100, you'd calculate:\n<pre><code>value_stored_in_dword_xxxx + sizeof(Player) * player_id + 0x100\n</code></pre>\nSo if <pre><code>dword_xxxx</code></pre> -> <pre><code>0xAABBCCDD</code></pre>, <pre><code>sizeof(Player)</code></pre> -> <pre><code>0x204</code></pre>, <pre><code>player_id</code></pre> -> <pre><code>8</code></pre>, and <pre><code>offset</code></pre> -> <pre><code>0x100</code></pre>, your calculation would be:\n<pre><code>0xAABBCCDD + (0x204 * 8) + 0x100\n// ^base      ^size   ^id  ^offset\n</code></pre>\n\nThe example\nSince you gave us <pre><code>mov [esi + 0x2F], dl</code></pre>:\n\n<pre><code>esi</code></pre> is a pointer to the structure. Look above (in the disassembly).\n\n\n<pre><code>mov esi, dword ptr [dword_xxxx]</code></pre> (most probably) means it's dereferencing a pointer, which means that the structure is allocated dynamically.\n<pre><code>mov esi, offset dword_xxxx</code></pre> (most probably) means that it's just assigning the address (<pre><code>xxxx</code></pre> part) to <pre><code>esi</code></pre>, so this is a static address.\n\n\n\nThe usage\nCheat Engine\nIn Cheat Engine, it's easy as inputting the pointer and the offset:\n\nAs you can see, <pre><code>0x5CCB138</code></pre> is the <pre><code>dword_xxxx</code></pre>, the value inside <pre><code>dword_xxxx</code></pre> is <pre><code>0x09021A00</code></pre>, and that + <pre><code>0x142</code></pre> (my offset) results in the start of the in-game name.\nC\nIn case you want to do it programmatically, you can do it like this in C:\n<pre><code>PCHAR my_name = PCHAR (*PDWORD(0x5CCB138) + 0x142);\n^save the addr|       | ^deref to get     | add the offset\n              | ^cast |    0x09021A00     |\n\n// -> be careful, do not surpass the max length!\n// -> also remember that there's 'your name' length + 1 \\x00 byte\n//    at the end!\nchar new_name[] = \"newName\";\nstrncpy(my_name, new_name, sizeof(new_name)); // again: be careful with the length!\n</code></pre>\nThe proper way, however, would be reversing the entire struct like this:\n<pre><code>struct player_data {\n    int ID;\n    char name[15];\n    int some_data;\n    ...;\n};\n// make sure the order / size of each item is correct!\n// a single error can fuck up the entire struct\n\n// I'm going to assume you understand pointers\nplayer_data* data = *(player_data**) 0x5CCB138;\n\n// do your changes\n// again, be careful with the length!\n// also note that sizeof() will not work if you use char*\nchar new_name[] = \"new name!\";\nstrncpy(data->name, new_name, sizeof(new_name));\n</code></pre>\n",
