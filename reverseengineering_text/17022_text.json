In binary, that is:\n<pre><code>1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111</code></pre>\nWhat can we say about this\n  number? It's first (leftmost) bit is 1, which means that this\n  represents a number that is negative. That's just the way that things\n  are in two's complement: a leading 1 means the number is negative, a\n  leading 0 means the number is 0 or positive.\nTo see what this number is a negative of, we reverse the sign of this\n  number. But how to do that? The class notes say (on 3.17) that to\n  reverse the sign you simply invert the bits (0 goes to 1, and 1 to 0)\n  and add one to the resulting number.\nThe inversion of that binary number is, obviously:\n<pre><code>0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000</code></pre>\nThen we add one. \n<pre><code>0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001</code></pre> \nSo the negative of 0xFFFFFFFF is\n  0x00000001, more commonly known as 1. So 0xFFFFFFFF is -1.\n",
