All data references to the segment will be replaced by constant values. This may lead to drastic changes in the decompiler output. If the segment is not read-only, please change the segment NAME.\n\nHow can we fix this issue in IDA Pro?\n",

            "content": "What is the meaning of this message in IDA?\n\nWhen you load a file into Ida (.exe, ⁣.dll, ⁣.bin,,.hex, etc.), it creates at least one segment for the memory address (you can add or remove segments on your own). Every segment has a unique name that you can change. A segment with the name .text means that the content of this segment is read-only and not writable. So if a piece of code is accessing this segment and changing a variable value in it, the message in your question will appear and say that the target segment is considered read-only, which results in wrong decompiled code.\n\nHow can we fix this issue in IDA Pro?\n\nTwo workarounds:\n\nChange the <pre><code>segment name</code></pre> to something else: View->Open subviews->Segments (Shift+F7), right click on the segment-->Edit, Change the name.\nChange the <pre><code>segment permission</code></pre> to read and write: Follow the above path and check the <pre><code>write</code></pre> and <pre><code>read</code></pre> check boxes.\n",
