    "content": "I am running my IDA script on many files (batching), and i need to get the file name the script is running on within the script. the problem is i cannot find any API that does that.\nthe closest things i found was GetIdbDir(), which doesn't include the file name, also there seems to be a get_path function in ida_loader, but it expects a c type pointer, when i gave it a python string it failed.\n",
