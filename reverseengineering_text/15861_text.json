    "content": "I'm using BinDiff to perform diff operation between two 32-bit Binaries (one of them is a DLL and the other one an EXE).\nWhen I perform the Diff Operation, I get the error message:\n\nAdding new Diff to workspace failed. Diff binary does not exist.\n\nI am using IDA Pro version 6.9.160222 and BinDiff version 4.2.0\nI opened each of the binaries with IDA Pro and saved the IDB file.\nBinDiff was launched using bindiff.cmd (which in turn launches the bindiff.jar)\nFrom the GUI, I created a New Work Space and then from the menu, Diffs -> New Diff\nFor the Primary and Secondary source, I selected the IDB files corresponding to each of the binaries. Now, when I press Diff, it gives the error message: \"Adding new Diff to workspace failed. Diff binary does not exist.\"\nWhy is it not able to locate the Diff Binary?\nBoth differ.exe and differ64.exe are present in the same directory as bindiff.jar\nAnother option I tried was in IDA Pro, instead of saving the IDA, I used the BinExport plugin to save the BinExport Files. Even when BinDiff uses the BinExport files saved from IDA Pro, I get the same error message.\nMy OS Version is: Win 7 64-bit.\n",
