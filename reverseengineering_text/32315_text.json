    "content": "I am trying to decrypt Lua files from an Android game \"The Sea Road: Fate Assembly\" (APK download link). It uses Cocos2d-x, but it's encrypted, maybe with AES encryption.\nWith Frida, the game will crash when I hook it. It also crashes in IDA64 when I hook it. Have someone an idea and when I search for the sig: GuoSig, I can't find it.\n",
