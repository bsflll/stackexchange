    "content": "What is the Linux equivalent to <pre><code>OllyDbg</code></pre> and <pre><code>IDA Pro</code></pre> ? Or if there are multiple tools that do the various functions that <pre><code>OllyDbg</code></pre> and <pre><code>IDA Pro</code></pre> do, where can I find these tools? I'd like to start reversing some elf files on Linux and I'm just looking for a set of tools to get me started.\n",
