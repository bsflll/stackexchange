    "content": "i'm reversing this function doing this floating point calculations which eventually leads to a crucial compare. I need to understand what exactly are the calculations that are made and i want to re-write them in python. \nBasically i need to rewrite this whole piece of code because the calculations that happen later on are some sort of key generation, but i cant understand what is the calculation done in here.. I was hoping someone could help me figure this out, while i give all the information i already understand.\nThe piece of code:\n<pre><code>sub     esp, 8\nmovsd   xmm0, ds:MEMORY1 ; mov 128-bit memory    \nmovsd   [esp+1437Ch+var_1437C], xmm0    \nmov     eax, [ebp+ItirationCounter_var_60]\nmov     [ebp+CurrentCounter_var_A8], eax    \ncvtsi2sd xmm0, [ebp+CurrentCounter_var_A8] ; Convert to floating point into xmm0    \nmov     ecx, [ebp+CurrentCounter_var_A8] ; 32    \nshr     ecx, 1Fh        ; 0    \naddsd   xmm0, ds:MEMORY2[ecx*8] ; adds 0    \nsub     esp, 8    \nmovsd   [esp+14384h+var_14384], xmm0    \ncall    msvcrt.fmod            ; returns A / B floating point remainer    \nadd     esp, 10h    \nfstp    [ebp+var_F8]    ; Store ST0 in memory    \nmovsd   xmm0, [ebp+var_F8]    \nucomisd xmm0, ds:MEMORY3 ; always zero    \nlahf                    ; load AH Flag register    \ntest    ah, 44h    \njp      short CrucialFunction\n</code></pre>\nOk, so the op-codes \\ pieces of code i dont understand are: <pre><code>addsd   xmm0, ds:MEMORY2[ecx*8]</code></pre>, <pre><code>call fmod</code></pre> and the <pre><code>ucomisd xmm0, [MEMORY1]</code></pre> .\n\nI can understand that the fmod function is receiving the arguments from the xmm0 opcodes that happen earlier with the <pre><code>sub esp, 8</code></pre>, but the output is not the same as the output i recieve when doing this function on python.. maybe im missing something.\ni just dont understand what <pre><code>ucomisd</code></pre> is doing.. and how it effects the <pre><code>ZeroFlag</code></pre> and <pre><code>ParityFlag</code></pre>, so this is an issue...\n\nhere is my so-far python implementation i made for this little piece of code (it runs in a loop which is missing for the code-snap i gave, so bare with me please)\n<pre><code>MEMORY1 = 0x4024000000000000 #qword_7600D600\nMEMORY2 = [0x0, 0x41F0000000000000] #qword_7600D620\nMEMORY3 = 0x0\n\ndef ToDoublePrecision(value):\n    # cvtsi2sd xmm0, value\n    return hex(struct.unpack('<Q', struct.pack('<d', value))[0])\n\ndef KeyGeneration():\n    counter = 0\n    while 1:\n        counter &= 0xFFFFFFFF # Sanity - maintain 32 bit\n        xmm0 += MEMORY2[(counter) >> 0x1F] # This is wrong.. ---- addsd   xmm0, ds:MEMORY2[ecx*8] \n        if(1 == (0x80000000 & counter)):\n            pass # I dont know what is going on in here..\n        else:\n            xmm0 = ToDoublePrecision(counter) # This is a little hack.. the value at MEMORY[0] is 0x0.. so i just decided this should happen\n\n        # This calculation is inaccurate for some reason, and differs a lot from the output on register ST0    \n        result = math.fmod(MEMORY1, xmm0)\n        ....\n        ....\n\n        \"\"\"\n        ZeroFlag = 1, well if the last calculatio is set to zero\n        ParityFlag = 1, is set if the last calculation amount of set bits ('1' - ones) is odd\n        \"\"\"\n</code></pre>\nI'm just stuck on these opcodes for quite some time.. if anyone can give me a good reference on the internet which explains how they work or what they do.. That could be super helpful.\nAn example of an fmod call and its arguments:\nJust before the <pre><code>CALL msvcrt.fmod</code></pre> instruction, ESP looks like that:\n<pre><code>EBP-14384 012FBC30   00000000\nEBP-14380 012FBC34   40438000\nEBP-1437C 012FBC38   00000000\nEBP-14378 012FBC3C   40240000\n</code></pre>\nmy <pre><code>ItirationCounter</code></pre> is set to <pre><code>0x27</code></pre>\nand the result of the <pre><code>msvcrt.fmod</code></pre> function into ST0 is\n<pre><code>Float 9.0000000000000000000</code></pre>, <pre><code>Hex 4002 90000000 00000000</code></pre>\nGoing to 'var_F8' after the opcode <pre><code>fstp    [ebp+var_F8]</code></pre>, the value is a QUAD_WORD of <pre><code>0x40220000 00000000</code></pre> (Ordered)\nAfter all that, <pre><code>LAHF</code></pre> changes <pre><code>AX</code></pre> to the value <pre><code>0x220</code></pre>, which means <pre><code>AH</code></pre> is <pre><code>0x02</code></pre>. \nthe jump is taken.\n",
