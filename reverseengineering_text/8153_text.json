    "content": "My company has an ancient payroll system that we want to virtualise so that it can be preserved for legal reasons. The software runs on an operating system called THEOS.\nWe've run into a bit of a snag. The operating system depends on a security dongle being present to install and run. The device is a sentinel C-Plus A (see below). It connects to a parallel port and acts a passthrough device for a parallel printer.\n\nI've been exploring options on how to virtualise this dongle. My plan is to somehow emulate the dongle, attach the virtual device to VMware machine and install THEOS as a VM (I already know THEOS is compatible with VMware).\nSo far, I've managed to find this forum which is hosting a dumper and emulator for this dongle, but I'm not able to download it as I'm not a member (and cannot join without an invite code).\nI've also found this business that claims to be able to create an emulator for this dongle, and am in the process of contacting them about it. However, we would prefer to do this ourselves rather than go through someone else.\nDoes anyone have any advice or experience for a situation like this? Or perhaps information on how we can access the tools hosted on the exeforums site?\n",

I did get a response from them about the fact that theos could be virtualised, but I haven't managed to hear back from them about the security dongle yet. @JasonGeffner Interesting; I hadn't seen the word 'virtual dongle' in the other documentation I was looking at. This gives me some hope; I'll push the vendors harder.\n",

I thought it was my VM setup, but everything seems right there. Thanks.\n",
