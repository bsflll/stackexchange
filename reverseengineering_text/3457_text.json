I rather would read pseudo-code. \nAre there any documents, tutorials or tools for this work targeting MIPS platform? What methods are you people using ? Sorry if this question is off-topic but normal Google search didn't yield much for MIPS.\nEdit: I try to decompile modem firmware image and look for default telnet password actually since WebUI passwords dont work and my ISP does not know it too.\n",

            "content": "IDA's decompiler only supports ARM and x86. With that said, there are a couple you can try:\n\nREC - This one has already been mentioned. Last I used it, it would segfault when you issued the 'help' command, so YMMV.\nRetargetable Decompiler - This is an online decompiler that supports various architectures, including MIPS. It's OK at getting a general idea of how the code works, but in my experience misses important details (it showed data being written to undefined pointers, for example).\nJEB - JEB 2.3 is a professional reverse-engineering platform that supports native decompilation of MIPS 32-bit code. The output is interactive and can be refactored/modified, similarly to Hexrays'.\n\nUltimately, you are probably better off learning to read the disassembly. One thing that I commonly do is manually convert individual code blocks to pseudo-code; in IDA you can then right-click on a code block, select 'Group Nodes' and replace the disassembly in that code block with whatever text you want (e.g., the pseudo code). This makes it much easier to break down and understand complex functions.\n",

Also a quick tip, since eCos is open source, I've had some success in the past building IDA FLIRT signatures for the eCos libraries; didn't catch everything of course, but it was a big help.</span>",
