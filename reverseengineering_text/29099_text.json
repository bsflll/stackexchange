    "content": "I've been working in IDA Pro with a project but there is an issue. Try-Catch statements don't look nice.\nI've been searching and it seems like IDA does not support them so I was wondering if there is a way to either:\n\nHide sections of the Pseudocode\nCreate extensions for Hex-Rays to support them\nTell IDA how and where the exceptions are\n\nThis is how the thing looks like at the moment:\n<pre><code>  v3.SavedRegs = &savedregs;\n  v3.Handler = &loc_43B24C;\n  v3.Next = NtCurrentTeb()->NtTib.ExceptionList;\n  __writefsdword(0, &v3);\n  Controls::TControl::ReadState(Self, a2);\n  __writefsdword(0, v3.Next);\n</code></pre>\nAnd I would like to end up with something like this:\n<pre><code>  try {\n    Controls::TControl::ReadState(Self, a2);\n  } ... {}\n</code></pre>\nOr if I can just hide those parts...\n<pre><code>  //try {          <- Block comment (parts hidden)\n    Controls::TControl::ReadState(Self, a2);\n  //} ... {}       <- Block comment (parts hidden)\n</code></pre>\nAnything is good as long as I can hide those lines because they are distracting AF. Thank you very much!\n",

            "content": "I've considered doing this myself, but it's tricky for many reasons.\nFirst, exception internals are not standardized across languages, platforms, or implementations. 64-bit Windows programs use a data-driven exception model, i.e., the <pre><code>RUNTIME_FUNCTION</code></pre> (etc.) entries in the <pre><code>.rdata</code></pre> segment. In this paradigm, the binary pre-registers information about exception scopes and handlers with the operating system via standardized structures, which takes care of lookup and dispatch when an exception occurs. Your example shows 32-bit Delphi; 32-bit Windows programs use a code-driven exception model, where the code is responsible for adding and removing exception handlers on demand, using proprietary metadata formats. As a result, adding exception support would require a lot of platform and language-specific effort, and may involve reverse engineering undocumented exception implementations across multiple runtime versions for a given language. While there would be benefits to adding exception support, it would also require a lot of work to develop (and maintain as the runtime support evolves over time).\nSecondly, even if we were to decompile exception-related things into a simplified, language-independent representation, the most logical method of presentation would involve extending Hex-Rays to support things like <pre><code>try</code></pre>/<pre><code>catch</code></pre>/<pre><code>finally</code></pre> blocks as scoped constructs, and producing these things in the output. Unfortunately, extending the Hex-Rays <pre><code>ctree</code></pre> IR in this fashion is impossible for third-party developers. The valid <pre><code>ctree</code></pre> expression types are held in an <pre><code>enum</code></pre> called <pre><code>ctype_t</code></pre>. We'd need to add new entries like <pre><code>cit_try</code></pre> to this <pre><code>enum</code></pre>, we'd need to extend the <pre><code>union</code></pre> in <pre><code>cinsn_t</code></pre> to support an additional <pre><code>ctry_t *</code></pre> element, and we'd need to modify all of the existing <pre><code>ctree</code></pre> code in Hex-Rays to be aware of our modifications (for example, to print the <pre><code>try</code></pre> blocks in the decompilation listing). None of these things can be done by third-party plugins, as the existing, pre-compiled code will generate INTERRs upon encountering our <pre><code>cit_try</code></pre> instructions. Adding statement types to the <pre><code>ctree</code></pre> IR can only be accomplished via source-level modifications, not via plugins.\nFinally, even though Hex-Rays technically has an option not to eliminate exception-related code, I'm not completely sure how it works. Exception-related code often manifests itself as \"function chunks\" attached to a given function, which have no incoming control flow references. As a result, that code is eliminated by the optimizer very early into the decompilation process. You'd need to find a way to preserve it.\nIt's a daunting prospect for a third-party developer; I myself abandoned the idea. It's also daunting for the first-party developers. I don't expect to see it in any major decompiler any time soon.\n",

Seems like a real pain in the ass to do from what you said so maybe I should stick to just putting comments here an there... But either way I think that a feature to hide lines or group of instructions just like the disasm does would be useful in the software.</span>",
