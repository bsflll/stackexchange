    "content": "We all know that in typical programs, there exist some references. \n\nWhen compiling, linker will translate all the memory references into concrete memory addresses during the symbol relocation step. And by doing some quick experiments (IDA-Pro 6.4), I notice that IDA-Pro can help to lift these memory addresses back into symbols. \nHowever, I found that the symbolization functionality of IDA-Pro can be mislead by some cases. So what I am interested is to calculate how many references have been recovered by IDA-Pro. I am asking that is there anyway to obtain the information of \"how many memory references are recovered by IDA-Pro?\"\nThanks @Jason a lot for his answer, but what I am trying to do is not collect all the labels. Here is an example:\n\nPlease pay attention to the symbol <pre><code>sub_80484AE</code></pre> in address <pre><code>0x804a020</code></pre>. Note that the 4 byte data <pre><code>0x08, 0x04, 0x84, 0xae</code></pre> in porocessed binary are considered as a symbol, as it is equal to the beginning address of function <pre><code>sub_80484AE</code></pre>. This is true. However, as no instruction refers to the address <pre><code>0x804A020</code></pre>, so there is no <pre><code>name</code></pre> in address <pre><code>0x804a020</code></pre>. \nWhat I want to collect is all the symbols with its corresponding address, for example, in the above case, I need to collect this \n<pre><code>0x804a018 : sub_804847b\n0x804a01dc : _strchr\n0x804a020 : sub_80484AE\n</code></pre>\nAm I clear enough? I really appreciate if anyone can give me some help! Thank you a lot!!\n----------------------------------------------- update ---------------------------------------\nAm I still not clear enough? \nLet me put it in this way. Can I obtain all the symbol information which used to be resolved by linker? Say, in the picture I updated, during compiling linker resolved three symbols, at memory address 0x804a018, 0x804a01dc, 0x804a020. IDA-Pro recovers some of these information. So I want to collect all the IDA recovered symbol information (this information could be function name, or it could be an entry of jump table, or it could be a jump destination, as I draw in the picture). \nNote that I want to recover the information in a format that each resolved symbol together with the memory address. For example in the picture, it should be:\n<pre><code>0x804a018 : sub_804847b\n0x804a01dc : _strchr\n0x804a020 : sub_80484AE\n</code></pre>\nI am thinking to traverse all the memory address of a binary, and check each the oprend of instruction (or content if it is in the data section), to see whether it is a recovered symbol or not. If so, I will store this symbol together with this instruction (or data)'s memory address.\nBut basically how to check whether a oprend in a instruction is a symbol?\n",

To do this, open the Functions window (in the menubar: View → Open subviews → Functions), right-click in the Functions window, and choose Copy all. You can now paste the list of function names into a text editor or spreadsheet.\n",
