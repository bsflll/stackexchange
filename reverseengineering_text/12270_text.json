    "content": "I am researching an embedded device which runs QNX. I can login via telnet as a user but don't have the root password (in parallel I am running oclHashCat with the hash from the shadow file but it takes a lot of time).\nI can get access via GDB and can execute commands in root context so I was thinking that <pre><code>netcat</code></pre> would be an easy way to get a root shell (<pre><code>shell</code></pre> command in GDB doesn't appear to work).\nI found netcat binaries from netbsd for armle but when I try to run it I get the error <pre><code>can't access shared library</code></pre>. Not sure what it's missing but my guess is glibc (searching for .so with hex editor shows libc.so libdl.so).\nAm I correct that it's looking for <pre><code>libc.so</code></pre> and <pre><code>libdl.so</code></pre> ? Where to find these for QNX armle?\n",
