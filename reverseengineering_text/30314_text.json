    "content": "I'm working on this problem: Challenge 53\nWhen compiling with <pre><code>cl c53.c /Fac53.asm /MD</code></pre> in VS2019 X86 Development Console and loading the <pre><code>.exe</code></pre> into OllyDbg, I found OllyDbg labels all segments of <pre><code>c53</code></pre> as <pre><code>R</code></pre>:\n\nMaybe there is some misunderstanding here, but why is the data segment not writable? Actually when I step into the program I can see the beginning of memory part of \"Hello, world!\" been overwritten by \"Goodbye!\" and there was no segfault (unlike in Linux there IS segfault and I'm still trying to figure out why, but that's a different question when checking <pre><code>c53.o</code></pre> in IDA it tells me the string \"Hello World!\" is in rodata so that segfault makes perfect sense):\n\nTo verify that the strings are indeed in data segment, not in rodata segment, I checked the assembly code:\n<pre><code>_DATA   SEGMENT\n$SG10125 DB 'Goodbye!', 00H\n    ORG $+3\n$SG10126 DB 'Result: %s', 0aH, 00H\n$SG10129 DB 'Hello, world!', 0aH, 00H\n_DATA   ENDS\n</code></pre>\n",
