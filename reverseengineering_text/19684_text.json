    "content": "Yes, it's one of these!\nI have a 199mumble Brother integrated word processor, with a very weird non-PC floppy format. I've built a floppy controller and have successfully read the flux off the disk, decoded both kinds of GCR, and reassembled the result into a disk image. But I need to be able to check the checksums in the sectors to know whether I've done it right. (Eyeballing it looks good.)\nEach sector is 256 bytes and is followed by three bytes which vary depending on the contents of the sector --- identical sectors produce identical values, so I'm assuming it's a checksum. Interestingly, the all-zero sector produces an all-zero checksum, so I suspect it's not a regular CRC.\nI have 100 different examples but there may be some incorrect results in there (due to misread sectors); the full list is at https://pastebin.com/0HZrUVPR but here are a few selected examples, in what's hopefully reveng format so the checksum is in the last three bytes:\n<pre><code>00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005750314120464c4f505059080000000000000000000000000000000000000000616161616161616120202020000000000000000000000000000002000a5d000064656d6f20202020a4ca1a\n414141414141414141410000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008b38af\n414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141de6162636465666768696a6b6c6d6e6f707172737475767778797a303132333435363738394141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141de4141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141de4141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141415a6ea1\n41414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141de4141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141de6162636465666768696a6b6c6d6e6f707172737475767778797a303132333435363738394141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141de41414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141414141413362ac\n</code></pre>\nNote that the last two contain the same data, rotated right a whole number of bytes.\nSo, I'm stumped. There are some 24 bit CRCs but they appear to be quite rare. reveng had nothing, but I'm not entirely sure I'm driving it correctly --- it appeared to execute more quickly than anything which does a brute force search ought to. I've tried some trivial summing methods but the easy ones didn't work and there are too many variations just to guess.\nHow would I go about figuring this out?\n",

Looks pretty reasonable.\nThen, I read about existing hash functions and see what method they uses. I note that CRC uses polynomial remainder mod 2, so I guess that the hash is the input as a polynomial modulo some polynomial with degree 25 (because the output has 24 bits).\nWith simple brute force, I conclude that the polynomial is <pre><code>000201</code></pre>. Testing reveals that it's correct.\n\nreveng had nothing, but I'm not entirely sure I'm driving it correctly --- it appeared to execute more quickly than anything which does a brute force search ought to.\n\nWhy reveng executes so quickly?\nIt's because there are only 2width possible polynomials. reveng only takes small time to try each polynomial. In this case width = 24, so there are only 1048576 polynomials, which is not very large for a computer.\nWhy reveng returns no output? What's the difference between this and CRC?\nCRC appends <pre><code>width</code></pre> (in this case - 24) bits to the input before computing polynomial remainder, this algorithm doesn't.\n",
