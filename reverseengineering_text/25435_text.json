    "content": "I'm currently trying to look into Q.U.B.E. 2's internal mechanics, so I decided to look at it using Ghidra. Q.U.B.E. 2 is built upon UnrealEngine, so it it's pretty big (~50 Mb's). However, when importing the file, Ghidra complains about a lot of missing DLLs. So I started downloading all of them manually and putting them into a directory which I specified in the import settings -> External Libraries, however, the missing files only get written in the \"Additional Info\" field of the import results.\nThe problem here is, that the \"Additional Info\" ends with the following message:\n<pre><code>There were too many messages to display.\n659 messages have been truncated.\n</code></pre>\nmeaning I can't take a look at all of the missing dll's.\nI can't have a good look into the code without the dependencies, as Ghidra displays <pre><code>No symbol</code></pre> warning's everywhere. My guess is that a big thing of Unreal Engine is still missing, as most of the missing symbols start with <pre><code>U</code></pre> (<pre><code>UObjectBase</code></pre>, <pre><code>UWorld</code></pre>, ...)\nCan I somehow look at the complete import log to add the missing libraries? Or is there a faster way to supply every dependency?\n",
