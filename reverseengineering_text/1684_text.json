            "content": "There is an H8 port of GNU binutils (the target is called 'h8300' I believe) which includes <pre><code>objdump</code></pre>. It seems it's even available in Debian in the package <pre><code>binutils-h8300-hms</code></pre> (might be outdated).\nAlternative GNU-based toolchains for many Renesas processors (including H8) are provided by KPIT (free but requires registration). I think they've been contributing to mainline too but not sure how's their progress there.\nJust for reference, here's how to use <pre><code>objdump</code></pre> to disassemble a raw binary:\n<pre><code>objdump -m h8300 -b binary -D myfile.bin\n</code></pre>\nRenesas offers their own commercial compiler/assembler/simulator (and I think a disassembler too) suite called High-performance Embedded Workshop (HEW) but I couldn't find out how much it costs. There is a downloadable evaluation version, however.\nFor a quick look at some hex you can also try the Online Disassembler, it has a couple of H8 variants.\n",
