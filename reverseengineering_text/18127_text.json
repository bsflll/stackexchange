    "content": "Dear members, \nI am trying to figure out the parameters of some hexadecimal CRC32 values I have.\nThe values are:\n<pre><code>Value - input (before hashing)\n55D3028A - J\n73AF2D02 - O\n6742BE71 - T\n</code></pre>\nI hope I can figure out the polynominal and initial/final XOR value so I can hash my own values.\nI'm using reveng to getting the parameters for hashing my own strings, but I didn't found a working solution.\nthe commands I've tried:\n\n./reveng.exe -w 32 -q 40000000 -s 55d3028a 73af2d02 6742be71\n./reveng.exe -w 32 -p 40000000 -q 80000000 -s 55d3028a 73af2d02 6742be71\n./reveng.exe -w 32 -p 80000000 -q c0000000 -s 55d3028a 73af2d02 6742be71\n./reveng.exe -w 32 -p c0000000 -q 0 -s 55d3028a 73af2d02 6742be71\n./reveng.exe -w 32 -l -s 55d3028a 73af2d02 6742be71\n\nIs it possible to use the input value(s) and the given crc(s) to bruteforce/calculate the parameters or does someone know a other method to achieve the same goal.\nThanks in advance,\nEvilID\n",

            "content": "I wanted to give this a try because it seemed interesting but I did not succeed.\nStill, maybe this will lead you in the right direction for further tests.\nI started reading some introduction material on CRCs:\nhttp://www.sunshine2k.de/articles/coding/crc/understanding_crc.html\nand this one where someone else was trying to reverse engineer a CRC:\nhttps://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/essays/CRC-Reverse-Engineering.html\nto get a general understanding what we're dealing with. Then I was about to write some small Z3 script but luckily stumbled upon \nhttps://github.com/DennisYurichev/yurichev.com/blob/master/blog/CRC_cracker_Z3/CRC_cracker.py\nwhich is described here: https://yurichev.com/blog/CRC_cracker_Z3/\nBasically, that is a script that uses Z3 (Microsoft's theorem prover) to calculate the CRC sum and it tries to find the polynomial, test Big and Little Endian interpretation, and an inverted input/output or not. You supply it with input data and the CRC sums they have to generate and then it tells you the parameters.\nThat script did not produce a result for me though. That either means it's not a CRC, not a 32 bit CRC, the input/output is modified beyond simple inversion, or the supplied samples are not just over the 3 letters you listed.\nI also could not find any matching publicly known set of parameters (such as CRC32C), for that I tested some parameter sets using https://pycrc.org/\nIf your actual target was recreating the checksum I'd probably go reverse engineer the code now instead of treating it as a blackbox.\n",
