    "content": "While debugging inside a loaded <pre><code>exe</code></pre> process (using <pre><code>IDA Pro</code></pre> as a disassembler, and <pre><code>WinDbg</code></pre> as a debugger) I can right click the code view and select <pre><code>Graph view</code></pre>:\n\nThat will switch it to this nice code-flow view that is much easier to read:\n\nBut if I step into a system DLL (in this case <pre><code>mshtml.dll</code></pre>) I can't seem to get that same <pre><code>Graph view</code></pre> command, and instead I get this generic view:\n\nSo I was wondering, if there's a way to enable <pre><code>Graph view</code></pre> for a system DLL as well?\n",

            "content": "IDA can only display functions in graph mode, so in order to see that code as a graph, you must:\nFind the start of the function\nSearch for a prologue, such as <pre><code>push ebp</code></pre>, <pre><code>mov ebp, esp</code></pre>1, and find the start of the function. If it gets hard, you can always load debug symbols2 and find the start like that.\n1: Actually, most Microsoft DLLs are compiled with the hotpatch option, which means that the prologue is prefixed with <pre><code>mov edi, edi</code></pre> (here's why), so searching for that instruction should be very easy.\n2: In the WinDbg command line, write <pre><code>.symfix</code></pre> to fix the symbols path and <pre><code>.reload /f mshtml.dll</code></pre> to reload the symbols for that module. Alternatively, go to <pre><code>Debugger</code></pre> -> <pre><code>Debugger windows</code></pre> -> <pre><code>Modules list</code></pre>, find <pre><code>mshtml.dll</code></pre> in the window, right-click it and choose \"Load debug symbols\". Then, simply use the <pre><code>Functions</code></pre> window or the status bar to find the start of the function.\nMake it a function\nPut the cursor at the start, and press P. Now press Space and you'll be in graph mode!\n",

What I didn't realize is that it takes <code>Ida Pro</code> some time before \"Graph view\" option becomes available, i.e. it evidently needs to scan the module after symbols are loaded. After that it will work just fine!</span>",
