    "content": "I need to rename some memory address \"names\" in IDAPython. I'm talking about the dword_805672 formatted ones. Please see the screenshot below:\n\nI've placed red boxes around the names which I would like to rename with IDAPython. I've searched the API docs and I came up with: <pre><code>idc.MakeName(ea,name)</code></pre> however, as you can see, this only placed a name in the spots labeled <pre><code>dynamic_1</code></pre>, <pre><code>dynamic_2</code></pre> and so on. I want to rename the actual operand.\n",

I'm assuming that you did something like <pre><code>idc.MakeName(0x123772cd, 'dynamic_3')</code></pre> instead of doing the make name on the actual dword in the instruction.\nSomething like this should be done instead:\n<pre><code>idc.MakeName(idc.GetOperandValue(0x123772cd, 0), 'dynamic_3')</code></pre>\nIn this case <pre><code>idc.GetOperandValue</code></pre> will return the value of the zeroth operand (ie. 0x123ef5e0). That address will then be labeled 'dynamic_3' and IDA should update the UI to show the change.\n",

Do you have any tips on how to learn the little fine ins and outs of the API like this? This is the kinda stuff that's not really in the docs :(</span>",
