As in, the process is recreated in the exact same state as if \"loading a saved game\".\nContext is that of a game that crashes either while attempting to save/load a game or certain conditions are met (e.g. unit count > 5000). There are no debug logs.\n",

Your processor needs to support it.\n\nWinDbgX (the one from the MS store) has support for that (i.e. <pre><code>winget install -e --id Microsoft.WinDbg</code></pre>).\nGDB also has support for it.\nrr is even dedicated to the whole concept.\nVMware used to include the feature called \"replay debugging\" for a few major versions; unfortunately it got scrapped.\n\nHowever, it's not possible to take a mere memory dump and \"revive\" a process based on that. The record & replay method involves a whole lot more than just the memory state. Also, memory dumps often are only an excerpt of the full memory space of a process.\n",

Intuitively, it's not clear as to why a process can't be revived from a point during its run. Of course there are corner cases such as random algorithms that are seeded with input that's not covered by the \"recorder\" but other than that, no?</span>",

But consider memory layout alone, ASLR, randomly created base addresses for DLLs on Windows (and that's just the usermode view of the memory). On Windows, all \"Windows subsystem\" processes are registered with the subsystem at startup. Intel PT (the mentioned underlying CPU feature) probably doesn't need <i>everything</i>. But it needs a meaningful subset and the help of the OS/debugger to facilitate collection. Intel PT <i>does</i> allow that sort of revival. What I wrote was that a <i>memory dump</i> alone isn't sufficient. You need something like Intel PT.</span>",
