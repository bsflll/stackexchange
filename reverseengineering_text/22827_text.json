But each decompiler seems, in one way or another, have inconsistency in the type system of its decompiled language (I think they all try to decompile to <pre><code>C</code></pre> or pseudo-<pre><code>C</code></pre>).\n<pre><code>IDA v.7.4.191122</code></pre> (evaluation version) gives:\n<pre><code>int __cdecl main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)\n{\n  return foo(apply, 7LL, envp);\n}\n\n__int64 __fastcall foo(int (__fastcall *a1)(__int64 (__fastcall *)(), _QWORD), unsigned int a2)\n{\n  return (unsigned int)((int)a2 / a1(bar, a2));\n}\n</code></pre>\nI don't show results of <pre><code>bar</code></pre> and <pre><code>apply</code></pre> because there was already an inconsistency here: IDA detects that <pre><code>foo</code></pre> is called with 3 arguments in <pre><code>main</code></pre>, but then it concludes that <pre><code>foo</code></pre> has actually 2 parameters.\nNext, <pre><code>Ghidra v9.1.build.2019-oct-23</code></pre>:\n<pre><code>void main(void)\n{\n  foo(apply,7);\n  return;\n}\n\nulong foo(code *param_1,uint param_2,undefined8 param_3)\n{\n  int iVar1;\n\n  iVar1 = (*param_1)(bar,(ulong)param_2,param_3,param_1);\n  return (long)(int)param_2 / (long)iVar1 & 0xffffffff;\n}\n</code></pre>\nwhich has an opposite opinion: <pre><code>foo</code></pre> is called in <pre><code>main</code></pre> with 2 arguments, but in its definition <pre><code>foo</code></pre> has 3 parameters.\n<pre><code>JEB v.3.8.0.201912242244</code></pre> (evaluation version):\n<pre><code>unsigned long main() {\n  return foo(&apply, 7L);\n}\n\nunsigned long foo(unsigned long param0) {\n  unsigned int v0 = v1;\n  param0();\n  return (unsigned long)(v0 / ((unsigned int)v2));\n}\n</code></pre>\nwhich gives a perfect result for <pre><code>main</code></pre>, but it then claims that <pre><code>foo</code></pre> is a function of just 1 parameters (and while it shows <pre><code>param0()</code></pre>, it keeps <pre><code>param0</code></pre> as <pre><code>unsigned long</code></pre>).\nActually, the decompilation results are not correct (which is somehow understandable), but they are even inconsistent. Do I miss some configuration?\n",
