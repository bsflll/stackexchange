            "content": "r2pipe\nThe best programming interface to radare2 called r2pipe.\nTo quote from the project's Github page:\n\nThe r2pipe APIs are based on a single r2 primitive found behind\n  <pre><code>r_core_cmd_str()</code></pre> which is a function that accepts a string parameter\n  describing the r2 command to run and returns a string with the result.\n\nr2pipe supports many programming languages including Python, NodeJS, Rust, C and others.\n\nWriting the program\nTo use r2pipe you should first make sure you have radare2 installed. It is always recommended to use the latest version from git.\nInstall or update radare2 with the following steps:\n<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/radare/radare2.git # clone radare2 if you didn't do it yet for some reason.\n$ cd radare2\n$ ./sys/install.sh\n</code></pre>\nNow after radare2 is installed and updated let's move to write the C program to list all the functions of the binary. As you've mentioned in your question, it should be the equivalent for opening the binary with radare2, executing <pre><code>aaa</code></pre> to analyze the binary (which is actually <pre><code>r2 -A binary_name</code></pre>) and then execute <pre><code>afl</code></pre> to list all the functions.\nFirst we should define a function that accepts r2 instance and command. This function will execute the command, print the results and free the resulting string.\n<pre><code>#include <r_socket.h>                           \n\nstatic void r2cmd(R2Pipe *r2, const char *cmd) {\n        char *msg = r2p_cmd (r2, cmd);          \n        if (msg) {                              \n                printf (\"%s\n\", msg);           \n                free (msg);                     \n        }                                       \n}  \n</code></pre>\nAfter that, writing the <pre><code>main()</code></pre> function should be intuitive:\n<pre><code>int main() {                                           \n        R2Pipe *r2 = r2p_open (\"r2 -q0 /bin/echo\");\n        if (r2) {                                  \n                r2cmd (r2, \"aaa\");                 \n                r2cmd (r2, \"afl\");                 \n                r2p_close (r2);                    \n                return 0;                          \n        }                                          \n        return 1;                                  \n}   \n</code></pre>\nWe define an instance of r2 with the program we want to examine, and then use the function we just created to execute commands through radare2's interface. First we analyze the program using <pre><code>aaa</code></pre> and then we print the functions using <pre><code>afl</code></pre>.\n\nCompiling\nTo compile the program using <pre><code>gcc</code></pre> we should execute the following command:\n<pre><code>gcc list_functions.c -o list_functions $(pkg-config --cflags r_socket --libs r_socket)\n</code></pre>\n\nReferences\n\nr2pipe project page\nr2pipe C bindings\n",
