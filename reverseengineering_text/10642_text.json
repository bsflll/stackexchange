            "content": "This is an extremely loaded question and has just as much to do with forensics as it does with reverse engineering. If you're working in a role as a network security analyst and have been tasked with determining whether a binary is malicious, it can be assumed that one of your chief priorities is to identify host-based or network-based signatures. These will be used to help your security admin colleagues detect and eliminate the threat throughout your network. However, unless you're working with a virus from the early 90s, you're not going to find an obvious message like, \"WARNING: THIS PROGRAM WILL DESTROY YOUR MACHINE!\" in the program's strings.\nAnti-RE/debugging/VM and encoding/obfuscation techniques (which are common in modern malware and can extend the time of your analysis considerably) aside, smart malware behaves similarly to legitimate programs and use standard OS APIs to do its work. To reiterate the comment from the user above, you must set a standard on what is considered to be malicious activity.\nWith all that said, backdoors, keystroke loggers, downloaders, etc. all have unique behavioral indicators. For example, if you run <pre><code>strings</code></pre> on the binary in question and can see a routable IP address, and that IP does not trace back to a legitimate organization, that is a good indication this binary is a reverse shell, and the IP can be used as a network-based signature. This is something that can be done in 2 minutes, but this alone is, by no means, thorough or sufficient.\nFor more information on malware analysis techniques, I strongly recommend Practical Malware Analysis by Sikorski and Honig.\n",
