To see which APIs your exe is usually using you can use ApiLogger (https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/SysAnalyzer/ApiLogger)\n\n\nDon't forget to set the Breakpoints Before Call\n\nIn my example I set a filter on VirtualAlloc from Kernel32.dll\n\nOpen your sample you want to have a look at:\n\n\nIf you are seeing no results you may have to play with \"Attach Using\" which is by default set to \"Static Import\"\n\nRun your sample and if everything works well you'll hit your breakpoint and you can stat to edit (and dump) the corresponding memory:\n",

It will record (in great detail) all activity performed by your application. \n\nProcess Monitor is a free tool from Microsoft that displays file\n  system, registry, process, and other activities on the system. Itâ€™s an\n  invaluable tool for troubleshooting Windows problems as well as for\n  malware forensics and analysis tasks. The thoroughness of the tool is\n  also weakness, as the amount of data captured by Process Monitor can\n  easily overwhelm the analyst.\n\nFortunately, you can filter the output of Process Monitor, and some have even created filter-sets that you can download and load into Process Monitor, saving you the time of creating them yourself.\n",
