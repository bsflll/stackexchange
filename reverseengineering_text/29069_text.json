    "content": "I have following intel processor <pre><code>4th Generation Core Processor (Haswell U/Y)</code></pre>.\nI want to check the value of <pre><code>PMBASE</code></pre> register in the processor. For that I have downloaded the processor datasheet, where I found that <pre><code>PMBASE</code></pre> is present at B:D:F <pre><code>0:1:0</code></pre>. Here is the screenshot\n\nThe VID and DID of the device are mentioned below (from the same datasheet)\n\nBut, now when I am doing <pre><code>lspci</code></pre> from my linux machine, I am not seeing device <pre><code>0:1:0</code></pre>. I have even checked with chipsec tool. Even there I am not seeing any device with device id <pre><code>0x0c01</code></pre>. \nAny reason why such discrepancy is there?\n",
