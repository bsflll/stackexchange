    "content": "Is there any option to set new icon for a signed PE executable in windows without re-signing it again. This means that the icon image, although fully assimilated to the PE file, won't change the hash value as it's appears in the file signature part.\nperhaps there's a concept where one can sign only the specific sections in the files such as <pre><code>.text</code></pre> or <pre><code>.data</code></pre> and avoid other parts of the file ? \nthanks\n",

The icon is part of the resource section (<pre><code>.rsrc</code></pre>) which is covered by the signature so any modification will invalidate it and the binary needs to be re-signed. \nThere may be some parts of the executable you can change without invalidating the signature, but the resource section is not one of them.\n",

However, it seems like explorer still cannot find the icon, perhaps its because the file length has exceeded some value inside the pe structure ? are there any more fields I need to set ?</span>",
