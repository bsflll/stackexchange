    "content": "Disassembling is great but when trying to re-assemble to opcode it gives different results each time. Example:  \n<pre><code>C:\\>rasm2 -a x86 -b 64 -d \"48898D80FEFFFF\"  \nmov qword [rbp - 0x180], rcx  \nC:\\>rasm2 -a x86 -b 64 \"mov qword [rbp - 0x180], rcx\"  \n49898d80feffff  \n</code></pre>\nSee the difference? The first byte has been changed and it keep the same behavior each time. Another issue is, I couldn't get it to assemble this instruction with 8 bytes it only gives me 4 bytes:\n<pre><code>C:\\>rasm2 -a x86 -b 64 -d \"C7458C0000803F\"  \nmov dword [rbp - 0x74], 0x3f800000  \nC:\\>rasm2 -a x86 -b 64 \"mov dword [rbp - 0x74], 0x3f800000\"  \n41c67400\n</code></pre>\nBut when I remove the the bits flag and set the registers to 32 bit it gives me the correct opcodes!\n<pre><code>C:\\>rasm2 -a x86 \"mov dword [ebp - 0x74], 0x3f800000\"  \nc7458c0000803f\n</code></pre>\nWhy is it doing this and what did I do wrong?\nGitHub issue link for future reference.\n",
