    "content": "I've a X64 DLL file which uses C++ standard library heavily. I've loaded the PDB symbol file in IDA and all the subroutines names <pre><code>sub_xxyz</code></pre> changes to <pre><code>std::xyz</code></pre>, which is as expected. But there are many subroutines, for example one name is like <pre><code>std::basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char>>::basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char>>(void *Dst, _BYTE *a2, __int64 a3)</code></pre>. Too long, isn't it ;)\nUnder the hood, all these subroutines mainly do some memory manipulation with <pre><code>malloc()</code></pre>, <pre><code>memcpy()</code></pre>, <pre><code>memmove()</code></pre> etc. Hence my question, Can I simplify those subroutines in IDA by any means?\n",

            "content": "Although this function name is indeed quite long, there's no easy way to simplify it nor is it too difficult to understand once you gain decent C++ development experience, using std especially. The TLDR answer is that this is a constructor for a <pre><code>std::string</code></pre> object (specifically this looks like the substring(3) constructor, but I'm not 100% sure).\nIf you visit the <pre><code>std::string</code></pre> reference page, you'll see this is the definition for <pre><code>std::string</code></pre>:\n<pre><code>typedef std::basic_string<char> string; \n</code></pre>\nThe <pre><code>std::string</code></pre> class is being defined using the <pre><code>std::basic_string</code></pre> class template, which has three template parameters:\n\nthe character type used for the string object.\nan object to control some string traits.\nThe allocator used to actually allocate the string buffers for the class.\n\nIn the <pre><code>std::string</code></pre> case, however, only the first template parameter is provided - the other two are the default ones defined based on the first template parameter (char), and although they can be replaced with different or more complex traits or allocators, this isn't the case for the <pre><code>std::string</code></pre> class. \nAlthough the typedef string is pretty simple and straightforward thanks to the default templates parameters being unspecified, when the object is built and actually defined by the compiler the full definition is used, which adds a lot of boilerplate definitions.\nIf we split it up to it's parts, we'll see <pre><code>std::basic_string</code></pre> is being used and three template parameters are specified. As mentioned for the <pre><code>std::string</code></pre>, the second (<pre><code>std::char_traits<char></code></pre>) and third (<pre><code>std::allocator<char></code></pre>) are derived by the first and are both templates by themselves, receiving the same template parameter <pre><code>std::basic_string</code></pre> got (<pre><code>char</code></pre>).\nAfter the class definition, the two colons indicate a definition of an object under the class namespace:\n<pre><code>::basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char>>(void *Dst, _BYTE *a2, __int64 a3)\n</code></pre>\nWe can easily see this is a function that has the same name as the class itself, which is the known way to define a constructor. \nLastly, as with every function we have the parameters this function accepts inside the parentheses:\n<pre><code>void *Dst, _BYTE *a2, __int64 a3\n</code></pre>\nTo simplify the full definition back to <pre><code>std::basic_string<char></code></pre>, one would need to hold the default template parameters for all std template classes, and strip the ones that are recognized as the default ones. Although this is not a very difficult task, it seems a little redundant to me. You are obviously encouraged to either develop such a plugin yourself or suggest the feature improvement to the IDA development team.\n",

There are slight variations between compilers (which IDA already support, obviously) but basically I think it is structured enough for you to not need a actual C++ parsing, at least on the plugin's side. I believe you could also scrape some DBs or websites to get the default values without doing any c++ parsing either. YMMV and I didn't go into details because I don't thing anybody should be wasting their time on that, tbh.</span>",

Because that's where the short names come from (<code>std::string</code>, <code>std::wstring</code> etc) and where the defaults will be known (provided you can parse C++). With libclang it's really a lot easier than it used to be (e.g. trying to parse the XML AST output from GCC).</span>",
