    "content": "I am sorry if this is really a silly question. I am trying to learn reverse engineering. What I can't understand is those 'var_8', 'var_12'. Are they just variables? What are the use of them in the following code? If someone give me an overview of what this piece of code actually does then it will boost up my learning process. I know the first four instructions which are really just setting up the stack frame for the function and I know all the registers used in here. I need to know what this function actually doing so that I can judge if I am figuring it out right or wrong.  \n<pre><code>00611e63 8BFF                            mov        edi, edi                ; XREF=0x611721\n00611e65 55                              push       ebp\n00611e66 8BEC                            mov        ebp, esp\n00611e68 83EC10                          sub        esp, 0x10\n00611e6b A174897000                      mov        eax, dword [ds:0x708974]\n00611e70 8365F800                        and        dword [ss:ebp-0x10+var_8], 0x0\n00611e74 8365FC00                        and        dword [ss:ebp-0x10+var_12], 0x0\n00611e78 53                              push       ebx\n00611e79 57                              push       edi\n00611e7a BF4EE640BB                      mov        edi, 0xbb40e64e\n00611e7f BB0000FFFF                      mov        ebx, 0xffff0000\n00611e84 3BC7                            cmp        eax, edi\n00611e86 740D                            je         0x611e95\n</code></pre>\n",

It is a hot-patch point often used in Windows DLL. This page could give you insight about how it works.\n",
