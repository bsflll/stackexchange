    "content": "I have created simple code to test using lldb . This is the first time i am using lldb and i am familiar with gdb. while i am trying to disassemble the unix executable file its not working any commands i should use . Or i should try other , if so can you provide me a list of disassembler,decompiler and debugger for unix and windows 64bit processors which supports scripting too. I have searched for them but could't find. can you suggest me list of good disassemblers.\n",

Here are some disassemble commands for use within LLDB:\n<pre><code>disassemble --frame</code></pre>: Disassemble the currently running function.\n<pre><code>disassemble -a 0x1234</code></pre>: Disassemble the function containing the address <pre><code>0x1234</code></pre>\n<pre><code>disassemble -n _foo</code></pre>: Disassemble the function called \"<pre><code>_foo</code></pre>\"\nTry <pre><code>help disassemble</code></pre> to learn more.\nAs for a list of good disassemblers on various platforms, it depends whether you have a lot of disposable income or not. IDA Pro is the best but it costs around $1000. If that's prohibitive, Google can help you find lists of free and cheap tools.\n",
