    "content": "I am protecting an exe that being loaded by Assembly.Load... This makes everything difficult because most obfuscators causing it to not work properly or not load at all. I used confuserEx Ameteurz modded its working with max settings but I don't like protection too easy to unpack. Right now I am using .net reactor 6.5 its good but messagebox annoying and I can't trust completely I think someone can deobfuscate it. What do you suggest?\n",
