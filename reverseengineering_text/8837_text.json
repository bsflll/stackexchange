    "content": "I would like to make IDA disassemble the <pre><code>.plt</code></pre> section of ELF files correctly, e.g. as objdump does: \n<pre><code>objdump -D -M intel asdf | grep \"Disassembly of section .plt\" -A80\n</code></pre>\n\nI don't know why but IDA gives me this (Note the <pre><code>dw ?</code></pre> and <pre><code>dq ?</code></pre>):\n\nEven the IDA hexeditor does not show me the correct values at the corresponding addresses, but gives me <pre><code>??</code></pre>s.\nI tried selecting and deselecting the settings described in the IDA Online help (search for \"PLT\") but this didn't help...\n\n0: Replace PIC form of 'Procedure Linkage Table' to non PIC form\n1: Direct jumping from PLT (without GOT) regardless of its form\n2: Convert PIC form of loading <pre><code>_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_[]</code></pre> of address\n3: Obliterate auxiliary bytes in PLT & GOT for 'final autoanalysis'\n4: Natural form of PIC GOT address loading in relocatable file\n5: Unpatched form of PIC GOT references in relocatable file\n\nHow can I configure IDA so that I can access the instructions in the <pre><code>.plt</code></pre> section of an ELF file with IDAPython?\n",
