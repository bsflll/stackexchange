    "content": "I have the following assembly line and I have my problems to understand it, because until now I have always seen lines like this: <pre><code>mov eax, 0</code></pre> and so on. \nBut now, I have the following (I use IDA PRO):\n<pre><code> mov ds:dword_4870058 , offset loc_4048E0\n</code></pre>\nWhen I click on offset <pre><code>loc_4048E0</code></pre>, I see: \n<pre><code> loc_4048E0:\n mov al, 10h\n jmp sub_402774\n</code></pre>\nwhen I interpret <pre><code>dword_4870058</code></pre> as a global variable, can I assume that <pre><code>dword_4870058</code></pre> gets the value <pre><code>10h</code></pre> (if I regard <pre><code>al</code></pre> as a return value register) . This is the only thing that I can imagine. \nIs it a right or wrong assumption ?\n",

They're all the same ... just numbers.\nLittle thing to pay in mind, in x86 you cant do memory to memory moves. So, the \"can I assume that <pre><code>dword_4870058</code></pre> gets the value <pre><code>10h</code></pre>\" is completely wrong, the function at that address has NOT been called has it ? So, it cant get the value <pre><code>10h</code></pre>...\nIts simply storing one value (the address of a function) into another memory block.\n",
