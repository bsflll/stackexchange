            "content": "OllyDbg is interpreting numbers as hex by default. But <pre><code>0x55000</code></pre> is larger than <pre><code>0xFFFF</code></pre> so it cannot be stored in a 16bit register, which <pre><code>ax</code></pre> is, hence it complains.\nIf you meant the decimal number 55000, I think you can enter it as \"55000.\" with the trailing dot. If that doesn't work enter the number as hex:\n<pre><code>mov ax, 0D6D8\n</code></pre>\nThe leading 0 is necessary otherwise the first character would be a letter and OllyDbg would not recognize it as a number.\n",
