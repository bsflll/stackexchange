    "content": "I am trying to run IDA without GUI. My purpose is to run a specific script that receives arguments via my main program against multiple files, but for some reason, it does not work for me. Sometimes it opens IDA without any reason.\nI am using the following commands:\nOne command is: <pre><code>'C:\\\\IDA\\\\ida.exe -B %s' % file</code></pre>\nSecond command is: <pre><code>cmd = 'C:\\\\IDA\\\\ida.exe -a- -A -S\"script.py \"%s\"\" %s' % (file, file)</code></pre>\n",

            "text": "How is IDA supposed to distinguish the script name from the parameter? You're using the exact same type of quotes (<pre><code>\"</code></pre>) to denote two different things. You're attempting to quote the overall script+parameters, but you seem to also be quoting the parameter(s) with the same type of quotes. Not sure how you execute this (i.e. which Python module), but <pre><code>cmd.exe</code></pre> is likely going to have an issue telling these apart ... not to mention that file names with blank spaces will garble up the whole thing anyway.\n",
