    "content": "So I am learning about ELF, and am looking through a binary in Ghidra as I do. I've made sense of the ELF header, and now I am looking through the program header table.\nMy binary has a bunch of entries in the program header table, but I am hung up on one in particular...\nFrom referencing...\nhttp://www.sco.com/developers/gabi/latest/ch5.pheader.html#p_flags\n...I can see what the different flags mean. Of relevance:\n<pre><code>p_offset = 0xABCDEF\np_vaddr = 0x1BCDEF\np_filesz = <number>\np_memsz = <bigger number>\n</code></pre>\nI am able to go to the p_vaddr value in the binary, and it brings me to the <pre><code>.ctors</code></pre> section. Where I do see what appears to be a list of pointers, but currently those pointers do not represent valid virtual addresses (by currently I mean they are not virtual addresses that I can \"go\" to in Ghidra). When I run the program dynamically in gdb though, I can run <pre><code>x addr_of_interest</code></pre> and it succeeds and says it is pointing to something in a library blah blah.\nI found a relevant link from GCC too, but it did not answer my question as far as I could tell...\nhttps://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Initialization.html\nMy question therefore is this: When/how are these pointers mapped to valid memory, and where in the ELF file is the information that would tell me how this happens?\n",

I had Ghidra's image base set to 0x0, rather than 0x400000 (which is the p_vaddr of the loadable segment containing all of the code, and notably, the canonical value used here for x86_64 binaries). This is the only reason the function pointers listed in <pre><code>.ctors</code></pre> were not addresses Ghidra could go to. As soon as I set the image base to 0x400000 they were legitimate. \n:facepalm:\n",
