    "content": "Say, I have a command in radare which produces multiple input, say <pre><code>afl</code></pre>. I can run it and extract many addresses:\n<pre><code>[0x5579ca2e2196]> afl~[0]\n0x5579ca2e2060\n0x5579ca2e4fe0\n0x5579ca2e2090\n0x5579ca2e20c0\n0x5579ca2e2100\n</code></pre>\nHow do I do run another command on each of those addresses? Let's say I want to print first byte of each of them or set a breakpoint with <pre><code>db</code></pre> on each address.\nI read about iteration, but it looks like it only works on flags with something like <pre><code>sym.*</code></pre>, but not on arbitrary outputs, so I can't do this:\n<pre><code>p8 1 @@ `some command which produces many addresses`\n</code></pre>\nI know that I can save output to a file and then use something like <pre><code>p8 1 @@.my_file</code></pre>, but it looks strange that I need to create a file for that.\nBasically, I want a way to run a single radare command (possibly with parameters) for every line of output of another radare command.\n",
