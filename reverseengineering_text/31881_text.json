    "content": "I have the firmware in which mod operation must be done. I want to find this part of instructions.\nAssume the following logic exist in the firmware:\n<pre><code>res = var % 17\n</code></pre>\nI have tried to make search by <pre><code>% 0x11</code></pre> using IDA pseudocode and python but it does not find anything. Also I have tried to use gcc to dissemble this mod operation written in C but without any success.\nArchitecture: armv7-m\nCPU: cortex-m4\n",
