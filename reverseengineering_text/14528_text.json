    "content": "I have a binary that is utilizing OutputDebugString as an anti-debugging technique. I want to find the calls and patch up the jump table or something similar. Normally I can find an API call by using the \"Names\" window. Also I have tried searching for all intermodular calls. The OutputDebugString API is found in neither, but I know it is being called. How do I find the calls to this API and set a BP on them?\nNote: This software is packed and protected using Armadillo, which uses some API redirections, so maybe it is using LoadLib/GetProcAddr to call the API by offset instead of by name?\n",

With x64dbg you can name this module and correctly restore your breakpoints in it. Try finding it by placing a breakpoint on the api itself and then look in the callstack. Also, x64dbg is not susceptible to this anti debug trick so that might help you too...\n",

If I <pre><code>Alt+F9</code></pre> to run until user code, then I land before a call made to an address loaded in the DS. I guess at some point it uses <pre><code>GetProcAddr</code></pre> and saves it there? Still, in the comment section, Olly detects it as a call to <pre><code>OutputDebugStringA</code></pre>. Is the reason it is not being found with <pre><code>Ctrl+N</code></pre> because its generated at runtime? That would mean all calls made by discovery via <pre><code>GetProcAddr</code></pre> are not listed in the names list?\n",
