    "content": "I'm working on reverse engineering a firmware which I was able to get its functions control flow graphs to display successfully on Ghidra. I am trying to see if there is a way to save those control flow graphs as a text file or something parse able so that I can write a parser for it and use it in my program (I want to recreate the graph programmatically to train my program to detect certain functions). Thank you!\n",

You can find this file in <pre><code>ghidhra/support</code></pre> directory.\nThe ghidra api is available here. You can use this api to write custom scripts, either in java or python 2.7.\nThen you can do:\n<pre><code>./analyzeHeadless /projectloacation projectname -import /binary_location -postscript /yourscript-location -deleteproject\n</code></pre>\nTo run your analysis. This command runs your script on binary by creating a new project and then deleting it later (<pre><code>-deleteproject</code></pre> flag, which is optional).\nYou can find a lot of examples in their github repository. e.g. script.\nAs you said in your question, if you want to work with functions, you can:\n<pre><code>functions = currentProgram.getFunctionManager().getFunctions(True)\n</code></pre>\nget the list of functions (in python, changed the syntax if you are using java).\n",
