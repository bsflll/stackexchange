    "content": "Much reverse engineering has been done on Windows over the years leading to great undocumented functionality, such as using <pre><code>NtCreateThreadEx</code></pre> to inject threads across sessions.  \nOn OSX the topic of thread injection seems relatively uncharted.  With the operating system being so incredibly large, where can I begin looking in order to uncover the functionality I desire?\nFor example, if someone were to ask me this about Windows, I would expect an answer telling me to begin reverse engineering <pre><code>CreateRemoteThread</code></pre> or to start looking at how the kernel creates user threads and point them into <pre><code>ntoskrnl.exe</code></pre>.\n",

            "content": "Admittedly, I don't know much about OSX, or even Linux.  But I would suggest looking at the GDB source code.  GDB somehow is able to attach to running processes in order to debug them.  I would imagine this would, at least, provide similar functionality that you're looking for and prove a decent place to start.\nIf you're looking for a system call, it appears that <pre><code>ptrace</code></pre> is how GDB might do it.  Also, here's a nice overview of how debuggers work.\nUpdate: \nActually it seems that Uninformed wrote an article that covers this topic somewhat.  In the article they discuss:\n\nA lot of people seem to move to Mac OS X from a Linux or BSD\n  background and therefore expect the ptrace() syscall to be useful.\n  However, unfortunately, this isn't the case on Mac OSX. For some\n  ungodly reason, Apple decided to leave ptrace() incomplete and unable\n  to do much more than take a feeble attempt at an anti-debug mechanism\n  or single step the process.\n\nAlso from that article, it looks like <pre><code>thread_create_running</code></pre> might be the function you're looking for.  Link to the man page.\n",
