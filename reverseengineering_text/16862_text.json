    "content": "I'm switching over to Radare2 from GDB mixed with peda. One of the things I love about GDB, is the <pre><code>p</code></pre> command. For example, <pre><code>p system</code></pre> prints out the address of system. As well, peda's <pre><code>searchmem</code></pre> function is wonderful for uses such as <pre><code>searchmem SHELL</code></pre>. In Radare2, I have no idea how to achieve this. I've been Google'ing to the high heavens to no avail. Does anyone know if Radare2 has this ability?\n",

            "content": "To print the address of <pre><code>system</code></pre> export of <pre><code>libc</code></pre> with radare2 you can use <pre><code>dmi libc system</code></pre>\nFirst you need to open radare2 and continue executing until you reach the program’s entrypoint. You have to do this because radare2 is starting its debugging before <pre><code>libc</code></pre> is loaded. When you’ll reach the entrypoint, the library would probably be loaded.\nNow use the <pre><code>dmi</code></pre> command and pass it libc and the desired function. \n<pre><code>$ r2 -d binary_name\n\n[0xf771ab30]> dcu entry0\nContinue until 0x080483d0 using 1 bpsize\nhit breakpoint at: 80483d0\n\n[0x080483d0]> dmi libc system\n</code></pre>\nWorth to mention here, that after the analysis (see <pre><code>a?</code></pre>) radare2 associates names to interesting offsets in the file such as Sections, Function, Symbols, Strings, etc. Those names are called ‘flags’. You can print the flags and their addresses with <pre><code>f</code></pre>. For more help see <pre><code>f?</code></pre> and read the \"flags\" chapter in radare2 book. \nTo know how to print different addresses and flags in different ways I'd recommend trying the <pre><code>p?</code></pre> command and reading the \"Printing\" chapter.\n\nSearching in radare2, including in memory, can be done with the <pre><code>/</code></pre> command. You can get more help about the available search commands by using <pre><code>/?</code></pre>. I highly recommend reading the \"Search\" chapter in radare2 book. See my answer here for example.\n\nReferences\n\nradare2 book \nExploitation using radare2\n",
