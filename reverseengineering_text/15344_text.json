    "content": "In a program I am debugging, the canary value is read to <pre><code>eax</code></pre> from <pre><code>gs:0x14</code></pre> memory location. I am attaching gdb to the process late enough to break on the <pre><code>mov</code></pre> reading the canary to <pre><code>eax</code></pre>. Therefore, reading <pre><code>eax</code></pre> is not an option to me. How can I read (<pre><code>x/w</code></pre>) the canary location (<pre><code>gs:0x14</code></pre>) in gdb?\n",
