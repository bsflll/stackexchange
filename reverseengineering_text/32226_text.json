    "content": "I am attempting to reverse-engineer an old DOS executable, which seems to have been compiled around 1992 using Microsoft's C compiler at the time.\nWhen opening the executable in Ghidra no imports are listed, so I assume that any library functions that were utilised have been statically linked. Certain strings exist such as <pre><code>%s%s</code></pre>, so I can assume that <pre><code>printf</code></pre> has been utilised, for example.\nHowever, when looking through the code, nothing stands out as obviously being library code. Is there a way to identify library functions just from looking at the assembly/decompiled output?\nThanks,\nJames\n",

You can use existing signature sets, for instance github.com/Maktm/FLIRTDB (or make and apply your own signatures if needed).\nIf you need a tutorial on Ghidra setup here's a decent one.\n",
