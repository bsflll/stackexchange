    "content": "I am reverse engineering a program using IDA Pro Free 5. In one of the functions, the compiler has reused the stack space of one of the passed in arguments as a local variable of a different type, but the same size.\nIs there a way to rename a stack variable part of the way through a function? At the moment, I'm using a manual operand, but its not optimal.\n",
