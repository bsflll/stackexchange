    "content": "Let's say I have an IC (integrated circuit) and I want to hide it's function. What would be best practice to do that? \n\nRemoving the markings with sandpaper or acid?\n(E.g. atmega328, ATtiny85,... ) How to avoid that anyone could find out what program sketch is running on it?\nConnecting a few useless other ICs without function to it? \n\nImagine now you found one of these black bugs (IC) without markings and without other components. What could you do to get the program sketch running on it?\n",
