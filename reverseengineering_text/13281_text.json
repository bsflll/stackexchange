    "content": "I have recently installed Immunity Debugger in order to do some dynamic analysis on some Malware however am getting the same 2 errors no matter what i try.\n\nThe first error is that Immunity is 'Unable to set a breakpoint' this is set to the default WinMain function. \nThe second is that Immunity is 'Unable to write back modified registers'. \n\nI originally suspected that there may have been some Anti-Debug tactics involved however have come to realise that is not the case after implementing some plugins that circumvent that type of protection. \nScratching my head here as i cant seem to find anyone with the same issue as me. \nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n",
