            "content": "Lets go over the instruction piece by piece:\nmov\n<pre><code>mov</code></pre><pre><code>qword ptr ds:[rax+18],r8</code></pre>\nThis is the opcode part of the instruction. It describes the base operation the CPU is required to perform. <pre><code>mov</code></pre> is an opcode instructing a CPU to copy data from the second operand to the first operand. The first operand on the <pre><code>mov</code></pre> instruction is a target operand, and the second is the source.\nqword ptr\n<pre><code>mov</code></pre><pre><code>qword ptr</code></pre><pre><code>ds:[rax+18],r8</code></pre>\nThis second operand is the most complex part of this instruction, so I've split it to several pieces and I'll go over each individually.\nThis part is the first part of the first operand. Operands are objects such as addresses or registers on which operations are performed. <pre><code>qword</code></pre> indicates this operand describes an address of quad-word size, in Intel's x86 family of processors this means 8 bytes (a word is 2 bytes long). <pre><code>ptr</code></pre> indicates the value of the operand should be treated as an address.\nIn our case, this means assigning the value in the second operand to the 8 bytes starting at the address pointed to by the remaining of the first operand (<pre><code>ds:[rax+18]</code></pre>).\nds:\n<pre><code>mov qword ptr</code></pre><pre><code>ds:</code></pre><pre><code>[rax+18],r8</code></pre>\nThe colon is optional, and if present it follows the segment register to use when accessing data addresses. This is called memory segmentation. Segment registers were first created to allow accessing memory addresses wider than the size of registers in 16bit processors and became redundant in 32 and 64-bit processors outside of real-mode, which is the mode most CPUs start at before they're switched to protected-mode (32bit) or long-mode (64bit).\nExcept for specific-meaning special segment registers (such as <pre><code>fs</code></pre> in 32bit windows, and <pre><code>gs</code></pre> in Linux and 64-bit windows), this can be widely ignored if not operating in 16bit modes.\n[rax+18]\n<pre><code>mov qword ptr ds:</code></pre><pre><code>[rax+18]</code></pre><pre><code>,r8</code></pre>\nThe brackets are coupled with the previously discussed <pre><code>ptr</code></pre> keyword and are used to highlight the address is being dereferenced before the operation is performed. All values inside the brackets should be added together to calculate the target address.\nIn our case, this means <pre><code>rax</code></pre> + 18. This means <pre><code>rax</code></pre> probably points to a structure, a class, an array or some other complex memory object, and we're accessing the member at offset 18 of that memory structure. As there isn't any prefix or postfix indicating the number's base, I'll assume it's in hex.\nThis means <pre><code>rax</code></pre> could be an array of qwords, and this instruction is accessing the forth (index 3) element of that array (since 18h=24=8*3).\n<pre><code>rax</code></pre> could be a structure of four qwords, such as a three-dimensional point in time defined as the following:\n<pre><code>struct _point\n{\n    long x;\n    long y;\n    long z;\n    long t;\n};\n</code></pre>\nprobably accessing the <pre><code>t</code></pre> member.\nIt is important to note that for certain optimization reasons (into which I won't dive here), <pre><code>rax</code></pre> is not necessarily pointing the beginning of a structure, and could be already pointing to an offset within the structure, adding 18 to that offset instead.\n, (comma)\n<pre><code>mov qword ptr ds:[rax+18]</code></pre><pre><code>,</code></pre><pre><code>r8</code></pre>\nCommas are simply operand separators, indicating the first operand has ended and the second is about to begin.\nr8\n<pre><code>mov qword ptr ds:[rax+18],</code></pre><pre><code>r8</code></pre>\nCompared to the first operand, the second one is a piece of cake. This simply means the value currently in register <pre><code>r8</code></pre> is the source value, and what will be assigned to the address <pre><code>rax+18</code></pre>.\n",
