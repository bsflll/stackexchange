    "content": "I have a PCB board that is a little involved to figure out its working. I spent a good day mapping trace by trace, node by node but still some node connections wouldn't make sense. I know designers use software to reroute PCB traces, making them compact and planar, also render them hard to decipher.  \nI was wondering if there is any software that helps me translate single sided PCB traces with components to schematics?\n",
