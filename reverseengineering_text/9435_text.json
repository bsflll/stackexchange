EDIT: From searching through the decompiled dll.\n<pre><code>using System;\nnamespace winnov.Amalga.core\n{\n  public interface ISession\n  {\n     string Configuration { get; set; }\n     SessionState { get; }\n     TimeSpan Duration { get; }\n     string ArchiveBasePath { get; set; }\n     string ArchivePath { get; }\n     void Start();\n     void Stop();\n     void ApplyPreset(string presetxml);\n     void writeScriptCommand(string name, string value);\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n",
