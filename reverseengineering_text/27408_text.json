    "content": "I'm analyzing an obfuscated binary.  IDA did a pretty good job of doing the initial auto-analysis.  Later, I went through and marked some sections as undefined, or code, etc.  Now IDA can't re-create a section as a function. It complains about\n<pre><code>The function has undefined instruction/data at the specified address.\n</code></pre>\nI think this is because it has remembered where I've marked thing as undefined or data or code.  And those marks are confusing the auto analyzer.\nThanks!\n",

If there are many such places, you can also try a mass selection and force everything in a range to code (though this may backfire if code is obfuscated).\n",
