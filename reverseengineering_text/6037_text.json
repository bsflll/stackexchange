    "content": "DOSbox compiled with <pre><code>--enable-debug=heavy</code></pre> option becomes a powerful reversing tool. Anytime I feel like checking the disassembly and memory state I just hit Alt+Pause.\nBut, what if I want to see the very first instructions of the program ? How do I start the application so that it immediately enters debug mode before even starting execution ?\n",
