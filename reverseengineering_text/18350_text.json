    "content": "I have a <pre><code>text.txt</code></pre> file and I want to read it and print its content in the Output Window of IDA Pro (Free version).\nI wrote an .idc script as follows:\n<pre><code>#include <idc.idc>\n\nstatic main() {\n    auto fp;\n    auto toPrint;\n\n    fp = fopen(\"C:\\Users\\bob\\text.txt\", \"r\"); // fp is a file handle\n\n    toPrint = fgetc(fp);\n\n    Message(\"%s is the string\n\", toPrint);\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nBut it gives me an <pre><code>unknown character</code></pre> as shown above. I also tried using <pre><code>toPrint = readstr(fp)</code></pre>, but it does not work. (same unknown character)\nPS: I'm analysing a 32 bit PE file. I could not use IDAPython, as I'm using the x64 free version, so I have to resort to IDC. Any help appreciated.\n",

This is probably an initial cause of your problem: symbols preceded by single slash are interpreted as escape sequences which means that the file name was interpreted incorrectly and was not opened.\n\nUsing fgetc in a way you did is also incorrect because it returns long or character, not a string, and Message function probably interprets is as a pointer.\nI checked this on IDA 6.9. In a later versions it is probably better to detect an EOF by value_is_string function for this.\n",
