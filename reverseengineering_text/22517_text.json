    "content": "I am currently trying to use angr, and I need to find a string \"Done!\" which results in the \"good termination\" of the program. The input is 32 bits and I need to know the input which leads to the \"Done!\" being printed.\nI thought of using the following in my python script:\n<pre><code>b = angr.Project('a.out')\narg1 = claripy.BVS('arg1', 32)\nb.factory.entry_state(args=['a.out', arg1])\npg = b.factory.simgr()\npg.explore(find=lambda x: b'Done!' in x.posix.dumps(1))\n</code></pre>\nIn my current knowledge of angr, this should result in the path, wich leads to \"Done!\" being printed. Am I mistaken? With found[0] I could then access the result.\nBut angr leaves me with \n<pre><code><SimulationManager with 1 deadended>\n</code></pre>\nas an output for my simulation manager. What am I doing wrong? Are there more requirements needed for this to work?\nApriciate any help.\nCheers\n",
