Hex-Ras Decompiler comes with its own set of limitation noted in Hex-Rays Decompiler Manual, to mention few:\n<pre><code>Below are the most important limitations of our decompilers (all processors):\n     * exception handling is not supported\n     * type recovery is not performed\n     * global program analysis is not performed\n</code></pre>\n",
