    "content": "Trying to teach myself how to use IDA Pro, and I'm stuck trying to understand this enum:\n<pre><code>enum Input::Action, copyof_42, bitfield\n</code></pre>\nLocal type 42 is defined as:\n<pre><code>typedef ChunkStatus::Enum\n</code></pre>\nwho's enum is:\n<pre><code>enum {Nothing = 0x0,\n      CustomTiles = 0xA,\n      BasicTiles = 0x14,\n      CorrectedTiles = 0x1E,\n      Tiles = 0x28,\n      Entities = 0x32,}\n</code></pre>\nI know the Input::Action enum has values at least from 0 to 90. \nHere's my questions:\nWhat do the commas in the first statement mean?\nCan I put a limit on the range of values that Input::Action can take?\nI've loaded the PDB file, and have gotten the name of enum members for some of the other enums. Can I get names for the members of this enum?\n",
