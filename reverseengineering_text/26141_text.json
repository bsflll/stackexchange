    "content": "I was trying out a simple heap overflow example (http://highaltitudehacks.com/2020/09/05/arm64-reversing-and-exploitation-part-1-arm-instruction-set-heap-overflow/) but replicated the relevant code in x86/x64 to understand it better. This is the code I used\n<pre><code>#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    char *name = malloc(0x6);\n    char *command = malloc(0x6);\n    strcpy(command,\"whoami\");\n    strcpy(name,\"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzls -l\");\n\n    system(command);\n}\n</code></pre>\nI noticed that if I compiled the code and ran it normally, I will get system to execute \"ls -l\" and does a folder listing. However, if I was stepping through the binary using lldb from start to midway and proceed to continue the rest of the execution while inside lldb, I will see \"whoami\" executed instead.\nI am testing this on a Mac OS and I am not sure if this is due to lldb or Mac OS behaviour?\n",
