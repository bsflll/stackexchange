    "content": "I'm trying to disassemble some 6502 using Ghidra. The following (prerequisites: POSIX-style shell, Python 2.x) will generate a file called <pre><code>test.dat</code></pre> that demonstrates the issue:\n<pre><code>python -c \"open('test.dat','wb').write(''.join([chr(x) for x in [0xa2,0xa3,0xa9,0x00,0x9d,0x40,0x00,0xca,0x10,0xfa,0x60]]))\"\n</code></pre>\nThen, from in Ghidra:\n\ncreate new project (wherever you like)\nimport <pre><code>test.dat</code></pre> created above, with Language as <pre><code>6502</code></pre>/<pre><code>default</code></pre> and <pre><code>Base Address</code></pre> as 0x400\ndouble click <pre><code>test.dat</code></pre> in <pre><code>Active Project</code></pre> to get to the CodeBrowser window\nsay No when analysis is offered\ngo to location $400 and press D to disassemble\n\nThe disassembly is pretty short.\n<pre><code>                             //\n                             // RAM \n                             // fileOffset=0, length=11\n                             // RAM: 0400-040a\n                             //\n            0400 a2 a3           LDX        #0xa3\n            0402 a9 00           LDA        #0x0\n                             LAB_0404                                        XREF[1]:     0408(j)  \n            0404 9d 40 00        STA        $0x40,X=>DAT_00e3                                = ??\n            0407 ca              DEX\n            0408 10 fa           BPL        LAB_0404\n            040a 60              RTS\n</code></pre>\nThe odd thing here is that rather than generating a label for <pre><code>$0040</code></pre>, which is the base address of the table, it's generated one for <pre><code>$00e3</code></pre> - the first byte accessed - as if X is a TOC pointer, or similar, and $0040 is the offset. This isn't appropriate for 6502 code.\nIn this little example I can right click and fix up the references by hand, but I don't mind admitting that I don't want to have to do this for an entire program. 6502 code is full of this stuff.\nCan I stop this from happening?\n(I got very lost trying to follow through the Java source provided! - but I did figure out that this sort of reference is known as an extended reference, and appears to be common to all targets. I couldn't find anything in the documentation about these, though, or how to disable them.)\n",

But it might be that this is as good as it gets (I doubt 6502 was high on their priority list...), so I'll be happy to accept this as the answer if it starts to look like that's the case. It does give me a few more things to look for in the code.</span>",

                    "text": "<span class=\"comment-copy\">From what I can see, how it works is <code>ConstantPropagationAnalyzer</code> emulates p-code (the internal ghidra representation) of your program instructions and once it sees a load from an address, it creates a reference. Now, the address it sees is the computed result, 0xE3, so this is what it adds a reference to. You'll probably need to write a custom analyzer for 6502 that would use the original instruction (not its p-code) and create a reference to 0x40.</span>",
