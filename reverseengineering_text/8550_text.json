It relies on the fact\n  that the \"ReadProcessMemory\" function returns false if you try to read\n  guarded or no-access memory. To use this trick, all you have to do is\n  call the \"ReadProcessMemory\" function with the \"Handle\" parameter set\n  to 0xFFFFFFFF, the \"lpBaseAddress\" parameter set to the image base,\n  and the \"nSize\" parameter set to the size of image. If it returns\n  false, then at least one memory breakpoint is present.\n\nAs for your other question -- \"How can i avoid detection?\" -- that is answered here: https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/8510/1562\n\nYou can't know how to avoid getting detected if you don't know how the\n  detection works. I'd recommend finding and reverse engineering the\n  detection logic so that you can either disable it (patch it out) or\n  better understand how to avoid detection.\n",

However this poses a problem since several compilers insert 0xCC bytes between functions (as kind of a trap in case of memory overwrite, I guess)\n\nSo, you would have to do is to know how many of those \"innocent\" INT3 was there before and check for anomalies. Sounds like prone to failure, IMHO :)\nSPOILER: IIRC, this was one of the anti-RE mechanisms in the last Flare Challenge.\n",
