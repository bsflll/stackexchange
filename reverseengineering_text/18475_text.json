    "content": "While working on this kernel module, I noticed IDA somehow resolves some ELF relocations statically. Consider the symbol <pre><code>sys_renameat</code></pre>, which, according to IDA, resides at <pre><code>0x8000720</code></pre> in <pre><code>.bss</code></pre> segment.\n\nThe raw hex bytes corresponding to the <pre><code>mov</code></pre> instruction at <pre><code>0x800328</code></pre> are <pre><code>A3 20 07 00 08</code></pre>\nHowever, looking at bytes at that specific offset with a hex-editor reveals <pre><code>A3 00 00 00 00</code></pre>. Clearly, there is a relocation which IDA is resolving somehow. \n\n<pre><code>readelf -r rootkit</code></pre> confirms this.\n<pre><code>Relocation section '.rel.init.text' at offset 0x119c contains 26 entries:\n Offset     Info    Type            Sym.Value  Sym. Name\n.\n00000059  00001701 R_386_32          00000000   sys_renameat\n.\n</code></pre>\nThe symbol information as returned by <pre><code>readelf -s rootkit</code></pre>\n<pre><code>Symbol table '.symtab' contains 44 entries:\nNum:    Value  Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name\n.\n23: 00000000     4 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT   15 sys_renameat\n.\n</code></pre>\nHowever, if I <pre><code>strip</code></pre> the binary, suddenly IDA fails to resolve (<pre><code>mov</code></pre> instruction at <pre><code>0x800328</code></pre>) the relocations any more.\n\nMy understanding is, resolving dynamic relocations never depends on symbol information which <pre><code>strip</code></pre> removes. I tried to compute how IDA was computing <pre><code>R_386_32</code></pre> type relocation for <pre><code>sys_renameat</code></pre> according to ELF specification, but couldn't figure out what's going on.\nIs IDA resolving relocation correctly in this case/ If so, can someone please explain this behavior?\n",

In 2.6, <pre><code>insmod</code></pre> pretty much just passes the verbatim contents of the LKM file (.ko file) to the kernel and the kernel does the relocation.\n\nAbout relocation resolution by IDA:\nSince the real address of the symbols is not known until runtime but the user expects to see nice names in the disassembly, IDA's ELF loader creates a fake segment (\"extern\") and fills it with placeholders for the external symbols. The relocatable bytes are then patched to point to those fake symbols.\n",
