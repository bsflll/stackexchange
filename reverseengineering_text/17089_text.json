    "content": "I have a file in the Intel hex format, which was taken of from a pic16F1705 chip. I need to find a way to disassemble it into some form of human friendly programming language in order to make some modifications to it. I tried running it through a x86 and x64 dissembler, but in both cases I got an output, which looked like assembler code, but there were around 4000 bad lines in both cases.\nMy question is how should I disassemble this file, so I can read it in some human friendly programming language and modify it? \n<pre><code>0:  02 00                   add    al,BYTE PTR [eax]\n2:  00 04 00                add    BYTE PTR [eax+eax*1],al\n5:  00 fa                   add    dl,bh\n7:  10 00                   adc    BYTE PTR [eax],al\n9:  00 00                   add    BYTE PTR [eax],al\nb:  80 31 0f                xor    BYTE PTR [ecx],0xf\ne:  28 ff                   sub    bh,bh\n10: 3f                      aas\n11: ff                      (bad)\n12: 3f                      aas\n13: 7e 14                   jle    0x29\n15: 80 31 20                xor    BYTE PTR [ecx],0x20\n18: 00 7f 08                add    BYTE PTR [edi+0x8],bh\n1b: a2 10 00 10 00          mov    ds:0x100010,al\n20: f0 00 04 2e             lock add BYTE PTR [esi+ebp*1],al\n24: 70 08                   jo     0x2e\n</code></pre>\nThese are some example lines of the output I get after running the hex through a x86/x64 dissembler.\n",
