    "content": "I created an app in 2018 with python and then used Cython and pyinstaller v 3.6.\nI am wondering how to decompile it.   I have tried uncompyle6 + pyinstxtractor however this only works for python files, not cython. There is also no known cython decompiler.  I have had a try with Ghidra and IDA but no luck although I am new to it.\n",
