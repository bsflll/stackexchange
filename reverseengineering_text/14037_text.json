I want to grab RAM dump. I think it must be a hardware option. Is there a way to do this? Maybe anybody have some expirience?\n",

There may be hardware workarounds to get the data directly from the RAM chips or logic traces but they likely involve multi-K$ professional logic analyzers or testing tools. In any case, you gave us too little information for a really useful answer.\n",
