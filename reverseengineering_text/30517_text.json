            "content": "IDA doesn't stores hotkeys in registry rather it stores gui, terminal user interface(tui), analysis etc. related settings in configuration files which have <pre><code>.cfg</code></pre> extension, this approach provides flexibility in fine tuning/exporting configurations to user.\nThese configuration files are stored in <pre><code>cfg/</code></pre> directory which you can easily find in your IDA installation directory.\nFor example\n<pre><code>IDA_DIR/cfg/ida.cfg</code></pre>\nHowever, plugin related configurations are stored in  <pre><code>IDA_DIR/plugins/plugins.cfg</code></pre>\nBut the most important configuration files are those that govern the use of IDA and they are the following:\n\nida.cfg - stores most common configuration options (parsing/analysis/processors etc.)\n\nidagui.cfg - applies to the graphical user interface (GUI behaviors, keyboard hotkey mappings etc.)\n\nidatui.cfg - applies to the command line version of IDA (configuration for console version of IDA)\n\n\nI assume you want to change or reuse your IDA hotkeys. Therefore, you can open <pre><code>idagui.cfg</code></pre> files in any text editor and change settings as per your preference.\nAll configuration files are well documented using comments and so does the <pre><code>idagui.cfg</code></pre> file, it has been divided into three sections:\n\ndefault GUI behaviors\nkeyboard hotkey mappings\nFile extension configuration for the <pre><code>File->Open dialog</code></pre>\n\nHowever, if you do not feel comfortable editing <pre><code>idagui.cfg</code></pre> directly, then you should create <pre><code>idauserg.cfg</code></pre> in the same directory and add to it all of the options that you wish to override. In this case you only need to edit the last line in <pre><code>idagui.cfg</code></pre> to contains a directive to include <pre><code>idauserg.cfg</code></pre> file. For example:\n<pre><code>#softinclude <idauserg.cfg></code></pre>\nNext time in case you upgrade/reinstall/use IDA on some other platform, you can simply copy <pre><code>idauserg.cfg</code></pre> into <pre><code>cfg/</code></pre> directory. Similar method can be applied for <pre><code>ida.cfg</code></pre> but user provided configuration file should be named as <pre><code>idauser.cfg</code></pre> and include directive in <pre><code>ida.cfg</code></pre> should be appended as above.\n",
