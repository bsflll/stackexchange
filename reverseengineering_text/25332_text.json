    "content": "I am currently practicing reverse engineering to look for the default password of the Linksys V1.5 firmware here https://www.linksys.com/us/support-article?articleNum=148613\nI tried to use binwalk to get more information from the file but do not know where to go from here.  Almost no useful information from what I have seen from hexdump and strings command.  Is there any other recommended tools to use or strategies?\n",
