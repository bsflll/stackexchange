For that moment tested several utilities for relocation patching. \nRelocEditor - didn't solve the issue, but maybe for some future researchers who will face with similar task will find it useful \nReloc Rebuilder - actually solved issue. Just select patched executable and app should fix the relocation table.\nRelocation Section Editor - didn't tried myself, but should also work. Link here because of purposes as in first item.\n",
