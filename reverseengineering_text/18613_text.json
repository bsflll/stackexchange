    "content": "I'm trying to convert my IDB files to BINEXPORT files using the following command that has been advised in many similar questions: \n<pre><code>    \"<path-to-idaq.exe>\" -A -OExporterModule:<result-directory> -S\"<path-to-export-script>\" \"<path-to-idb>\"\n</code></pre>\nHowever, I get 4 files in return(ID0, ID1, NAM, TIL files) and no BINEXPORT file. Am I on the right path?\n(Edit: I moved my .idb, idc and batch file to another directory and now my .idb file is being rewritten each time I launch the command instead...)\nI think my  file which is a .idc is correct:\n<pre><code>    #include <idc.idc>\n\n    static main()\n    {\n         Batch(0);\n        Wait();\n        Exit(1 - RunPlugin(\"zynamics_binexport_8\", 2));\n    }\n</code></pre>\n",
