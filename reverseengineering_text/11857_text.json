Any idea how to handle this ??\n<pre><code>double dzSell(int a1, double a2, int a3, int a4, int a5)\n</code></pre>\nint a1 is array type in dll\nSadly i can not comment Marware answer so putting it here\nso e.g. line like this \n<pre><code>v9 = *(double *)(a1 + 8 * (v5 - 1));\n</code></pre>\nshould be changed to ???\n<pre><code>v9 = *(double *)(a1[2] * (v5 - 1));\n</code></pre>\nand int a1 to double *a1 ??\n",

For proper casting i used (uintptr_t)buffer\n",
