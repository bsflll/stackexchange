    "content": "I'm reverse engineering a very popular Android app. \nThey perform some type of signature verification on the APK, however they do it without: \n\nCalling <pre><code>PackageManager.signatures</code></pre>\nCalling <pre><code>PackageInfo.signingInfo</code></pre>\nInstantiating a <pre><code>JarFile</code></pre> or <pre><code>JarEntry</code></pre>\nCalling native functions(there is a native library with signature verification code, however it has no <pre><code>JNI_onLoad</code></pre> and the function is not called)\nDirectly accessing the <pre><code>META-INF</code></pre> directory\nUtilizing SafetyNet\n\nI have verified that the APK is performing signature verification and not any other type of tamper-detection by resigning the APK and not modifying any files.\nThe only thing I can think of is that the APK is using reflection to call a method whose signature is encrypted or encoded.\n",
