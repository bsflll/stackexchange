            "content": "AFAIK that is not possible. There are other things you can keep in mind however:\nUse of the GCC optimization flags will help make the code look much less readable to a human. When you compile with the highest level of optimization <pre><code>gcc -O3</code></pre> the compiler will move things around such that the \"flow\" might not be at all what you expect. \nYou can also use the flag <pre><code>-static</code></pre> which will force gcc to take small functions and make them inline. This will embed them into your code instead of showing as function calls.. it will make them harder to distinguish. \nOne thing to keep in mind is too it's important to get rid of any unneeded symbols. Gcc offers <pre><code>-fvisibility=hidden</code></pre> and <pre><code>-fvisibility-inlines-hidden</code></pre> to help with this. You can also pass the <pre><code>-s</code></pre> flag to gcc to strip symbols away.\nI think that's about all you can do with gcc to help prevent reverse engineering. Additionally you can use code obfuscation, but there are issues there as well unless you implement it yourself, if you use a readily available method or tool to prevent reverse engineering, there is probably already a tool to counter it.\nKeep in mind that the final executable will have information in it as well such as what version of gcc it was compiled with. This too can be removed with the <pre><code>strip</code></pre> command. \nIf I have an executable (<pre><code>myprog</code></pre>) I can run <pre><code>objdump</code></pre> on it to check some information:\n<pre><code>mike@mike-VirtualBox:~/C$ objdump --full-contents --section=.comment myprog | head\nmyprog:     file format elf64-x86-64\n\nContents of section .comment:\n 0000 4743433a 20285562 756e7475 2f4c696e  GCC: (Ubuntu/Lin\n 0010 61726f20 342e362e 332d3175 62756e74  aro 4.6.3-1ubunt\n 0020 75352920 342e362e 3300               u5) 4.6.3.   \n</code></pre>\nOops, you can see what version/compiler I used. Well, we can fix that:\n<pre><code>mike@mike-VirtualBox:~/C$ strip -R .comment -R .note myprog\nmike@mike-VirtualBox:~/C$ objdump --full-contents --section=.comment myprog | head\nobjdump: \nsection '.comment' mentioned in a -j option, but not found in any input file\nmyprog:     file format elf64-x86-64\n</code></pre>\nThere are other portions you can strip as well, such as <pre><code>.note.ABI-tag</code></pre> but you do lose portability\n",

The only thing you can hope for is to force the user to have a black-box analysis approach of your software (meaning that the user will only be able to observe the output of your program on chosen input).\nBut, even this black-box analysis is extremely difficult to enforce without an additional piece of hardware (eg smartcard) as the user is supposed to be able to take intermediate snapshots of the memory during the execution of your program.\n",

With some extra work it might be even possible to produce code which compiles to exactly the same bytecode (as long as there was no additional post-processing of compiled binary). This presentation described some of the approaches for this, but I can't find the slides.\n",
