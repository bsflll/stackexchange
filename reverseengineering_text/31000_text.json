    "content": "I'm reverse engineering a program from a memory dump using Ghidra. I know there are sections which contain images and sampled sound data in a raw format.\nI'm looking for a tool which will let me view the raw binary as an image so I can find those parts and extract them. Can I do this in Ghidra? Or is there another tool I can use?\n",
