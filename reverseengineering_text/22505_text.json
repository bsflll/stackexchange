    "content": "I'm trying to debug a backtrace created with rr so I type:\n<pre><code>rr replay -s 50505 -k\n</code></pre>\nit displays out:\n<pre><code>gdb '-l' '10000' '-ex' 'set sysroot /' '-ex' 'target extended-remote 127.0.0.1:50505' target\n</code></pre>\nThen I attach to it with ida remote debugger - i can continue, dismiss exceptions but nothing else - pressing the step over button just resumes the process.\nAlso rr have special set of instructions reverse-* however when i type anything in the gdb command line at the bottom it says:\n<pre><code><error sending command to monitor>\n</code></pre>\n",
