Hex-Rays (c) 2004-2012\nListening on port #23946...\n=========================================================\n[1] Accepting connection from 192.168.188.1...\nhere is stack address leak: 0xbfdfdc04\nhere is heap address leak: 0x9085410\nnow that you have leaks, get shell!\n</code></pre>\nThanks a lot for your help! :-)\nEDIT: \nThis is where the error is raised:\n",
