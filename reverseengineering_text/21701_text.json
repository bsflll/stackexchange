    "content": "I'm new with frida and came to this problem.\nI have dll that I want to reverse engeneer(there are no debug symbols). Specifically I want to dump some data from a function. So I have this big function and here is the fragment of it:\n\nHere you can see that some string(<pre><code>pf4</code></pre>) is moved to <pre><code>edx</code></pre>, but more important thing comes after that. You can see that <pre><code>sub_575FD30</code></pre>\nfunction is called couple of times. \nThe most interesting thing for me is the <pre><code>eax</code></pre> register after the call. So what I want to do is to dump value of <pre><code>eax</code></pre> after the call of this function.\nI can't consider dumping something from <pre><code>sub_575FD30</code></pre> function because that function is called from many other places and I specifically want to dump <pre><code>eax</code></pre> after calling it in this specific example.\nMy question is how can I acheive it using frida? Should I hardcode the instruction address(address of <pre><code>push eax</code></pre>) and get value of <pre><code>eax</code></pre>? Is it the correct way or is there some better way to achieve it? Any direction of how to achieve it and script example would be appriciated.\n",
