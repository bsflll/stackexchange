    "content": "I'm working on decompiling a DOS .exe that was written in Pascal or Delphi. When looking at the decompiled code, there appears to be many strings that are are padded with <pre><code>00</code></pre>. Example:\n<pre><code>06 53 54 52 49 4E 47 00 00 00 STRING\n07 41 4E 4F 54 48 45 52 00 00 ANOTHER\n08 4C 41 53 54 7F 4F 4E 45 00 LAST ONE\n</code></pre>\nThe leading number is the length of string, using Pascal conventions. If I were to run the .exe, these strings appear in a list. Because of this, I assume that the organization of the strings is supposed to be a list of some sort.\nMy questions are these:\n\nIs there a way in Ghidra to puts these string into an Array, with one string per element? When I hit <pre><code>[</code></pre> it tries to build the array only off the length of the string and the characters of the first string and ignores the <pre><code>00</code></pre>.\n\nWhy was the code compiled this way. It would appear to increase the size of the file with addition padding byte(s), and I see these type of lists all over the decompiled file.\n",

The only solution I have found is manually editing the raw hex to place the terminated strings sequentially, then placing the removed padding bytes after the last string to keep everything aligned. Very hacky, I know.... but it works so far.\n",

            "content": "While it'd be nice to define a struct using Ghidra's flexible arrays, they are limited in functionality to the point where I haven't found them particularly useful.\nIn your case though, the padding bytes may actually make your life easier. If the strings are all 9 bytes like your example, you could do this:\n<pre><code>struct pstring {\n  byte len;\n  char[9] str;\n}\n</code></pre>\nAnd then make an array of <pre><code>pstring</code></pre> instances.\n",
