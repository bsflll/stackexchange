    "content": "I have a game plugin that enables the lua script encryption.I tried to decode it but it seems used many useless encode method to let you cannot understand it.It seem like some enctypted lua script there,But they are something different.(Decrypting Lua Files)\nThe main file is win.xpl,a dll file.And i decode it with IDA and it seems to read the init .secured file first,and read main.key and serial.key(they all encrypted)\nAnd it read acturl.dat to get activation link.Sadly,they all encrypted.All encrypted lua script is .secured and it's unreadable.\nSome can tell me what encryption is used?Thanks!\nMain program file:https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tUMcOPEFA0alc0lSHvT3YCKvR2llclJ2\nAnd i found a vaild main.key file:https://drive.google.com/open?id=11unjtWBKqrbhlKKDXA6G3lmWemFaFbDx\nAnd the init main file:https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OSpgGsiJsqe7H3YO1dXYBQFlaozXNDTB\nHere maybe the acvation part:\n<pre><code>v45 = -2i64;\n  v2 = a2;\n  v3 = a1;\n  XPLMGetVersions(&v42, &v44, &v43);\n  v81 = 15i64;\n  v80 = 0i64;\n  Dst = 0;\n  v4 = \"10\";\n  if ( v42 >= 11000 )\n    v4 = \"11\";\n  sub_1800845F0(&Dst, v4, 2ui64);\n  v5 = sub_1800978F0();\n  v6 = sub_180097E40(v5, &v46);\n  sub_18008AD20((__int64)&Filename, v6, \"/main.key\");\n  if ( v48 >= 0x10 )\n  {\n    v7 = (void *)v46;\n    if ( v48 + 1 >= 0x1000 )\n    {\n      if ( v46 & 0x1F )\n        invalid_parameter_noinfo_noreturn();\n      v8 = *(_QWORD *)(v46 - 8);\n      if ( v8 >= v46 )\n        invalid_parameter_noinfo_noreturn();\n      if ( v46 - v8 < 8 )\n        invalid_parameter_noinfo_noreturn();\n      if ( v46 - v8 > 0x27 )\n        invalid_parameter_noinfo_noreturn();\n      v7 = *(void **)(v46 - 8);\n    }\n    j_j__free_base(v7);\n  }</code></pre>\nI think the key is in the \"v6\"?\n",
