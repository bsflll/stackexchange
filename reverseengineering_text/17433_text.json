    "content": "I am debugging a program and searching to see when the program is calling <pre><code>WinHttpOpenRequest</code></pre>.    \nI searched using for the function with Ctrl+G\n\nI pressed on <pre><code>Follow expression</code></pre> and it put me on the definition of the function on the <pre><code>WinHttp</code></pre> module:\n\nI wanted to find the place where the main module of the program is calling this function and not the definition.  \nI put a breakpoint there and after the program stopped there I tried to use the  <pre><code>Go to</code></pre> -> <pre><code>Previous location\\procedure</code></pre> so see the calling to this function from the program but it send me to different places.  \nAny idea how can I find the places where the program is calling to a specific function, in my case <pre><code>WinHttpOpenRequest</code></pre> ?  \nI have a workaround and use IDA to find the exact place, but I am sure OllyDbg has this ability and I just not familiar with it.\n",
