    "content": "I'm using radare2 to deconstruct a binary blob. When defining bit-field value there seems to be no syntax to specify the width of the field that contains the enum. For instance with a C structure as follows :\n<pre><code>struct mystruct{\n   uint32_t myint,\n   uint8_t bitfield1,\n   uint8_t bitfield2,\n   uint8_t bitfield3,\n   uint8_t bitfield4\n}\n</code></pre>\nI would declare the following :\n<pre><code>\"td enum byte_enum {bit_8=0x80, bit_7=0x40,bit_6=0x20,bit_5=0x10, bit_4=0x08,bit_3=0x04,bit_2=0x02,bit_1=0x01}\"\npf.binary xBBBB myint (byte_enum)bitfield1 (byte_enum)bitfield2 (byte_enum)bitfield3 (byte_enum)bitfield4\n</code></pre>\nbut each byte gets interpreted as a full 32 bits int (although the offsets only get incremented by 1, which is bewildering me)\n<pre><code>[0x00000000]> px 16\n- offset -   0 1  2 3  4 5  6 7  8 9  A B  C D  E F  0123456789ABCDEF\n0x00000000  4142 4344 3132 3334 0aff ffff ffff ffff  ABCD1234........\n[0x00000000]> pf.binary\n     myint : 0x00000000 = 0x44434241\n bitfield1 : 0x00000004 =  bitfield1 (bitfield) = 0x34333231 : bit_1 | bit_5 | bit_6 | 0x200 | 0x1000 | 0x2000 | 0x10000 | 0x20000 | 0x100000 | 0x200000 | 0x4000000 | 0x10000000 | 0x20000000\n bitfield2 : 0x00000005 =  bitfield2 (bitfield) = 0x0a343332 : bit_2 | bit_5 | bit_6 | 0x100 | 0x200 | 0x1000 | 0x2000 | 0x40000 | 0x100000 | 0x200000 | 0x2000000 | 0x8000000\n bitfield3 : 0x00000006 =  bitfield3 (bitfield) = 0xff0a3433 : bit_1 | bit_2 | bit_5 | bit_6 | 0x400 | 0x1000 | 0x2000 | 0x20000 | 0x80000 | 0x1000000 | 0x2000000 | 0x4000000 | 0x8000000 | 0x10000000 | 0x20000000 | 0x40000000 | 0x80000000\n bitfield4 : 0x00000007 =  bitfield4 (bitfield) = 0xffff0a34 : bit_3 | bit_5 | bit_6 | 0x200 | 0x800 | 0x10000 | 0x20000 | 0x40000 | 0x80000 | 0x100000 | 0x200000 | 0x400000 | 0x800000 | 0x1000000 | 0x2000000 | 0x4000000 | 0x8000000 | 0x10000000 | 0x20000000\n</code></pre>\nI tried the [1]B syntax but radare2 does not take the right byte, it just truncates the 4-byte value to LSB, which happens to be 3 bytes down if you use big endian (like I do). This may be a bug.\n",
