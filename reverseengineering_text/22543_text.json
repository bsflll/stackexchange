    "content": "Programs such as Detect It Easy or IDA can show functions and libraries (<pre><code>DLLs</code></pre>) imported by a binary in the case of <pre><code>C/C++</code></pre> binaries. I have a collection of <pre><code>.NET</code></pre> malware that I'm analyzing and would like to see the imported functions and DLLs for these binaries. I've noticed that <pre><code>_CorExeMain</code></pre> is the only thing that I can see in the <pre><code>imports</code></pre> section with tools such as <pre><code>IDA</code></pre> for such binaries. I'm aware that I can decompile the <pre><code>.NET</code></pre> binary in a tool like <pre><code>dnSpy</code></pre> and manually read the function calls but I would like an automated and fast of doing this such as the <pre><code>imports</code></pre> section in <pre><code>IDA</code></pre>.\nIs there a way to see functions imported from dynamic libraries for <pre><code>.NET</code></pre> binaries?\n",
