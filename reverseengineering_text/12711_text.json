    "content": "I've been slowly working on getting into the workings of a set-top box. I hit a snag when the firmware that it downloads is encrypted. I managed to find some pictures of the circuit board (but haven't opened up my device yet) and I have been reading up on communicating over the on-board serial port. I have zero experience with this, other than what I've read on http://devttys0.com and http://jcjc-dev.com/ and various other sites.\nSo my question is this - Since I'm such a newbie at this, is anyone willing to look at these pictures and help me figure out where a serial port might be hidden? \nPictures @ https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qzd2jpjlv1ieehu/0Am6ttruYe\nAny thoughts? Thanks for your time!\n",
