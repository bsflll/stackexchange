    "content": "Let's say we have 2 functions funcA and funcB, funcA is the upstream of funcB. I want to view certain values and call stack in funcB only if funcA satisfies certain conditions. I can't achieve this through conditional breakpoint in funcB since I don't know how to access the value I want with registers in funcB. The approach I think of it's add conditional break point both in funcA and funcB. In funcA, I set the flag when certain conditions satisfy. In funcB, I check the flag, print certain values if it's set, and reset the flag. But I don't know how to do this in Windbg. Can I define some variables to hold the flag?\n",

            "text": "You can use the pseudo-registers (<pre><code>$t0</code></pre> through <pre><code>$t19</code></pre>) to store how you're accessing things. Their state can be saved with the <pre><code>.push /r</code></pre> and <pre><code>.pop /r</code></pre> commands if you need to nest for some reason. If you want to use full names or even store a whole expression to evaluate, you can also use aliases which get pasted into your expressions using <pre><code>${ }</code></pre> such as <pre><code>${youraliasname}</code></pre>. To assign an integer to an alias, you'll need to assign it with <pre><code>as /x</code></pre> or you can expand it by assigning to a temporary register. Also, you can use <pre><code>${/d:youraliasname}</code></pre> in your expression to see if it has been defined.\n",
