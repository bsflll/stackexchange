    "content": "This post might be specific to IDA Pro, so bear that in mind.\nI'm currently trying to write a plugin for debugging specifically one executable. I know that a certain object in the executable's process exists at 0xAB40C0 (it always exists there). Can I simply write object* obj = (object*)0xAB40C0; and then access the various members of it?\n",

And no, they do not share the address space.\nAs a side note, dynamic binary instrumentation frameworks such as PIN do involve inserting itself into the process space of the binary being instrumented.\n",
