    "content": "I have a struct in IDA Pro that I want to export to a c-style struct. For example:\n<pre><code>00000000 ICreateErrorInfo struc ; (sizeof=0x4, align=0x4, standard type)\n00000000                                         ; XREF: sub_73C9D0r\n00000000 lpVtbl          dd ?                    ; offset\n00000004 ICreateErrorInfo ends\n</code></pre>\nI want to export the above to something similar to:\n<pre><code>typedef struct ICreateErrorInfo {\n    int lpVtbl;\n} ICreateErrorInfo;\n</code></pre>\nI am also using HexRaysCodeXplorer if that helps.\n",
