            "content": "From the docs:\n\nOn most systems, GDB has no special support for debugging programs\nwhich create additional processes using the fork function. When a\nprogram forks, GDB will continue to debug the parent process and the\nchild process will run unimpeded. If you have set a breakpoint in any\ncode which the child then executes, the child will get a SIGTRAP\nsignal which (unless it catches the signal) will cause it to\nterminate.\n\n\nOn some systems, GDB provides support for debugging programs that\ncreate additional processes using the fork or vfork functions. On\nGNU/Linux platforms, this feature is supported with kernel version\n2.5.46 and later.\n\nCould it be that your kernel version is too low?\nYou can also try <pre><code>catch fork/vfork/exec </code></pre> commands.\n",
