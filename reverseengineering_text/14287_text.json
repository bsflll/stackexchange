    "content": "I would like to figure out the data format used by an old DOS game I used to play when I was a kid. That link includes a full download for all the files and it runs fine in DOSBox if you want to try it.\nThe game's main executable (once you run the installer) is <pre><code>Z#.EXE</code></pre>, which file identifies as \"MS-DOS executable, COFF for MS-DOS, DJGPP go32 DOS extender\". Binwalk returns nothing interesting besides a few copyright strings - by trying the <pre><code>-X</code></pre> option, it finds a ton of deflate streams which seem bogus. Strings however shows interesting stuff :\n<pre><code>stub.h generated from stub.asm by djasm, on Sat Oct  5 20:49:01 1996\nThe STUB.EXE stub loader is Copyright (C) 1993-1995 DJ Delorie.\n...\n$Id: stub.asm built 10/05/96 20:49:00 by djasm $\n...\ngo32stub, v 2.00T\n...\nO2C - v1.0 - RiCO/SPiRiT - Richard Spijkers\n...\npopr0%d.vg2\npopr1%d.vg2\npopr2%d.vg2\npopr3%d.vg2\npopb0%d.vg2\npopb1%d.vg2\npopb2%d.vg2\npopb3%d.vg2\npopp0%d.vg2\npopp1%d.vg2\npopp2%d.vg2\npopp3%d.vg2\nr01.VG2\nr02.VG2\nr03.VG2\nr04.VG2\nr05.VG2\nb01.VG2\nb02.VG2\nb03.VG2\nb04.VG2\nb05.VG2\np01.VG2\np02.VG2\np03.VG2\np04.VG2\np05.VG2\npopg1%d.vg2\npopg2%d.vg2\npopg3%d.vg2\ng01.VG2\ng02.VG2\ng03.VG2\nr401.VG2\nr401b.VG2\nr402.VG2\nr402b.VG2\nr403.VG2\nr403b.VG2\n...\ndemodisk.vg2\nstagecom.vg2\npop.vg2\ncursor.vg2\nenergy.vg2\nlogo.vg2\nreadyr.vg2\nreadye.vg2\nreadya.vg2\nreadyd.vg2\nreadyy.vg2\n...\nError loading Song\nPANG%02d.LV2\nRAIN.SNG\nBOSS1.SNG\nError loading level \nThe combined level file is corrupt.\n...\nBUBBLE.PCX\nPREVIEW1.PCX\nPREVIEW2.PCX\nPREVIEW3.PCX\nPREVIEW4.PCX\nPANG1.PCX\nVShI\nuLA9\nBMBLEV\nBMBARS\nBMBIG\nBMGRAB\nPANG%02d.PCX\n...\nGENERAL.SNG\nCREDITS.SNG\n...\nTITLE.PCX\nerror loading title screen (TITLE.PCX)\n...\nBMANIASW.CDF ### the data file\nunable to locate data file BMANIASW.CDF.\n...\nSPLIT.RAW\nGUN.RAW\nYEAH.RAW\nGROUP.RAW\nHSTUCK.RAW\nBONUS.RAW\nSPLITTER.RAW\nTICK.RAW\nCLOCK.RAW\nOHYEAH.RAW\nBOSSHIT.RAW\nLAUGH.RAW\nTRUMPET.RAW\nYBIRD.RAW\nMENUMOVE.RAW\nMENUHIT.RAW\nSCORE.RAW\nBMANIA.PAL\n...\nCannot open CF file.\nUnable to locate combined file: \nabnormal program termination.\nUnable to read from combined file.\n...\nman%d.vg2\narrow.vg2\n0,1,2,3,4\nharp%d.vg2\nguna0.vg2\ngunb0.vg2\ngunc0.vg2\nmanh%d.vg2\nman0.vg2\nman4.vg2\nmanhitg.vg2\nmanf0.vg2\nmanf1.vg2\nmanf2.vg2\nmanf3.vg2\n0,1,2,3\nmanc%d.vg2\nshield.vg2\nmans4.vg2\n...\nrhinoh1.vg2\nrhinoh2.vg2\nrhinoh3.vg2\nrhino1.vg2\nrhino2.vg2\nrhino3.vg2\nrhino4.vg2\nrhino5.vg2\n</code></pre>\nThe first few suggest that DJGPP was used to compile the file, and then a ton of what looks like filenames follow, with some error strings as well as a reference to <pre><code>BMANIASW.CDF</code></pre> which is either the game's actual data/asset file. The full strings output is here.\nOn the data file, binwalk finds nothing besides LZMA streams which again seem like false positives. Strings shows very repetitive patterns as well as totally random onee, plus more filenames at the end of the file, so it looks like there is both uncompressed data as well as compressed. The full strings output is here.\nDoes anyone recognize this type of compression, or could hint at which tools to try next?\n",
