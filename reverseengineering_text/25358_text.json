Why is it failing when I try to set it?\n",

There are two options:\n\nRename the local type or struct to have no “wrong” symbols, you can use it in type declaration then\nUse “Convert to struct*” context menu command on the argument/variable. This bypasses the C parser and sets the type directly.\n",
