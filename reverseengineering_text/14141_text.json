    "content": "In OllyDbg, is there a way to break when memory is allocated?  \nNormally, I would just find a malloc call and set the break there, but that's not always available in the case of packed/encrypted/obfuscated code.\nThe memory map seems to only allow breaks on already allocated memory.\nIf not Ollydbg, is there another tool that can do this?\nThanks,\nGeoff\n\nI've got my GREM, but I'm still pretty new to reversing.\n",
