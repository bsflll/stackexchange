    "content": "I'm using IDA PRO 5.0 Free to analyze firmware from a camcorder (mn103 processor). I'm a complete newbie in reverse engineering so it's hard for me to learn how it works only using assembly code. I found out, there are a lot of original function names left in the dump:\n\nIs it possible to get C code with original function names from this? I don't have Hex Rays decompiler tho.\n",

The code itself is still machine language and there's no way to directly translate that back into the original. Your best option is a decompiler like Hex-Rays, but that will still only give an approximation.\n",
