    "content": "A curious and useful feature of GDB is process recording, allowing an analyst to step forwards and backwards through execution, writing a continuous log of the changes to program state that allow for remarkably accurate playback of program code.\nAlthough we can all safely say the process recording log contains the executable's changes to the various data and control registers, the functionality is much more than keeping some serialized representation of the current continuation. For example, I've been able to reify the state of an executable that uses threads to modify shared memory.\nCertainly we can't expect time dependent code to work, but if threading code modifying shared state can, in general, be stepped through backwards and still work reliably again, what limitations does process recording have beyond the purely architectural challenges (i.e displaced stepping) specified in the documentation?\n",

By successively \"undoing\" each change in\nmachine state, in reverse order, it is possible to revert the state of\nthe program to an arbitrary point earlier in the execution. Then, by\n\"redoing\" the changes in the original order, the program state can be\nmoved forward again.\n\nThis presentation describes even more of the internals.\nIn addition to above, for some remote targets GDB can make use of their \"native\" reverse execution by sending Remote Serial Protocol packets <pre><code>bc</code></pre> (backward continue) and <pre><code>bs</code></pre> (backward step). Such targets include:\n\nmoxie-elf simulator\nSimics\nVMware Workstation 7.0\nthe SID simulator (xstormy16 architecture)\nchronicle-gdbserver using valgrind\nUndoDB\n",
