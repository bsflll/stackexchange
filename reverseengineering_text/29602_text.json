    "content": "I've wrote a kernel driver recently and it does multiple things, but I wanted to add a IAT hook for a certain driver.\nI want to hook the IAT of another driver from my driver if that makes sense.\nSo I understand your typical IAT hook is done via DLL injection so you're within the same address space as said module.\nThe main question I'm having is can someone give an example of IAT hooking a kernel driver via a kernel driver? I can't figure it out.\nI've been using multiple examples of regular IAT hooking via dll injection but applying it to the Kernel driver instead.\nExpected outcome: Driver1.sys (does the IAT hook) parses the import table of Driver2.sys and replaces the function \"DbgPrintEx\" import with a function located in Driver1.sys aka accomplishing an IAT hook.\nHere is what I wrote / referenced:\n<pre><code>NTSTATUS _HOOKS_::HookFn(PVOID ModuleBase, const char* FunctionName, uintptr_t HookFunc, uintptr_t* OrigFunc) {\n\nIMAGE_DOS_HEADER DosHeader{ 0 };\nmemcpy(&DosHeader, ModuleBase, sizeof(IMAGE_DOS_HEADER));\n\nIMAGE_NT_HEADERS NtHeaders{ 0 };\nmemcpy(&NtHeaders, (PVOID)((uintptr_t)ModuleBase + DosHeader.e_lfanew), sizeof(IMAGE_NT_HEADERS));\n\nIMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR ImportDescriptor{ 0 };\nIMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY ImportsDirectory = NtHeaders.OptionalHeader.DataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT];\n\nmemcpy(&ImportDescriptor, (PVOID)((uintptr_t)ModuleBase + ImportsDirectory.VirtualAddress), sizeof(ImportDescriptor));\n\nLPCSTR LibraryName = NULL;\nPVOID Library = NULL;\nIMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME FunctionNamee{ 0 };\n\nwhile (ImportDescriptor.Name != NULL) {\n    memcpy(&LibraryName, &ImportDescriptor.Name + (uintptr_t)ModuleBase, sizeof(LibraryName));\n\n    IMAGE_THUNK_DATA OriginalFirstThunk{ 0 }, firstThunk{ 0 };\n    memcpy(&OriginalFirstThunk, (PVOID)(ImportDescriptor.OriginalFirstThunk + (uintptr_t)ModuleBase), sizeof(IMAGE_THUNK_DATA));\n    memcpy(&firstThunk, (PVOID)(ImportDescriptor.FirstThunk + (uintptr_t)ModuleBase), sizeof(IMAGE_THUNK_DATA));\n\n    while (OriginalFirstThunk.u1.AddressOfData != NULL) {\n\n        memcpy(&FunctionNamee, (PVOID)(OriginalFirstThunk.u1.AddressOfData + (uintptr_t)ModuleBase), sizeof(IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME));\n\n        Log::Debug(\"First function name -> %s\n\", FunctionNamee);\n\n        if (!strcmp(FunctionNamee.Name, FunctionName)) {\n            Log::Debug(\"FOUND FUNCTION!!! Address -> %p\n\", firstThunk.u1.Function);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nreturn STATUS_SUCCESS;\n</code></pre>\nThis code BSOD's on: <pre><code>memcpy(&ImportDescriptor, (PVOID)((uintptr_t)ModuleBase + ImportsDirectory.VirtualAddress), sizeof(ImportDescriptor));</code></pre>\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but since kernel drivers share the same address space I can just simply use memcpy or RtlCopyMemory to obtain the structs needed for this hook, does anyone have any references or some sort of documentation I can read?\nThanks to all in advance!\nextra info:\n\nWindows 10\nUsing VMWare for testing\nI'm testing the hook on my own driver\n\nEDIT: Posted the faulting source line that causes BSOD.\nUpon debugging via WinDbg(x64), the driver obtains all the addresses correctly comparing them to memory view. Except <pre><code>ImportDescriptor</code></pre> gets an RVA of 0x6000, when inspecting <pre><code>ModuleBase + 0x6000</code></pre> for the RVA it shows that this memory region is invalid, so I believe that the 0x6000 RVA is incorrect and I'm not sure why\nBUG CHECK CODES:\n\nBSOD Error Code: PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA\nBUG Check Code: 50\n",

I think with more than sixteen years of Windows KM development and some formal training in the subject matter, I know a thing or two. And even if you don't dabble in KM your are certainly aware that assertions don't fire in \"release\" (free) builds, but do in \"debug\" (checked) ones. Heck that's the whole reason for the name checked builds in the first place. Similarly macros expand differently. Loads of them actually. Now one could argue that this is \"technically\" not altering the logic. But in fact it is, because differently expanding macros mean different code...</span>",

So long I'll make this non-answer a community wiki, attempting to give clues, ask for details and point to resources.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but since kernel drivers share the same\naddress space I can just simply use memcpy or RtlCopyMemory [...]\n\nUhm this statement is \"sort of\" true, but then it also isn't. It depends on so many aspects in (Windows) kernel mode. While the address space (i.e. min through max address) is technically the same, it depends a whole lot in which context your code executes (e.g. the IRQL) and of the attributes for the memory you attempt to access (e.g. NonPagedPool vs. PagedPool).\nHowever, this is introductory material for KM driver development, so I recommend you pick up a book such as \"Windows Kernel Programming\" from Pavel Yosifovich or even the somewhat older work \"Programming the Microsoft Windows Driver Model\" from Walter Oney. The courses offered by OSR and Yosifovich would also be a great way to learn this stuff.\nBesides you forgot to mention which bug-check code you're getting. This is very much relevant to help you. The parameters included in the bug-check can also give an idea in absence of a full memory dump (or in your case a live debug session). The parameters are those four items included alongside the bug-check code in a blue screen.\n\nAt what IRQL is your code executing during the bug-check? You can't touch\nHow is the code marked in your driver? (e.g. <pre><code>PAGED_CODE()</code></pre> or similar?)\n\nAlso, in case you attempt this in <pre><code>DriverEntry</code></pre> that one always runs at <pre><code>PASSIVE_LEVEL</code></pre> either way ...\n\n\nWho is the caller of the function?\nAssuming you're not doing this inside an I/O request code path, you're still fairly wasteful with stack. KM code has quite the limits when it comes to available stack.\nAll the above questions, comments, remarks also should be checked for code you call (such as <pre><code>Log::Debug()</code></pre>).\n\nThat said, your above statement should be true for all intents and purposes at <pre><code>PASSIVE_LEVEL</code></pre> and to some extent at <pre><code>APC_LEVEL</code></pre>. But even then it pays of to make use of SEH for some code and make use of <pre><code>MmIsAddressValid</code></pre> and <pre><code>ProbeForRead</code></pre> and similar routines as appropriate.\nBtw: perhaps you'd like instead to tell us what it is you're trying?  Although admittedly none of this is very closely related to RCE.\n",
