    "content": "I have the following AT&T assembly code:\n<pre><code>  movl 12(%ebp),%eax\n  cmpl %eax,8(%ebp)\n  jle L7\n  movl 8(%ebp),%eax\nL7:\n  leave\n</code></pre>\nI'm supposed to \"transpose\"(??) it to C code. I actually just have to fill in the blanks in this skeleton C code:\n<pre><code>int g(int x, int y) {\n    if (x ______ y)\n        return ______;\n    else\n        return ______;\n}\n</code></pre>\nFrom what I unerstand, the assembly is going to return whatever is in <pre><code>%eax</code></pre> when done.\nSo this is how I understand what's happening:\nThe <pre><code>cmpl %eax,8(%ebp)</code></pre> line is comparing x (<pre><code>8(%ebp)</code></pre>) with y (<pre><code>%eax</code></pre>). If x is <pre><code><=</code></pre> to y, we jump to <pre><code>L7:</code></pre> and return whatever is in <pre><code>%eax</code></pre> at that time, which is y. Otherwise, we proceed to the next line in the assembly code and <pre><code>movl</code></pre> x (<pre><code>8(%ebp)</code></pre>) to <pre><code>%eax</code></pre>, and return whatever is in <pre><code>%eax</code></pre>, which would be x at that point.\nIn the end, this is what I think is happening:\n<pre><code>int g(int x, int y) {\n    if (x <= y)\n        return y;\n    else\n        return x;\n}\n</code></pre>\nAm I correct in saying that the assembly returns whatever is in <pre><code>%eax</code></pre> when the assembly code is finished running?\n",

In order to avoid things getting messy, calling conventions have been devised.\nYour question therefore becomes \"what calling convention was used to compile the unknown C code to the known assembly?\"\nWhen compiling for x86 architectures, C compilers usually use the cdecl convention. \n Working on the assumption that was the convention used here, then integer results would indeed always be returned in register EAX.\n",
