    "content": "I'm working with a binary file that has been encrypted using the AES cipher, but I'm unsure of which mode of operation was used (e.g., ECB, CBC, GCM, etc.). I need to automate the process of identifying the mode, if possible. The binary file is encrypted, and I don't have the key and don't want to brute force the key.\n",

            "content": "If you only have the encrypted data then you can't get the cipher mode used. There are only some exceptions that allow you to guess a bit:\n\nIf you know the exact length of the pure encrypted data and it's length does not fit to the AES block size then there is a chance that a stream mode like GCM or CFB was used.\n\nIf the decrypted data has redundancies (is not compressed) and you see repeated patterns in the encrypted data then most likely ECB mode is used. See also the famous ECB encrypted Tux image at Wikipedia.\n\nIf the encrypted data is very large, GCM mode becomes unlikely, as most implementations process GCM mode in memory, especially when decrypting. In addition GCM mode has fixed maximum size of 64GB.\n\n\nIf you want to get the cipher mode used you have to decompile the program that encrypts/decrypts the data.\n",
