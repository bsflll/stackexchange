    "content": "In proxy dll in .def file I can see the following notation:\n<pre><code>_CreateFrameInfo=PROXY__CreateFrameInfo @1\n</code></pre>\nOthers use in the following format:\n<pre><code> _AIL_3D_position@16 = vcruntime140_._AIL_3D_position@16 \n</code></pre>\nWhat is the meaning of @ tag in that notation?\nAlso, I have run the Dependency Walker on that program. It returned Hint: 1 (0x0001), 5(0x0005), etc. Are these related? There are less hints than functions though...\n",
