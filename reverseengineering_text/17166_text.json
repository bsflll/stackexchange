            "content": "1- If you own original firmware bin image you could use hex workshop, open it:\ntools -> generate checksum, keep results. Also you have online websites with specific CRC algorythm, MD5, MDC2, and so on... Keep as much results as you could for next step..\n2- Normally checksum bytes should be at the end of the file (EOF) and usually is a CRC32 (4 bytes lenght). So collect all checksums and take a look to results if match ok.\nThen you would be able to generate correct checksum with proper algorythm, just in case as the bootloader makes. \nNever loose the faith :-)\n",
