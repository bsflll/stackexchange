Obvious ones would be\npush/pop modifies esp, pushad accesses all\nbut I'm sure there are more. Does someone know of a comprehensive list?\nedit: By implicitly I mean registers that are not explicitly mentioned in the arguments or the opcode. (except eflags)\n",

            "content": "I do not know of any comprehensive list, but here (32-bit/64-bit) is a very useful reference which contains most of the information you want.\nNote their description of the operand columns:\n\nIf an operand is set up using italic, it is an implicit operand, which is not explicitly used. If an operand is set up using boldface, it is modified by the instruction.\n\nSo for example, in the 8-bit version of the <pre><code>MUL</code></pre> instruction (<pre><code>AX = AL * r/m8</code></pre>), they list the operands as AX, AL, and r/m8.  Note that the first two operands are italicized because they are implicit, and the first operand is bolded because it is modified.\nUnfortunately, this does not cover all cases of register modification.  For example, <pre><code>MOVSD</code></pre> only lists m32 and m32 for the operands and does not mention the fact that <pre><code>ESI</code></pre> and <pre><code>EDI</code></pre> are dereferenced and then adjusted by 4.\n\nStill, it covers almost all cases, including:  <pre><code>AAA</code></pre>, <pre><code>AAD</code></pre>, <pre><code>AAM</code></pre>, <pre><code>AAS</code></pre>, <pre><code>CBW</code></pre>, <pre><code>CDQ</code></pre>, <pre><code>CLTS</code></pre>, <pre><code>CMPXCHG</code></pre>, <pre><code>CMPXCHG8B</code></pre>, <pre><code>CPUID</code></pre>, <pre><code>CWD</code></pre>, <pre><code>CWDE</code></pre>, <pre><code>DAA</code></pre>, <pre><code>DAS</code></pre>, <pre><code>DIV</code></pre>, <pre><code>ENTER</code></pre>, <pre><code>IDIV</code></pre>, <pre><code>IMUL</code></pre>, <pre><code>IN</code></pre>, <pre><code>LAHF</code></pre>, <pre><code>LEAVE</code></pre>, <pre><code>LGDT</code></pre>, <pre><code>LIDT</code></pre>, <pre><code>LLDT</code></pre>, <pre><code>LMSW</code></pre>, <pre><code>LOOP</code></pre>, <pre><code>LOOPcc</code></pre>, <pre><code>MONITOR</code></pre>, <pre><code>MUL</code></pre>, <pre><code>OUT</code></pre>, <pre><code>POPA</code></pre>, <pre><code>PUSHA</code></pre>, <pre><code>RDMSR</code></pre>, <pre><code>RDPMC</code></pre>, <pre><code>RDTSC</code></pre>, <pre><code>RDTSCP</code></pre>, <pre><code>REP</code></pre>, <pre><code>SAHF</code></pre>, <pre><code>SALC</code></pre>, <pre><code>SGDT</code></pre>, <pre><code>WRMSR</code></pre>, and many of the float and SSE instructions, as well as a couple instructions that do not have mnemonics.\nIt does not (completely) cover some others, including:  <pre><code>CMPS</code></pre>, <pre><code>INS</code></pre>, <pre><code>LODS</code></pre>, <pre><code>MASKMOVDQU</code></pre>, <pre><code>MASKMOVQ</code></pre>, <pre><code>MOVS</code></pre>, <pre><code>OUTS</code></pre>, <pre><code>SCAS</code></pre>, <pre><code>STOS</code></pre>. Modifications to the stack pointer are generally not mentioned.\nIf you care about segment registers, there are also <pre><code>LDS</code></pre>, <pre><code>LES</code></pre>, <pre><code>LFS</code></pre>, <pre><code>LGS</code></pre>, <pre><code>LSS</code></pre>, and the segment prefixes.  Several other instructions can implicitly modify the segment registers, however.  Additionally, instructions that access memory implicitly access cached information from the segment registers.\nNote: The above are not comprehensive lists!\nUltimately, you need to read the Intel Manuals to get the official documentation, but this chart should still save you a lot of time.\n",

There are instructions that modify memory using immediate values, for example.  They don't access registers, so they seem to qualify but probably not what you intend.\n",
