    "content": "I want to look under a BGA chip and map JTAG pins to traces where I can attach a JTAGulator. Is there some version of a BGA x-ray that isn't thousands of $'s?\nHere's a picture of the BGA's. Would it be easier to build a breakout connector to insert between this and main board?\n\nIf I desoldered them, maybe I could stick them in a socket and read them directly?\n",

If they were eMMC, there are sockets you can buy to read them, or breakout the pins manually to a dummy card. Not sure, there are some fairly cheap kits online that seem alright.\n",
