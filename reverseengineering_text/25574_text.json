Following all the steps in the video I receive an unhandled exception at 1:47. I am unable to deobfuscate the crackme. I've tried so many variations of this I couldn't possibly list them. Imagine 3-days; 9 hours a day running every variation, that's what I've done.\nAn expert will have it deobfuscated in a few mins. Is anyone able to advise the steps with dnSpy to truly deobfuscate this crackme?\nI'm not after the solution to the crackme; just how to debfuscate.\n",
