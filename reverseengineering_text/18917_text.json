I guess that this firmware is for a router or something similar.\nYou should just force your disassembler to take this file as raw MIPS and process it.\nNote: A 'raw binary' is just a file with raw opcodes in it without any specific recognizable format (such as ELF, PE or Mach-O). Raw formats are just intended to be mapped directly in memory without going through an operating system first. It is very common in the embedded software World.\n",
