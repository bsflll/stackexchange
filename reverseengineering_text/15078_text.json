    "content": "I'm new to the coding game. I've been using Ollydbg to try and find the info but it seems it's encrypted. I was hoping I could locate the info so I can program my device to work with the software it's intended for. I was able to find where the process requests the info and sets the info under \"names\" .text files (Example: \".text _GetDeviceVid\" and \".text _SetVid\"). Is there a way I can retrieve that info so I can use it to program my device?\n",
