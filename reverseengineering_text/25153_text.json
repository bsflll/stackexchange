    "content": "I have a USB keyboard which has an Electron app to set the macros on the keyboard. I unpacked the <pre><code>app.asar</code></pre> file, and the JS files seem to indicate that it is a ReactJS app, and is a minified production build, and obfuscated too much to reverse engineer.\nAnother way to approach the problem seemed to be to use USB sniffer. I chose WireShark for the job. I wanted to capture all the data packets sent from the app to the keyboard, and hoped to reverse engineer that. The problem is, I can't find a way to capture the raw USB stream. I tried using WireShark to monitor <pre><code>usbmon0</code></pre>, but there is too much metadata, and separating the raw data from the protocol metadata seems to be a daunting task.\nI do not have a hardware USB sniffer or a JTAG debugger. Is there a simple way to capture all the raw data going from the app to the keyboard?\n",
