    "content": "I am trying to reverse a program which is employing some kind of anti-debugging trick based on the use of  SEHs and the TF. The code stars with:\n\nSo apparently it's generating an exception with\n<pre><code>XOR DWORD PTR [ESP], 154h\n</code></pre>\nWhich ultimately terminates with a call to <pre><code>ExitProcess()</code></pre> without even running the program.\nI tried using <pre><code>NOP</code></pre>s to bypass this but since upon execution the EP is already pointing to this problematic piece of code it did not work. \nHow can  I bypass this and what's really triggering the exception?\n",
