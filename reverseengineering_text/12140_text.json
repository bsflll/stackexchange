    "content": "The PE-Header of Windows executables contains as its third field the \"Timestamp at compile time\". To reach reproducibility in our build process we would like to set the time (Epoch seconds) to zero (=1970-01-01 00:00:00).\nDoes this have any side-effects? According to \nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/164151\nthe header does not impact the function.\nAre there compiler/linker flags to get this automatically?\nKind regards\nStefan S.\n",
