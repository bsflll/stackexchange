    "content": "I love doing online stock trading in my free time. Because I spend most of the day at my job I cannot do much of it. So, I'm thinking of making a software that will automatically place trades for me based on the trading strategy that I created. The trading platform that my broker provided me is java and html5 based and I access it with a web browser. My broker does not provide API for automated trading. I have understanding of some basic Javascript and Python programming. So, in order to make my algo trading software I need to do some reverse engineering. Don't know java (no time to learn also) and don't have enough money for hiring a programmer. Is there anyway I can reverse engineer a java applet using Python/Javascript? If I can, what else I need to learn about reverse engineering, as I know only basic python and JS.\n",

            "content": "If I understand well, you would like to reverse a Java applet in order to plug your own tool on a specific API (which is incidentally a trading platform).\nI do not know why you are speaking about Javascript/Python... If you are reversing a Java application, then you need to know about Java applications... There is no escape from reality, unfortunately.\nAnyway, what you need to use is a Java Decompiler in order to recover as much possible from the <pre><code>*.class</code></pre> files you got from the application you want to understand. There are several Java Decompilers that you can find, here is a small list (from the most featured to the least):\n\nJava Decompiler\nProcyon\nKrakatau\nCFR\nJAD\nMocha\n\nYou can find more information by looking to this similar question on SO.\n",
