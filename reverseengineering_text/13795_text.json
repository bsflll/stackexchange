    "content": "I'm using XPosed for faking gps location. I have faked and tested successfully these two apis:\n\n<pre><code>FusedLocationApi</code></pre> from <pre><code>GoogleApiClient</code></pre>\n<pre><code>LocationManager</code></pre> including two methods: <pre><code>requestLocationUpdates</code></pre> and <pre><code>getLastKnownLocation</code></pre>\n\nBut when I test it on some other apps such as Grab, Uber or Google Map, they still display my location correctly. Are they using different APIs? How can I find that out?\n",
