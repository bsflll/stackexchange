    "content": "I'm getting started with some reverse engineering lately, especially on Linux and ELF format, but I'm struggling here.  \nFor now I'm only using GDB to disassemble binaries, and even though I can read and understand the assembly code in general, I don't know \"where\" to look, or what register to check to find the flag (I'm talking about CTFs here).\nWhat I'm asking for are books or videos, something to get me used to GDB and give me the thinking methodology (if there's such a thing).\nThanks!\n",

Maybe you should try to do some wargames so you can learn step by step and teach yourself by practice what you need to know : exploit-exercises.com/nebula\n",
