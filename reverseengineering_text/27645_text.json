    "content": "I've asked the same question at stackoverflow, but i'm gonna copy-paste it here as i might get more relevant answers(?):\nI'm trying to kernel debug a physical Macbook pro device.\nWhen my setup contains a VM, between a host MacOS and guest MacOS, its working with no problem using <pre><code>lldb -o \"kdp-remote <guest_machine_ip>\"</code></pre>\nmy boot-args on my remote (to debug) Macbook are:\n<pre><code>user$ nvram boot-args\nboot-args       debug=0x44 kext-dev-mode=1 pmuflags=1 -v kcsuffix=debug\n</code></pre>\nWhen i'm triggering kernel debug using either\n<pre><code>sudo dtrace -w -n \"BEGIN { breakpoint(); }\"</code></pre>\nor <pre><code>LEFT CMD + RIGHT CMD + PowerButton</code></pre>, the system is in halt mode, not responsive to anything (Mouse not moving, etc)\nBut when I'm trying to connect to the machine from the host using the lldb command provided earlier, it's not working.\nI've made sure the machines can ping each other and I can set up a SSH connection.\nTo the best of my understanding, I had to user special Apple adapters (<pre><code>Realâ„¢ Ethernet adapter</code></pre>), so I'm using the following adapters to debug the remote machine:\n\nhttps://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMEL2AM/A/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-to-thunderbolt-2-adapter\nhttps://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD463LL/A/thunderbolt-to-gigabit-ethernet-adapter\n\nThe physical connections setup looks like that:\nMacOS-Debugger --(USBC to Ethernet adapter)--> Ethernet cable <-- (ThunderBolt to Ethernet adapter) <-- (ThunderBolt3 to ThunderBolt2 adapter) <-- MacOS-debuggee\nGenerally for the debugging I used the following tutorial, which worked for VM debugging:\nhttps://knight.sc/debugging/2018/08/15/macos-kernel-debugging.html, I didn't find the exact KDK version, but I don't think it should be the problem here\nMy debugger is <pre><code>BigSur</code></pre>, and my debugee is <pre><code>Catalina</code></pre>\nAny ideas to what the problem may be will be helpful\n",
