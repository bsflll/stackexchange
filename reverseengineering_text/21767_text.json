    "content": "I am analyzing a dex file and to ease with reverse engineering, I converted it a jar so it could be decompiled. In the file <pre><code>android/support/v17/leanback/media/MediaControllerGlue.class</code></pre>, the following import appears: \n<pre><code>import android.support.v4.media.session.MediaControllerCompat;</code></pre>\nHowever, this class is not defined. In fact, there is no <pre><code>android/support/v4/media</code></pre> package in the file. \nTo confirm, this, I listed the referenced type in the <pre><code>type_ids</code></pre> section of the dex file, and sure enough, the following type is present: <pre><code>android/support/v4/media/MediaControllerCompat</code></pre>. However, when I then iterate over all entries in the <pre><code>class_defs</code></pre> section, this class is nowhere to be found.\nI am new to Android (this is actually an Amazon Firestick APK) development/reverse engineering so I'm not sure how this is possible. Is there some way of defining classes in a separate library that would exist outside of the APK?\n",
