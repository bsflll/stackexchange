    "content": "So I was doing some REing in IDA, changed a function parameter type and suddenly my stack pointer messes up (<pre><code>1025B361: inconsistent fpu stack</code></pre>). Does anyone know what to look for here or how to fix it?\nI tried the following:\n\n Undefining-redefining and changing argument types. \n Changing the `double game_time` type to `float` in pseudocode, but it won't let me (`Sorry, cannot change variable type`, because it's in use in the pseudocode).\n Changing the stack definition from `0000018C var_18C dq ?` to `dd`.\n Changing the signature of `director_debug`.\n Manually editing the HEX code from `DD 1C 24` to `D9 1C 24` (forcing m32fp).\n In order: changing the function signature, changing the stack value, undefining the calling function and redefining it as a function (code).\n\nHowever, none of this helped. \nPseudocode\n<pre><code>_EDX = game_time_ptr_12; //float edx@2\n__asm\n{\n  fld     dword ptr [edx+0Ch]\n  fstp    [esp+18Ch+var_18C]\n}\ndirector_debug(\"%3.2f: Director debug: %s.\n\", *(_QWORD *)&game_time, \"NORMAL MODE\"); //double||__int64 game_time ST24 8@2\n</code></pre>\nDissassembly\n<pre><code>.text:1025B35B 0 184                 mov     edx, game_time_ptr_12\n.text:1025B361 0 184                 fld     dword ptr [edx+0Ch]\n.text:1025B364 1 184                 push    offset aNormalMode ; \"NORMAL MODE\"\n.text:1025B369 1 188                 sub     esp, 8\n.text:1025B36C 1 190                 fstp    [esp+18Ch+var_18C] ;qword ptr [esp]\n.text:1025B36F 0 190                 push    offset a3_2fDirectorDe ; \"%3.2f: Director debug: %s.\n\"\n.text:1025B374 0 194                 call    director_debug\n</code></pre>\nWhat it should become\n<pre><code>game_time = *(game_time_ptr_12) + 12);\ndirector_debug(\"%3.2f: Director debug: %s.\n\", game_time, \"NORMAL MODE\");\n</code></pre>\n",

            "content": "I recently had the very same issue and I could only fix it by checking the following:\nWhenever some methods returned <pre><code>float</code></pre> or <pre><code>double</code></pre>, calling methods displayed <pre><code>__asm fstp</code></pre> instructions instead of pseudo code assignments despite those method's stack being seemingly well defined. Additionally, <pre><code>inconsistent fpu stack</code></pre> is displayed in the Output window when listing these methods.\nSwitch to the disassembly of a messed up method. Its address line prefixes are accompanied by (what seems to be) the problematic FPU stack pointer. It will display a negative value (like <pre><code>.text:0x0065789-1</code></pre>) at locations it calls methods that should return <pre><code>float</code></pre> or <pre><code>double</code></pre>.\nI double-checked the return types of those methods, switching them back and forth from <pre><code>int</code></pre> to <pre><code>float</code></pre>/<pre><code>double</code></pre>, which eventually fixed the decompilation of the calling methods again.\n",
