    "content": "I'm reverse engineering an <pre><code>ARM64</code></pre> Golang binary built with <pre><code>musl</code></pre> and I've already detected <pre><code>kill -10,12,15 pid</code></pre> as the signals which interact with it, where <pre><code>10</code></pre> and <pre><code>12</code></pre> represent user-defined signals. I think there must be other signals as well and I wish to detect them. In particular, may there be other user-defined signals or only 2 <pre><code>SIGUSR</code></pre>s are available no matter what? Since signals are being sent to the binary during runtime I wanted to know if there are signature functions in Golang's runtime that may be imported in the binary and represent signal handling functionalities in the binary.\n",
