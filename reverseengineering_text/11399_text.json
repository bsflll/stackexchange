    "content": "I have this assembly code that reads a string of 120 bytes. If I try to fill the buffer by pressing a key until it stops writing, the enter key doesn't work. I counted the characters and I found that I have written 121 characters. \nIs this normal? Is there a way to avoid it? Another interruption perhaps?\nThe code:\n<pre><code>.model small\n.stack 100h\n.386\n.data \n    MSG DB \"Please give me the string (max 120 chars): \", 10, 13, \"$\"\n    Sentence1 DB 121,?,121 dup(0)\n.code\nstart:\n    mov ax, @data\n    mov ds, ax\n\n    mov ah,09h\n    lea dx,A\n    int 21h\n\n    xor ax,ax        \n    mov dx, offset Sentence1\n    mov ah, 0Ah\n    int 21h\n    xor bx,bx\n    mov bl, Sentence1[1]\n    mov Sentence1[bx+2], '$' \n\n    mov ah, 4ch\n    int 21h\nend start  \n</code></pre>\nAn example (imagine that is a 11 bytes buffer and not 121 bytes, for brevity):\n<pre><code>Please give me the string (max 10 chars):\nAAAAAAAAAAA\n\\_________/\n     |\n    11 As\n</code></pre>\nIf I press Enter at this point it doesn't work, but if I delete an A and press Enter, then it works.\nI use Tasm and Tlink for compiling.\nRegards.\n[Edit] A typo.\n",
