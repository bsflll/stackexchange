            "content": "BAP is mostly a rewrite of BitBlaze, so feature-wise there are many common features.  However, many of these have been re-written or re-designed for BAP.\nCommon features:\n\nLifting of usermode, x86 instructions\nDatafow analysis module\nDominator analysis\nCFG and SSA representations\nOptimization framework\nVerification condition generation\nDependency graphs\nSlicing\n\nI am a BAP developer, so I can mainly attest to what is new in BAP since we split.  However, I don't think BitBlaze has (publicly) added new features since then.\nNew in BAP:\n\nFormally defined semantics for the IL\nPIN-based user-level taint tracking and tracing tool\nIntegration with LLVM\nNative instruction lifting (i.e., in OCaml)\n\nOnly in BitBlaze:\n\nTEMU system-level taint tracking and tracing tool\n",
