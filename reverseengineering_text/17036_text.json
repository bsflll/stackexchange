    "content": "I'm trying to stop at a specific module load from a kernel debugger inside a specific process context.\nWhat i do is to first set <pre><code>sxe ld [process-name]</code></pre> let's say calc.exe.\nNow, when I run calc it works, but when i set <pre><code>sxe ld [dll-name]</code></pre> (say kernel32/ntdll) it won't work.\n",

            "content": "I think usually this enables stopping on loading of kernel modules only (e.g. drivers). However, this SO answer claims it can work for user-mode processes if you send <pre><code>!gflag +ksl</code></pre> first (Enable loading of kernel debugger symbols).\nIt also describes how you can set process-specific kernel  breakpoints, e.g.\n<pre><code>kd> .process\n    Implicit process is now 00112233`44556677\nbp /p 0011223344556677 nt!NtMapViewOfSection\n</code></pre>\nThe <pre><code>NtMapViewOfSection</code></pre> syscall is used, among other purposes, to load DLLs so by stopping at it you should catch all further DLL loads.\n",
