    "content": "X-POST FROM unix.stackexchange.com\nI'm currently trying to make modifications to a router firmware: Swisscom Centro Grande - aka Pirelli Vx226N1, firmware version: 60200.\nI've decompiled it successfully with FMK v0.99 and got the <pre><code>header.img</code></pre>, the <pre><code>rootfs.img</code></pre> and the <pre><code>footer.img</code></pre> image parts.\nThis is the binwalk of rootfs.img:\n\nSquashfs filesystem, little endian, non-standard signature,  version 4.0, compression:gzip, size: 2764423 bytes,  1145 inodes, blocksize: 65536 bytes, created: Fri Mar 15 00:33:08 2013\n\nI decompiled the rootfs.img with unsquashfs succesfully and got the system folders. I made some changes (enabled a shell on telnet) and tried to repack everything with the tools provided (the <pre><code>./build-firmware.sh</code></pre> command).\nThe final firmware size was bigger than the original one.\nTried to falsh, nothing happened.\nI analyzed the firmware and especially the upgrade method to learn how to properly build the firmware.\nI found the <pre><code>update.sh</code></pre> file which handles the upgrade process (analyzes the file provided by the user and flashes only if everything is correct, in order to prevent brick)\nHere is the link to the pastebin of that file\nI'm pretty sure that the original firmware files are parsed through the <pre><code>parse_yaps_image()</code></pre> function, so I tried adapting on my own to check the files but I noticed that there was an external check with a binary file called <pre><code>sig_verify</code></pre>\nIf the files doesn't exists another function is invoked, the problem is that the function provided isn't correct (it return a <pre><code>wrong validation token</code></pre> error even with original firmwares!)\nMy goal is to analyze the <pre><code>sig_verify</code></pre> file and look for the algorithm, in order to understand the composition method and in order to flash my router in the proper way and finally get the root shell (and make modification on everything I want)\nI uploaded all files on a Mega folder so the interesed guys who wanna help me could access any file needed.\nI included in the folder 60208 the two scripts I used to check the files.\nThe result of the script I wrote (it's just the adaptation of the script in the router) is this:\n<pre><code>denys@denys-pc:~/Documents/router/Vx226N1/images/modified/60208$ ./check_upgrade_yaps.sh \nParsing YAPS format...\n16+0 records in\n16+0 records out\n16 bytes (16 B) copied, 0.000843843 s, 19.0 kB/s\nError: wrong validation token (5b445d3b251d59753031c9d7a94ba4ab, 7d98668859855f1b9459256257fc3262)\n</code></pre>\nAnd here is the binwalk of <pre><code>sig_verify</code></pre> file.\n<pre><code>denys@denys-pc:~/Documents/router/Vx226N1/images/modified/60208$ binwalk sig_verify \n\nDECIMAL     HEX         DESCRIPTION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0           0x0         ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, version 1\n1921        0x781       LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x01, dictionary size: 16777216 bytes, uncompressed size: 16777472 bytes\n</code></pre>\nAs you can notice it's a MIPS executable.\nI tried to run it under a MIPS envirronment (virtual machine, <pre><code>qemu-system-mips</code></pre>) without any success.\n<pre><code>qemu-system-mips -M mips -kernel ./vmlinux-2.6.18-6-qemu -initrd ./initrd.gz -hda hda.img -append \"root=/dev/ram console=ttyS0\" -nographic</code></pre>\nThe kernel and the initrd were downloaded by http://archive.debian.org/debian/dists/etch/main/installer-mips/current/images/qemu/netboot/\nAny help would be appreciated. If someting isn't clear just let me know :)\n--- EDIT ---\nDecompiled...\nAnyone that could translate machine language into human-comprehensible code?\n",

This will execute the sig_verify binary, which does something similar, but it will also use asymmetric encryption on the checksum. To replicate this, you'd need the private key, but you only have the public one from the disassembly. Getting that private key is about as feasible as getting the secret from an ssh or a https server - there's no real way to do this.\n",

            "content": "Interestingly, both the online disassembler and retargetable decompiler choke on your <pre><code>sig_verify</code></pre> program, and <pre><code>objdump</code></pre> says it has a corrupted section header, while Ida can read it without any problems.\nFrom a quick glance, there's only 3 interesting functions in it, that i called <pre><code>main</code></pre>, <pre><code>generate_hash</code></pre> and <pre><code>verify_key</code></pre>. Both <pre><code>generate_hash</code></pre> and <pre><code>verify_key</code></pre> use various functions of the gcrypt library (which it links dynamically). <pre><code>main</code></pre> opens a file from <pre><code>argv</code></pre>, uses <pre><code>generate_hash</code></pre> to calculate a checksum over the file, then calls <pre><code>verify_key</code></pre>. <pre><code>verify_key</code></pre> uses, among some other stuff, <pre><code>gcry_pk_verify</code></pre>, which verifies a public key. If <pre><code>verify_key</code></pre> succeeds, <pre><code>main</code></pre> truncates the last few bytes from the file (which, i assume, contain the key to verify against).\nIt seems to me that the vendor uses some private key to sign the firmware file, and has the flash process check the file against the corresponding public key, which would make it very hard to create a valid replacement firmware. HOWEVER, i only looked at the function names and strings and didn't try to understand every byte of the functions, so i might be wrong.\nI don't know if my IDA license allows me to make the disassembly public, but i'll check this and, if you're interested and it's ok with the license, upload the disassembly somewhere so you can investigate further.\n",
