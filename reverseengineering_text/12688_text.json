    "content": "Let's say I have a carbon objective-c executable, and a crash report. From the crash report, it is apparent that the main method is located at <pre><code>0x00002639</code></pre>, and the NSApplicationMain method from the AppKit is at <pre><code>0x93ba0025</code></pre>. I anticipate that the first main method has background processes, and NSApplicationMain is the method typed by the user.\nIs there any sort of predictable interval to instructions? I want to make breakpoints at every instruction written by the programmer. Let's say for example that the main after the main method, the instructions are separated by 2, so from <pre><code>0x93ba0025</code></pre>, the next function would be <pre><code>0x93ba0027</code></pre>, etc.\nWould the above apply, or will I have to do something more to achieve this?\n",
