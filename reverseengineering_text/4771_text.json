    "content": "I have the following problem:\nin an assembly code I have a call into a function. When I step into the function and analyze a little bit, after a while ollydbg says that is suddenly terminated and I can not do anything against that. You know, after terminating ollydbg does not allow to step futher.\nMy question would be: \nIs is possible to go back to the line where the function is called and step over the function ? I mean, after knowing that the function is terminating the whole thing i would not go again in that function.\n",

Here is list(non exhaustive) of conditions, that can take debugger down\n\nUnhandled exception was thrown when you tried to step into(maybe anti-debugging trick)\nYou're trying to step into address, that, actually, doesn't exists(unlikely, but may be)\n\nAnyway, if you want the community to help you, there is lack of technical details in your topic. Here is the list of things, that worth providing: OS, commands prompted (breakpoints, etc), debugger listing(IMHO, Windbg better).\nAbout \"time shifting\". As you can see, main OS is not suitable for analyzing purposes. Consider doing this in virtual environment. Best practice is to save initial snapshot of all the configuration and go step-by-step through all parts of interest doing snapshots when needed. The advantage of this approach is that you can rollback previous configuration easily without roughly duplication of all the steps.\n",
