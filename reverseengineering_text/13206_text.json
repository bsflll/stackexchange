            "content": "The official response I got from hex-rays states they rather avoid shipping too many third party libraries bundled with IDA if said libraries will not be helpful for the majority of users.\nThey suggested compiling the necessary Qt libraries myself and bundling the resulting packages with the plugin, but unfortunately this will be a nightmare to maintain (carrying out those packages for every IDA version).\nAlthough using QNetwork will have some advantages (like clean async operation), my original goal was ease of maintenance and this is better achieved by using a python library like requests. That's probably the direction I'll be taking.\nthe full response is this:\n\nWe don't, because the disadvantages would far surpass the benefit.\n  That is, we would have to ship many more libraries (no reason to stop\n  to QtNetwork), that probably < 1% our users need, and adding that much\n  bloat for such little benefit, doesn't really make sense to us.\nThat being said we provide instructions + patch to re-build it yourself\n  from the original Qt 5.4.1 sources:\n   - http://www.hexblog.com/?p=969\nWith those you should obtain a new Qt build, that corresponds to\n  the one we're shipping, ... plus those libraries we don't ship\n  (and PDBs, of course.)\n\nThey also went on and explained why Python/PyQt/QtWidgets.pyd are indeed shipped rather surprisingly:\n\nA valid question would be: why ship python/PyQt5/QtWidgets.pyd then?\n  ..well, there really is no reason. This is a mistake.\n\nAnd finished by tipping off about an upcoming new minor release:\n\nPS: We are a few days away from a new release (IDA 6.95), that will ship\n  with Qt 5.6.0, which is a long-term release (i.e., 3 years support +\n  bugfixes.)\n\nNoting the complexities of bundling additional IDA-QT libraries with plugins:\n\nUnless you really have to build specifically for IDA 6.9 (and thus\n  Qt 5.4.1), perhaps it's best to wait for the new release, in order to\n  not have to do it twice? (I'll write a similar blog post with configure\n  options + patch for IDA 6.95)\n",
