    "content": "I am trying to reassemble code reversed from an executable using radare2. I have managed to extract the asm and am using nasm for reassembling. \nThe question is, the code also contains commands like \n<pre><code>byte ptr [esi],pushal, fucomi st(3) and sqrtps xmm5, xmmword [edx - 1]</code></pre> which I'm unfamiliar with.\nI tried assembling with the <pre><code>nasm -felf -o</code></pre> command. However, I'm getting the following errors.\n<pre><code>test.asm:68: error: comma, colon, decorator or end of line expected after operand\ntest.asm:69: error: comma, colon, decorator or end of line expected after operand\ntest.asm:85: error: comma, colon, decorator or end of line expected after operand\ntest.asm:133: error: comma, colon, decorator or end of line expected after operand\ntest.asm:167: error: impossible combination of address sizes\ntest.asm:167: error: invalid effective address\ntest.asm:298: error: symbol `pushal' redefined\ntest.asm:423: error: comma, colon, decorator or end of line expected after operand\ntest.asm:637: error: comma, colon, decorator or end of line expected after operand\ntest.asm:802: error: symbol `pushal' redefined\n\n</code></pre>\nAccording to this stackoverflow post, the keyword ptr does not exist in nasm and it suggested that the word be removed. Doing that resolved a few errors. Now I have the following errors:\n<pre><code>test.asm:68: error: comma, colon, decorator or end of line expected after operand\ntest.asm:69: error: comma, colon, decorator or end of line expected after operand\ntest.asm:85: error: comma, colon, decorator or end of line expected after operand\ntest.asm:133: error: comma, colon, decorator or end of line expected after operand\ntest.asm:298: error: symbol `pushal' redefined\ntest.asm:423: error: comma, colon, decorator or end of line expected after operand\ntest.asm:637: error: comma, colon, decorator or end of line expected after operand\ntest.asm:802: error: symbol `pushal' redefined\n\n</code></pre>\nSince I have no idea what pushal and sqrtps mean, I'm reluctant to remove them from the code. Could someone please explain what these commands mean? \nAdditionally suggestions on how I can get this as a compilable error-free code are also welcome.\nEDIT:\nFollowing user blabb s suggestion, i replaced pushal with pushad and now I have only 2 errors\n<pre><code>test.asm:80: error: comma, colon, decorator or end of line expected after operand\ntest.asm:127: error: comma, colon, decorator or end of line expected after operand\n</code></pre>\nThe 2 lines in question are: \n<pre><code>fucomi st(3)\nand\nsqrtps xmm5, xmmword [edx - 1]\n</code></pre>\nany suggestions as to how to handle this?\nEDIT 2:\nincluding lines 76-83\n<pre><code>pop esi\nint3\nsti\nxor ebx,ebx\nfucomi st(0),st(3)\njmp 0x400299\npop es\nxor ebx, ebx\n</code></pre>\nand lines 122-132\n<pre><code>add cl, bh\niretd\nmov dr0, ebx\nand eax, ebx\nret\npush 0xf\nsqrtps xmm5, xmmword [edx - 1]\npush ecx\npush 0xffffffffffffffff\ncall dword [ecx + 0x51]\npush ecx\n</code></pre>\nEDIT3:\nBased on user blabb s suggestion and also by referring the NASM docs, I found that NASM does not accept st(0),st(3) and instead it accepts st0,st3. Now only one error left.\n<pre><code>test.asm:127: error: comma, colon, decorator or end of line expected after operand\n</code></pre>\nStill did not understand how to handle this.\n",
