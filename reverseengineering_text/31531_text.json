    "content": "IDA Pro 7.6\nStatic disassembly of ARM executable.\nThis binary has 40K functions or so, and no symbols.  So all the functions are sub_49FFA etc.\nHowever, 90% of these functions have a call to a debug logging function, which says what the function is.\ne.g.:\n<pre><code>sub_49FFA() {\n     ....do stuff......\n     debug_message(0x9887, \"save_config()\",\"Error:  Cannot save config: %s\",\"No disk space!\");\n     ....do stuff......     \n}\n</code></pre>\nSo we know sub_49FFA is really save_config()\nAs this is ARM, this means arg2 is the r1 register pointing to a string.  This is shown in the disassembly with LDR r1,=save_config ; \"save_config()\" immediately before BL debug_message\nIs there a way for a script to find all the code refs to debug_message(), and rename the calling function (if not already named) with the string that names the function?\nSpent an hour searching, but I'm not skilled in IDA scripting or python so any help would be appreciated.\nUp until now, I've been exporting the binary as pseudo code, parsing it to make an .idc script to name the functions, but it's pretty error prone, takes a long time and I often have to load multiple versions of the executable for analysis.  Must be a better way.\nedit: Thanks to Rolf Rolles for their helpful suggestion of some script functions that might help.\nI've been able to cobble something together using the below\n<pre><code>ref_addr=0x01D7448\n\nargs = idaapi.get_arg_addrs(ref_addr)\nfunc_name = get_func_name(ref_addr)\nfunc_addr = get_name_ea(0, func_name);\n\nprint (\"func_name for %x is %s (%x)\" % (ref_addr,func_name,func_addr))\nif args:\n   arg_offset = args[2]\n   print (\"arg_offset: %x   \" % arg_offset)     \n   debug_func_dcd = idc.get_operand_value(arg_offset, 1) \n   debug_func_addr = idaapi.get_dword(debug_func_dcd)\n   print (\"debug_func_dcd: %x      debug_func_addr: %x    \" % (debug_func_dcd,debug_func_addr))\n   str_type = idc.get_str_type(debug_func_addr)\n   debug_func = get_strlit_contents(debug_func_addr,-1,str_type).decode(\"utf-8\")\n   #print (\"value: %x\" % debug_func)   \n   print (\"value: %s\" % debug_func)\n   set_name(func_addr, str(debug_func), 0)\n</code></pre>\n(I'm sure this isn't best practice and doesn't have error checking etc - just a proof of concept).\nHowever, unlike my original question many of the binaries actually have the debug function string as argument 5.  i.e. not held in a register at time of debug call, but rather placed on the stack.\n<pre><code>.text:001D7414                 LDR             R4, =aUsbPower_0 ; \"usb_power_reset\"\n.text:001D7434                 STR             R4, [SP,#0x30+function] ; function\n\n.text:001D7448                 BL              debug_log\n</code></pre>\narg_offset = args[4] gives 001D7434, but idc.get_operand_value(arg_offset, 1) (i.e. [SP,#0x30+function])  gives 0\nI don't think I can read register R4 even though we know what the value always is unless we're in a live debug session.\nCan I evaluate this in a different way to get the address of R4 being set?\nNot sure about the etiquette here - so if this has to be a separate question please let me know.\nedit2:\nIn the end, I decided to simply use DumpPseudoCode and parse it to find the right strings I need to name the function properly.\nThat means most of the entire executable gets pseudocode generated for it, and probably isn't terribly efficient.\nAdditionally, because the debug strings contain the source file name e.g. \"/src/network/upnp/upnp_server.c\" I added logic to create folders for the functions and move all functions to the correct place.\nThat makes things much better.  I just have an excuse to go and make a coffee while the script runs.\n",

IDA isn't wrong by giving you the answer it gave -- that's the address where the value is moved onto the stack in advance of the call. However, you really want the address where the value is moved into <pre><code>R4</code></pre>. IDA won't give this to you directly; you'd have to employ some hand-written data flow analysis. However, Hex-Rays can give you the information you need.\n\nUse <pre><code>ida_hexrays.decompile</code></pre> to obtain a <pre><code>cfunc_t</code></pre> object for the calling function\nObtain its <pre><code>eamap_t</code></pre> object by calling <pre><code>cfunc_t.get_eamap</code></pre>\nUse the address where the call to the logging function takes place as a key into the <pre><code>eamap_t</code></pre>\nIterate through the vector of <pre><code>cinsn_t</code></pre> objects that you get back looking for an instruction that contains a <pre><code>cot_call</code></pre> object\nOnce you find the call expression <pre><code>x</code></pre>, access its <pre><code>carglist_t</code></pre> object via <pre><code>x.a</code></pre>\nExtract the string from <pre><code>x.a[N]</code></pre>, where <pre><code>N</code></pre> is the index of the argument you want\n",
