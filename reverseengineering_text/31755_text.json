    "content": "I'm analyzing a mac OS framework, and while redefining types in the decompilation view,\nI wish to define one of the types as a type defined as <pre><code>NSData</code></pre> class which is defined inside <pre><code>CoureFoundation</code></pre> framework that is in the Imports tree:\n\nI've added this frameworks as a program to the project, analyzed it, and set it as external program in the imports tree for my first framework:\n\n\n\nNow after doing all this I still cannot use the classes and types defined from <pre><code>CoreFoundation</code></pre> or any other external library. I even tried to run <pre><code>FixupELFExternalSymbolsScript.java</code></pre> plugin but it only works for ELF and not Mach-O.\nWhat can I do for my first framework which depends on the types and classes defined in other frameworks to be able to access them so I could use them in the decompiler view?\nIf it matters I'm analyzing these macOS frameworks on a Windows host.\n",
