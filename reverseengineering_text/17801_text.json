    "content": "This table is part of the packet encryption of an old game for which I am developing a server.\nThe crypto algorithm doesn't just xor the password with the message.\nIt uses a multiple of the ascii value of the letters in the password as an index for this table/array. With the retrieved value, it then does logical and operations which null out most, but not all values.\nThe result of this is finally xor'ed with the corresponding letter in the message.\nI mean the general idea seems nice for a software that was developed 10+ years ago and was mainly a kids game, but I wonder why someone invents such an algorithm an then puts so many zeroes in there. \nIs it possible, that this table is in some way a part of a standard library function that was mistakenly used in this context?\nOr are these just a bunch of random values to mess with someone who is trying to reverse engineer the encryption?\n<pre><code>20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00\n20 00 28 00 28 00 28 00 28 00 28 00 20 00 20 00\n20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00\n20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00\n48 00 10 00 10 00 10 00 10 00 10 00 10 00 10 00\n10 00 10 00 10 00 10 00 10 00 10 00 10 00 10 00\n84 00 84 00 84 00 84 00 84 00 84 00 84 00 84 00\n84 00 84 00 10 00 10 00 10 00 10 00 10 00 10 00\n10 00 81 00 81 00 81 00 81 00 81 00 81 00 01 00\n01 00 01 00 01 00 01 00 01 00 01 00 01 00 01 00\n01 00 01 00 01 00 01 00 01 00 01 00 01 00 01 00\n01 00 01 00 01 00 10 00 10 00 10 00 10 00 10 00\n10 00 82 00 82 00 82 00 82 00 82 00 82 00 02 00\n02 00 02 00 02 00 02 00 02 00 02 00 02 00 02 00\n02 00 02 00 02 00 02 00 02 00 02 00 02 00 02 00\n02 00 02 00 02 00 10 00 10 00 10 00 10 00 20 00\n</code></pre>\n",
