    "content": "I'm working on decompiling the scripting engine from the game Rayman 2. It's going pretty well, but I'm getting stuck on a particular function which calls another function with arguments that aren't initialized.\nThis is the relevant piece of the function:\n<pre><code>void __cdecl fn_p_stIntelligenceEvalTreeEngine(HIE_tdstSuperObject \n*superObject, tdstNodeInterpret_ *nodeInterpreter, tdstGetSetParam_ \n*getSetParam)\n{\n  ...\n\n  HIE_tdstSuperObject *superObject_1; // [sp+0h] [bp-20h]@0\n  tdstNodeInterpret_ *nodeInterpreter_1; // [sp+4h] [bp-1Ch]@0\n  tdstGetSetParam_ *getSetParam_1; // [sp+8h] [bp-18h]@0\n\n  ...\n\n  evaluatedNode = fn_p_stEvalTree(superObject_1, nodeInterpreter_1, getSetParam_1);\n</code></pre>\nFrom what I understand, at the time of calling the variables have already been put in place, namely at bp-20, bp-1C and bp-18h. Now what I'm failing to understand is how these variables are assigned. Should I be looking at the parent function which calls this function to see how these variables are created? Or is there some other explanation?\nHere's the full function for those interested:\nhttps://pastebin.com/Udj4K8PW\n",
