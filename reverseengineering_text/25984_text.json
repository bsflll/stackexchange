If you want to find a function that edits your player health (and possibly find a static address of for example player class) you can just simply right click the address of health you found, then click <pre><code>Find out what writes to this address</code></pre>. All addresses (in the middle of some function) that written to your health will be listed.\n\nYou can then copy the address that belongs to some function and inspect the function in for example Ghidra.\n",
