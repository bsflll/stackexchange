            "content": "The overall format of an AArch64 Linux kernel can be found in https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/arm64/booting.txt\nOf particular note (emphasis mine):\n\nThe AArch64 kernel does not currently provide a decompressor and\ntherefore requires decompression (gzip etc.) to be performed by the\nboot loader if a compressed Image target (e.g. Image.gz) is used.  For\nbootloaders that do not implement this requirement, the uncompressed\nImage target is available instead.\n\nand indeed, I downloaded a sample image from Linaro and its header matches the structure in section 4, i.e. the image is uncompressed.\nhex dump of the header:\n<pre><code>0000000000: 4D 5A 00 91 57 00 00 14 │ 00 00 08 00 00 00 00 00  MZ.............\n0000000010: 00 70 A8 00 00 00 00 00 │ 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ...............\n0000000020: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 │ 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ...............\n0000000030: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 │ 41 52 4D 64 40 00 00 00  ........ARMd@...\n</code></pre>\nYou can see the <pre><code>magic</code></pre> field at offset 0x38 (<pre><code>0x644d5241</code></pre> or \"ARM\\x64\" as text).\nThe \"MS-DOS executable\" text shown by <pre><code>file</code></pre> is a red herring: the overall image format is actually Portable Executable (PE), which has to start with the <pre><code>MZ</code></pre> signature. Linux kernel employs a few tricks to appear like a valid PE file so that it can be booted by a UEFI-compliant firmware.\nThere is no \"elf bibnary\" to extract because the kernel has been linked into the PE file format and does not contain any ELF headers anymore. IF you want to disassemble it, just disassemble it as raw AArch64 binary (e.g. pass <pre><code>-bbinary -maarch64</code></pre> flags to an ARM <pre><code>objdump</code></pre>) - the second instruction will jump to the real entrypoint:\n<pre><code>0000 4D 5A 00 91    ADD             X13, X18, #0x16\n0004 57 00 00 14    B               stext\n</code></pre>\n(see <pre><code>arch/arm64/kernel/head.S</code></pre> in kernel sources for more details).\n",
