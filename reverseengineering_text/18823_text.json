    "content": "I found the executable in question using <pre><code>VirusTotal</code></pre> \"hunting\" feature, where one can run <pre><code>Yara</code></pre> rules for the files existing in VT database and match the strings. I downloaded the file, opened it with <pre><code>PEStudio</code></pre> and it turned out to contain very many strings that were email addresses, one of which was the string I looked for in VT:\n\nPlease note, the number of extracted strings is pretty high.\nHowever, when I opened the executable in <pre><code>IDA</code></pre>, none of these email strings were found. The number of strings was much lower too. But, instead I found, for example, these strings:\n\nDoes this possibly mean that the emails do not come from a pre-existing list but are generated by the executable?\nIn addition, I noticed some text file names in the <pre><code>PEStudio</code></pre>'s string list, but they were also nowhere to be found in <pre><code>IDA</code></pre>'s list. Is there any difference between <pre><code>IDA</code></pre>'s and <pre><code>PEStudio</code></pre> (and similar tools') string extraction?\n",

So this is only (marginally) useful when you are interpreting parts of the disassembly that use resources.\nAs Ida PRO does not parse common resource formats, it may not be able to show your strings in its \"Strings\" window, and always list them as raw data. So you may want to prefer to use an external resource viewer anyway.\n",
