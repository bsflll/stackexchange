Only difference is that it uses a FM database as it's storage engine in the background, with all user-facing FM features being invisible to the user of the runtime solution.\n",

            "content": "Not quite sure what you are looking for, so here goes:\nIf you just want to open the database of a FM runtime solution, thats easy:\n\nJust rename the .USR file to .fp7 and open it with Filemaker (you might need Filemaker Pro Advanced). See also the developers guide for the layout of the bound files (page 14). The .USR file is called the \"bound\" (as in binding together) file of the runtime solution (created using Filemaker Pro Advanced). \n\nNote: The format is .fp7, there is no .fp10 format. The next higher version would be .fmp12\nIf you want to export your FM data into another database (e.g. Oracle database), then are multiple ways to get at your data:\n\nBulk export (parts) of your data to XML or other formats. Importing the XML somewhere does not seem very straightforward, but all the information should be there.\nUse Custom Web Publishing with XML to answer interactive queries in XML. This library seems to support these kinds of queries.\nHowever, I think the best option is to use the ODBC or JDBC interface to query your data. Then you can use standard SQL to query everything you'd need. You might need to export your scripts separately, although they will be of no use to you as they only work in FM.\n\nThat said, there isn't much to reverse engineer here, apart from renaming a file for the first scenario. However, you absolutely do need a valid copy of Filemaker 10 (or higher) to access your data. There is no description of the internal Filemaker format anywhere, and you won't be able to read it with any other programs. Note that there is a 30-day trial available from the Filemaker website.\n",

Maybe the ODBC solution you suggested allows me to query through all the data, but I am not sure. I will try it the next time when I got it (probably a few days).
