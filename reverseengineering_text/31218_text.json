I tried the typical <pre><code>0x4A000000</code></pre> but some disassembly ends up with lots of warnings about not being able to resolve switch branches.\nI've had similar issues when dealing with raw binaries, and it's almost always down to sectioning the file right, or setting the base address right.\nSo, I think I'm missing something here. Any pointers?\nThe device uses an Allwinner SoC, which has an ARM V7 processor.\nThanks\n",

But this contains a header, pushing actual U-Boot to <pre><code>0x8040</code></pre>.\nNow, one only needs to load this file on Ghidra with offset <pre><code>0x8040</code></pre> and with the usual base address of <pre><code>0x4A00'0000</code></pre>:\n",
