    "content": "I have a MIPS 32-bit MSB binary and I can disassemble the code with IDA Pro and decompile it successfully with ReTargetable Decompiler.\nIn order to understand the binary much better, I need to debug the binary to understand a few subroutines.\nI am using Ubuntu 64-bit (version 14.04). I have followed the instructions provided here: https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/8917/2673 for installing qemu, binfmt, gdb-multiarch, MIPS libraries and cross compiling tool chain.\ncross compiler installation error:\nI get an error while trying to install gcc-4.4-mipsel-linux-gnu on Ubuntu 14.04\ngcc-4.4-mipsel-linux-gnu depends on cpp-4.4-mipsel-linux-gnu.\nWhen I try to install cpp-4.4-mipsel-linux-gnu, I get an error that libgmp32c2 is not installed. And when I try to install libgmp3c2 using apt-get, it doesn't find the package.\nI can find several other packages like libgmp3c2-* however, cannot find the specific, libgmp3c2 package which cpp-4.4-mipsel-linux-gnu needs. And I have even added the recommended repositories to /etc/apt/sources.list\nHowever, I thought we need to install the cross platform compiling tools only if I need to compile the program for the target architecture.\nError in Execution of MIPS Binary\nSo, I tried to execute the MIPS binary and it crashes. When I run strace on it, I get the following error:\n<pre><code>NeonFlash:~$ qemu-mips -strace ./test \n61294 brk(NULL) = 0x00412000\n61294 mmap(NULL,4096,PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS,-1,0) = 0x767ca000\n61294 uname(0x76ffeae8) = 0\n61294 access(\"/etc/ld.so.nohwcap\",F_OK) = -1 errno=2 (No such file or directory)\n61294 access(\"/etc/ld.so.preload\",R_OK) = -1 errno=2 (No such file or directory)\n61294 open(\"/etc/ld.so.cache\",O_RDONLY) = 3\n61294 fstat64(3,0x76ffe6d0) = 0\n61294 mmap(NULL,104789,PROT_READ,MAP_PRIVATE,3,0) = 0x767b0000\n61294 close(3) = 0\nqemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\n</code></pre>\nBelow are the details when I tried to use gdb with the binary:\n<pre><code>NeonFlash$ qemu-mips -g 12345 ./test &\n[1] 60181\nNeonFlash$ gdb-multiarch ./test \nGNU gdb (Ubuntu 7.7.1-0ubuntu5~14.04.2) 7.7.1\nCopyright (C) 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
