    "content": "I'm trying to call a function with a function pointer in C++, but I can't find any convention that fits it. Its stack arguments are (right to left):\n<pre><code>func(float x, float y, int unk);\n</code></pre>\n...but ecx needs to be pointing to a buffer it can use for output / storage. That would be __thiscall, but the caller cleans up the stack (adds 12 to esp). This is what I have right now:\n<pre><code>((void(__thiscall*)(char*,float,float,int))(0x1234567))(a, b, c);\n</code></pre>\nbut it causes the application to crash because the stack isn't evened.\nHow can I call this?\n",
