    "content": "I've been working for my final project which is a disassembler for AMD64 instruction set, and i was trying to disassemble machine code by hand to understand it correctly. But i got stuck at a x87 instruction.\nMachine code of instruction is: <pre><code>dd 04 c5 60 40 08 08...</code></pre>\nI've checked AMD64 manual vol3, and it says DD is an x87 instruction and with the help of ModRM byte ,which is <pre><code>0b00000100</code></pre>, my ModRM.reg field is <pre><code>000</code></pre> and with this information manual says this instructions meaning is \"FLD mem64real\". But since I've compiled this code for i386 target architecture i think that i shouldn't have 64 bit memory adress. \nBut the most interesting part is when i checked the binary with objdump, it says that this bytes are corresponds to <pre><code>fldl   0x8084060(,%eax,8)</code></pre> but i can't find any information about FLDL instruction nor how does objdump find this. \nSo my question is am i doing something wrong ?\nHow objdump think that instruction is FLDL but manual says its FLD ?\nTarget machine of binary is i386.\nI use AMD64 manual volume 3 to check instructions\nVersion of objdump is <pre><code>GNU objdump (GNU Binutils for Debian) 2.26.1</code></pre>\nHere is readelf output of binary\n<pre><code>ELF Header\nMagic:   7f 45 4c 46 01 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \nClass:                             ELF32\nData:                              2's complement, little endian\nVersion:                           1 (current)\nOS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V\nABI Version:                       0\nType:                              EXEC (Executable file)\nMachine:                           Intel 80386\nVersion:                           0x1\nEntry point address:               0x80482c0\nStart of program headers:          52 (bytes into file)\nStart of section headers:          3744 (bytes into file)\nFlags:                             0x0\nSize of this header:               52 (bytes)\nSize of program headers:           32 (bytes)\nNumber of program headers:         8\nSize of section headers:           40 (bytes)\nNumber of section headers:         31\nSection header string table index: 28\n</code></pre>\n",

The \"FLD m64fp\" instruction reads 8 bytes from the input address (<pre><code>0x8084060 + eax*8</code></pre> in this case), interprets it as a floating point number (a <pre><code>double</code></pre>), and then pushes it to the FPU register stack.\nIn this case <pre><code>0x8084060</code></pre> is likely an address to a global array of <pre><code>double</code></pre> and <pre><code>eax</code></pre> is an index to fetch a value out of the array.\n",

I know that DD means it's an x87 instruction and i use ModRM byte(04) to find it's <code>fld</code> and i think somehow c5 means <code>eax*8</code>. But i cannot find what is that C5 byte or which table i should look to find its values.</span>",

            "content": "So this answer only focuses on the second question of @Efe:\nHow is <pre><code>+eax*8</code></pre> constructed.\nYou can determine the SIB-offsets with the following steps. We analyze the first two bytes <pre><code>04 c5</code></pre> of the whole instruction:\n<pre><code>dd 04 c5 60 40 08 08\n</code></pre>\nFirst, we only focus on the MOD-REG-R/M Byte (look here for details)\n<pre><code>MOD-REG-R/M Byte = 04\n--------------------------------------------------\n04   0000 0100\nMOD  00          Meaning: SIB with no displacement\nREG  000         Meaning: eax (32-Bit)\nR/M  100         Meaning: SIB with no displacement\n</code></pre>\nSecond, we analyze the SIB Byte of the instruction (look here for details). Scaled indexed addressing mode uses the second byte (namely, SIB byte) that follows the MOD-REG-R/M.\n<pre><code>SIB Byte = C5\n--------------------------------------------------\nc5    1100 0101\nScale 11    Meaning: Index*8\nIndex 000   Meaning: eax register\nBase  101   Meaning: Displacement only\n</code></pre>\nThe combination of MOD and Base lead to (look here for details)\n<pre><code>MOD = 00 and BASE field = 101:\n--------------------------------------------------\ndisp + eax*n\n</code></pre>\n",
