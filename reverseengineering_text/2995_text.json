    "content": "Some days ago I coded a simple code to test a buffer overflow exploitation on x86 system. In order to keep it simple I disabled ASLR and NX so there are no protection that could cause weird behaviours.\nThis is my C code to exploit:\n<pre><code>#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid read_txt(){\n        char txt[64];\n        printf(\"Write something:\");\n        gets(txt);\n}\n\n\nint main(){\n    read_txt();\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\nI also wrote my own shellcode that just prints a string. As far as I know the payload should be something like this, fill the buffer with NOP instructions + shellcode, add 0x41414141 (AAAA) to overwrite EBP register and finally I override the return address with an address pointing to the middle of the NOPs.\nActually it does not work in that way and my payload is as follows:\n<pre><code>[1-\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x31\\xc0\\x31\\xdb\\x31\\xc9\\x31\\xd2\\xb0\\x04\\xb3\\x01\\x68\\x20\\x3b\\x29\\x20\\x68\\x68\\x73\\x65\\x63\\x68\\x20\\x48\\x69\\x67\\x68\\x48\\x6f\\x6c\\x61\\x89\\xe1\\xb2\\x0f\\xcd\\x80\\xb0\\x01\\x31\\xdb][2-\\x41\\x41\\x41\\x41][3-\\x89\\xf4\\xff\\xbf][4-\\x89\\xf4\\xff\\xbf]\n\n1- NOPs + Shellcode = 60bytes\n2- AAAA =4 bytes (Padding to fill the buffer, if NOP+Shellcode fills 64bytes it does not work)\n3- Address to override EBP (In the middle of NOPs)\n4- Overrides Return Address\n</code></pre>\nThis exploit works on gdb but fails if I pass the payload directly to the program, and I think that the problem is that just before the program executes gets() function the disasembler shows the leave instruction which points esp to ebp and causes an error.\nThis is the disassembly of read_txt() function:\n<pre><code>0x0804844c <+0>:    push   %ebp\n   0x0804844d <+1>: mov    %esp,%ebp\n   0x0804844f <+3>: sub    $0x44,%esp\n   0x08048452 <+6>: movl   $0x8048510,(%esp)\n   0x08048459 <+13>:    call   0x8048320 <printf@plt>\n   0x0804845e <+18>:    lea    -0x40(%ebp),%eax\n   0x08048461 <+21>:    mov    %eax,(%esp)\n   0x08048464 <+24>:    call   0x8048330 <gets@plt>\n   0x08048469 <+29>:    leave  \n   0x0804846a <+30>:    ret    \n</code></pre>\nAnd this is the execution of the exploit on GDB:\n<pre><code>(gdb) x/20x $esp\n0xbffff47c: 0xbffff480  0x90909090  0x90909090  0x90909090\n0xbffff48c: 0x90909090  0xc0319090  0xc931db31  0x04b0d231\n0xbffff49c: 0x206801b3  0x6820293b  0x63657368  0x69482068\n0xbffff4ac: 0x6f486867  0xe189616c  0x80cd0fb2  0xdb3101b0\n0xbffff4bc: 0x41414141  0xbffff489  0xbffff489  0xbffff500\n(gdb) s\nWarning:\nCannot insert breakpoint 0.\nError accessing memory address 0x90909090: I/O Error.\n\n0xbffff489 in ?? ()\n(gdb) c\nContinuing.\nShellcode Executed\nProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n0xbffff4b9 in ?? ()\n(gdb) \n</code></pre>\nNotice that EBP points to 0x90909090 because it has the same address that overrides the return address, and also notice the string Shellcode Executed that is the shellcode included in the payload.\nMy question is, where could I point EBP to avoid this problem before pointing the return address to the NOP slide? Also as secondary question why I can't fill the 64bytes buffer with NOPs+Shellcode?\nRegards.\n",

You can read: How to predict address space layout differences between real and gdb-controlled executions?\nIn your case, you may just have to adjust your address by adding/subtracting 96 bytes.\nI can, also, give you a few tricks with <pre><code>gdb</code></pre> to help you a bit with this:\n\n<pre><code>info frame</code></pre>: This command gives you a full image of the frame you are in. Including where are stored the saved eip ans the saved ebp. It is extremely useful to observe if you reach the right spot in the memory to modify. You may set a breakpoint on <pre><code>read_txt</code></pre> and display the content of the saved eip before and after the <pre><code>gets()</code></pre> is called in order to see if the modification occurred properly.\nWhen hitting a:\n<pre><code>0xbffff489 in ?? ()\n</code></pre>\nIt basically means that <pre><code>gdb</code></pre> did not find any symbol linked to the memory location. But, it might be assembly code, especially if it is your shellcode. So, to disassemble it you can use either of these commands:\n\n<pre><code>disas 0xbffff489,+40</code></pre>\n<pre><code>x /10i 0xbffff489</code></pre>\n\n\nHope this help.\n",
