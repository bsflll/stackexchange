    "content": "A PIE binary, when loaded in IDA shows an offset (<pre><code>0x202010</code></pre>) different from gdb (<pre><code>0x2013a1</code></pre>) for instruction located at <pre><code>0x555555554c68</code></pre> in (gdb) and <pre><code>0xc68</code></pre> (in IDA). How can I explain this discrepancy?\n",

            "content": "For \"Position Independent Executable\" binaries, the loader is free to relocate the binary using some base address. In the case of GDB, the binary is mapped already into memory, the offset <pre><code>0x2013a1</code></pre> in the memory operand is calculated relatively with the current <pre><code>RIP</code></pre> (which is the address of the next instruction). The current instruction size is <pre><code>0x6f - 0x68 = 0x7</code></pre> bytes, so in considering with the address of the current instruction, we have an offset: \n<pre><code>0x2013a1 + 0x7 = 0x2013a8\n</code></pre>\nIn the case of <pre><code>IDA</code></pre>, you see the \"static\" virtual address, the offset <pre><code>0x202010</code></pre> in the memory operand is calculated relatively with the base address of the code segment, so in considering with the address of the current instruction, we have an offset: \n<pre><code>0x202010 - 0xc68 = 0x2013a8\n</code></pre>\nThese values are coherent for both cases.\n",
