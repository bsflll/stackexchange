    "content": "I would like to analyze the authentication function of a given GWT web application. When authenticating with my credentials, I could identify that my credentials are sent via websocket in form of a binary blob. This most certainly is a serialized GWT object. The authentication seems to follow a protocol that involves 3-4 messages exchanged with the server-side.\nHence, I strive to understand how the client-side transforms my textual credentials (username / password) into this binary blob. Subsequently, I would like to understand how I can deserialize messages coming from the server in order to get a better idea of the messages exchanged and hence the protocol.\n",
