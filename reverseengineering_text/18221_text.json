    "content": "i am trying to use gdb to analyse a c program but i am a little confused.\n\nin the above picture you can see  i am trying to analyse the stack . On the left we have memory addresses.Since i am using a 64 bit machine ,shouldn't ever memory address have 64 bits?but in the picture every memory location has 32 bits . Also the stack starts at 0x28fed0 and the second address is 0x28fee0 ,where are the address between these.I mean where is 0x28fed1?\nI studied architecture many years ago and i seem to be missing something basic.\nCan any one help me out?\nthanks\n",

            "content": "The stack is not intrinsically 64-bit, it's just a memory area which can contains anything.\nYou specifically asked gdb to dump the memory in 32-bit quantities:\n<pre><code>x/32xw</code></pre> \n32 is the count (you can see that you've got 8 lines of 4 columns), <pre><code>x</code></pre> is output format (hexadecimal), and <pre><code>w</code></pre> is the item size (\"word\" - a 32-bit integer).\nIf you want to view memory as an array of 64-bit items, replace <pre><code>w</code></pre> by <pre><code>g</code></pre> (\"giant word\" or a 64-bit integer). To see individual bytes, use <pre><code>b</code></pre>.\nAs for addressing, each 32-bit item occupies four 8-bit bytes, so a row of four of them adds up to <pre><code>4*4=16</code></pre>, or <pre><code>0x10</code></pre> bytes, that's why the next line starts at <pre><code>0x28fee0</code></pre>. The byte at address <pre><code>0x28fed1</code></pre> is present inside the 32-bit word at 0x28fed0. Try dumping memory in different formats to get the feel for the data layout. Read up on little endian.\n",
