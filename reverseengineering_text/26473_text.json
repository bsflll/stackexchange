    "content": "I am reversing a binary using Ghidra. In the disassembled output, I have the following lines in the main function:\n<pre><code>(code *)mmap((void *)0x0,0x55,7,0x22,-1,0)\n</code></pre>\nI am quite confused here since the file descriptor appears to be -1 and I remember reading that file descriptors should be non-negative.\nCan someone please tell me what I am missing here?\n",

The fd argument is ignored; however,\nsome implementations require fd to be -1 if MAP_ANONYMOUS (or\nMAP_ANON) is specified, and portable applications should\nensure this.  The offset argument should be zero.  The use of\nMAP_ANONYMOUS in conjunction with MAP_SHARED is supported on\nLinux only since kernel 2.4.\n\nWhile this seems like a likely explanation, it isn't a 100% guarantee on its own. You could find further proof by looking at the headers for the system you're REing to confirm that <pre><code>MAP_ANONYMOUS</code></pre> is indeed being used as part of the flags.\n",
