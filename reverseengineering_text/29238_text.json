    "content": "My goal is to run and debug ELF file (c444) which is compiled for the ARM architecture. I have some experience with x32 and x64 Intel architectures. However, I down know how to proceed with ARM-based architecture.\nFile general information is extracted below from tools <pre><code>file</code></pre> and <pre><code>readelf</code></pre>. It looks that the file is compiled for ARM architecture: ARMV5TE and ARM core: arm1022e.\n<pre><code>c444: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /system/bin/linker, stripped\n\n</code></pre>\nArchitecture specific information\n<pre><code>kali@kali:~/Downloads/samolan$ readelf -A c444 \nAttribute Section: aeabi\nFile Attributes\n  Tag_CPU_name: \"arm1022e\"\n  Tag_CPU_arch: v5TE\n  Tag_ARM_ISA_use: Yes\n  Tag_THUMB_ISA_use: Thumb-1\n  Tag_FP_arch: VFPv2\n  Tag_ABI_PCS_GOT_use: GOT-indirect\n  Tag_ABI_PCS_wchar_t: 4\n  Tag_ABI_FP_denormal: Needed\n  Tag_ABI_FP_exceptions: Needed\n  Tag_ABI_FP_number_model: IEEE 754\n  Tag_ABI_align_needed: 8-byte\n  Tag_ABI_enum_size: int\n  Tag_ABI_optimization_goals: Aggressive Speed\n  Tag_ABI_FP_16bit_format: IEEE 754\n</code></pre>\nHeaders\n<pre><code>ELF Header:\n  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 01 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \n  Class:                             ELF32\n  Data:                              2's complement, little endian\n  Version:                           1 (current)\n  OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V\n  ABI Version:                       0\n  Type:                              DYN (Shared object file)\n  Machine:                           ARM\n  Version:                           0x1\n  Entry point address:               0x470\n  Start of program headers:          52 (bytes into file)\n  Start of section headers:          4480 (bytes into file)\n  Flags:                             0x5000200, Version5 EABI, soft-float ABI\n  Size of this header:               52 (bytes)\n  Size of program headers:           32 (bytes)\n  Number of program headers:         8\n  Size of section headers:           40 (bytes)\n  Number of section headers:         24\n  Section header string table index: 23\n\n\n</code></pre>\nFrom Wiki I can see that there are many different variations of ARM architectures and one of them is ARMV5TE. I found that QEMU can emulate different AMR architectures. Hence I have tried to create a virtual ARM machine following this tutorial (tutorial).\nBasically, I downloaded 3 files from here and run the command in the directory with downloaded files.\n<pre><code>qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -kernel vmlinuz-2.6.32-5-versatile -initrd initrd.img-2.6.32-5-versatile -hda debian_squeeze_armel_standard.qcow2 -append \"root=/dev/sda1\" -redir tcp:2222::22\n</code></pre>\nIn the created virtual machine I have run <pre><code>uname -a</code></pre> and got information that architecture can be something write (<pre><code>armv5tejl</code></pre>):\n<pre><code>root@debian-armel:~# uname -a\nLinux debian-armel 2.6.32-5-versatile #1 Wed Sep 25 00:01:55 UTC 2013 armv5tejl GNU/Linux\n\n</code></pre>\nWhen VM started I connected to it with ssh and copied c444 file to the machine, changed the permissions <pre><code>chmod 777 ./c444</code></pre>, and run the command <pre><code>./c444</code></pre> but got an error.\n<pre><code>root@debian-armel:/home/user# ./c444 \n-bash: ./c444: No such file or directory\n</code></pre>\nThe questions\n\nThe question is am I creating the correct environment to run this file?\nWhat could be a reason to get the error <pre><code>-bash: ./c444: No such file or directory</code></pre>.\nMaybe you could point to the direction of what images, kernels, etc. are necessary to build a system where I could run this file.\nDoes somebody know what is the difference between QEMU machines and architecture?\n",
