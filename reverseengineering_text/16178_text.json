    "content": "I'm trying to analyze a MS-DOS COM file that I wrote a few years ago with IDA Free 5.0, I've since renamed the segment to <pre><code>code_and_data</code></pre> and named constants and set data types correctly. However, when looking at the disassembly, I get <pre><code>db</code></pre> pseudo-instructions in the listing, like this:\n\ncode_and_data:0106 replacement_irq_handler:                ; DATA XREF: start+81o\ncode_and_data:0106                 cli\ncode_and_data:0107                 push    bx\ncode_and_data:0108                 db      3Eh\ncode_and_data:0108                 cmp     byte ptr ds:3BEh, 'C'\ncode_and_data:010E                 jnz     short call_original_dos_interrupt_handler\ncode_and_data:0110                 db      3Eh\ncode_and_data:0110                 cmp     byte ptr ds:3C0h, 'A'\ncode_and_data:0116                 jnz     short call_original_dos_interrupt_handler\ncode_and_data:0118                 db      3Eh\ncode_and_data:0118                 cmp     byte ptr ds:3C2h, 'K'\ncode_and_data:011E                 jnz     short call_original_dos_interrupt_handler\ncode_and_data:0120                 db      3Eh\ncode_and_data:0120                 cmp     byte ptr ds:3C4h, 'O'\ncode_and_data:0126                 jnz     short call_original_dos_interrupt_handler\ncode_and_data:0128                 db      3Eh\ncode_and_data:0128                 cmp     byte ptr ds:3C6h, 'N'\ncode_and_data:012E                 jnz     short call_original_dos_interrupt_handler\ncode_and_data:0130                 push    StartOfIndexTable\ncode_and_data:0133                 pop     bx\n\nI understand that there are no additional bytes there, since the <pre><code>db</code></pre> and the <pre><code>cmp</code></pre> instruction after it start at the same address (see left column). Why does IDA show/add those <pre><code>db</code></pre> pseudo-instructions?\nIs there any way to tell it to not show those, or is there a reason why it might be useful (I could only guess that since the same segment is both used for code and data, it tries to be \"helpful\" and show the code as data as well)?\nBut if so, why does it only show the first byte of the instruction (if you look at the addresses on the left again, these instructions are longer than 1 byte).\n",

If you assemble the assembler source code as given by IDA using a standard x86 assembler (like <pre><code>MASM</code></pre>), the <pre><code>DS:</code></pre> prefix will be ommitted, because the addressing mode \"immediate address\" is relative to the data segment by default. IDA shows the extra <pre><code>DB</code></pre> instruction to tell you (or an assembler that tries to re-assemble the listing) that the redundant, superflous segment prefix is actually encoded in the binary. If you want to hide that information, check Options -> General -> Analysis -> \"Processor specific analysis options\" -> \"Don't display redundant instruction prefixes\".\n",

            "content": "Edit: Thanks Michael for the clarification, these are not Branch hints, but Segment Prefixes. Keeping the answer for a reference and for people coming from search engines. \n\nThese are \"Branch Hints\" which aim to give the processor a \"hint\" as to whether or not a branch is likely to occur.  \nBranch Prediction \nIt used for optimization that is called Branch Prediction â€” an attempt that is done by the processor to predict which branch the code would take. The CPU is able to keep processing by making an assumptions about the direction of a branch before a condition is resolved. Otherwise, it was \"sitting\" and waiting for the condition the branch is dependent on to be resolved. \nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nIn computer architecture, a branch predictor is a\n  digital circuit that tries to guess which way a branch (e.g. an\n  if-then-else structure) will go before this is known for sure. The\n  purpose of the branch predictor is to improve the flow in the\n  instruction pipeline. Branch predictors play a critical role in\n  achieving high effective performance in many modern pipelined\n  microprocessor architectures such as x86.\n\nBranch Hints \nYou can hint the CPU about the likelihood that a branch would be taken by using hint bytes that are inserted before a conditional jump instruction.\nThis is done by using branch-hint-bytes which are inserted immediately before the conditional jump instruction.  \nThe bytes are <pre><code>3Eh</code></pre> and <pre><code>2Eh</code></pre> and respectively they mean as follows:\n\n<pre><code>2Eh</code></pre> - hint that the branch will not occur most of the time.\n<pre><code>3Eh</code></pre> - hint that the branch will occur most of the time.  \n\nMore Information: \nYou can read more about branch hints and optimisation here (recommended) and here.\nIf you want to read more about Branch Prediction I recommend this article about Dynamic Branch Prediction.\n",
