    "content": "My router has the following pin layout between flash memory and MCU:\n\nThe big chip is the MCU from a Sercomm H300s router.\nWhat I want is to analyze the signaling between 2 chips using the most accessible pins in the MCU. But I also want to avoid soldering.\nHow I can interface the big chip without soldering?\nWould clamps such as these ones or this ones do the job?\nAlso, how I can record any binary data exchanged between MCU and Flash memory chip in my computer, do I need a bus pirate or a logic analyzer?\n",
