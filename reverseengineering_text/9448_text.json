            "content": "In general case there is no difference between array and sequentially placed variables of the same type. The information about arrays and more complicated data types is lost during compilation.\nHowever there are several ways to restore this information from the context (and none of them will work in your specific case because it is too much simple and thus very much optimize-able).\n\nFrom allocations. If something is allocated using malloc or new [] operator it may be an array or class/structure object, and the element size may be revealed by observing the access to this memory.\nFrom access patterns. If you see a loop accessing the memory it may be an array\nBy not accessed gaps in memory, both stack and global (was previously mentioned as \"holes\"). If compiler will not be able to detect and \"unroll\" the access to the array, it will compute the accessed element's offset on the fly and will add this offset to the address of first element of the array. If you'll try to analyze such kind of code and its variable allocation you'll see the \"base\" of the array and some not referenced memory after it which will be accessed as *(base +computed_offset) = something.\n\nRegarding \"hidden instructions\":\nThey are not needed in optimized code. Both of your variants are functionally equivalent. Compiler just computed the needed index during the compilation, \nso nobody hides anything here.\n",

If you see code like  \n<pre><code>mov [ebp - 4], 1\n</code></pre>\nit access the stack. w s's answer tells you how to differentiate between access to single variables or an array.\nNo sane compiler or coder will ever use esp/ebp for anything but the stack, however if you want to be really sure (during runtime) you can get the stack boundaries from the TEB (windows only).  \nAn access to a global variable will always be an access to a fixed memory location.  \n<pre><code>mov     dword_403390, 0Ah\n</code></pre>\nIn this example 403390 is the fixed memory location (whether it is actually fixed or changed due to ASLR/relocations isn't important as this invisible in the disassembly).\nFor further verifiaction you can check wheter that adress lies in the boundaries of the loaded executable or DLL/shared module.\n",
