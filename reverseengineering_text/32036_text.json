    "content": "Im learning about CTREE in IDA. Here is my ida decompiled code:\n<pre><code>v3 = 0;\n  if ( !strcmp(Str1, \"hello\") )\n    v3 = 100;\n  return a1 + v3;\n</code></pre>\nAt this time, i just want to mess arround with CTREE so I look at CTREE in graph for strcmp instruction (highlighted in pic). I notice that i need to remove lnot and replace it with something else.\n\nSo my idea is create a new cexpr_t, use replace_by. But after that, i need to set cif.expr.x and for next block. But when i run the script, i got this error:\n<pre><code>    raise Exception(\"%s is already owned, and cannot be reused\" % v)\nException: <ida_hexrays.cexpr_t; proxy of <Swig Object of type 'cexpr_t *' at 0x0000025277D9D300> > is already owned, and cannot be reused\n</code></pre>\nSo how can i replace the lnot block and still able to go to the call block. Here is my script:\n<pre><code>from ida_hexrays import *\nfrom idaapi import *\n\nclass Ctree_Test(ctree_visitor_t):\n    def __init__(self):\n        ctree_visitor_t.__init__(self, CV_FAST | CV_INSNS)\n\n    def visit_insn(self,i):\n        if i.op != cit_if:\n            return 0\n        \n        cif = i.cif\n        temp = cif.expr.x #get next block\n        # create new expr\n        x = cexpr_t()\n        x.op = cot_bnot # just want to set it to bnot for testing\n        x.ea = cif.expr.ea\n        \n        cif.expr.replace_by(x)\n        cif.expr.x = temp # set next block\n\n        return 0\n\nfunction = get_func(0x401000)\ndecompiled_function = decompile(function)\nse_2 = Ctree_Test()\nse_2.apply_to(decompiled_function.body, None)\nprint(\"Done\")\n</code></pre>\n",
