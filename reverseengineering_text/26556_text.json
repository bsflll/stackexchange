    "content": "For the past few years I've been using an ida color scheme which I created, that was very easy on my eyes with the previous versions of IDA Pro (<7.0). However, after start using version 7.5 I cannot see any option to import colors from <pre><code>.clr</code></pre> files or export the current ones.\nIDA Pro 7.0:\n\nIDA Pro 7.5:\n\nIt seems to be a lot of font options are missing from the new version as well.\nIDA Pro 7.0 Fonts:\n\nIDA Pro 7.5 Fonts:\n\nI don't have a lot of experience with IDA gui. I'd appreciate any help.\nEDIT:\nI fixed the font problem by installing the desired font. However I still cannot figure out how to import <pre><code>.clr</code></pre> files\n",

In order to port older <pre><code>.clr</code></pre> themes to the current format you can use a Python script that Hex-Rays provide here.\ne.g.\n<pre><code>port_clr72_to_css.py -i {theme}.clr > {theme}.css</code></pre>\nto produce a CSS formatted theme which can be placed in the relevant directory of your IDA 7.5 install: <pre><code>$IDA_INSTALL/themes/{theme}/{theme}.css</code></pre>.\nFurther documentation on the new themes can be found on Hex-Rays site.\n",
