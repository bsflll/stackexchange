It is not currently accepting answers.\n                                \n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This question does not appear to be about reverse engineering within the scope defined in the help center.\n\n\nClosed 8 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Improve this question\n                    \n\n\n\nEveryone knows the state of IDA's documentation... There is a bit of info in idc.idc and the SDK headers, there's Chris Eagle's book (which predates quite a few advances in IDA), and there's the occasional juicy tidbit in the blogs of Ilfak, Igorsk, Daniele and the others.\nBut by and large there's mostly Google, reversing IDA.WLL, and copious experimentation. Which means that it's often much slower going than we would like, and quite often things require a lot more effort than necessary because we're unaware of some trick, twist or workaround that somebody else has already discovered. \nThe perfect solution would be a community wiki. So, is there a wiki for all things IDA? \nIf so then all serious spelunkers needs to know about it: it ought to be linked from here, from IDA's home site and major RCE gathering places...\nIf there's no wiki yet then we ought to do something about it (like badgering Ilfak).\n",

And where I can go look to find out what's really going on. E.g. why calling <pre><code>set_idc_getattr</code></pre> with the result of a previous call - or that of a call to <pre><code>get_idc_getattr</code></pre> - will fail and crash IDA when your plugin is unloaded (it's because IDA returns <pre><code>\"\"</code></pre> for an empty method but you have to pass 0 to reset, not <pre><code>\"\"</code></pre> which fails and leaves things as they are)\n",
