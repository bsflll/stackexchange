    "content": "I'm trying to insert some instrumentation into libraries such as <pre><code>System.Windows.Browser.dll</code></pre>.\nI tried to use <pre><code>ildasm</code></pre>+<pre><code>ilasm</code></pre> and Reflexil and both failed - reassembled library causes browser crashes, even when i do not do any changes between disassembling and assembling.\nI've managed to change the runtime using simple hex-editor, and it was successful. but it's so annoying.\nWhat do i do wrong? Why it's impossible to reassemble Silverlight5 runtime  with <pre><code>ildasm</code></pre>/<pre><code>ilasm</code></pre>?\n<pre><code>ildasm.exe /out=System.Windows.Browser.il System.Windows.Browser.dll\nilasm.exe /dll System.Windows.Browser.il\n</code></pre>\nIt works perfectly with .NET runtime and with Silverlight applications but not with Silverlight runtime.\n",
