    "content": "I am reverse engineering how a CPS software package communicates to a radio device. I have the basics down, and want to trick the software into thinking COM1 is the radio, when in reality I want to capture the control flow pin state changes (CTR and RST).\nI am running Windows XP in Qemu and/or Virtual Box with Linux as the base OS. Is there a way for Linux to emulate a software-defined serial port that captures all pin state changes?\nI have tried using <pre><code>socat</code></pre>, specifically with something like this <pre><code>socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0,b9600 pty,raw,echo=0,b9600</code></pre>, but attempts to change the control flow pins on the resulting <pre><code>/dev/pts/X</code></pre> will result in an <pre><code>ioctl</code></pre> error. Also, simple <pre><code>cat /dev/pts/X</code></pre> only shows content sent over the device, not control flow changes.\nHow would I do this? And, how would I pass the resulting device to a Windows VM to make it think it is communicating with <pre><code>COM1</code></pre>?\nThanks!\n",
