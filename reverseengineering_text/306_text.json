I waited but nothing happened (tried in Opera and IE9) so I took a look at the page source.\nNext to the picture's <pre><code><img></code></pre> tag there was a <pre><code><script></code></pre> which included the following URL:\nhttp://imgs.xkcd.com/static/time07.min.js\nI tried to make sense of it, but I can't figure it out. Can someone explain how it works and what was supposed to happen?\n",

The bulk of the script seems to be an implementation of EventSource - which, while important, is not terribly interesting for our purposes, so I've omitted it here. After some Googling around, I am in fact fairly certain that the EventSource implementation used here is https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource - after minifying and beautifying that code, it looks very similar to what shows up in time07.min.js.\n\nAs far as I can tell, it has no magic in it and serves just as a simple way for the server to let the client know when there is a new image.\n",
