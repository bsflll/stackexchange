I observed that the library itself is <pre><code>1.2 MB</code></pre> while the driver executable is of <pre><code>237 KB</code></pre>. This has led me to believe that the linker <pre><code>ld</code></pre> is smart enough to include only the required code from the library, thus eliminating the unnecessary instructions to prevent the executable from being bulky.\nIs there any means to instruct <pre><code>ld</code></pre> to link the entire <pre><code>gmp</code></pre> library (even the unnecessary code) starting at some specified location?\n",
