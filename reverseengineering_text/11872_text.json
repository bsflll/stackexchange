    "content": "Imagine you are working in a kind of crypter that only works with the current function deciphered, rest of the code is ciphered by symmetric encryption. When a new function is about to be called, the current function is enciphered and the following is deciphered and called.\nMy assumption is that a analyst can easily dump the deciphered code (real code) each time a function is called, due to is the unique time where code is leaked/deciphered. Also, an analyst could easily repatch the executable in order to extract the protection, but it would need the symmetric key, once he has it, he just has to remove the encryption/decryption blocks and decipher the code.\nQuestion here is: How can I implement a secure system that accomplish:\n\nKey management without leaking the key, or protecting it from being retrieved. (So the executable isn't patched for removing crypter's protection).\nAvoid dumping per deciphered function. (Thus the analyst wouldn't dump the whole executable's deciphered code just dumping deciphered functions in runtime).\n\nIt would be great to read some advices. Thanks!\n",
