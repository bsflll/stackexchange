    "content": "Dumped the PE using Scylla, analysing without issues, but when I was trying to inspect codes, I see that IDA analysed imports incorrectly.\nIt means that I see for example <pre><code>MapViewOfFile()</code></pre>, which according to pseudo does not what it should do, after jump to this imp in <pre><code>.idata</code></pre> I see what this should be <pre><code>GetModuleHandleW()</code></pre> (Fake + 0x18 = real) and this is valid for all imports, OFC, IDA analysed all wrong + undefined variables causes that.\nNever seen that issue, maybe somebody knows how to fix.\n",
