    "content": "This is a probably a very basic question, please bear with me.\nI'm starting to get into reverse engineering following this pdf I found online: https://beginners.re/\nI am, however, stuck at the very basic steps.\nThe relevant part from the PDF: \nWhen I try to compile my c++ code (which is the same as in the book) with the following command:\n<pre><code>gcc main.cpp -S -O\n</code></pre>\nThis is the output I get:\n2\nWhich, as you can see, is very different, and a lot more complicated than the supposed output written in the pdf. I'm unsure what I'm doing wrong, could anyone help me?\n",

These directives are not instructions.\n",

Also, is there a way to generate a simplified output file similar to the one in the pdf (function names remaining, directives removed etc.), or did the author presumably manually clean up the codes himself?</span>",
