Depending on what you want to accomplish, this is where other analysis (static and/or dynamic) comes into play where you have to find your way to the meaning of everything that's obfuscated (well, everything you're interested in, at least). This is by no means a trivial task necessarily, but it's what you have to start considering in the absence of meaningful symbols/names.\n",

If, when the binaries are compiled, the obfuscation implementation modifies the name itself in every place it's referenced, then that (the mangled name) is what the name will be for you, the reverser. It's as if the developer developed the application using those obfuscated names in the first place.\nDepending on what you want to accomplish, this is where other analysis (static [studying binaries without executing (running) them] and/or dynamic [studying binaries while they're executing]) comes into play where you have to find your way to the meaning of everything that's obfuscated (well, everything you're interested in, at least). This is by no means a trivial task necessarily, but it's what you have to start considering in the absence of meaningful symbols/names (which is quite commonly the case in unmanaged (non-CLR) binaries that lack symbol names).\n",
