Ive watched a couple youtube videos and I am completely stuck.. Can anyone help me?? Would really appreciate it\nWhen I input an incorrect password, I get this prompt.\n\nAlternatively, I have an outdated subscription code, when I enter that code I get this prompt\n\nAfter running the program through x64dbg and going to search for an associated string.. nothing comes up.. Can someone please help me?\nhttps://gyazo.com/0853f4006a130d3922f1966b983c3970\n(A Picture incase it is too small in the gif) ->\n",

Are you sure the strings are available at the time?\nI would recommend making a deadlisting, using whatever disassembler you're comfortable with, and having a look for the strings and xrefs to them. You tend to get a very narrow view of the logic in a debugger, and you need the wide one for this.\nEdit: x64dbg apparently only searches the module currently shown in the disassembly. Open up the symbols window, clickety-click your friend's module, and try searching again. Or you could set a breakpoint on MessageBox() and see where it's called.\n",
