    "content": "I suddenly noticed that my c file produced by ida pro for some of the ipa files is zero bytes. However, I'm able to decompile other ipa files, but I got some which is not being decompiled properly it seems and hence 0 bytes of c file produced. I would like to put up the ida logs here for reference:\n<pre><code>BinExport 9 (@a0efa77, Mar  8 2016), (c)2004-2011 zynamics GmbH,\n(c)2011-           2016 Google Inc.\n\n  bytes   pages size description\n--------- ----- ---- --------------------------------------------  \n16326656  1993 8192 allocating memory for b-tree...  \n16326656  1993 8192 allocating memory for virtual array...  \n262144      32 8192 allocating memory for name pointers...\n-----------------------------------------------------------------  \n32915456            total memory allocated\n\nLoading processor module /Applications/IDA Pro 6.95/idaq64.app/Contents/MacOS/procs/pc64.imc64 for metapc...OK \n\nAutoanalysis subsystem has been initialized.
