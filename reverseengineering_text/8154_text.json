    "content": "On Linux the strace.so pintool gives a good overview on how system calls are intercepted in PIN. One could monitor the value of <pre><code>EAX</code></pre> to see which system call is being invoked(and mprotect and writes could be intercepted in the fashion).\nHow could we do something similar for Windows? I see that the <pre><code>int 2e</code></pre> interrupt is used to trap into the kernel and that the system calls numbers are given at here. Is <pre><code>NtWriteFile</code></pre> the analogue of <pre><code>write</code></pre>? Also is <pre><code>NtProtectVirtualMemory</code></pre> the analogue of <pre><code>mprotect</code></pre>?\n",

            "content": "Pintools on Windows can also aid you in instrumenting system calls. Also, if its discovered that the cpu supports <pre><code>sysenter</code></pre>/<pre><code>syscall</code></pre>, those are used in place of <pre><code>int 2e</code></pre>. However, this has no bearing on whether or not instrumentation can take place.\nTo answer your second question, yes, <pre><code>NtReadFile</code></pre>, <pre><code>NtWriteFile</code></pre> and <pre><code>NtDeviceIoControlFile</code></pre> are the *nix equivalent of <pre><code>read</code></pre>/<pre><code>write</code></pre>/<pre><code>ioctl</code></pre>.\n",
