    "content": "I've set breakpoints on some Windows kernel functions using WinDBG. When the breakpoints are hit, I can query information about the invoking user-mode process using the <pre><code>!process</code></pre> or <pre><code>!peb</code></pre> commands.\nHow are these commands implemented? How can I find the relevant memory structures and \"manually\" trace back to the user-mode caller when one of my BPs hit?\n",
