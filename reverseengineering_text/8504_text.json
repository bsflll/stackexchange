    "content": "Howdy guys and ghouls,\nI've got a classic b0f, in fact it's the protostar stack5 exercise\nlink to stack5 code\nNow I have the buffer + shellcode running up to overwriting EIP and I need to provide the address to overflow EIP. What's the right way of deducing the return address? I've tried ESP - len(shellcode) but this doesn't seem to work.\nHow do you go about calculating the right return address (the more precise the better)?\nGDB related examples appreciated.\n",

This still leaves you with 32 bytes for the shellcode, which should be plenty. Then, jump to <pre><code>0xbffff848</code></pre> which is 16 bytes into the nops, and shifting them around by a few bytes won't hurt you anymore.\nAt the end, instead of calculating how many bytes between the end of the buffer and the saved <pre><code>EIP</code></pre>, i'd just repeat the buffer address a few times, so you can be sure EIP gets overwritten; you don't really care about whatever else is there.\nSo to sum it up, your input should be\n<pre><code>0x90 (32 times)\nyour shellcode\nas many 0x90's as you need to fill the buffer to 64 bytes\n0x48 0xf8 0xff 0xbf  repeated about 10 times.\n</code></pre>\nRemember to swap the <pre><code>EIP</code></pre> bytes because we're on a little endian machine.\n",
