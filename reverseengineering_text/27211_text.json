            "content": "The simplest approach would be to use code cave:\n\nFind some locations with no (or useless) instructions.\nPut in there your function calls and args.\nAt the end of your calls, place a jump to the instruction executing next after the original call, according to your screenshot, that would be the address 0x41B417.\nOverwrite the address of the original call (0x41B412) with a jump to your code cave (you've got 5 bytes, plenty of space for a good long jump).\n\nAnother approach would be to write a DLL, define the function's prototype, load it and call the function as many times and with any arguments as you want.\n",
