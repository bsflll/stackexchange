    "content": "I'm trying to solve the Sharif CTF 2016 HI2.exe challenge. This challenge requires a specific (impossible to reach) environment (64 processors, 128GB RAM, ...) to display the flag. As the executable is packed with <pre><code>VMProtect</code></pre>, the best alternative seems to hook functions responsible for the environment specification checks, and modify their return values at run time. I'm using OllyDbg with the StrongOD plugin. I have documented all details here: https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/SharifCTF-2016/hi.\nI have achieved the first step (I have modified values of the <pre><code>SYSTEM_INFO</code></pre> structure manipulated by the <pre><code>GetSystemInfo</code></pre> function) but failed to reach my second breakpoint, set on the <pre><code>GlobalMemoryStatusEx</code></pre> function. The program displays the following error message before my 2nd BP is reached: <pre><code>A debugger has been found running on your system</code></pre>.\nI have tried to play with a few options from the StrongOD plugin (HidePEB, KernelMode, SkipSomeExceptions) but it either doesn't change anything or crashes the executable before the 2nd BP.\nHow can I achieve this goal? How should I configure OllyDbg and/or StronOD to prevent the program from knowing it's being debugged?\nMany thanks in advance for your help.\n",
