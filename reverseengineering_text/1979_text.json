            "content": "This is doable in WinDbg, but the syntax isn't the greatest. The other answers are probably better if you're just looking to get a result quickly. That said, here's how you'd do it.\nRegOpenKeyExW is an stdcall function, and it looks like you're on a 32-bit version of Windows, so when you enter the function the first argument will be at <pre><code>ESP+4</code></pre>, the second at <pre><code>ESP+8</code></pre>, etc. The signature for it is:\n<pre><code>LONG WINAPI RegOpenKeyEx(\n  _In_        HKEY hKey,\n  _In_opt_    LPCTSTR lpSubKey,\n  _Reserved_  DWORD ulOptions,\n  _In_        REGSAM samDesired,\n  _Out_       PHKEY phkResult\n);\n</code></pre>\nSo at <pre><code>ESP+8</code></pre> you'll find a pointer to a null-terminated Unicode string (<pre><code>lpSubKey</code></pre>). You can test this out by setting an unconditional breakpoint on RegOpenKeyExW and then using <pre><code>du poi(esp+8)</code></pre> to print the string.\nTo do the next piece – stopping when the value of <pre><code>lpSubKey</code></pre> is equal to some pattern, you can check out MSDN's documentation, which contains an example of doing exactly that. I don't have access to a Windows machine at the moment, but the following should do what you want (adapted from the MSDN example):\n<pre><code>bp advapi32!RegOpenKeyExW \"$$<c:\\\\commands.txt\"\n</code></pre>\nAnd then create <pre><code>c:\\commands.txt</code></pre> with the following contents:\n<pre><code>.if (poi(esp+8) != 0) { as /mu ${/v:SubKey} poi(esp+8) } .else { ad /q ${/v:SubKey} }\n.if ($spat(@\"${SubKey}\", \"Foo*\") == 0)  { gc } .else { .echo SubKey }\n</code></pre>\nYou can replace <pre><code>\"Foo*\"</code></pre> in the above with any valid string wildcard.\nBreaking this down, the first <pre><code>.if</code></pre> sets up an alias named <pre><code>SubKey</code></pre> equal to the contents of the unicode string at <pre><code>esp+8</code></pre>. The second line matches that string against the pattern <pre><code>\"Foo*\"</code></pre>; if it doesn't match, then <pre><code>gc</code></pre> is used to continue execution without stopping. If it does match, <pre><code>.echo SubKey</code></pre> prints out the string, and then breaks.\n",

This way I could implement quite complex human-readable logging scenarios.\nRationale\nThe reason stuff like the nested dictionary exists is so that it can be easily extended to hook whatever function from whatever DLL I please. Of course it could be hardcoded as well, but I have had scenarios where I was hooking dozens of functions.\n",
