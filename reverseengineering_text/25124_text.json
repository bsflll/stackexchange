            "content": "As far as I understand reading your comments - you want to log all the executed instructions in the file. To do this you need to:\n\nPause the program, either via <pre><code>Pause</code></pre> option (F12) or using breakpoints\nSelect <pre><code>Trace</code></pre> menu and then <pre><code>Trace into...</code></pre> (Ctrl+Alt+F7) or <pre><code>Trace over...</code></pre> (Ctrl+Alt+F8). If you want to log every instruction you probably want to use <pre><code>Trace into...</code></pre>\nNow in the newly created window\n\n\nyou can select the <pre><code>Log Text</code></pre> format, you can use the proposed <pre><code>0x{p:cip} {i:cip}</code></pre> which will log the data to file like <pre><code>0x006E8749 mov ebp, esp</code></pre>. It is also good idea to set the <pre><code>Maximum trace count</code></pre> and the <pre><code>Log File...</code></pre> where the data will be stored. After you are done just press <pre><code>OK</code></pre> and the x64dbg will start executing your program and log all the instructions. Keep in mind that the program won't work really fast during the trace procedure.\n",
