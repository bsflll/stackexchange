            "content": "Linux\nAs @Nirlzr correctly mentioned, <pre><code>netstat -ape | grep <proc_name/pid></code></pre> will show you the active connections of a process. It might be just enough for you but there are some cases where it would not. \n<pre><code>netstat</code></pre> has some blind spots -- it only shows connections at a certain point in time. Therefore, connections which closed quickly and every connection which was closed before or started after the execution of <pre><code>netstat</code></pre> will obviously not be shown.  \nA solution for this is to use <pre><code>strace</code></pre> which can help you monitor the connections which created by a process.\nTo start a process and monitor its connections:\n<pre><code>strace -f -e trace=network -s 10000 <process [arg1] [arg2] [...]></code></pre>\nTo monitor an already existing process:\n<pre><code>strace -p <pid> -f -e trace=network -s 10000</code></pre>\nif you don't know its PID use <pre><code>pidof <processname></code></pre>\nThen use some <pre><code>grep</code></pre> magic to print only the IP addresses:\n<pre><code>strace -f -e trace=network <process [args...]> 2>&1 | grep -oP 'connect.*inet_addr\\(\"\\K[^\"]+'</code></pre> \n\nWindows\nIn windows you also can use <pre><code>netstat</code></pre> or the improved version of it <pre><code>Get-NetTCPConnection</code></pre> via <pre><code>powershell</code></pre>. But both have the blind spot aforementioned.  \nTwo recommended solutions for it are:  \n\nNetwork Monitor by Microsoft\nTcpLogView by Nirsoft\n\nBoth have the ability to monitor connections as they open and a nice GUI to show it.\n",

This often includes IP addresses and ports used for existing connections. If you want to list existing connections and their owning processes on linux, running the <pre><code>netstat</code></pre> command.\nBy providing it some command line arguments you can get the desired information, consulting man pages is always recommended but for your specific case running <pre><code>netstat -ape</code></pre> to list all connections with their pid and username.\n",
