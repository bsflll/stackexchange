    "content": "This is similar in nature to this question and this question; I'm interested in what compiler settings to enabled/disable to make a Visual C++ harder to reverse engineer.\nHere's a few compiler flags I've already got which I believe should be set:\n<pre><code>/Ox</code></pre> Full optimization. This appears to be the equivalent of gcc's -O3\n<pre><code>/Oy</code></pre> Omit frame pointers. (x86 only)\n<pre><code>/GR-</code></pre> Disable Run Time Type Information\n<pre><code>/MT</code></pre> flag is used to static link the various libraries.\nVisibility - I don't think  the MSVC compiler has any options to turn off visibility like <pre><code>-fvisibility=hidden</code></pre> offered in gcc, but is this necessary for MSVC since the debugging symbols are stored in the PDB file?\nAre there any other things I should include to ensure minimal information is distrubuted in the application?\n(I might add that I am creating a standalone executable)\n",
