    "content": "I am self learning reverse engineering and working on reversing a firmware image for an unknown ioT device that's running on Zephyr. I have the firmware image (.img file), which returns 'Linux kernel ARM64 boot executable Image' when running the file command. I've tried running binwalk to extract anything meaningful, but all I get is the Linux kernel ARM64 image and text. My question is, is it even possible to boot this image and how can I go about this?\n",
