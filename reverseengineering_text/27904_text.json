            "content": "<pre><code>LEA</code></pre> means \"Load Effective Address\", i.e. instead of loading into the EAX register the content at the address ESP+8, it loads directly the address, i.e. the content of the register ESP increased by 8.\nFor illustration, if in the ESP register (Extended Stack Pointer) is the value 1000, the situation may be as this:\n\nThen your instruction <pre><code>LEA EAX, [ESP+8]</code></pre> loads into the EAX register the number 1008 — the address of the 3rd value in the stack.\nIn other words, the EAX will contain the address (a pointer) to the value 531.\nCompare:\nIf you replace the <pre><code>LEA</code></pre> instruction with the <pre><code>MOV</code></pre> one:\n<pre><code>LEA EAX, [ESP+8]    ; original (LEA): EAX = 1008\nMOV EAX, [ESP+8]    ; replaced (MOV): EAX =  531\n</code></pre>\nthen the EAX register will be loaded with the value in the stack, i.e. 531.\n\nNotes:\n\nWhy a pointer into stack?\nBecause arguments of functions are generally put into the stack.\nSo in your code you probably obtained a pointer to the particular (2nd ?) argument.\n\nWhat the part <pre><code>EAX => local_18</code></pre> means?\nGhidra's decompiler (to C language) doesn't know the original instructions (and variable names), so it creates names as your <pre><code>local_18</code></pre>.\nIn the listing (disassembly) <pre><code>EAX => local_18</code></pre> means something as:\n\n“In this location, your variable <pre><code>local_18</code></pre> is used in the form of the  EAX register”.\n\n(This variable is not in the memory — its value is directly in the EAX register.)\n",
