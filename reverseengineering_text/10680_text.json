It was handy for strategy games like Age of Empires - allowing for easy left hand to control of scrolling, panning, zooming and using a variety of programmable hotkeys.  Today it's a useless/unsupported/forgotten item that sits in a drawer in my office.  I would like to use the device to help navigate in a 3D CAD environment like Blender or 3D Studio Max.  On Windows 7 & 8.\nIs there any existing research/work available in this area?\nIs there an open source driver framework?\nDoes anyone know Microsoft's official stance on 'hacking' this old hardware?\nHow should I get started?\nThanks!\n",
