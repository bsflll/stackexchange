    "content": "How can I extract a code listing from a Ghidra project such that I can reassemble with something like vasm? I have gone through a memory snapshot and disassembled the code and marked data sections etc. to a point where I would like to check my work.\nFurther to the question and answer in Extracting Assembly line code from an executable in Ghidra I would like to extract line labels, plate comments and EOL comments.\nHere is an example:\n\nHere's what I'd like the extracted code to look like:\n<pre><code>; Extracted data blocks\nSTATUS_STRING_BUFFER:\n        dc.b 0\n        dc.b 0\n        dc.b 0\n        dc.b 0\n; etc\nCURRENT_STATUS_MESSAGE_CODE:\n        dc.b 0\n\n; Extracted subroutine\n**************************************************************\n* Display a message in the status bar                        *\n**************************************************************\nDisplayStatusMessage:\n        movem.l {a2, a1, d5},-(sp)\n        lea STATUS_STRING_BUFFER, a1\n        clr.w d0\n        move.b (a0)+,d0\n        move.b d0,CURRENT_STATUS_MESSAGE_CODE    ; Store Message byte\n        andi.b #$7f                              ; Mask out msb\n        ; ... etc\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see there are a number of things to do including:\n\nExtract data blocks\nConvert <pre><code>db</code></pre>, <pre><code>dw</code></pre>, <pre><code>ddw</code></pre> to <pre><code>dc.b</code></pre>, <pre><code>dc.w</code></pre>, <pre><code>dc.l</code></pre>\nConvert hex from <pre><code>0xNN</code></pre> to <pre><code>$NN</code></pre> notation\nExtract plate comments\nExtract labels\nExtract disassembled code lines\nExtract EOL comments\n\nIs there a readily available script for this or can someone show a working example?\n",
