When an app crashed it usually prints errors on <pre><code>adb logcat</code></pre> look at it to understand what is going wrong. Also check the code for code that checks the app signature and integrity. May be the crash is performed intentionally because the signature is wrong? Jadx decompile errors are common, that is nothing unusual some byte code is extremely difficult to recompile to Java language.\n",
