    "content": "I used the <pre><code>file</code></pre> command in Linux to get information about a binary file. I am also looking for the addresses that these calls are located at. I think I can get this information from GDB or <pre><code>objdump</code></pre> but I am not very good with Linux commands and programs yet so any help is much appreciated. The output from the file command is below:\n<pre><code>ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=0x6d232dd468b2344847a4b9c81eb064ffe257d5d0, stripped\n</code></pre>\nThen using the <pre><code>strings</code></pre> command I got this output (I see several C function calls but which are external ?):\n<pre><code>/lib/ld-linux.so.2\n-#mH4\n__gmon_start__\nlibc.so.6\n_IO_stdin_used\nexit\nstrncmp\nstrncpy\nputs\nprintf\nmalloc\natoi\n__libc_start_main\nGLIBC_2.0\nPTRh\nQVh>\nUWVS\n[^_]\ntesting\nstrncmp: %s;\natoi\nComplete\n;*2$\"\n</code></pre>\n",

Undefined symbols (indicated by a <pre><code>U</code></pre>) will be resolved externally (by the <pre><code>libc</code></pre> or whatever), and <pre><code>T</code></pre> (or <pre><code>t</code></pre>) symbols are locally defined. Lowercase indicates a local symbol, uppercase a global symbol.\nOf course, this assumes there's a symbol table present. In your example, it's been stripped.\nIn that case, you can do <pre><code>objdump -T</code></pre> file to list the external references.\n",

You can either use the <pre><code>nm</code></pre> command with the <pre><code>-D</code></pre> switch (or <pre><code>--dynamic</code></pre>), or use <pre><code>objdump</code></pre> with the <pre><code>-T</code></pre> switch. Both commands will output the dynamic symbol table entries and the libraries they originate from.\n",
