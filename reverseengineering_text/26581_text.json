    "content": "This is the section of disassembled code in question. It’s from a Linux kernel module compiled for 4.4.16 on ARMv7.\n<pre><code>  ; Registers used:\n  ;  - r3 :  unsigned long argp\n\n0000005c         mov        r1, sp\n00000060         bic        r2, r1, #0x1fc0\n00000064         bic        r2, r2, #0x3f\n00000068         ldr        r4, [r2, #0x8]\n0000006c         adds       r1, r3, #0x1\n00000070         sbcslo     r1, r1, r4\n00000074         movlo      r4, #0x0\n00000078         cmp        r4, #0x0\n0000007c         bne        loc_dc\n</code></pre>\nThe stack at this point looks like this:\n<pre><code>00  <- SP\n04  [padding]\n07  u8 arg_kernel\n08  pushed[r4]\n0c  pushed[r5]\n10  pushed[r6]\n14  pushed[lr]\n18  <Previous SP>\n</code></pre>\nHere’s how I decoded this assembly into pseudo-C:\n<pre><code>r4 = *(SP & 0xe000 + 8);\nr1 = argp + 1;\n\nif (r1 overflowed) {\n    r1 -= r4;\n    r4 = 0;\n}\n\nif (r4 == 0) {\n  /* jump */\n}\n</code></pre>\nIf I got this right, I don’t really understand the purpose of this code. If I made a mistake, I really don’t understand it. Can anyone offer any insight into the purpose of these operations?\n",
