    "content": "I have bumped into a compression format which <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre> doesn't seem able to identify. It is used in at least ZyXEL P-724 firmware images. Running <pre><code>file</code></pre> doesn't show anything.\nComparing the files I have, I found there seems to be a fixed-size header of around 20 bytes (checked with two files drastically different in both size and contents -- namely, <pre><code>HTPCode</code></pre> and <pre><code>RasCode</code></pre>). Poking around <pre><code>BootExt</code></pre> I can see decompression-related string, but nothing that would give away the exact algorithm.\nThe suspected header bytes are (bytes that differ marked out):\n<pre><code>08 00 xx xx 71 A8 1A xx 17 2A 7C 60 xx C2 02 0C 20 83 10 00</code></pre>\nA sample containing the original image, extracted ROM object, and the compressed data itself: https://yadi.sk/d/lBRqhldYjRMPf\n",
