    "content": "Given a SHA256 hash signature generated from a string of length 40 that includes uppercase (A-Z) and lowercase (a-z) alphabetic characters, as well as numeric characters (0-9), what strategies can be employed to fine-tune and optimize the cracking process? Additionally, which cracking tools are recommended for this task?\n",

It should be 256 bit long\n",
