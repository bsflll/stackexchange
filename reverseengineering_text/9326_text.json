    "content": "I need to execute a call to <pre><code>cat</code></pre> on a target file using a buffer overflow in a challenge app (can't execute on the stack, but can use <pre><code>libc</code></pre>). For reference, in <pre><code>C</code></pre> this is valid code for what I'm trying to do:\n<pre><code>int main(void) {\n        char * const argv[] = {\"cat\", \"/etc/target/file\"};\n        char * const envp[] = {NULL};;\n        execve(\"/bin/cat\", argv, envp);\n}\n</code></pre>\nI can load some null-terminated strings up on the target and I've also determined the address of <pre><code>execve</code></pre>. Here's the info I have:\n<pre><code>\"/bin/cat\" @ 0xbfffffb9:\n\"cat\" @ 0xbfffffbe\n\"/etc/target/file\" @ 0xbffff96f\n\nexecve @ 0x804831c\n</code></pre>\nI can overwrite the <pre><code>EIP</code></pre> and following bytes with a string like:\n<pre><code>\"AAAA....AAA\" + EIP + [RETURN ADDR] + ARG1 + ARG2 ....\n</code></pre>\nIn the string above I can replace <pre><code>EIP</code></pre> with the address of <pre><code>execve</code></pre> and jump to the function, but that's where things go sour for me. I've never set up a stack for arrays and couldn't find a google example of using arrays in a classic buffer overflow.\nHow can I set up the stack with array parameters for my function call? What does my stack need to look like in this case?\n",

            "content": "What you're actually doing there is passing pointers to the array, not the array itself. If you look at the declarations:\n<pre><code>    char * const argv[] = {\"cat\", \"/etc/target/file\"};\n    char * const envp[] = {NULL};\n    execve(\"/bin/cat\", argv, envp);\n</code></pre>\n'argv' and 'envp' are pointers to the array.\nTypically, it's easiest to just ROP to execve('command', NULL, NULL) to avoid fancy setup. Why not execve('/bin/bash', NULL, NULL) then cat the file from the spawned shell? \nOtherwise you can finagle some pointers to make it work - pass it pointers to  NULL-pointer terminated arrays of strings that contain your args.\n",
