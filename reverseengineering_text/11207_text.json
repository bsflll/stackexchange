I got problem with <pre><code>r2</code></pre>.\nAs the title states it, many tutorials, articles, videos about <pre><code>r2</code></pre> are just about disassembling programs, and read assembly codes. But, I want debug my programs.\nI search on the web and on GitHub... But did not find anything meaningful (or maybe I did miss it).\nI would like to know if somebody could tell me how to run the debugger in <pre><code>r2</code></pre>.\n",
