    "content": "This program I am analyzing is full of anti-debugging.  It won't even run if most debuggers are loaded before I start the app.\nI tried using IDA to static analyze it, but it was written in a OOP language, and has many calls to pointers inside registers; so I keep getting stuck digging in.\nSo, I'm wondering if it's possible to patch the .exe with code above the calls to record the register values, and maybe the line of the instruction. and then I can see what functions/methods are being called.\nI added a bunch of zero bytes to the end of the .exe, and it ran, so it doesn't seem to have any checksum verification.\nWill this be possible?\n",

Once downloaded you can copy the files and run them without install to a machine without windows store if required. More info is available at Time Travel documentation. These traces once generated you can then step backwards/forwards instruction by instruction or to breakpoints. \n\nFor example I used this command to show the time travel position for all text written to a file I could then click the hyperlink generated to go to exact register/thread/memory state when that text was written to file \n<pre><code>bp kernel32!WriteFile \"!position;.printf \\\"%mu\\\",@rdx;g\"</code></pre>\nTo go forwards use <pre><code>g</code></pre> command, to go backwards <pre><code>g-</code></pre>, to step single instruction forward <pre><code>t</code></pre> and step instruction backwards <pre><code>t-</code></pre>\n\nAlso consider identifying the anti debugging technique used then hide from it, some examples here.\n",

If this does not work, I dump the whole process with <pre><code>SysInternals</code></pre> <pre><code>Process Explorer</code></pre> or <pre><code>WinDbg</code></pre> after suspending the process. The I use <pre><code>Ghidra</code></pre> do analyze the whole dump. I noted that <pre><code>IDA</code></pre> has issues in analyzing those dumps (sometimes peculiar parts are not detected) but you can combine them. This would give you the ability to analyze the code. If the code is self modifying you should use the second approach.\nFor the second case (and as last resort) I use a specially modified VM to remotely debug the application in non invasive mode. The VM is crafted with a custom rootkit that hides the processes you want (in particular, debuggers), this way you can debug the whole system in kernel mode without being detected.\n",
