    "content": "I'm debugging a file with radare2 and when I come to <pre><code>scanf</code></pre> function I want to forward input from a .txt file. In gdb I would do this by typing <pre><code>r < text.txt</code></pre>.\nIs something like that possible in radare2? I've tried <pre><code>dc < text.txt</code></pre> but it seems that it's not working.\n",
