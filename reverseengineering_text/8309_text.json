    "content": "I was debugging a program, and discovered a line of code like so:\n<pre><code>memcpy(stack_variable, attacker_supplied, read_length_from_packet(pPacket));\n</code></pre>\nThe <pre><code>read_length_from_packet</code></pre> returns -1 if the length is bigger than 0x1FF, but seems they forgot to actually check for -1.\nAnd since <pre><code>memcpy</code></pre> takes a <pre><code>size_t</code></pre> (unsigned), the -1 gets converted to 0xFFFFFFFF, and I can massively override the stack, so much it writes on memory it shouldn't, raises an exception, and crashes.\nIs there a way to make an exploit out of this, or it'll just stay in a crash?\n",
