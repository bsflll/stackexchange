    "content": "ELF x64 binary on a remote server communicates via simple socket server in C.\nAfter overflowing the buffer (total buffer is 2000, password buffer is less), overwriting the RIP, filling with NOP sled (512 nops), inserting a reverse bind shellcode on the top of that, finding out a perfect address (without <pre><code>\\x00</code></pre>) in middle of nop sled which after sliding it will execute the shellcode.\n\nRemote server ASLR is off;\n\nBinary compiled without canary and can execute code from stack.\n\nNo info leak AFAIK\n\n\nI understand the many outcomes but if I decide to brute force the remote server to find the NOP-sled address.\nAny good practice for that ?\n",

Maybe restricting searching space to certain stack addresses or leaking addresses someway could help your problem. I don't heard any other intelligent search method for this type of problem.\n",

Look up on this technique called ROP(Return Oriented Programming). Currently you're bruteforcing the RIP, what if there's some code in the binary that will help you jump to your shellcode without bruteforcing and plus no PIE means that address is constant. When your control is getting transferred at <pre><code>ret</code></pre>, look at what other registers contain. You might find code such as <pre><code>call eax</code></pre> in the binary.\n",
