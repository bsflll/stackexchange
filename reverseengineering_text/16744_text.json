    "content": "I am trying to use Frida on a Java application which is obfuscated with ZKM (Zelix KlassMaster).\nWhen I attach to the process, it seems the JVM is not loaded:\n<pre><code>[Local::PID::23585]-> Java.available\n\nfalse\n</code></pre>\nI have the same behavior on Burp which is run by the following command :\n\njava -Djsse.enableSNIExtension=false -jar -Xmx2g burpsuite_free.jar\n\nDoes anyone know why Frida does not detect the JVM?\n",

There's also the pyspresso framework which uses the Java Debug Wire Protocol to debug java applications using a python code base.\nAlso have a look at this answer for more ideas.\n",
