    "content": "I am trying to capture https requests an application performs during runtime without any success yet. Different failing approaches, using mitmproxy / charles proxy and user ca certificates, obtaining smali code in order to bypass x509Certificate checks, installing ca cert as system to avoid certificate pinning, using different xposed applications (outdated, still worth a try), make me wonder what it is that I am missing. It is only possible to capture chrome's https traffic, other applications refuse to load / connect. To be fair, one might ask why I don't figure out myself where requests are built and log all needed information. Personally, I think a working method capturing said traffic saves a lot of time and work. \n<pre><code># virtual methods\n.method public checkClientTrusted([Ljava/security/cert/X509Certificate;Ljava/lang/String;)V\n    .locals 1\nreturn-void #!!\n\niget-object v0, p0, La/a/a/a/e/d/d$a;->a:Ljavax/net/ssl/X509TrustManager;\n\ninvoke-interface {v0, p1, p2}, Ljavax/net/ssl/X509TrustManager;->checkClientTrusted([Ljava/security/cert/X509Certificate;Ljava/lang/String;)V\n\nreturn-void\n.end method\n\n.method public checkServerTrusted([Ljava/security/cert/X509Certificate;Ljava/lang/String;)V\n    .locals 1\n\nreturn-void #!!\n\niget-object v0, p0, La/a/a/a/e/d/d$a;->b:La/a/a/a/e/d/i;\n\ninvoke-interface {v0, p1, p2}, La/a/a/a/e/d/i;->a([Ljava/security/cert/X509Certificate;Ljava/lang/String;)Z\n\nmove-result v0\n\nif-nez v0, :cond_0\n\niget-object v0, p0, La/a/a/a/e/d/d$a;->a:Ljavax/net/ssl/X509TrustManager;\n\n    invoke-interface {v0, p1, p2}, Ljavax/net/ssl/X509TrustManager;->checkServerTrusted([Ljava/security/cert/X509Certificate;Ljava/lang/String;)V\n\n    :cond_0\n    return-void\n.end method\n\n.method public getAcceptedIssuers()[Ljava/security/cert/X509Certificate;\n    .locals 1\n\nreturn-void #!!\n\niget-object v0, p0, La/a/a/a/e/d/d$a;->a:Ljavax/net/ssl/X509TrustManager;\n\ninvoke-interface {v0}, Ljavax/net/ssl/X509TrustManager;->getAcceptedIssuers()[Ljava/security/cert/X509Certificate;\n\nmove-result-object v0\n\nreturn-object v0\n.end method\n</code></pre>\nIf you're successfully capturing traffic (especially https) please let me know your procedure in order to achieve what the question is asking for.\n",
