    "content": "I am trying to figure out how to get the imports of a PE using the PEfile python project (https://github.com/erocarrera/pefile)\nOne thing special about that library is the ordlookup folder.\nIt looks like it is mapping ordinals to specific function names for known dlls.\nI ran PEfile on a .exe I had and I got in the imports: \n<pre><code>\"wsock32.dll\": {\n    \"listen\": \"0x44a560\",\n    \"accept\": \"0x44a564\",\n    \"htons\": \"0x44a568\",\n    \"getsockname\": \"0x44a56c\",\n    \"gethostbyname\": \"0x44a570\",\n    \"gethostname\": \"0x44a574\",\n    \"ntohl\": \"0x44a578\",\n    \"inet_addr\": \"0x44a57c\",\n    \"ntohs\": \"0x44a580\",\n    \"ioctlsocket\": \"0x44a584\",\n    \"recv\": \"0x44a588\",\n    \"send\": \"0x44a58c\",\n    \"recvfrom\": \"0x44a590\",\n    \"sendto\": \"0x44a594\",\n    \"select\": \"0x44a598\",\n    \"connect\": \"0x44a59c\",\n    \"WSACleanup\": \"0x44a5a0\",\n    \"WSAStartup\": \"0x44a5a4\",\n    \"inet_ntoa\": \"0x44a5a8\",\n    \"bind\": \"0x44a5ac\",\n    \"getpeername\": \"0x44a5b0\",\n    \"setsockopt\": \"0x44a5b4\",\n    \"socket\": \"0x44a5b8\",\n    \"WSAGetLastError\": \"0x44a5bc\",\n    \"closesocket\": \"0x44a5c0\"\n  },\n</code></pre>\nThen I removed the line that allows that ordlookup module to work an re-ran PEfile:\n<pre><code>\"wsock32.dll\": {\n    \"null\": \"0x44a5c0\"\n},\n</code></pre>\nWhy do I get two different answer? What are ordinals / what does ordinals do?\n",

BUT not every ordinal is the same for a given function. The function Sleep sor example has different ordinals depending on the OS version, even the architecture of the system (32 bit / 64 bit). Research and check which function you can safely get by ordinals. I'm not a big expert but I hope this helps.\n",
