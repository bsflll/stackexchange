    "content": "So I encountered this bit of assembly code:\n<pre><code>cmp dword ptr [ECX + 0x24c], DAT_007c6bc0\n</code></pre>\nIt's comparing <pre><code>ECX + 0x24c</code></pre> with <pre><code>DAT_007c6bc0</code></pre>. If they are not equal, it will just return from the function.\nI have compared the output of Ghirda and IDA (free) and in IDA it looks like this:\n<pre><code>cmp dword ptr [ecx + 24Ch], offset unk_7C6BC0\n</code></pre>\nNow, what exactly is <pre><code>DAT_007c6bc0</code></pre>? I couldn't really find any information on it, and how does it compare to <pre><code>ECX + 0x24c</code></pre> since it just checks if the address is the same, right?\n",

It's just a pointer comparison (<pre><code>dword ptr</code></pre> means that we treat these numbers as <pre><code>dwords</code></pre> - <pre><code>4</code></pre>bytes each); in pseudo code it could look like this:\n<pre><code>if (*(ECX + 0x24c) != DAT_007c6bc0)\n    return;\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, if <pre><code>d</code></pre> is the data located at <pre><code>DAT_007c6bc0</code></pre> in memory (<pre><code>d = *DAT_007c6bc0</code></pre>), then the code will check whether data at <pre><code>ECX + 0x24c</code></pre> is a pointer to <pre><code>d</code></pre>.\n",
