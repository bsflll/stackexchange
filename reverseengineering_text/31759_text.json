    "content": "I have been having a really strange issue which I have tried all ways to troubleshoot from my end but was not successful.\nI am going through a malware analysis course and following the debugging process of the trainer in the video, when I am trying to debug the same malware on my system, I am not able to hit the same break points as him.\nI am using x32Dbg for debugging.\nThe following are some examples of the issue -\n\n\nThe API CreateProcessInternalW hits for him but never hits for me in any malware sample.\nThe API WriteProcessMemory hits for him but never hits for me in any malware sample.\nOn stepping over VirtualAlloc breakpoint, for him the API is VirtualAllocEx and for me its NtAllocateVirtualMemory\nOn stepping over VirtualProtect breakpoint, for him the API is VirtualProtectEx and for me its zwprotectvirtualmemory\n\n\nThe following are the things I have tried -\n\n\nI have made sure that the tutor and me are running the same operating system (Windows 10)\nI have tried to use both 64bit and 32bit versions of Windows 10\nI have made sure I have the same malware sample as the malware samples are provided by the tutor himself and also I have verified the hash of the malware.\nI have made sure the difference is not being caused by a Anti-Analysis mechanism of the malware\nI have verified the above point by analysing the malware behaviour and found that the malware is being executed the same way as it is for him\nLike for one case for a malware, for the tutor the malware was using the CreateProcessInternalW API to call cmd.exe and drop a file in a directory, for me the API doesn't hit but the file is still dropped.\n\n\nI am not sure what is causing this difference of API calls and trying to fix this issue.\nHelp would be appreciated.\n",
