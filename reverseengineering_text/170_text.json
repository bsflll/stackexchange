            "content": "My answer here is specific to common C/C++ compilers, but the principles behind the answer generalize to other scenarios.\nCompiler differences manifest themselves in many ways, some of them very subtle.  If it was strictly a matter of attributes in the executable header, then we could easily imagine rewriting said header.  However, each compiler has its own unique flavor of generated code (and which varies depending upon the optimization level).  Each compiler has its own default standard library (which often includes telltale strings), and different default boilerplate code at the executable's entrypoint.  There are other differences such as:  optimizations used in one compiler that are not used in another; the default calling convention could differ; the code generated for function prologues is noticeably different on gcc and MSVC (for example); different compilers have different code sequences and data structures for exception handling; and many more examples.  I would say that it is practically impossible to disguise which compiler produced a given executable.\n",

For example, imagine compiling your Windows executable with mingw, but then adding a RICH header to it.  This is a contrived example, but by adding this artifact of the MSVC compiler to the mingw output would probably confuse some automated tools.\n",
