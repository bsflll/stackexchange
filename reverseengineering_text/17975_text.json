    "content": "I'm trying to disable the modification of a byte array in a C++ application. I know where the original array is created and where to find the modified one, but I'm having trouble finding the function responsible for the modification, which also copies the array, presumably on-the-fly.\nThe memory is dynamic, so I can't set a HW breakpoint ahead of time, but I do know the contents of the unmodifed array. Is there an easier way to find the function that creates the modified array than to try and follow the original array through memory or trace it back? (I have attempted this, but somehow I keep missing it...)\nIs there maybe a plugin for OllyDbg that searches through the trace when you point to a memory address that you need to know where it was modified from?\n",

So you can break on wherever the allocation return is and use the command to set a second breakpoint. e.g.: bp <addrOfAllocReturn> \"ba w 4 <eaxOrAllocRet>\".  You can do something similar with conditional breakpoints in Olly\n",

For this you need to enable memory allocation tracing with\n<pre><code>gflags.exe /i yourApplication.exe +ust\n</code></pre>\nThen use windbg and !heap -p -a command on the block address, it will print you the call stack which allocated this memory. So at least you'll have the idea where it was allocated, and you'll be able to put hardware breakpoint at the allocation point.\n",
