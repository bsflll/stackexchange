    "content": "I'm using Ghidra to work out the structure of some binary files. No code.\nI can use the Structure Editor to define a struct, such as the header of the file format.\nBut I can only find a way to create the struct in the context of one of the files and then it will not be visible to the other.\nIs there a way to make it visible to both?\n",
