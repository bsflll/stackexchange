    "content": "I'm playing around with the PE header and the Import Address Table. I wrote a dummy program that calls <pre><code>MessageBoxA</code></pre> with some retard parameters. After successfully replacing the <pre><code>MessageBoxA</code></pre> function address with an address inside a cave with <pre><code>PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE</code></pre> access, I tried running the program. The shellcode is just messing with the pushed arguments and afterwards it's jumping to the original <pre><code>MessageBoxA</code></pre> function address.\nIf the address is <pre><code>75FD0CD0</code></pre> then the Little Endian representation would be <pre><code>D00CFD75</code></pre>, right?\nAfter running it and the program successfully calling the code inside the cave, it would crash. I opened Cheat Engine to compare the values. The instruction that was supposed to jump to the <pre><code>MessageBoxA</code></pre> function was showing a jump to a different function. After opening the edit option, the instruction was: <pre><code>jmp 76552F20</code></pre> instead of <pre><code>jmp 75FD0CD0</code></pre>. I edited that and put the correct address inside and the bytes that were written were <pre><code>80EAA475</code></pre> which was somehow pointing to the <pre><code>MessageBoxA</code></pre> function.\nHow did Cheat Engine get <pre><code>80EAA475</code></pre> from <pre><code>75FD0CD0</code></pre>?\n",
