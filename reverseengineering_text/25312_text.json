    "content": "I'm reversing an anti VMware mechanism which detects <pre><code>VGAuthService.exe</code></pre> and <pre><code>vmtoolsd.exe</code></pre> as well as a few registries that I've taken care of and some drivers from <pre><code>C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\vm...</code></pre>. I deleted <pre><code>C:\\Program Files\\VMware</code></pre> folder and those drivers, killed <pre><code>VGAuthService.exe</code></pre>, <pre><code>vmtoolsd.exe</code></pre> and <pre><code>vm3dservice.exe</code></pre> processes but it's still detected, which means I'm missing something. However, when I uninstall VMware Tools, even without rebooting the machine, it's undetected.\nIs there a tool/or way to find which files VMware Tools installation drops on disk, what it modifies, etc.? I remember there was a tool \"Orca\" which was useful for .MSI files, but it's not in this case.\nMy VM:\n<pre><code>VMware® Workstation 15 Pro\n15.5.5 build-16285975\n</code></pre>\n",

            "content": "First step in understanding installer is identifying what product the installer was created with, then look is there any known extract command lines. Tools such as Universal Extractor 2 can also help do this automatically.\nIn this case if you use a tool such as ProcMon you can see that VMWare's setup.exe extracts an MSI and executes that.\nWe can pass the admin install command line to setup.exe, which is then passed to Windows Installer msiexec.exe which extracts the MSI. This is also documented by VMWare in Extracting the drivers from VMware Tools bundled with VMware Workstation\n<pre><code>setup /A /P C:\\setup\n</code></pre>\nThis will output files into C:\\setup along with the MSI.\nYou can then just browse the folder structure to identify files, or use an MSI editing tool such as ORCA open the MSI to view registry tables and custom actions.\nAlso be aware there is more low level options then simply looking for files/drivers to detect running in VMWare for example as per Mechanisms to determine if software is running in a VMware virtual machine\n\nTesting the CPUID hypervisor present bit Testing the virtual BIOS\nDMI information and the hypervisor port\n\nExample using CPU id:\n<pre><code>int cpuid_check() {\n    unsigned int eax, ebx, ecx, edx;\n    char hyper_vendor_id[13];\n    cpuid(0x1, & eax, & ebx, & ecx, & edx;;\n        if (bit 31 of ecx is set) {\n          cpuid(0x40000000, & eax, & ebx, & ecx, & edx;; memcpy(hyper_vendor_id + 0, & ebx, 4); memcpy(hyper_vendor_id + 4, & ecx, 4); memcpy(hyper_vendor_id + 8, & edx, 4); hyper_vendor_id[12] = '\\0';\n              if (!strcmp(hyper_vendor_id, \"VMwareVMware\")) return 1; // Success - running under VMware         } \n</code></pre>\nUsing DMI information:\n<pre><code>int dmi_check(void) {\n    char string[10];\n    GET_BIOS_SERIAL(string);\n    if (!memcmp(string, \"VMware-\", 7) || !memcmp(string, \"VMW\", 3)) return 1; // DMI contains VMware specific string.         else                 return 0; }\n</code></pre>\n",
