Although I have encrypted texts, <pre><code>ltrace</code></pre> reveals them, for example:\n<pre><code>strstr(\"Name:\\tltrace\n\", \"ltrace\") \n</code></pre>\nA solution would be static linking, but I do not want to statically link everything. Is there a way to select which functions to link statically, or to prevent <pre><code>ltrace</code></pre> from revealing these information?\n",

But this has limited use if your process doesn't have sufficient privileges or if the user renames <pre><code>ltrace</code></pre> or if the user patches out (disables) your <pre><code>ltrace</code></pre>-termination code.\n",
