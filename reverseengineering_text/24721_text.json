    "content": "I'm reversing a program which I assume was compiled with MSVC. It's seeming like the first entry in each vtable is the class' destructor. However, when I look at the disassembly and decompilation, it seems like the destructors all take a second argument, and that the object's memory is only freed if that second argument is nonnull.\nWhat is the purpose for this second argument? I would think that, if it's a destructor, the class should always be destructed and its memory freed. So why the second argument which could prohibit the memory from being freed up?\n",

In such case when memory was not allocated for the object, destructor cannot released that memory. Please take a look at  \"How to delete the memory allocated by placement new ?\" on geeksforgeeks.org/placement-new-operator-cpp there is nice example. It's possible to call destructor directly like this : \"    // No delete : Explicit call to Destructor.      pe->~Complex(); \"\n",

So, then, a call to <pre><code>delete object</code></pre> in the original code might call the destructor with a non-null second argument, while a call to the destructor, say, because the object was on the stack and went out of scope would have a null second argument, and thus not try to deallocate memory which was on the stack.

Its purpose is to make sure that a\n  proper <pre><code>operator delete</code></pre> gets called when destructing a class.\n  Pseudo-code for a deleting destructor looks like following: \n<pre><code>virtual void * A::'scalar deleting destructor'(uint flags)\n{\n  this->~A();\n  if (flags&1) A::operator delete(this);\n};\n</code></pre>\nThe address of this function is placed into the vftable instead of the\n  destructor's address. This way, if another class overrides the virtual\n  destructor, <pre><code>operator delete</code></pre> of that class will be called. Though in\n  real code <pre><code>operator delete</code></pre> gets overriden quite rarely, so usually\n  you see a call to the default delete().\nSometimes compiler can also\n  generate a vector deleting destructor. Its code looks like this: \n<pre><code>virtual void * A::'vector deleting destructor'(uint flags)\n{\n  if (flags&2) //destructing a vector\n  {\n    array = ((int*)this)-1; //array size is stored just before the this pointer\n    count = array[0];\n    'eh vector destructor iterator'(this,sizeof(A),count,A::~A);\n    if (flags&1) A::operator delete(array);\n  }\n  else {\n    this->~A();\n    if (flags&1) A::operator delete(this);\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\nFor more details see also C++: Under the Hood by Jan Gray, one of the main developers of Visual C++.\nI also recommend you to make some classes with custom operators new/delete and check the generated code.\n",
