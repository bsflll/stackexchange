    "content": "I'm trying to find the line number of the <pre><code>0f05 syscall</code></pre> interrupt with no success.\nI searched everywhere and couldn't find any way of doing that, it seems like this information is hard coded in the CPU (which make sense).\nMy goal is to follow the debugger to the kernel code but currently I don't know which function I need to put a break point on.\nWhen I do \"step into\" on the <pre><code>syscall</code></pre> line it simply move to the next instruction like it is <pre><code>mov</code></pre> or something\nThanks\n",
