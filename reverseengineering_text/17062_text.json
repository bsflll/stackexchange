    "content": "Given the sample code below:\n<pre><code>#include <iostream> \n\nstruct Data {\n    int a;\n    int b;\n    int c;\n};\n\nint main() {\n    Data *d = new Data;\n    d->a = 1337;\n    d->b = 1338;\n    d->c = 1339;\n\n    std::cout << d << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\nPrinting out the address of the pointer <pre><code>d</code></pre> is never the same (which seems logical). But the pointer that points to the base of <pre><code>d</code></pre> is also never the same.\nIs there a way to find a static address that is always the same and points to the base of <pre><code>d</code></pre>? Or do I need to do this with a signature scan?\nThe main purpose is to always have a pointer to the base of <pre><code>d</code></pre>, without disassembling it when I restarting the program.\n",
