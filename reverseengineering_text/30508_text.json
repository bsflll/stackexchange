            "content": "As we know there are limitations to using watchpoints: there are a finite amount of watchpoints permitted per architecture (typically 4) and the “watched” size of memory usually caps out at 8 bytes. Therefore, it is important to delete them after they are no longer needed.\nYou can delete a watchpoint in <pre><code>lldb</code></pre> using the <pre><code>watchpoint delete</code></pre> command and passing the watchpoint ID as an argument.\nExample:\n<pre><code>(lldb) watchpoint delete 1\n1 watchpoints deleted.\n</code></pre>\nOr we can use,\n<pre><code>(lldb) w delete 1\n1 watchpoints deleted.\n</code></pre>\nTo delete all watchpoints - simply omit the last argument.\n",
