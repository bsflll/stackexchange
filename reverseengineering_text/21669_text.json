    "content": "I have <pre><code>STM32F303 Nucleo</code></pre> board (Datasheet), and I work with Mbed IDE, which allows me to compile code to the board. The compiled code is in <pre><code>.bin</code></pre> format.\nSome relevant information from the datasheet:\n\nCpu is Arm-v7\nFlash memory starts at <pre><code>0x8000000</code></pre>\nSRam starts at <pre><code>0x20000000</code></pre>\n\nI want to load in IDA the <pre><code>.bin</code></pre> file, and map the <pre><code>ROM</code></pre> and <pre><code>RAM</code></pre> sections according to the memory map.\nI tried many different configurations in the memory organization form, but couldn't find the one that represents the actual memory. The default form as IDA recognizes it:\n\nFrom what I understand, the size of the <pre><code>bin</code></pre> file is <pre><code>0x632c</code></pre>, which includes both the RAM and ROM. Any ideas of how can I make the cut between the two sections? And when I do, what is the right way to fill it in the memory form?\n",
