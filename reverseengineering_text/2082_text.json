However, if you're willing to implement a minimal windbg backend, you could extend uberstealth, which unfortunately I've never come to finish as a project (actually I think anti-debugging is a dead anyway, but that's another story ;-)).\nIt's essentially IDAStealth, but with all debugger specific functionality factored out (there's a backend for IDA and Olly2). All you'd have to do is write a backend for Windbg (and fix the remaining bugs, I could help you with that though), all other code is debugger independent.\nShould be less than a few dozen lines of code.\n",
