But I'm cannot find any resource about how these thermostats are accessible from the Internet and how to connect to these thermostats. Is there any documentation available? If not, how would I find how to interact with the thermostats?\n",

            "content": "Okay, so far your question is a bit meager on the informational side, but it's intriguing. Let me start an attempt to answer it. I'll not be able to answer it, lacking the device in question.\nMethodology\nHere's what I would do.\n\nPose as a WiFi access point (AP). Most WiFi cards will allow you to do this, if the software side allows for it as well. If the existing access point is something like a Linux-based access point, you don't need anything else.\nOnce you are the AP sniff the traffic that goes through the interface using Wireshark, <pre><code>tcpdump</code></pre> or similar tools.\n\n\nFigure out the protocol used\n\n\nif it's a plain text protocol you are only left with decoding the meaning of the sent data\nif it is encrypted\n\n\nsee whether you can use a man-in-the-middle attack to read the data stream\ntry to find out the version of the server software. Usually embedded software is lagging behind a bit, so if you find it is vulnerable, you may be able to get a (<pre><code>root</code></pre>) shell.\ntry to find firmware updates for the device and see whether tools like <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre> and <pre><code>firmware-mod-kit</code></pre> can make sense of them. Being able to unpack the firmware updates will give you a lot of information about the device and what's running on the current version, even if the versions may differ.\n\nif you find out that particular certificates are allowed and they are based based on a weak hash algorithm (MD5) or if it happens to be an SSH key created on Debian while it was vulnerable. In the former case you may be able to forge a certificate and in the latter you will be able to brute-force an otherwise secure SSH connection\n\n\nFailing all of the above and being able (financially) to sacrifice one of the devices, I'd take it apart and try to find whether I can get a serial console or whether JTAG pins/contacts are available. If I was able to find out more about the used chips, I'd give boundary scanning a try.\n\nThe further down you were reading the more hurdles to take and the harder the approach. Now, perhaps you edit more details into your question if this partial answer gets you started.\n",
