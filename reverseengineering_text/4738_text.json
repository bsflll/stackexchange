    "content": "My original point was to build something a bit more powerful and generic than a <pre><code>PTRACE</code></pre> system call for Linux platforms. The problem with <pre><code>PTRACE</code></pre> is that it only run on your own system and architecture.\nAn idea would be to run a virtual machine (or, better, an emulator) with a different operating system and a (possibly) different architecture on it.\nWhile looking for the ideal candidates, I found the QEmu monitor interface and several projects using QEmu as OS/architecture emulator to collect traces:\n\nAvatar\nDECAF (successor of TEMU)\nPANDA\nS2E (seems to be a sub-component of Avatar?)\nTEMU (Bitblaze)\n\nThe features I want are similar to the <pre><code>PTRACE</code></pre> interface (freeze execution, step by step runs, memory and registers read and write, ...) all with several OSes and several architectures. \nMy questions:\n\nDid I forgot some similar projects in my list ?\nCan the QEmu monitor interface provide a system/architecture agnostic <pre><code>PTRACE</code></pre> interface just as I want ? And, if not, what are the main issues I might run into while implementing it inside QEmu ?\n",

            "content": "PANDA developer here. I think that actually most of the things you want are supported by QEMU's native gdbstub. If you start QEMU with the <pre><code>-s -S</code></pre> options, it will listen on port 1234 for incoming connections, and provide the functionality you want, including:\n\nSingle-step using the <pre><code>si</code></pre> command\nRegister get/set using <pre><code>info reg</code></pre> and (for example) <pre><code>set $edi = 0x40c8c39</code></pre>\nReading memory contents with the <pre><code>x</code></pre> command\nModify memory using <pre><code>set *(char *) 0x1a5f2c0 = 0xd9</code></pre>\nBreakpoints using (e.g.) <pre><code>break *0x826e2671</code></pre>\n\nSo using some gdb scripting, I think you should be able to get the capabilities you want with plain gdb and QEMU.\nAll this was just tested using a Windows 7 32-bit VM and gdb using the <pre><code>target remote :1234</code></pre> command.\n",

            "content": "Past TEMU user here.   Perhaps you should attempt to understand TEMU more (which I don't), to prevent duplicating the work already done.   PTRACE only records syscall transitions, but if you go under QEMU, a better granularity is basic blocks.   Not sure if TEMU has the capacity to do that, the idea is the each basic block can uniquely identify part of the path taken, without going into lower level of details at the registers/values level.   ie, less noise, but more refined than syscall.   Knowing the the full state of the registers at each entry and exit point of the basic block, can almost deterministically decide what is the path the entire execution trace will look like, minus all the intermediate registers values, which can be derived if need to.   (\"almost\", because asynchronous event like interrupt can happened).\nUpdate:\nThere is another option:   QEmu + Lttng, but since default Qemu does not provide that feature, you have to download the QEMU source code, and compile it to enable lttn-ust tracing.\nhttp://linuxmogeb.blogspot.sg/2014/08/how-to-trace-qemu-using-lttng-ust.html\n",
