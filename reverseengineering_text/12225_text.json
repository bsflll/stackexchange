    "content": "I'm new to decompiling apps. Most of the apps I decompile aren't very popular, so obfuscation hasn't been a problem yet. I'm not entirely sure what obfuscation looks like. The current app I'm looking into has this, or a similar variant, in all of its layout files.\n\n\u000e\u000eRelativeLayout      ImageView \f\fLinearLayout !!com.graphtech.views.AppsViewPager  € @   ô õ Ô Ä Ð s× &¯ Õ  \u0010       ÿÿÿÿ\u000e   \u000f   \u0010 t      ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ            \u000f      ÿÿÿÿ  \u0010   \u000f      ÿÿÿÿ  1 \u000f       ÿÿÿÿ  \u0010ÿÿÿÿ\u000f      ÿÿÿÿ  \u0010ÿÿÿÿ\u0010 œ      ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ            \u000f      ÿÿÿÿ  \u0010 \n  \u000f       ÿÿÿÿ  \u0010ÿÿÿÿ\u000f      ÿÿÿÿ  \u0010ÿÿÿÿ\u000f      ÿÿÿÿ  \u0010   \u000f      ÿÿÿÿ  ÿÿÿÿ\u000f    \n\nIs this obfuscation or just a problem from the process of decompiling?\nA lot of weird symbols.\nThe app I'm looking into is the \"Else Splay Launcher\". It's the leftovers from an unsuccessful phone ui a company designed some years ago, and it was eventually turned into a launcher for Android.\nSplay Launcher UI Preview\n",
