    "content": "I recently extracted a bunch of raw bytes (from wireshark) into a regular <pre><code>.txt</code></pre> file.  Because these raw bytes are stored in a text file, all those hex-digits are actually written as ASCII characters on the disk.\nNow, I want to interpret the ASCII encoded hex-digits as raw bytes,\nbecause they actually represent a <pre><code>.jpeg</code></pre> image.\nI alredy tried to copy paste the digits into ghex, (I work on Ubuntu) but ghex only allows you to paste data into the interpreted area, not into the byte-manipulation area.\nIs there a simple way to do this?\n",

You can share the data with others, mark it up, examine it in any editor or IDE. Much better than pushing around an actual binary file.\n",
