            "content": "In short:\n\nYes \nCorrect\nYou have to have a specification to know.\n\nThe data directories are a fixed sparse array, and the meaning of each slot is defined by the specification, so (for example) the Export table is always the first entry, it can't move. If you don't have an Export table (but you do have other directories), then the <pre><code>Size</code></pre> and <pre><code>VirtualAddress</code></pre> fields will be zero.\n\nNote that the number of directories is not fixed. Before looking for a specific directory, check the NumberOfRvaAndSizes field in the optional header.\n\nSo if the <pre><code>NumberOfRvaAndSizes</code></pre> member is 2, then you can look at the Export table and the Import table, but nothing else.\nParsers are built against the specification, so if they encounter a PE file with a <pre><code>NumberOfRvaAndSizes</code></pre> value greater than what they know about, then they don't know what the data is or how to interpret it (and no way to find out by inspecting the PE file). Same goes for any Directory that is reserved or otherwise undocumented.\n",
