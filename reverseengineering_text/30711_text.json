    "content": "I am trying to solve an elf CrackMe. I opened it with IDA Pro and I saw start function is on address 0x1E8. I opened the elf with HxD and I saw entry point is 0x1E9 (and no results on file for 01E8)...\nIf I run on Kali terminal:\n<pre><code>readelf --symbols CrackMe\n</code></pre>\nI don't get any result. If I run:\n<pre><code>readelf --sections Crackme\n</code></pre>\nI get over 20 sections.\nIf I try to execute the binary on Kali terminal:\n<pre><code>./CrackMe\n</code></pre>\nI get\n<pre><code>zsh: exec format error.\n</code></pre>\nI changed manually the byte of entry point that is different with HxD, E9 --> E8, but I don't get any different results when I execute all again using the edited file.\nAny ideas? Thank you.\n",
