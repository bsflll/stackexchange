In the current version (6) that file is an <pre><code>sqlite3</code></pre> database. You can find some of the information you're looking for in the tables in that database-- specifically, the <pre><code>functions</code></pre> table contains the number of basic blocks and edges.\nSince you're using IDA, I also recommend you check out ida_haru, it may also export some of the information you're looking for.\n",
