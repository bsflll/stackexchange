    "content": "As a preface, I do not have any experience in reverse engineering. I am an application developer, so this field is way out of my area of expertise. My end goal is to create a web page out of this information but this is the first hurdle I faced: getting the required data in the first place.\nI am currently trying to identify the nature of a file that I have suspicions might be encrypted and/or compressed (I'm still trying to learn the tell-tales of a file being encrypted/compressed). Since this is way above what I can do at the moment, it would be great if someone can help out or at least provide some guidance.\nThis is an example file (do let me know if you'd like some more examples):\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1vwt4G55E-TaGvuWM86L6S-7Sbd2o0gOp/view?usp=sharing\nSo far, here's what I know and attempted:\n\nFile is most likely a JSON or CSV (not 100% sure, but all the other unencrypted metadata files are JSON/CSV format)\nFile has a lot of repeated sets of binary <pre><code>ef</code></pre> <pre><code>bf</code></pre> <pre><code>bd</code></pre>, which I'm assuming are just paddings or an attempt to obfuscate?\nMost of the corresponding hexes do not really translate to a readable set of standard encodings such as UTF-8\n\nAny help/guidance would be appreciated.\n",

            "content": "When given an unknown file there are several things you can do:\n\nIdentify if the file is a binary format (raw bytes) or a text format. Any hex/text editor should be enough for that purpose.\n\nIf the file is Binary - it could have text strings inside, which could help understand the nature of the file.  In your case, no text strings appear in the file.\n\nSome binary files have \"magic values\" - identifiers that help to understand which file format it is. for example - the 4 first bytes in <pre><code>ELF</code></pre> file format will be always <pre><code>.ELF</code></pre>. In your case, the file starts with <pre><code>CE A3 EF BF</code></pre> which doesn't correspond to any known format.\n\nNext step will be to use binary tools like binwalk to identify any compressed/internal files/objects. In this case, it yields nothing.\n\nNext step will be to calculate the entropy of the file. It could be done by <pre><code>binwalk -E <file></code></pre>. in this case, it yields 0.52 - the higher the entropy it, the higher chances the file is encrypted/obfuscated. Here, it looks like the entropy is not high, meaning the file is not encrypted/obfuscated.\n\n\nSo overall it looks like it's just a custom binary file format. In order to continue investigating, you need to understand which program is using the file - and in what purpose, and continue with a reverse engineering process, usually based on static disassembler like <pre><code>IDA PRO</code></pre> or the free <pre><code>Ghidra</code></pre>.\n",

For now I'll try to find where the entrypoint is for reading all these files and update this thread accordingly.</span>",
