The fd and offset arguments are ignored; however,\n  some implementations require fd to be -1 if MAP_ANONYMOUS (or\n  MAP_ANON) is specified, and portable applications should ensure this.\n  The use of MAP_ANONYMOUS in conjunction with MAP_SHARED is only\n  supported on Linux since kernel 2.4.\n\nIt says if <pre><code>MAP_ANONYMOUS</code></pre> is specified then we may use <pre><code>-1</code></pre> as <pre><code>fd</code></pre> which explains your question.\n",
