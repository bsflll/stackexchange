    "content": "I'm not very experienced with graphic or printer formats. My first (and only try yet) was to print a Tux.png with 265 x 314 pixel via the Chromium browser and see what Wireshark shows as USB transfer.\nI turns out that the image became a 1.540.598 byte bulk transfer (noticed because it uses a designated USB endpoint). For this I only measured the payload which divides into 188 packets of 8192 byte and one left packet with 4982 byte.\nThan I tried to look into the first 81920 bytes by concatenating the payloads and read the content as 32 bit integers to see if it contains some repeating patterns which maybe looked like some continuous white or black pixels - but this didn't work.\nSo did anybody already started an attempt to understand the data that is sent to the printer?\nIt would be good to have an open source variant of the driver, because the current driver is an Intel binary and won't work for example on a Raspberry PI, which could be a cheap and current-saving print server.\n\nUpdate 2014-03-10: Forgot to mention that I already found the open source drivers of Brother - but they don't contain the driver for the printer, they only provide the source for the CUPS wrapper. And just to mention it (should make no difference) I own an Brother DCP 135c.\n",

            "content": "The way CUPS works under the hood is it ends up executing a program (the binary driver) that operates on <pre><code>stdin</code></pre>.  This binary must conform to the CUPS backed interface described quite comprehensively: http://www.cups.org/documentation.php/api-filter.html\nEverything else provided by the driver is just scripts and meta-data (well, who knows, but the backend program is the important one.)\nFor example, I happen to have a Brother MFC J415W; the Brother Linux driver installs a bunch of stuff but eventually it ends up running a binary called <pre><code>/opt/brother/Printers/mfcj415w/lpd/brmfcj415wfilter</code></pre>.  \nSo one thing you might be able to do to make your life easier, instead of printing from a web browser, is work out how to run your backend binary directly.  That should be doable by looking in the scripts to see how it gets called with what arguments and environment variables.  \nThat way you might be able to have tighter control over which exact data gets converted for printing. You could also make a custom postscript file to push into that binary, perhaps various test patterns, like all black, all white, squares, etc., so that you may end up seeing patterns in the USB stream easier.\nFWIW I ran <pre><code>strings</code></pre> on my driver and the following was in it: <pre><code>Compressed by Brother Ind.,Ltd.</code></pre> - so I suspect you are seeing a compressed data stream of some kind.  It might be interesting to run something like <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre> over your stream to see whether it is able detect the compression mechanism used...\n",
