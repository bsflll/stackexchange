    "content": "I have been tracing through my binary and converting it to C code so I can understand it easily. As I am going through the instructions and functions, I keep stumbling upon code that don't make sense. \nFor example:\n<pre><code>ROM:080004B8                 CMNNE.W         R4, #1\nROM:080004BC                 BEQ.W           loc_80007DE\n</code></pre>\nThis code will never branch.\nAnother example:\n<pre><code>STRB.W          R0, [SP,#0x18+var_18] @ where var_18 is -0x18\n</code></pre>\nWhich is similar to indexing an array in C like this \"array[5-5]\". Why is this happening? Is this the disassembler? A form of obfuscated code that is trying to frustrate me? A poor compiler?\n",

            "content": "To expand on Rad Lexus' comment, which describes the situation very well but may not be understandable without an example:\nWithin a function, the stack pointer, in most cases, isn't constant. It may change when parameters for a function/method/subroutine are pushed, when the programmer uses things like <pre><code>alloca</code></pre>, and for other reasons as well, depending on the compiler and processor.\nThis makes tracking the position of arguments and local variables quite hard. For example, code like <pre><code>f(i++)</code></pre> may result in something like\n<pre><code>mov r0, [sp, #8]     ; read the variable\nmov [sp], r0          ; put it on the argument stack\nsub sp, sp, #4        ; adjust the stack pointer\nadd r0, r0, #1        ; calculate the ++\nmov [sp, #12], r0    ; write back result\n</code></pre>\nwhich is a version that makes the change to <pre><code>sp</code></pre> visible; normally, that change will be hidden in something like <pre><code>stmfd sp!, {r0}</code></pre>\nIn such cases, it's quite difficult to see that the \"read\" and \"write\" operations access the same address in memory while the <pre><code>sp</code></pre> value has changed.\nThis is why decompilers like IDA assign names to those locations - as an example, let's assume in my example the variable is named <pre><code>var_4</code></pre> with a value of 4.\nNow IDA can emit\n<pre><code>mov r0, [sp, var_4+#4]     ; read the variable\nmov [sp, var_4+#8], r0     ; write back result\n</code></pre>\nwith <pre><code>var_4</code></pre> hinting at \"the same variable\", and the <pre><code>#4</code></pre>/<pre><code>#8</code></pre> at the offset from <pre><code>[sp]</code></pre> that needs to be added to <pre><code>var_4</code></pre> in each of these cases.\n",
