            "content": "Okay, so after looking into this a bit further I came to the following conclusion. This may work for you by picking another processor model supported by the <pre><code>nec850</code></pre> processor module. However, RH850 support in particular was only introduced in IDA 7.2.\n\nLooking further we can see in the Wikipedia article on Renesas we find out why it ended up in the <pre><code>nec850</code></pre> processor module:\n\nHistory\nRenesas Electronics started operation in April 2010, through\n  the integration of NEC Electronics Corporation and Renesas Technology\n  Corporation. NEC Electronics was established in November 2002 by a\n  spin-off of the semiconductor operations of NEC. Renesas Technology\n  was established on April 1, 2003, as a joint venture of Hitachi, Ltd.\n  (55%) and Mitsubishi Electric (45%).\n\nThe name RH850 is actually not used in the IDA SDK 7.0 and 7.1 (this particular processor module comes with source code included as also indicated on the Hex-Rays website).\nAnd in the release information for IDA 7.2 we can read:\n\nThe NEC 850 processor module has been extended to handle new\n  addressing modes and instructions for V850E2M and RH850 from Renesas.\n\nSo no support prior to IDA 7.2 as I already surmised. In the IDA SDK 7.2 we can then find this:\n<pre><code>static const char *const shnames[] =\n{\n  \"V850\",\n  \"V850E\",\n  \"V850E1\",\n  \"V850E2M\",\n  \"RH850\",\n  NULL\n};\n\nstatic const char *const lnames[] =\n{\n  FAMILY\"NEC V850\",\n  \"NEC V850E\",\n  \"NEC/Renesas V850E1/ES\",\n  \"NEC/Renesas V850E2/E2M\",\n  \"Renesas RH850\",\n  NULL\n};\n</code></pre>\n(This should also provide the clue which possible alternative names you could try for rudimentary support using related processor models. All of those are implemented in that same <pre><code>nec850</code></pre> processor module.)\n",
