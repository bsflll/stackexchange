    "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/24696/windbg-gu-command-inside-of-a-breakpoint-causes-warning",
    "content": "I'm trying to leverage \"gu\" command in a conditional breakpoint or as a \"CommandString\" in a regular breakpoint. For example let's consider break on a malloc() function when we want to see in logs what pointer was allocated and what was the size of an allocation:\n<pre><code>bp msvcrt!malloc \"r $t1=@rcx; gu; .printf \\\"malloc: %p %08x\\\n\\\",@rax,@$t1; gc\"\n</code></pre>\n\ntldr: So, we've created a temporary register $t1, assigned it to the\n  size of allocation (the arch is x64,  thus @rcx = \"size\"), steeped out\n  of the function using \"gu\" command, and finally printed pointer at\n  @rax plus our temp register value. You can try it yourself with a \"notepad.exe\" ;)\n\nIt's kind of working, we can see the data:\n<pre><code>Some commands were skipped because previous commands caused target execution inside an event handler.malloc: 000001d2e78d42c0 00000100\nSome commands were skipped because previous commands caused target execution inside an event handler.malloc: 000001d2e78d4700 00000088\nSome commands were skipped because previous commands caused target execution inside an event handler.malloc: 000001d2e78d47c0 00000088\nSome commands were skipped because previous commands caused target execution inside an event handler.malloc: 000001d2e78d4880 00000038\nSome commands were skipped because previous commands caused target execution inside an event handler.malloc: 000001d2e78d4f10 000000f0\nSome commands were skipped because previous commands caused target execution inside an event handler.malloc: 000001d2e78d5030 00001124\nSome commands were skipped because previous commands caused target execution inside an event handler.malloc: 000001d2e78d6190 00002430\nSome commands were skipped because previous commands caused target execution inside an event handler.malloc: 000001d2e78d85f0 00000200\nSome commands were skipped because previous commands caused target execution inside an event handler.malloc: 000001d2e78d8820 00000080\nSome commands were skipped because previous commands caused target execution inside an event handler.malloc: 000001d2e78d88d0 00000080\n\n</code></pre>\nWith the only small exception which is noisy string\n\"Some commands were skipped because previous commands caused target execution inside an event handler.\". It seems it's always in a logs when we're using \"gu\" as a \"CommandString\". \nAny ideas how to get rid of it or what is the intended way of solving such a problem?\nRegards!\n",
