Types which have all of these\n  properties,\nthey're aggregate by the C++14 standard definition, that is, they have\n  no user-provided constructors, no private or protected non-static data\n  members, no base classes, and no virtual functions, and they have a\n  trivial copy-assignment operator, and they have a trivial destructor,\n  use the following return style:\nTypes less than or equal to 8 bytes are returned in x0. Types less\n  than or equal to 16 bytes are returned in x0 and x1, with x0\n  containing the lower-order 8 bytes. \nFor types greater than 16 bytes,\n  the caller shall reserve a block of memory of sufficient size and\n  alignment to hold the result. The address of the memory block shall be\n  passed as an additional argument to the function in x8. The callee may\n  modify the result memory block at any point during the execution of\n  the subroutine. The callee isn't required to preserve the value stored\n  in x8. \nAll other types use this convention:\nThe caller shall reserve a block of memory of sufficient size and\n  alignment to hold the result. The address of the memory block shall be\n  passed as an additional argument to the function in x0, or x1 if $this\n  is passed in x0. The callee may modify the result memory block at any\n  point during the execution of the subroutine. The callee returns the\n  address of the memory block in x0.\n\nUpdate 2:\nFrom ARM docs\n\nRegisters with a special purpose  \nâ€¢ X8 is the indirect result\n  register. This is used to pass the address location of an indirect\n  result, for example, where a function returns a large structure.\n  ...\n... the structure contains more than 16 bytes. According to the AAPCS for\n  AArch64, the returned object is written to the memory pointed to by XR.\n",

If you dedicate one register as a register that's likely going to contain an address, you could physically optimize the wiring so fetching data from memory pointed at by <code>x8</code> is fast. You don't want to do that for all of them, so you pick one register with special treatment and make using it as a memory-pointing register a convention.</span>",
