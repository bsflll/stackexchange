    "content": "first time post so please bear with me.\nFor days I have been trying to bypass a password my ISP has added to their remote CLI with no luck. \nI have a Zyxel C1100Z DSL modem that I've purchased from my ISP and I have been trying to breakdown their newest firmware in order to bypass a new shell password feature they've implemented. The past firmware did not have this feature and simply allowed you to login via ssh/telnet and then type 'sh' to drop into a simple Busybox shell. \nNow with the latest firmware, SSH seems to be severely broken/buggy, as does most of the CLI commands when you login over telnet (Cat,echo,netstat,etc.. do not function)\nSince this is a new feature, I have guessed that the password is either \n\nHard-coded into a CLI binary\nPulled from a configuration I have overlooked\nPushed remotely from the ISP \n\nSo far I have extracted the root-fs using binwalk and I've scoured many hours through each configuration, running strings to no end, I even tried to emulate MIPS using QEMU.\nRunning file on one of the binaries gives me:\n<pre><code>ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS32 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0, corrupted section header size</code></pre>\nI installed the old firmware hoping to get an idea of how the system worked and thought some of this info might prove useful:\n<pre><code>system type             : 963168MBV_17A\nprocessor               : 0\ncpu model               : Broadcom4350 V8.0\nBogoMIPS                : 398.33\nwait instruction        : yes\nmicrosecond timers      : yes\ntlb_entries             : 32\nextra interrupt vector  : no\nhardware watchpoint     : no\nASEs implemented        :\nshadow register sets    : 1\ncore                    : 0\nVCED exceptions         : not available\nVCEI exceptions         : not available\nunaligned exceptions            : 60561\n</code></pre>\nI've begun decompiling binaries using https://retdec.com/decompilation/ but that has't gotten me very far.\nI have hosted the extracted firmware root in a git repo at https://github.com/bwbryant1/CTL_C110Z\nI'm not asking for someone to do all of the work for me, mostly just some guidance as this is my first-attempt at reverse-engineering. Yes I have looked at past tutorials but none of the fit my firmware specifically and I have hit a brick wall.\nHow does one add a password to a shell? I know you can with inittab but it doesn't seem like that is what they are doing. I have no idea where the shell password prompt gets called from but I do know the text for it is stored inside /lib/private/libcms_cli.so. But I am not sure what this is. \nThank you\nEdit for clarification: I have ssh and telnet access but they do not give you access to the root-fs. It drops you into a kind of chrooted environment with limited capabilities. However, by typing \"sh\" you are prompted with \"Please type in shell password:\" and it doesn't ask for a username, only a pass\n",

It does indeed look like libcms_cli.so is responsible for the  additional password prompt. I did a little reversing and found it seems to just do a plaintext password comparison of what you enter with a password it gets from somewhere; I didn't spend too much time trying to figure it out but it comes from some cmsobject. Anyway, you should be able to patch address 0x617c to a nop instruction (00 00 00 00) previously a bnez v0, 0x6194 (14 40 00 05) which should bypass the string unequal comparison</span>",

Now to just get that file uploaded to a read only filesystem. I requested the source code from zyxel under GPL requests and once I get that I should (hopefully) be able make my own firmware update. In the mean time, the firmware mod kit, FMK, doesn't have support for extracting and then rebuilding jffs2 images so I'm going to have to try on my own with the mkfs.jffs2 command. Again thank you, that helps me out tremendously</span>",
