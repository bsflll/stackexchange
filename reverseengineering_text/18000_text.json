One of it's basic capabilities is translating assembly instructions in various architectures to opcodes and vice versa.\nThe usage is fairly simple:\n<pre><code># rasm2 -a arm -b 32 \"add R0, R1, R2\"\n020081e0\n</code></pre>\nHere:\n<pre><code>-a</code></pre> specifies the architecture.\n<pre><code>-b</code></pre> specifies the bits (where 16 is Thumb-1)\nFor more information there is plenty, such as the radare2 blog and official book.\n",
