You might need to look into the TV's setting section to find out what the exact model code is. Also, is webOS looks similar to the OS in your device? If yes, then from the wiki, your TV is running Linux Kernel on ARM, and there are actually some projects on the net on reversing webOS. Good luck!\n",
