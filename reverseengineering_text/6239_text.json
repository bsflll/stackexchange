    "content": "What is the difference between Ctrl-F9 and F9 in OllyDbg except the fact that the first command will stop the program execution on the next <pre><code>RET</code></pre> instruction while the second command will stop the program execution on the next breakpoint/program termination ?\nI just noticed that the debugging application give the different results in these cases (different register values after function call, etc) while executing the following code:\n<pre><code>; ...\nCALL module_name.some_address\nTEST EAX, EAX\n; ...\n</code></pre>\nI've set breakpoints on each of these instructions and noticed that the behavior is different when I just press F9 after first breakpoint or press F7 and Ctrl-F9.\nWhy ?\n",

            "content": "I don't know exactly how this feature is implemented in Ollydbg, but we can have a look at how it is implemented in x64_dbg as it is open-source.\nThe Ctrl-F9 (execute till return) functionality is implemented by <pre><code>cbDebugRtr</code></pre> in <pre><code>x64_dbg_dbg/debugger_commands.cpp</code></pre>. We can see that it calls <pre><code>StepOver</code></pre> which is a method provided by TitanEngine.\n<pre><code>CMDRESULT cbDebugRtr(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\n    StepOver((void*)cbRtrStep);\n    cbDebugRun(argc, argv);\n    return STATUS_CONTINUE;\n}\n</code></pre>\nIn the TitanEngine document the description of StepOver is described as follows :\n\nStepOver function\nThe StepOver traces code by single-stepping over calls. This tracing\n  function sets an INT3 breakpoint after the call, which is used to call\n  your callback. There is no guarantee that code execution will return\n  from that call, and thus no guarantee that your callback will ever be\n  called. The breakpoint is run only once, and is removed once your\n  callback has finished.\n\nTitanEngine is also open-source, here is the implementation of <pre><code>StepOver</code></pre> in <pre><code>TitanEngine / TitanEngine.Debugger.Control.cpp</code></pre>\n<pre><code>__declspec(dllexport) void TITCALL StepOver(LPVOID StepCallBack)\n{\n    ULONG_PTR ueCurrentPosition = GetContextData(UE_CIP);\n    unsigned char instr[16];\n    MemoryReadSafe(dbgProcessInformation.hProcess, (void*)ueCurrentPosition, instr, sizeof(instr), 0);\n    char* DisassembledString = (char*)StaticDisassembleEx(ueCurrentPosition, (LPVOID)instr);\n    if(strstr(DisassembledString, \"CALL\") || strstr(DisassembledString, \"REP\") || strstr(DisassembledString, \"PUSHF\"))\n    {\n        ueCurrentPosition += StaticLengthDisassemble((void*)instr);\n        SetBPX(ueCurrentPosition, UE_BREAKPOINT_TYPE_INT3 + UE_SINGLESHOOT, StepCallBack);\n    }\n    else\n        StepInto(StepCallBack);\n}\n</code></pre>\nAfter each step the callback function <pre><code>cbRtrStep</code></pre> is called which checks if the current instruction is a <pre><code>RET</code></pre> and if so the debugger is stopped. (<pre><code>x64_dbg_dbg/debugger.cpp</code></pre>)\n<pre><code>void cbRtrStep()\n{\n    unsigned int cipch = getCIPch();\n    if(cipch == 0xC3 or cipch == 0xC2)\n        cbRtrFinalStep();\n    else\n        StepOver((void*)cbRtrStep);\n}\n</code></pre>\nSo, to sum up, Ctrl-F9 is doing step-over until it encounters a <pre><code>RET</code></pre> instruction. If you press F7 and Ctrl-F9 the debugger will single-step the instructions of the function; the function you are calling might be doing debugger detection that is not triggered when setting a breakpoint after this function.\n",
