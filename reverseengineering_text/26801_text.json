    "content": "I've run into an issue with the MinGW build of objdump on Windows. Consider this very simple input file:\n<pre><code>48 bf 88 77 66 55 44 33 22 11\n</code></pre>\nI want to disassemble this as Intel x86-64 raw machine code. I am expecting this to show a single instruction:\n<pre><code>movabs rdi, 0x1122334455667788\n</code></pre>\nI'm passing <pre><code>-mi386:x86-64</code></pre> to objdump but it just gives me this error message. For comparison, with <pre><code>-mi386</code></pre> it works but is obviously the wrong architecture:\n<pre><code>C:\\test> objdump.exe -D -b binary -mi386 test.raw\n\ntest.raw:     file format binary\n\n\nDisassembly of section .data:\n\n00000000 <.data>:\n   0:   48                      dec    %eax\n   1:   bf 88 77 66 55          mov    $0x55667788,%edi\n   6:   44                      inc    %esp\n   7:   33 22                   xor    (%edx),%esp\n   9:   11                      .byte 0x11\n</code></pre>\nVersus:\n<pre><code>C:\\test> objdump.exe -D -b binary -mi386:x86-64 test.raw\n\ntest.raw:     file format binary\n\n\nDisassembly of section .data:\n\n00000000 <.data>:\n   0:   64-bit address is disabled\n</code></pre>\nDoes the MinGW build of objdump not support this architecture?\n",
