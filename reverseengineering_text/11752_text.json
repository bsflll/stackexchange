    "content": "An APK I'm working on uses some sort of algorithm to generate a hash which is sent along with an HTTP request. I want to figure out how the algorithm works.\nDecompiling the APK to Java is of no help at all because it is much too obfuscated and there is clearly a ton of jumping around to separate files, it's impossible to follow.\nAnalysing the SMALI is much more helpful, but still very difficult to follow due to the use of many different files, and also the generic/meaningless function names.\nI have IDA Pro but I don't have the Hex rays decompiler. There is also an extremely small amount of tutorials on using IDA Pro with Android. Is IDA Pro useless here? Smali is definitely easier to understand than the raw machine code instructions.\nWhat are my options for analysing and figuring out this algorithm?\nThank you for your suggestions\n",
