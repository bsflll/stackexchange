I used the link below for help, but I still can't figure out how to do it.\nI have installed r2pipe bindings and radare2.\n My python file looks somewhat like this,\n<pre><code>import r2pipe\nimport json\n\nr2 = r2pipe.open(\"/bin/ls\")\nx=(r2.cmd(\"pd 10\"))\njson.dumps(x)\n</code></pre>\nLinks i used to understand,\nhttps://github.com/radare/radare2/wiki/R2PipeAPI\nhttps://github.com/pwntester/cheatsheets/blob/master/radare2.md\n",
