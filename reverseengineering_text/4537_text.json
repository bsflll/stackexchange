    "content": "In a project, I cannot find the names of native functions in the .so libraries.\nThat is, a native function must be called something like <pre><code>Java_com_package_ClassName_functionName()</code></pre>. I do find functionName in the .so libraries, but either without the <pre><code>Java_com_package_ClassName_</code></pre> prefix, or wrapped into a mangled C++ name.\nSo:\n\nDoes Qt (Necessitas) use a special naming convention?\nIf yes, how it is done?\nIf no, what is going on?\n",

            "content": "The naming conventions for JNI functions are given by the Dalvik VM, a library couldn't change them and expect them to work, i.e. be callable from the Java part of the application. But, the Java_package_function convention is only needed for functions that Java wants to call, it it not neccesary for a <pre><code>C/C++</code></pre> function calling another one. \nIf you compile\n<pre><code>jint Java_com_example_foo(JNIEnv*  env, jobject  this) { return bar(); }\nint bar() { return 3; }\n</code></pre>\ninto a library, you can call <pre><code>Java_com_example_foo</code></pre> from java, and you won't be able to call <pre><code>bar</code></pre> from java, but nothing prevents <pre><code>Java_com_example_foo</code></pre> from calling <pre><code>bar</code></pre>.\nSo, there are 2 possibilities that come to mind:\n\nthe Java part is nothing but a stub that calls a <pre><code>main</code></pre> function in one library, and all the rest is done in <pre><code>C</code></pre> or <pre><code>C++</code></pre>. This <pre><code>main</code></pre> function probably will be called <pre><code>Java_package_function</code></pre>, not <pre><code>main</code></pre>, but it's the only function that uses this naming convention.\nThere's another wrapper library which provides the <pre><code>Java_package_function</code></pre> JNI API calls to the Java part, and calls the C/C++ functions which it imports from a different library. This library would probably be very small, so you might not have considered it interesting, and missed it in your previous analysis.\n",
