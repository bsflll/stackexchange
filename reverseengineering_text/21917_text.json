    "content": "I captured the traffic of a remote control for a LED light.\nI have multiple of those LED Lights.\nThe payload seems to be the same for each device but the frequency(channel) differs.\nFor one LED light I lost my remote control, now I'd like to replay the captured traffic but on a different frequency. \nHow can I do this with tools like GRC and Hack RF (or other tools) ?\n",
