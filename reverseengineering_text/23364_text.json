But basically it's just checking if the int entered by the user == 0 if it is then it goes to the xor ecx,2 if not then it does xor eax,3 on whatever number the user entered.\n",

Basically, <code>xor</code> with <code>2</code> changes second least significant bit to its negation, and <code>xor</code> with <code>3</code> changes both first and second least significant bit of <code>a</code>. They are just bit operations that act like sum modulo <code>2</code> on each bit. You can read more about <code>xor</code> <a href=\"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/xor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</span>",
