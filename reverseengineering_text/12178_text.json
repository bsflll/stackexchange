For example, you can test the following code:\n<pre><code>class A\n{\npublic:\n  virtual A getmyself() { return *this; }\n  virtual A* getmyselfpointer() { return this; }\n}\n</code></pre>\nThe generated assembly code for <pre><code>getmyself</code></pre> (the same for <pre><code>getmyselfpointer</code></pre>) is\n<pre><code>getmyself:\n  mov     eax, ecx\n  retn\n</code></pre>\nThis detail is not true for <pre><code>clang</code></pre> or <pre><code>gcc</code></pre> since they do not use <pre><code>ecx</code></pre> as default register for <pre><code>this</code></pre>.\n",
