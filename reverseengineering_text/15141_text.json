    "content": "The binary is from here: https://files.fm/u/qtqmhhdd\nI've been attempting this a couple of days. It's an ELF-64 bit file and I've gdb and IDA to see how it works for a while. You can run the file by\n<pre><code>./reverse1.bin TEST (outputs a fail message)\n</code></pre>\nIn gdb it runs a _Z5checkPc function and you can use \"disas check\". It uses the flag from address <pre><code>0x601038</code></pre> which is\n<pre><code> synt{0p5r7996pnq3qn36377036onor7342s41pq30r3n3q0p46n283862718o7n6s78n}\n</code></pre>\nBut I don't see it where it actually gets used in the code.\nFrom the check function it seems to does a bunch of operations (or, add, ...) to your arg. I thought it would do a compare to see determine if it \"fails\" or \"success\" at <pre><code>0x00000000004005b0</code></pre> but that is not right, strangely.\nAny insights on what to do?\n",

But you failed to understand that there is no direct comparison here.\n\nWe have a loop over a string value. That means it is highly probable each character is processed sequentially.\nValues are modified in an (obfuscated) way, before they are compared -> there is some kind of coding here!\n\nAlthough there is dead code included in the function, you'll have to identify the modification which is taking place directly before the comparison (what is compared to what? how are these values calculated?).\nI strongly encourage you to ask follow up questions if there is anything in particular you don't understand. For minor questions or discussions, you can also drop by in the chat.\n",
