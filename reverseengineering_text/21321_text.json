    "content": "I am trying to reverse engineer a decoder. The decoder contains a web server that makes sending/receiving information through the Internet possible.\nTo do so I need to sniff the packets that the decoder receives from an Android application installed on my phone, this application is what controls the decoder.\nI tried using Wireshark at first, but it turned out that the packets are sent over SSL, so they are all encrypted. I then tried to sniff my TCP packets using mitmproxy, which didn't work since it doesn't sniff TCP packets, it only logs packets sent over HTTP.\nAfter reading the answers to the following question How can I capture all traffic network by mitmproxy?. I decided to give Wireshark a second try.\nHowever, I need the private key which is stored on the decoder. This will enable me the decrypt the SSL packets. \nIs there any way I can get this private key from the decoder? would openssl solve this problem? I am on Linux, Ubuntu.\nI would appreciate some help with this!\n",
