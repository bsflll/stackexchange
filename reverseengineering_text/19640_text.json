    "content": "I load the entire PE into an <pre><code>std::vector<Byte> fileContent</code></pre> using <pre><code>std::fstream</code></pre>.\nThen I obtain the executable's dos header:\n<pre><code>IMAGE_DOS_HEADER* imageDosHeader = (IMAGE_DOS_HEADER*)fileContent.data();</code></pre>\nAfter that, I check whether the PE is valid(<pre><code>MZ</code></pre> and <pre><code>PE00</code></pre> signatures).\nIf it is, I get its import descriptor:\n<pre><code>IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR* imageImportDescriptor = (IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR*)((DWORD)imageDosHeader + imageNtHeader->OptionalHeader.DataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT].VirtualAddress);\n\n//Note: the VirtualAddress field equals 0x4FFC, so I assume it's valid\n</code></pre>\nNow, I iterate through the dlls and try to display their names as following:\n<pre><code>for(DWORD i = 0; ; i++)\n{\n    bool isCurrentDllValid = true;\n\n    //if all fields of the current dll are zeros, then this dll is the last one, so break the outer loop\n    for(DWORD j = 0; j < sizeof(IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR); j++)\n    {\n        if((*(DWORD*)((DWORD)&imageImportDescriptor[i] + j)))\n            break;\n        else if(j == sizeof(IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR) - 1)\n            isCurrentDllValid = false;\n    }\n\n    if(!isCurrentDllValid)\n        break;\n\n    char* dllName = (char*)((DWORD)imageDosHeader + imageImportDescriptor[i].Name);\n</code></pre>\nThe problem is: an attempt to display the <pre><code>dllName</code></pre> causes crash.\nAlso, the <pre><code>Name</code></pre> field is an RVA, but its value is <pre><code>0x6C61766E</code></pre> (the same thing is with the rest of the fields, the smallest one is <pre><code>TimeDateStamp</code></pre> with <pre><code>0x637465</code></pre>, still abnormal one), while size of the PE is less than <pre><code>0x7000</code></pre>.\nIn hex editor, RVA of e.g. <pre><code>\"KERNEL32.dll\"</code></pre> is <pre><code>0x46F0</code></pre>.\nHave you any idea why is it so? Am I missing something really simple?\n",

In this case, the Import Address Table doesn't have to be null-terminated.\n\nOr maybe this:\n\nIf the IAT is linked in the descriptor but empty, then the DLL is not loaded, and the file is loaded even with an invalid dll name - the descriptor is skipped.\n\nSo check if you have either situation.\n",

By the way if youre using Microsoft horribly outdated and jargon heavy PE pages with ambiguous offsets. The more explict form to their crappy struct ref for me SectionHeader.PointerToRawData + RVA  - SectionHeader.VirtualAddress. RVA is what you need to convert (in my case was OffSetToData for resource_data)</span>",
