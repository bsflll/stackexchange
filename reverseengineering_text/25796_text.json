    "content": "It is relatively easy to set environment variables in LLDB, via\n<pre><code>settings set target.env-vars DEBUG=1\n</code></pre>\nHowever, I can't seem to find a way to append to an environment variable.  The following doesn't work:\n<pre><code>(lldb) settings set target.env-vars DEBUG=1\n(lldb) settings set target.env-vars DEBUG=2$DEBUG\n(lldb) settings show target.env-vars DEBUG\ntarget.env-vars (dictionary of strings) =\n  DEBUG=2$DEBUG\n</code></pre>\n",
