    "content": "How to determine the System memory addresses of SPI Flash used in device running eCos operating system? For example, <pre><code>show flash</code></pre> command returns the following info:\n<pre><code> Flash Device Information:\n\n      CFI Compliant: no\n        Command Set: Generic SPI Flash\n   Device/Bus Width: x16\n Little Word Endian: no\n    Fast Bulk Erase: no\n    Multibyte Write: 256 bytes max\n  Phys base address: 0xbadf1a5\n Uncached Virt addr: 0x1badf1a5\n   Cached Virt addr: 0x2badf1a5\n   Number of blocks: 129\n         Total size: 8388608 bytes, 8 Mbytes\n       Current mode: Read Array\n        Device Size: 8388608, Write buffer: 256, Busy bit: \n\n      Size  Device      Device     Region\nBlock  kB   Address     Offset     Offset   Region Allocation\n----- ---- ---------- ----------- --------- -----------------\n    0   32 0x1badf1a5           0         0 Bootloader (32768 bytes)\n    1   32 0x1bae71a5       32768       ??? {unassigned}\n    2   64 0x1baef1a5       65536         0 Permanent NonVol (65536 bytes)\n    3   64 0x1baff1a5      131072         0 Image1\n    4   64 0x1bb0f1a5      196608     65536 Image1\n    5   64 0x1bb1f1a5      262144    131072 Image1\n    6   64 0x1bb2f1a5      327680    196608 Image1\n    7   64 0x1bb3f1a5      393216    262144 Image1\n    ..  .. ........ \n  127   64 0x1c2bf1a5     8257536   4063232 Image2 (4128768 bytes)\n  128   64 0x1c2cf1a5     8323072         0 Dynamic NonVol (65536 bytes)\n</code></pre>\nBut these addresses seems is not an actual addresses of memory locations.\nBecause when I try <pre><code>readmem</code></pre> command, it always returns errors.\nFor example, there is an example of <pre><code>readmem</code></pre> command:\n<pre><code>readmem -s 4 -n 64 0x80001234  -- Reads 64 bytes as 32-bit values</code></pre>.\nWhen I tried <pre><code>readmem -s 4 -n 16384 0x1baef1a5</code></pre> it always returns error: <pre><code>ERROR - Address</code></pre>(for any addresses from above table). So I assume these addresses is not an actual Flash Memory addresses. I tnink is this because processor’s memory controller maps the flash address space to the system address space. And flash word-size differs from system word-size.\nHow to find the System memory address to read SPI Flash?\n",
