    "content": "atm I'm using ida and x32dbg, when I find a function that interests me, I set a breakpoint on x32dbg, however, I'm not good enough at assembly to know everything from a function just from looking at the registers and whatnot. When I think a function may be something, I hook it, but it's an annoying process.\nSo is there an easier way to debug dll functions at runtime?\n",
