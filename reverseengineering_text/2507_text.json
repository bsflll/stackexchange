            "content": "I will assume you are talking about Windows Sockets and IPv4, since you have not mentioned otherwise. <pre><code>sockaddr</code></pre> is very well described in MSDN. It is defined as for IPv4 as follows:\n<pre><code>struct sockaddr {\n        ushort  sa_family;\n        char    sa_data[14];\n};\n\nstruct sockaddr_in {\n        short   sin_family;\n        u_short sin_port;\n        struct  in_addr sin_addr;\n        char    sin_zero[8];\n};\n</code></pre>\nI will use simple server application for demonstration purposes. Firstly let's set breakpoint on <pre><code>bind()</code></pre> and see what stack looks like:\n\nAs you can see, <pre><code>pSockAddr</code></pre> is a pointer to <pre><code>sockaddr</code></pre> structure is pushed on to stack as a second argument to the function. Let's go a little further and examine the <pre><code>sockaddr</code></pre> at <pre><code>0x0031F840</code></pre>:\n\nOne very important thing to note is that <pre><code>sin_port</code></pre> and <pre><code>sin_addr</code></pre> are stored using big-endian byte order, meaning the most significant part stored first.\nNow let's jump in and get pyCommand created in order to automate it with Immunity Debugger. For this purpose I will use <pre><code>BpHook</code></pre>:\n<pre><code># bindtrace PyCommand by PSS \n\nfrom immlib import *\n\nNAME = \"bindtrace\"\n\nclass BindBpHook(BpHook):\n    def __init__(self):\n        BpHook.__init__(self)\n\n    def run(self, regs):\n        imm = Debugger()\n\n        imm.log(\" \")\n        imm.log(\"Bind() called:\")\n\n        # Read sockaddr structure address\n        sockaddr = imm.readLong(regs[\"ESP\"] + 8)        \n\n        # Read 2 bytes of sin_family member\n        sockaddr_sin_family = imm.readShort(sockaddr)\n\n        # Read 2 bytes of sin_port and calculate port number \n        # since it is stored as big-endian\n        portHiByte = ord(imm.readMemory(sockaddr + 2, 1))\n        portLowByte = ord(imm.readMemory(sockaddr + 3, 1))\n        sockaddr_sin_port = portHiByte * 256 + portLowByte\n\n        # Read 4 bytes of sin_addr since it is stored as big-endian\n        ipFirstByte = ord(imm.readMemory(sockaddr + 4, 1))\n        ipSecondByte = ord(imm.readMemory(sockaddr + 5, 1))\n        ipThirdByte = ord(imm.readMemory(sockaddr + 6, 1))\n        ipForthByte = ord(imm.readMemory(sockaddr + 7, 1))\n\n        # Print results to Log View window\n        imm.log(\"---> Pointer to sockaddr structure: 0x%08x\" % sockaddr)\n        imm.log(\"---> sockaddr.sin_family: %d\" % sockaddr_sin_family)\n        imm.log(\"---> sockaddr.sin_port: %d\" % sockaddr_sin_port)\n        imm.log(\"---> sockaddr.sin_addr: %d.%d.%d.%d\" % \\\n                        (ipFirstByte,ipSecondByte,ipThirdByte,ipForthByte))\n        imm.log(\" \")\n        imm.log(\"Press F9 to resume\")\n\n\ndef main(args):\n\n    imm = Debugger()\n    functionToHook = \"ws2_32.bind\"\n\n    # Find address of the function to hook\n    functionAddress = imm.getAddress(functionToHook)\n\n    # Create and install our hook\n    myHook = BindBpHook()\n    myHook.add(functionToHook, functionAddress)\n\n    imm.log(\"Hook for %s installed at: 0x%08x\" % (functionToHook, functionAddress))\n\n    return \"[*] Hook installed.\"\n</code></pre>\nInstallation of the script is very simple. All pyCommands are stored in ./pyCommands folder of Immunity Debugger installation. I named my file <pre><code>bindtrace.py</code></pre>.\nThereafter, we load our executable into Immunity Debugger. Debugger will break automatically at entry point. Right after that we invoke the above pyCommand by typing <pre><code>!bindtrace</code></pre>, and run the executable by pressing F9. As soon as breakpoint hits, we get the result in Log windows, which can be accessed through Alt + L:\n",
