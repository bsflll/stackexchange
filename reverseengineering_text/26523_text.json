    "content": "I have an offset to a property within a player class that I need to access data from. It's made of a specific struct that I have already assembled. IDA reports the accessing offset as so:\n<pre><code>v32 = ( v3 + 280 ) // v3 is the player in this case\n</code></pre>\nI want to convert this to the correct struct within my own C++ module so I can read a specific property of that struct. I can easily get the base address of the players but whenever I get the property it doesn't come out correct.\nI have tried something of the following:\n<pre><code>playerData* lpData = reinterpret_cast<playerData*>((int)n_GetLocalPlayer() + 280);\n</code></pre>\nBut the struct isn't correct.\nThere is NO doubt that the base address or offset are correct, as the function I reversed in IDA was short and well commented. I just need help casting it.\nThank you!\n",

Here's the format:\n<pre><code>playerData* lpData = reinterpret_cast<playerData*>((*((DWORD *)n_GetLocalPlayer() + 280)));\n</code></pre>\n",
