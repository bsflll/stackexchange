In order to execute the file (i.e open it in debug mode) you need to pass the <code>-d</code> flag to radare. The command mentioned before will open the binary in read-only mode and will help you to conduct static analysis. The prepended \"./\" just means that the file is in the current folder. You can avoid it and simply call it with <code>r2 -a mips -b 32 filename</code></span>",
