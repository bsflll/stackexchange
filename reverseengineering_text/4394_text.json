    "content": "I am trying to learn actually how to get to the PEB inside of TEB. I have tried this with <pre><code>windbg</code></pre> but could not manage to dump the PEB with stuff like:\n<pre><code>!peb\n</code></pre>\nor \n<pre><code>dt nt!_PEB_LDR_DATA\n</code></pre>\nAnd others. But, I could not manage to get the PEB dumped. So also my favorite debugger is still <pre><code>immunitydbg</code></pre>. So, I was trying to get to the information using <pre><code>immunitydbg</code></pre> CLI. But the nearest thing I have managed to get to PEB is dumping the TEB.\n<pre><code>d fs:[0]\n</code></pre>\nSo, I there anyhow someway inside of immunity do get the contents of TEB/PEB? I also tried to use the <pre><code>Ollysdbg</code></pre> PE Dump plugin but that only gave me another exe file with different contents. And also i am not sure if the PE Plugin does the right thing for me.\n",
