    "content": "I'm using a calendar application, and each date is encoded. I would like to know which algorithm has been used to do this.\nExample:\nI have a date: 05-10-2023 ('mm-dd-yyyy') and it's encoded string is <pre><code>f3fgJV/I6y7CXfdp2CgyPKG2qCVrHqVXAP6PVXd/HOs=</code></pre>\nThis application is written in PHP, so there may be algorithms that I'm not aware of.\nAny help is appreciated.\n",
