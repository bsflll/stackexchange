    "content": "I am trying to find the correct Data Segment, corresponding to a certain File in a 16bit DOS Game.\nThe Assembly Instructions for the Decompiled .exe File in IDA Pro Version 5, I am looking at.\nI was wondering, is there a difference to DOS Assembly Hexadecimal, for a File, than a File opened up in a modern Hex Editor ? I use HxD the File in question, opened up in that Hex Editor is Offset(h):220A\nAn example of Assembly Instruction in the decompiled code is :- mov  ds:264Ah, ax\nthere is no Code with ds i.e. Data Segment ds:220Ah so what Value should I be looking for, if there is differences ? And are there any online converters, to help me achieve this ? or does anyone know how do work it out manually ?\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n",

But there are some things that you need to understand in order to progress.\n\nWhat does ds prefix mean? its meaning is defined by data structures (segment descriptors) that reside in memory and pointed to by a special register. Basically they define the memory offset, range etc. On modern system like windows most are set to the entire virtual space so are meaningless from a reversing perspective (though GS, FS are still used)\nTo find the offset you're looking for, the easiest way I can think of is to debug the process and try to see if you can look at the address using a debugger (that would help you understand more quickly)\nThe assembly you're looking at is 16bit assembly, which is not the exact same \"language\" as x64 assembly - so you need to be aware of that\nYou have to read a lot of material to move forward - you are working on an ancient format running on ancient \"OS\", be careful not to be confused with new information because everything has changed\nYou might want to consider working on more modern stuff, there are some disadvantages with learning from working on very outdated things. But that depends on your objectives and what you enjoy...\n\nIf you want to understand more, I suggest to read Windows Internals, understand assembly and keep going (it will take some time)\n",
