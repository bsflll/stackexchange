    "content": "in oder to solve a CTF-Challenge I have to construct a small ROP-chain. The scope of the ROP chain is to print the content of the `flag` file. I already constructed the ROP-chain, but it seems that when I call the system function with the parameter `cat flag`, the result isn't printed to the console.\nMy ROP-chain:\n<pre><code>payload = b'A'*80 + pop_rdi + addr_cat_flag + systemPlt</code></pre>\nAs far as I know it should work this way, since it is a 64-Bit machine. But the strangest thing is that when insted of calling <pre><code>system</code></pre> I call for example <pre><code>puts</code></pre> then the content at address addr_cat_flag, which in this case is <pre><code>cat flag</code></pre>, is printed to the console. This means that the parameter is hand over corectly.\nThe address of systemPlt should also be correct.\nDoes anybody know were the problem could be?\n",
