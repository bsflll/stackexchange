    "content": "Suppose we compile this method using Java 6+ compiler:\n<pre><code>void test(int x) {\n    try {\n        x += 777;\n    } finally {\n        x -= 333;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\nThe disassembled code would look like this:\n<pre><code>test(I)V\n    TRYCATCHBLOCK L0 L1 L2 null\n    TRYCATCHBLOCK L2 L3 L2 null\n   L0              // Start of try block\n    IINC 1 777     // The body of try block\n   L1              // Start of finally block in case of successful execution \n    IINC 1 -333    // Body of finally block\n    GOTO L4        // End of 'success' finally block \n   L2              // Start of finally block in case of exception\n    ASTORE 2       // Remember exception\n   L3\n    IINC 1 -333    // Duplicated body of finally block\n    ALOAD 2        // Load remembered exception\n    ATHROW         // Rethrow the exception \n   L4              // End of try/finally  \n    RETURN\n   L5\n</code></pre>\nObviously, this declaration specifies the \"try\" section and the beginning of the \"finally\" block:\n<pre><code>    TRYCATCHBLOCK L0 L1 L2 null\n</code></pre>\nBut the next declaration looks strange:\n<pre><code>    TRYCATCHBLOCK L2 L3 L2 null\n</code></pre>\nWhy does the Java compiler protect the exception while remembering it, and why does it specify itself as the handler recursively (i.e. the two <pre><code>L2</code></pre>s)?\n",

As we can can see there is no actual duplication of code, the multiple trycatch blocks function as goto labels under different cases of what failed or not (since a finally clause is also present). If you follow the program flow you can see that no duplication  takes place.\n",
