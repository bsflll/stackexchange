    "content": "Sometime ago I came across this situation:\nWindows 7 machine infected with adware, ads tabs opening up in chrome out of nowhere. Pretty invasive stuff. In the end i got rid of it with some malware removal tool (adaware), but that's like the \"i'm feeling lucky\" approach.\nSay it didn't work, there's no suspect browser plugin / extension in sight, so it's some kind of program getting spawned from time to time that opens up stuff in chrome. Let's say we've looked in the usual places (scheduler, startup registry entries, services ...) but found nothing or it's just too messy.\nHow do you go about tracing something like that ? \nAny way to catch the process red-handed, as in some kind of system-wide debugger we can tell to attach itself to any process that tries to <pre><code>exec</code></pre> chrome (or whatever call it is windows uses) so we can look at it before it goes away ?\nAny dev / system / RE tool out there that can do that ?\nSimilar question came up a while back with no good answer.\n",

Those are the nastiest as they are no process by themselves - they use another processs' memory space to execute their dirty stuff. And it's really hard to detect.\n",

The suggested answer feels more like scanning to me: going through the whole forest hoping to find it somehow. Sysinternals tools are great, but if the adware has infected a system exe or is just not running when i run Process Monitor, how is that going to help ?</span>",
