    "content": "when trying to decompile some interrupt service routines done with Watcom, the __GETDS call at the beginning of the functions will break the decompiler output completely.\nHere's the disassembly:\n\nAnd here the decompiler output:\n\nWhat could be the reason for this? Is there a way to fix this? The only thing that worked for me was creating a separate function for the code below __GETDS, but that's not really satisfying.\nThanks in advance!\n",

The solution is to break <pre><code>start</code></pre> after the <pre><code>int 21h</code></pre> call (Set function end, or 'E' key) and create a proper function for <pre><code>__GETDS</code></pre> itself. Then you will need to reanalyze all call sites (and maybe recreate the functions) so that code flow is properly updated.\n",
