    "content": "I have been using BinDiff as a plug-in for IDA Pro. I understand it is not possible to run this plug-in via terminal/batch mode. Is there a way I can export the results to a more readable format such as a .pdf or a .txt? I need a more readable format then the .BinDiff and .BinExport formats that it generates.\n",

However the .BinDiff results are essentially an SQLite file and can be handled as one. Firefox has a plug-in to read these SQLite files found here. For linux I have found that Sqliteman works well.\n",
