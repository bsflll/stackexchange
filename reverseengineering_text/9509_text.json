After executing this line the value of v7 changes from <pre><code>0xC</code></pre>. I can't understand how it happens. I thought the value should change from <pre><code>0x8</code></pre>.\nAnd I thought <pre><code>*(_DWORD *)</code></pre> should return a value. But instead, it returns another pointer. How is that happened (The both values of the memory, <pre><code>0xc</code></pre> away from <pre><code>&val_253</code></pre> and <pre><code>0x8</code></pre> away from <pre><code>&val_253</code></pre> are zero).\n",
