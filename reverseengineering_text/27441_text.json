    "content": "I'm working on a sample that contains packing and anti-analysis measures.\nUsing ScyllaHide plugin for x64dbg currently with all checks enabled (not sure if this would affect anything, I've tried messing with this a bit) I am able to attach the debugger to the process but I am observing some behavior I haven't encountered before.\n\nLooking in x64dbgs <pre><code>Memory Map</code></pre> tab, the processes main memory segment is layed out differently to what I've seen in the past. Normally it is of type <pre><code>IMG</code></pre> and contains the usual <pre><code>.text</code></pre>, <pre><code>.data</code></pre>, etc memory segments. This samples main segment is of type <pre><code>MAP</code></pre> and doesn't contain the normal sections. Is this a technique? What is it called?\n\nThere are multiple segments in this sample, here is how they look:\n<pre><code>Address=00004FF61EC70000\nSize=0000000001EE0000\nPage Information=malware_sample.exe\nAllocation Type=MAP\nCurrent Protection=ER---\nAllocation Protection=ER---\n\nAddress=00004FF620B50000\nSize=0000000000650000\nPage Information=malware_sample.exe\nAllocation Type=MAP\nCurrent Protection=-RW--\nAllocation Protection=-RW--\n\nAddress=00004FF6211A0000\nSize=000000000013B000\nPage Information=malware_sample.exe\nAllocation Type=MAP\nCurrent Protection=-R---\nAllocation Protection=-R---\n</code></pre>\n\nWhen trying to set breakpoints or patch memory x64dbg fails on the first segment I listed. I am able to place breakpoints on the second segment so my guess is the protection is preventing breakpoints/patching (<pre><code>Current Protection=ER---</code></pre>)?\nWhen trying to alter the protection of the memory segment in x64dbg using <pre><code>Set Page Memory Rights</code></pre> to test if that is the cause of the failure to patch/bps I get an error saying there was a failure to change the memory protection. What can cause this? Is there anti-debugging tricks to prevent changing memory protection?\n",
