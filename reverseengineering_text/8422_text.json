You'll then see in the lower pane the list of handles for that process, including thread handles. Find the thread ID associated with your target handle. For the example below, thread handle <pre><code>0x228</code></pre> is associated with thread ID <pre><code>3000</code></pre>:\n\nThough handle values are shown in hexadecimal in Process Explorer, thread IDs are shown in decimal. Thus thread ID <pre><code>3000</code></pre> in decimal is equal to thread ID <pre><code>0xBB8</code></pre> in hexadecimal.\nStep 2 - Find EIP for the thread ID\nIn OllyDbg's menu bar, select View → Threads. Right-click on the thread whose Ident corresponds to the thread ID you found in Step 1 (<pre><code>0xBB8</code></pre> in the example below), and select Show registers:\n\nThis will show you the current <pre><code>EIP</code></pre> for that thread, which is the next instruction to be executed once that thread is resumed:\n\nAlternative Step 2 - Find EIP for the thread ID\nIf the target thread was created in a suspended state and not yet resumed then the thread won't show up in OllyDbg's thread window. In this case, you can use LiveKd to find the thread's starting address by issuing the LiveKd command <pre><code>!thread -t <thread ID in hexadecimal></code></pre>\n<pre><code>kd> !thread -t BB8\nCid handle table at 88e01108 with 944 entries in use\n\nTHREAD 86B4E548  Cid 169c.0bb8  Teb: 7ffdb000 Win32Thread: 00000000 WAIT: (Suspended) KernelMode Non-Alertable\nSuspendCount 1\nFreezeCount 1\n    86b4ec28  Semaphore Limit 0x2\nNot impersonating\nDeviceMap                 9a70f9e8\nOwning Process            86b4cd40       Image:         wordpad.exe\nAttached Process          N/A            Image:         N/A\nWait Start TickCount      21829348       Ticks: 1299 (0:00:00:20.264)\nContext Switch Count      1              IdealProcessor: 0\nUserTime                  00:00:00.000\nKernelTime                00:00:00.000\nWin32 Start Address 0x002cb23d\nStack Init 8b777ed0 Current 8b777a40 Base 8b778000 Limit 8b775000 Call 0\nPriority 8 BasePriority 8 UnusualBoost 0 ForegroundBoost 0 IoPriority 2 PagePriority 5\nChildEBP RetAddr  Args to Child\n8b777a58 82a88d3d 85807a60 00000000 82b35d20 nt!KiSwapContext+0x26 (FPO: [Uses EBP] [0,0,4])\n8b777a90 82a87b9b 85807b20 85807a60 85807c28 nt!KiSwapThread+0x266\n8b777ab8 82a8158f 85807a60 85807b20 00000000 nt!KiCommitThreadWait+0x1df\n8b777b34 82abbfd9 85807c28 00000005 00000000 nt!KeWaitForSingleObject+0x393\n8b777b4c 82abbaf4 00000000 00000000 00000000 nt!KiSuspendThread+0x18 (FPO: [3,0,0])\n8b777b90 82e2390f 00000000 00000000 00000000 nt!KiDeliverApc+0x17f\n8b777bb0 82e23b29 00000001 00000000 00000000 hal!HalpDispatchSoftwareInterrupt+0x49 (FPO: [Non-Fpo])\n8b777bc8 82e23ba9 00000000 00000000 8b777c20 hal!HalpCheckForSoftwareInterrupt+0x83 (FPO: [Non-Fpo])\n8b777bd8 82c6450d b553bcc6 00000000 00000000 hal!KfLowerIrql+0x61 (FPO: [Non-Fpo])\n8b777c20 82abb559 00000000 778870d8 00000001 nt!PspUserThreadStartup+0x14\n00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 nt!KiThreadStartup+0x19\n</code></pre>\nYou can see <pre><code>Win32 Start Address 0x002cb23d</code></pre> in the output above, which is the starting address for the suspended thread.\n\nAlso, are there other ways to create suspended threads aside from\n  <pre><code>CreateThread()</code></pre> and <pre><code>CreateRemoteThread()</code></pre>?\n\nYes, you can call <pre><code>ntdll!NtCreateThread()</code></pre> or <pre><code>ntdll!NtCreateThreadEx()</code></pre>.\n",

            "content": "Based on provided information I suspect that the used method here is Dynamic forking of a process or as it also know process hollowing. The idea is to execute some arbitrary process in suspended state and replace its \"guts\" with the contents of another executable image. In general the idea could be implemented as following (based on Dynamic forking by Tan Chew Keong, 2004):\n\nUse the <pre><code>CreateProcess</code></pre> API with the <pre><code>CREATE_SUSPENDED</code></pre> parameter to create a suspended process from any EXE file. (Call this the first EXE).\nCall <pre><code>GetThreadContext</code></pre> API to obtain the register values (thread context) of the suspended process. The EBX register of the suspended process points to the process's PEB. The EAX register contains the entry point of the process (first EXE).\nObtain the base-address of the suspended process from its PEB, i.e. at [EBX+8]\nLoad the second EXE into memory (using ReadFile) and perform the neccessary alignment manually. This is required if the file alignment is different from the memory alignment\nIf the second EXE has the same base-address as the suspended process and its image-size is <= to the image-size of the suspended process, simply use the <pre><code>WriteProcessMemory</code></pre> function to write the image of the second EXE into the memory space of the suspended process, starting at the base-address.\nOtherwise, unmap the image of the first EXE using <pre><code>ZwUnmapViewOfSection</code></pre> (exported by ntdll.dll) and use VirtualAllocEx to allocate enough memory for the second EXE within the memory space of the suspended process. The <pre><code>VirtualAllocEx</code></pre> API must be supplied with the base-address of the second EXE to ensure that Windows will give us memory in the required region. Next, copy the image of the second EXE into the memory space of the suspended process starting at the allocated address (using <pre><code>WriteProcessMemory</code></pre>).\nIf the unmap operation failed but the second EXE is relocatable (i.e. has a relocation table), then allocate enough memory for the second EXE within the suspended process at any location. Perform manual relocation of the second EXE based on the allocated memory address. Next, copy the relocated EXE into the memory space of the suspended process starting at the allocated address (using <pre><code>WriteProcessMemory</code></pre>).\nPatch the base-address of the second EXE into the suspended process's PEB at [EBX+8].\nSet EAX of the thread context to the entry point of the second EXE.\nUse the SetThreadContext API to modify the thread context of the suspended process.\nUse the ResumeThread API to resume execute of the suspended process.\n\nSo, to answer your question I firstly suggest to verify that this indeed happens. Secondly, if it does you can do the following to break on the new created thread entry point. The proposed way is not the only one, but IMHO will be easy done taking into account your relatively small experience in RE/executable analysis:\n\nCheck the PoC to actually get the full understanding of the whole process.\n\nPlace BP on SetThreadContext. The second parameter is <pre><code>CTX</code></pre> variable which holds among various aspects of the thread context, also the address of the thread function.\nIn the nutshell, you need to examine <pre><code>CTX.eax</code></pre> to get the address of the thread function. For example <pre><code>0x00402030</code></pre> is the address you've found there. \nDownload and install ProcessHacker and with its help, examine the address space of the suspended process. Open the memory page to which the thread function belongs to - Right click on process -> Properties -> Memory. For example page <pre><code>0x00400000</code></pre>.\nProcessHacker will show you the memory page with local offsets to the page. You will need to go to the offset <pre><code>0x2030</code></pre>.\nPatch the memory at offset <pre><code>0x2030</code></pre> with <pre><code>0xEBFE</code></pre> (remember the previous bytes), this makes the thread loop indefinitely - <pre><code>jmp 0x00402030</code></pre>.\nNow, resume the parent process and attache the new instance of <pre><code>Olly</code></pre> to the suspended process which now is already running. Go to the EP and patch back to the original bytes. \nGood luck with the analysis.\n\n\nI hope this is understandable otherwise ask and I'll clarify.\n",
