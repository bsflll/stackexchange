    "content": "I know title isn't very clear so here is an example of a code I'm trying to disassemble:\n<pre><code>struct Inner {\n  int field1;\n  int field2;\n};\nstruct Outer {\n  int some_data[16];\n  struct Inner the_array[16];\n};\n\nint x(struct Outer* s, int id) {\n  return s->the_array[id - 1].field2;\n}\n</code></pre>\nA compiler fuses all the offsets (positive offset of Inner within Outer, negative offset of -1 index and positive offset of field2 in Inner) into single offset. The complete function code follows:\n<pre><code>movsxd  rax, esi\nmov     eax, [rdi+rax*8+3Ch]\nretn\n</code></pre>\nIDA and Hex-rays obviously think it is an offset into <pre><code>Outer::some_data</code></pre> and not into <pre><code>Outer::the_array</code></pre>. Corresponding pseudocode is:\n<pre><code>__int64 __fastcall x(Outer *s, int id)\n{\n  return (unsigned int)s->some_data[2 * id + 15];\n}\n</code></pre>\nIs there any way to manually select which nested structure member is being accessed?\nIf someone wants to reproduce this example to play with it themselves, that code sample is a complete TU and Linux x86-64 clang 10 or newer produces the assembly code I shown (<pre><code>-O1</code></pre> is enough for this optimization). Same source file can be then loaded into IDA as a C header to get the structures.\n",

It's only a partial solution though: a) smaller issue - <code>__shifted</code> cast will be plastered all over all the callsites, if lucky; if unlucky, same <code>__shifted</code> type will be propagated upstream and will require manual overrides; b) this one is much worse - it doesn't work if the function happens to touch not only <code>the_array</code> but also some other fields of Outer.</span>",
