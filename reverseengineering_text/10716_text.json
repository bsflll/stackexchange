    "content": "It is understood that the labels that come in the <pre><code>.text</code></pre> section of an assembly program are representative of the address of the following instruction.\nIs it the same idea with the symbols we see in the <pre><code>.data</code></pre> section ? i.e. \"The label is representative of the base address of whatever follows\".\nDoes this apply anywhere in the program ?\nI'm a NOOB in assembly, learning MIPS as a part of coursework.\n",
