    "content": "I am starting to look a bit more precisely at ARM assembler and I looked up some dumps from <pre><code>objdump</code></pre>. I saw a lot of instruction (<pre><code>add</code></pre> is not the only one) with an extra <pre><code>s</code></pre> at the end (<pre><code>adds</code></pre>, <pre><code>subs</code></pre>, ...).\nI looked a bit to the ARM documentation and it seems to mean something significant, but I can't figure out exactly what (the documentation I found about it seemed extremely obscure to me).\nHas somebody some insight on what is the meaning of this extra <pre><code>s</code></pre> added at the end of some ARM instructions ?\n",

One way to implement it is to have <code>sub reg, #1</code> followed by an explicit compare to zero (which will set the <code>Z</code> zero flag when reg becomes 0), then a predicated branch. With <code>subs reg, #1</code> the <code>Z</code> flag is implicitly updated, therefore no explicit comparison is required.</span>",
