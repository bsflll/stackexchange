I want to generate my own codes.\nI have the following codes (and more):\n\nCopy/Paste of the C-Column\n<pre><code>L7UMQRQCQAZBD\nOYXPVAANAB4ZE\nK4BCLQEFABBRE\nF5IKJLYGABSJE\n</code></pre>\nI tried a few different decoding mechanisms, but I didn't get any readings that would make sense to me.\nI expect to get numbers for the time and temperature brewing.

The number of times the same tee can be used to brewâ€¦\nEdit:\nAll the codes as text:\n<pre><code>VORWERK2AE4L7UMQRQCQAZBDERMYRTHWFKD7CM7PKMBOVEAUNE5WNISNWAIZT74WOLVSSHNSRUIHUWGKFUWKTNXXKI\nVORWERK2AE4OYXPVAANAB4ZEER3V2QO4WL6DZGBPBIJWY3AOLKJRXNICEWXVGO6CEKNCKJHFPUPTB3R3EG5YTFTQQE\nVORWERK2AE4K4BCLQEFABBREESWJ5KYBTINVAZWZ4SQ5AQUWFAZO3UPYAKOLO2HRIJNFNGXENAW3QU5IXRSKO5BFMI\nVORWERK2AE4F5IKJLYGABSJEETKQTQVEY73L4SOLWW5P5NLB355G6BVHINON755S6ADUEBXUV3AFW2JQOWGCHT6CME\n</code></pre>\n",
