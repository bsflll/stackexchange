    "content": "I have stackoverflow in MIPS arch (without ASLR/canary)\nIn Ida I see that the buffer that has the overflow located in SP+200\nIn the beginning if function I can see the stack size because I see the command\n<pre><code>addiu $sp, -4000\n</code></pre>\nSo I guess the stack frame on this function is 4000\nIf I want to override the PC register (when the function is return) , should I need to write to buffer 4000 (stack frame) -200(location of buffer in stack) ? Because the address is decrement is stack?\n",
