    "content": "Hello best people, my question is this example is telling me about cdecl calling convention. I have confusion that when analyzing the code in disassembly how would I recognize that this is the cdecl call plus\nthey are saying that the highlighted line in the picture showing that the stack is cleaned by the caller as the function is complete, my question is how it is cleaning the stack, I'm according to my knowledge seeing that the value 12 is added in esp, HOW IT IS CLEANING? please explain.\n",

This is the <pre><code>add esp, 12</code></pre> instruction, and it's called cleanup the stack.\nIn <pre><code>cdecl</code></pre> call, the caller, which is the current function, is the one that responsible for cleanup the stack. In other calling conventions, like <pre><code>stdcall</code></pre> the callee is responsible for cleaning the stack - restore the state of the stack pointers to prior the call.\n",

Unfortunately this term is quite entrenched so will probably continue to confuse new learners in future as well.\n",
