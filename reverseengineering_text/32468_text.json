    "content": "I tried to use different programs for this, such as fmodel and UnrealPakViewer, but fmodel support only utoc, so I can extract only some part of files and it does not support binka audio files. UnrealPakViewer can open ucas and I can see files in it, but I cant unpack these files.\nFiles: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W5cv3n6cgVFx18W6_A1Rqo350-TeLlCV?usp=sharing\n",
