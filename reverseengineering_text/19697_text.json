    "content": "In the core my question is about how to reverse engineer undocumented functions.\nI want to call the function \"xxxMouseEventDirect\" (located in win32kfull.sys). I have already been able to collect some information for this, but now I am a bit stuck.\nThe call hierarchy is as follows:\nNtUserSendInput -> xxxSendInput -> xxxMouseEventDirect.\nThe function looks like this:\n<pre><code>NTSTATUS __fastcall* xxxMouseEventDirect (ULONG dx, ULONG dy, ULONG mouseData, ULONG dwFlags, ULONGLONG time, ULONGLONG extraInfo, ULONGLONG, ULONG);\n</code></pre>\nI am relatively sure that I call the function parameters correctly, but there is still a blue screen when I call the function.\nThe bluescreen occurs like this:\n<pre><code>mov rax, qword ptr [win32kfull!_imp_gptiCurrent (fffffbe9`4c720ec0)]\nmov r14, qword ptr [rax]\ncmp qword ptr [r14+1B0h], rcx ; <--- Bluescreen because r14 == 0\n</code></pre>\nWhen I call NtUserSendInput, rax points to a pointer which is then used via [r14+1B0h].\nWhen I call xxxMouseEventDirect directly, rax points to 0, causing [r14+1B0h] to cause a blue screen.\nI now wonder what is stored in win32kfull!_imp_gptiCurrent and why it is not there when I call xxxMouseEventDirect directly.\nI am relatively new in the field of reverse engineering and would like to know how to deal with such a problem in general. Concrete tips are of course also very welcome.\nThank you\n",
