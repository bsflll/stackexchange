    "content": "IDA Pro uses a syntax like <pre><code>Var_A4 = dword ptr -0A4h</code></pre> when declaring stack variables at the top of a x86 assembly routine as shown:\n\nHowever, I would expect it to refer to such local variables and arguments using an EBP offset syntax. What is the meaning of the dword ptr syntax and why is this syntax used?\n",
