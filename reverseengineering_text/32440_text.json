I have only raw binary dump, not ELF or any other 'container'.\nUnfortunately, I cannot find any option to force VLE mode (my binary definitely uses it).\nThis one is just a short example:\n<pre><code>~$ objdump -b binary -EB -m powerpc:vle -M vle -D PowerPC_test.bin\n\nPowerPC_test.bin:     file format binary\n\nDisassembly of section .data:\n\n00000000 <.data>:\n   0:   c5 a9 50 1a     .long 0xc5a9501a\n   4:   fb 70 2a a4     .long 0xfb702aa4\n</code></pre>\nAccording to IDA and Ghidra, it should be\n<pre><code>seg000:00000000 C5 A9                       se_lwz    r26, 0x14(r25)\nseg000:00000002 50 1A FB 70                 e_lwz     r0, -0x490(r26)\nseg000:00000006 2A A4                       se_cmpi   r4, 0xA\n</code></pre>\n",

To be honest, it is strange because you can find a lot of PowerPC-related stuff in the binutils sources. But anyway, objdump from NXP works better, thanks for it.</span>",
