    "content": "I have been trying to use IDA Pro (with bindiff) via IDAPython to automate the analysis process of a bios.dump file while outputting the results to a .txt / .asm file. From here I want to use the bindiff functions to compare this database with another database and output any differences to a file.  Any recommendations?\n",

            "content": "With the now free BinDiff 4.2 you can do batch analysis with a bit of work.\nIn the BinDiff installation directory (<pre><code>zynamics/BinDiff 4.2</code></pre>), you will find <pre><code>bin/differ.exe</code></pre> and <pre><code>bin/differ64.exe</code></pre>. Those are binaries for batch diffing of IDBs and <pre><code>.BinExport</code></pre> files.\nThe basic usage would be:\n<pre><code>differ --primary=<directory-with-IDBs> --output-dir=<output-directory>\n</code></pre>\nSadly, this does not work (at least on my machine) as <pre><code>differ.exe</code></pre> fails to find IDA's executable and tries to execute the directory instead.\nTo solve this, we will export IDBs using the following command:\n<pre><code>\"<path-to-idaq.exe>\" -A -OExporterModule:<result-directory> -S\"<path-to-export-script>\" \"<path-to-idb>\"\n</code></pre>\nThe <pre><code>export-script</code></pre> is an <pre><code>.idc</code></pre> with the following code:\n<pre><code>#include <idc.idc>\n\nstatic main()\n{\n    Batch(0);\n    Wait();\n    Exit(1 - RunPlugin(\"zynamics_binexport_8\", 2));\n}\n</code></pre>\nOnce you have all your <pre><code>.BinExport</code></pre> files in one directory, run the original <pre><code>differ.exe</code></pre> command on that directory (give it the directory with the <pre><code>.BinExport</code></pre> files instead of the <pre><code>.idb</code></pre> files), and you'll get <pre><code>.BinDiff</code></pre> files for all possible diffs. Those can either be opened up in IDA, or manually parsed (they are SQLite databases).\n",
