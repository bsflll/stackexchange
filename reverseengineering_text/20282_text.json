    "content": "I have a function of the format:\n<pre><code>sub_ABCDEF(&global, \"stringName\", unimportantValue)\n\npush    offset string\nmov     ecx, offset global\ncall    sub_410010\n</code></pre>\nThat is called in several places, each varying the &global and string location.\nI am wondering if it's possible in IDAPython to bulk rename all the &global's to the string value.\nI used XrefsTo(410010, 0) to obtain a list of places the function is called from, but I am unsure how to get the parameters it was called with.\n",
