    "content": "I've seen this question which says <pre><code>__PAIR__</code></pre> macro does some conditional computation. But I can not relate that with standard I/O handles. Here is the pseudocode in IDA:\n<pre><code>if ( (char *)hConout - 1 <= (char *)0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFDi64 ) {\nConfigureStdHandles((PHANDLE)handle);\nv175 = __PAIR__(1, (unsigned int)handle[0]);\nv176 = __PAIR__(2, (unsigned int)handle[1]);\nv177 = __PAIR__(2, (unsigned int)handle[2]);\n</code></pre>\nHere is the corresponding Assembly:\n<pre><code>loc_1400088CA:                          ; CODE XREF: wmain+FBF↑j\nmov     [rsp+418h+handle+18h], rsi\nlea     rax, [rsi-1]\ncmp     rax, 0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFDh\nsetbe   al\nmov     rcx, [rsp+418h]\ntest    al, al\njz      loc_140008BAD\nlea     rcx, [rsp+418h+handle] ; hIn\ncall    _ConfigureStdHandles\nmov     esi, 1\nmov     dword ptr [rsp+418h+var_268+4], esi\nmov     eax, dword ptr [rsp+418h+handle]\nmov     dword ptr [rsp+418h+var_268], eax\nmov     dword ptr [rsp+418h+var_260+4], 2\nmov     eax, dword ptr [rsp+418h+handle+8]\nmov     dword ptr [rsp+418h+var_260], eax\nmov     dword ptr [rsp+418h+var_258+4], 2\nmov     eax, dword ptr [rsp+418h+handle+10h]\nmov     dword ptr [rsp+418h+var_258], eax\ncmp     [rsp+418h+var_230], r15b\njz      short loc_140008958\nmov     [rsp+418h+var_268], r15\nloc_140008958:  \n</code></pre>\nThe handles are for standard input, output and error respectively. Can you explain what does the <pre><code>__PAIR__</code></pre> macro do with those handles?\n",

            "content": "<pre><code>__PAIR__</code></pre> represents a 64-bit value constructed from two 32-bit values. Because you have 64-bit variables (<pre><code>var_260</code></pre> etc) being initialized by halves, decompiler detected a 64-bit move pattern and represented the right-hand side it as <pre><code>__PAIR__</code></pre> helper. If you think it's wrong, you can fix it by:\n\nfixing the stack variable to be two 32-bit ones instead of one 64-bit. You can do it by opening the stack frame view (e.g double-click on the stkvar)  and editing the  frame structure (e.g with D key). After refreshing (F5), the decompiler should show simple 32-bit assignments without <pre><code>__PAIR__</code></pre>.\nsplitting the 64-bit assignment into separate 32-bit ones. For that, use \"Split Assignment\" in the context menu.\n\n\nEDIT I suspect that those stack variables are not 64-bit integers but actually small structs of two members, e.g.\n<pre><code>struct handle_desc {\n  int handle;\n  int index;\n}\n</code></pre>\nmaybe look at how they’re used later in the code.\n",
