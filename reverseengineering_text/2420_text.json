            "content": "I'm answering from a C++ viewpoint, other languages have different reasons.\nThere are legitimate uses for these functions, even if they are nothing more than\n<pre><code>void func(/* any args */) {}\n</code></pre>\nOne example that comes to mind is a virtual function that does nothing in a base class but is overridden in a derived class. A similar example would be a template function whose general case is empty but specializations are not.\nOne more case is static variables. A static variable destructor has to be called at the end of the program, which usually uses <pre><code>atexit</code></pre> to register the destructor callback when the variable is accessed for the first time. As I recall, the C++ standard says that a destructor with no observable behaviour might not be invoked, but I have seen MSVC 6.0 register <pre><code>nullsub</code></pre>s as destructors anyway.\nGlobal variables follow rules similar to static ones.\nAnother possibility is a function that simply has no effect, according to the compiler. The function has to exist in case something (e.g. another compilation unit that doesn't know the implementation is empty) tries to call it, but its body is empty. \nMind that \"according to the compiler\" is not always equal to the coder's understanding. I myself once wrote a cleanup function that did a lot of work, but by mistake it took the argument by value instead of by reference. The compiler optimized the entire function body to a <pre><code>{}</code></pre> without any warning. Oops.\n",
