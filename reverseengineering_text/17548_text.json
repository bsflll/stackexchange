    "content": "i'm actually quite new to IDApython programing and i'm trying to get, for a \"switch-case\" jump table, the list of basic blocks for a given value of the case.\nWhile experimenting, i was trying to access the switch-case table using the following code as following the official documentation.\n<pre><code>import idautils\nimport idaapi\nimport idc\n\nmyfunc=0\njump_table = dict()\nswitch_map = {}\n\nfor func in idautils.Functions():\n    if 'Myfunction_name' == idc.GetFunctionName(func):\n        print 'function found'\n        myfunc = func\n        break\n\nfor (startea, endea) in Chunks(myfunc):\n    for head in Heads(startea, endea):\n        switch_info = idaapi.get_switch_info_ex(head)\n        if switch_info != None:\n            num_cases = switch_info.get_jtable_size()\n            if num_cases == 148:\n                print 'good jump table found'\n                results = idaapi.calc_switch_cases(head, switch_info)\n                for idx in xrange(results.cases.size()):\n                    cur_case = results.cases[idx]\n                    \"\"\"\n         --->       #can't use the following\n\n           -->      for cidx in xrange(len(cur_case)):\n           -->          print \"case: %d\" % cur_case[cidx]\n                    \"\"\"\n                    print \"  goto 0x%x\" % results.targets[idx]\n                #for cidx in xrange(cur_case.size()):\n                print cur_case\n                print \"  goto 0x%x\" % results.targets[idx]\n            else:\n                continue\n        else:\n            continue\n</code></pre>\nUnfortunately, i am not able to access correctly the cases values, as shown by the arrows in the code. Indeed, the \"cur_case\" object is a PySwigObject, which is not iterable. \nAny idea on how to get that code to work? (notes : i'm using IDA 64 bits)\nthanks in advance!\n",
