Why compiler shifted left the <pre><code>edx</code></pre>?\n",

You could also attach a dynamic debugger (Ollydbg) and see what is happening exactly by stepping trough your code.\n",

A statement that possibly needs reminding you that not any value here is in \"bits\" â€“ but maybe you confused it with <i>bytes</i>. Still: how did you come to the conclusion that there is <i>any</i> additional space left between <code>0x10</code> and <code>0xD8</code>? That space is <b>exactly</b> the amount needed for the 50 integers that your original code says there should be, nothing more and nothing less.</span>",
