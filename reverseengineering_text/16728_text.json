    "content": "A bit of background; I'm trying to inject my own code into the old game SimTower with the ultimate goal of reverse engineering it in the same way that OpenRCT2 was created.\nSince SimTower is distributed as a 16-bit NE executable I'm having a bit of trouble with injecting my own DLL and changing the main method to my own (as in this article https://bwrsandman.wordpress.com/2014/12/27/first-steps-to-reverse-engineering-an-executable/), but I think I've found another way.\nOne of the first things that SimTower does is to run <pre><code>WAVEMIXINIT</code></pre> from <pre><code>WAVMIX16.DLL</code></pre>. As far as I can tell, if the return value is <pre><code>0</code></pre> it shows a dialog box and disables the sound.\n\nMy plan now is to simply create a faux wavmix16 dll that will (for now) always return 0 from that function. That should allow me to get an entry point to run my own code, and get the game started.\n<pre><code>typedef void *HANDLE;\n\nHANDLE __far __pascal WAVEMIXINIT() {\n  // while (1) {;};\n  return 0;\n}\n\nvoid __far __pascal STUB4() {}\nvoid __far __pascal STUB5() {}\nvoid __far __pascal STUB6() {}\nvoid __far __pascal STUB7() {}\nvoid __far __pascal STUB9() {}\nvoid __far __pascal STUB10() {}\nvoid __far __pascal STUB11() {}\nvoid __far __pascal STUB12() {}\n</code></pre>\nCompiling this into a dll and naming it <pre><code>wavmix16.dll</code></pre> seems to work, and I can see that the call is coming in to my function, since if I uncomment the while loop the program will be stuck inside it.\nFor some reason though, the program crashes as soon as I get to my return statement.\n(wine)\n\nUnhandled page fault on read access to 0x0000fa30 at address 0x148f:0x0000000c (thread 002b)\n\n(Windows XP)\n\nThis is the assembly of my DDL function that gets called. I'm a little bit unsure of why there is more stuff than just a <pre><code>mov</code></pre> and <pre><code>retf</code></pre> (like the <pre><code>nop</code></pre>?), but I'm new to all this so maybe that's normal.\n\nThis is the assembly of the original DLL function:\n\nReally appreciate any help, thank you!\n",
