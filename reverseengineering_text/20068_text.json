    "content": "I updated a device over a firmware update software and sniffed the whole traffic with wireshark. There is a TCP Stream with ~30MB which I exported as raw data. The resulting file is <pre><code>Zip archived data</code></pre> but it has a CRC error when I try to extract it with binwalk/7zip.\nI also tried to export as hex dump and make <pre><code>xxd -r -p dump outfile</code></pre>.\nIn the pcap file are many <pre><code>TCP DUP ACK</code></pre> and <pre><code>TCP Out-Of-Order</code></pre> packets. \nI wonder if the exported binary takes over these dupes or out-of-order stuff.\nI also tried <pre><code>chaosreader -r dump.pcap</code></pre> still corrupt.\nExtracting the .exe with 7zip failed also with checksum error.\nAny of you have any idea what I'm doing wrong?\n",
