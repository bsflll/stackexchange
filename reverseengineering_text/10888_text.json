PS: Consider to save the state of your IDA Database before changing bytes with Database snapshot manager(Ctrl+Shift+T). It will help you to avoid troubles if something will go wrong.  If you want to patch the binary that you dissect, there are a plenty of ways to do that. You may use Edit -> Patch program -> Apply patches to input file in IDA Pro. Alternatively you may modify a binary in a debugger or with some hex editor. What would you like to modify?\n",
