    "content": "I downloaded and unpacked the modem from Google source, after that\nI used laginimaineb's script to unify all modem binary data. However, when loading this binary to IDA, I get an error says:\n\n<pre><code>Binary data is incorrect, maximum possible value is xxxxxx\n</code></pre>\n\nI tried to do the same thing by pulling this modem.b* from the device itself. The same behavior.\nI opened up this binary into 010 Editor and check the section size, and it seems like the sections have a size bigger than the binary size.\nHow could I fix the binary? Assuming that the first sections are valid, could I use that information to calculate the further section sizes?\n",
