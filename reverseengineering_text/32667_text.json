    "content": "In my company I am able to use Ms Teams only inside windows but when I try from a Virtual machine (Hyper-V) running linux it says that this device is not allowed.\nSo how can the Teams Server knows that I am on the right device ? Is it based on IP ? Does it use some kind of fingerprint like the user-agent of the browser ?\n",

I use it only on select websites, but sometimes it's the only way to convince stubborn sites that my browser is just as fine as those browsers it would like me to install (but which I avoid for one reason or another). What is your exact problem? At which point do you get stuck with your research into the topic?\n",
