    "content": "If I'm using GDB or any other debugger, I just want to know where the respective images are loaded for a given process.\nSay I create an executable HelloWorld, and it just prints hello.\nIt has a maximum and minimum bounds in memory. \nI am asking this question because I'm looking for certain bytes in memory; I'm going to call gdb's find with these values as parameter.\nThanks in advance, I apologize if it seems novice, but I've not read the entire GDB manual.\n",
