    "content": "When I load a .Net executable into IDA then there is no <pre><code>Debug</code></pre> menu as when I load a normal binary. Is there any way to enable the debug functionality for .Net as well? I'd like to step into some jitted functions in order to analyse the quality (or lack thereof) of the generated native code. \nI know that I can do this with Visual Studio, but that is too cumbersome and unwieldy for my taste. I'd rather use my trusted IDA, which is so much better for stuff like that.\nI tried attaching to an running .Net exe but that didn't really get me anywhere, apart from the need for adding <pre><code>ReadLine()</code></pre> calls to the programs to make them stay around long enough.\nIn case it matters, on this machine I'm still using IDA 6.8 (Pro) at the moment because my antivirus - Avira - screams its little head off when I launch IDA 6.9 (on account of the plugins).\n",
