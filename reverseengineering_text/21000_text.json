    "content": "With the help of IDA I was able to hard-code changes into an executable by simply replacing some bytes with a hex editor, what I did was to change the resolution to something larger.\nI've learnt that it's possible to do a similar thing with hooks, so I transferred all of the edits to multiple hooks. Now the issue is that I need to load my newly created DLL before anything else which means using a different method other than simply injecting it.\nI hope this makes sense, what would be the best method to achieve this?\n",

            "text": "Hi and welcome to RE.SE. How is it different than simply injecting? One method of injecting a DLL is to create a process yourself, which means you typically have all required rights to do whatever you like with it. Combine that with starting said process suspended and you have a recipe for injecting DLLs before the main entry point of the executable gets to run ... what am I missing? (duh, only saw the answer after I commented ... that answer embodies all I described)\n",

Although not required you can correct the PE checksum with the <pre><code>?</code></pre> button (and save afterwards):\n\nNote that adding the import doesn't mean that the executable loading your dll calls the export specified. It just means that the dll will be loaded and it's <pre><code>DLLMain</code></pre> will be called.\n",
