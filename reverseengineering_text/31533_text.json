    "content": "I am trying to analyze some binary files that are supposedly from a H8300 processor. I found this question that mentioned objdump supports H8300 but when I use the command I get the following error:\n\nobjdump: can't use supplied machine h8300\n\nI guess the files does not have the right format. From what I can see, they have the following format:\n<pre><code>BeginLine\nAddress:HexData:ChecksumByte?\nEndLine\n</code></pre>\nI also tried to export the HexData to a bin file but I still get the same error. What is the expected format?\n",
