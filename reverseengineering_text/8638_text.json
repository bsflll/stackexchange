    "content": "I am trying to iterate all the C <pre><code>statement</code></pre> (could be very coarse-grained, it's fine) in IDA-Pro recovered assembly program. \nSuppose I only consider these statements:\n<pre><code>State :: =\n  | if-else cond;\n  | loop;\n  | assignment;\n  | function call\n  | return\n  | {s1; s2; s3 ...}\n</code></pre>\nAnd after some quick search, I know that there are some (third-party) plugins that can help to identify some <pre><code>C</code></pre> control-flow structure, and I list some of them below:\nif-else cond  :   N/A\nloop  : link1 link2 link3\nSo my questions are:\n\nIs there any plugins that can recover if/else statement? It looks easier than loop, but I just cannot find a well-developed way to recover the statement.\nIs there anyway/api/scripts to iterate C statements in IDA-Pro? Or I have to implement myself?\n\nIdeally it should look like this as this is essentially used in source code analysis... (sorry for this pseudo code, I just want to clarify)\n<pre><code>let aux s =\n    match s with\n    | If e1 b1 b2 -> analyze e1 b1 b2\n    | Loop e1 e2 e3 b1 -> analyze e1 e2 e3 b1\n    | Assign v1 v2 -> analyze v1 v2 \n    | States sl -> List.iter analyze sl\n    | ...  in\nList.iter aux statement_list\n...\n</code></pre>\n",
