If you actually want XCHG EAX, EAX for some reason you have to write 0x87 0xC0, which is a valid but over-long encoding in 32-bit mode.</span>",

Now you're hoping people are doing NOPs or re-setting registers in very specific ways and checking all of them (idioms). AArch64 has an explicit NOP, it's in the HINT space since it's only going to get as far as the front end.</span>",

But there's no problem with choosing that encoding to be a special case of the operands for another opcode, like <code>add x0, x0, x0</code> on a CPU like RISC-V where <code>x0</code> is a zero register.  Maybe a tiny bit in terms of the combinatorial logic in the decoders to not have a NOP also match the opcode for something else.</span>",

The only 1-byte 8086 instruction with no architectural effect was <code>xchg ax,ax</code>, part of the exchange-with-accumulator group of opcodes where the other register number is in the low 3 bits. (<a href=\"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/xchg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">felixcloutier.com/x86/xchg</a>) There was no real need to document <code>90h</code> NOP separately, and original 8086 probably <i>didn't</i> run it any faster.</span>",

This is because today's architectures are mostly von Neumann architectures that happily mix data in between code. My guess is that <pre><code>0x00</code></pre> is the most common data value as it is used to initialize newly allocated memory and most default values for integers are also probably zero.\nIn code injection exploits you usually inject executable code as data and then trigger a bug to make the CPU execute this injected data.\nIf most data bytes are a <pre><code>NOP</code></pre> when (mis)used as instruction, most of the data becomes a so-called nop slide.\nA nop slide is very useful for an attacker as he might not be sure at which point exactly his injected code is in memory.\nWhen everything before his injected code are <pre><code>NOPs</code></pre>, he just needs to be lucky and hit somewhere into the nop slide which will then lead the CPU to execute the attacker’s injected code at the end.\nThat's why NOP slides can be used to defeat protections like ASLR, which loads memory at random positions.\nI don't think all these security considerations where made at the point they designed the instruction set, but maybe they had a guess that its not a good idea to make the default value for most data also a <pre><code>NOP</code></pre> when interpreted as instruction.\n",

The choice to have the \"mode\" bits of the ModR/M byte use <code>00</code> as a memory addressing mode (rather than register direct) was probably arbitrary, since 8086 doesn't have memory protection so a memory destination isn't going to fault and help you debug a bad jump target.  Only with protected mode did that become an advantage vs. if it had decoded as <code>add al, al</code> which isn't a NOP but won't fault either.</span>",

(Although on ISAs where register number 0 is a zero register that discards writes, it is a NOP.)  So it works as a NOP sled, allowing execution to reach whatever's after the padding as long as it lands somewhere in it.  Modern designs like RISC-V and AArch64 avoid that, with RISC-V I think even guaranteeing that the all-zero encoding will definitely fault, not usable as an extension.  It's good for ease of debugging, too, like if you let execution fall off the end of <code>_start</code>, it'll fault right there.</span>",

The fill bytes are then often choosen to be something that would crash when interpreted as instruction. In case of x86 e.g. <code>0xCC</code> which is bascially a software breakpoint for a debugger. Without a debugger the program would instantly crash. With a debugger you have a nice breakpoint and can debug the root cause more easily. So, nice for debugging and prevents NOP slides.</span>",
