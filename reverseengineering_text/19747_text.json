I have little problems given to me in Assembly code and I have to reverse engineer it to C, but I have been doing really bad job at it so far. Can someone tell me what this code translates to in C. \n<pre><code>    .file   \"hw4.c\"\n    .text\n    .p2align 4,,15\n    .globl  p1\n    .type   p1, @function\n\n.LFB14:\n    .cfi_startproc\n    movl    (%rdi), %eax\n    addl    (%rsi), %eax\n    ret\n    .cfi_endproc\n.LFE14:\n    .size   p1, .-p1\n    .p2align 4,,15\n    .globl  p2\n    .type   p2, @function\n</code></pre>\n",
