    "content": "I've been reading about the way syscalls are called in windows.\nThe general theme in all the articles I read is:\n64bit- called inside ntdll\n32bit- from ntdll jumping to KiFastSystemcall\nbut when I opened IDA with ntdlls from both 64 and 32 bit to verify these articles this is what I saw:\n(32bit)\n<pre><code>NtCreateFile proc near\nmov     eax, 55h        ; syscall num\nmov     edx, offset j_Wow64Transition\ncall    edx ; weird stub is called instead of KiFastSystemcall.\n            ; I couldn't find anything about it.perhaps a wrapper around KiFastSystemcall?\n\nretn    2Ch\nNtCreateFile endp\n</code></pre>\n(64bit)\n<pre><code>NtCreateFile proc near\nmov     r10, rcx        ; NtCreateFile\nmov     eax, 55h\ntest    byte ptr ds:7FFE0308h, 1 ; some test to decide wether to use int 0x2E or syscall?\n                                 ; I don't know why int 0x2E be used. I thought it causes overhead?\njnz     short loc_18009CB15\nsyscall                 \nretn\nloc_18009CB15:          \nint     2Eh             \nretn\nNtCreateFile endp\n</code></pre>\nif anyone knows why the system calls are called like this I would love to know.\nto summarize:\n(32 bit) why is j_Wow64Transition there instead of KiFastSystemcall?\n(64 bit) what is being compared and why?\nthanks.\n",

            "content": "Following cites, answering your first question come from Windows Internals Sixth Edition Part 1, page 225:\n\nWow64 (Win32 emulation on 64-bit Windows) refers to the software that permits the execution\n  of 32-bit x86 applications on 64-bit Windows. It is implemented as a set of user-mode DLLs, with\n  some support from the kernel for creating 32-bit versions of what would normally only be 64-bit\n  data Â­structures [...]\nWow64 hooks all the code paths where 32-bit code would transition to the native 64-bit system\n  or when the native system needs to call into 32-bit user-mode code.\nWow64 transitions\n  to native 64-bit mode, captures the parameters associated with the system call (converting 32-bit\n  pointers to 64-bit pointers), and issues the corresponding native 64-bit system call. When the native\n  system call returns, Wow64 converts any output parameters if necessary from 64-bit to 32-bit formats\n  before returning to 32-bit mode.\n\nSo, when you run some <pre><code>32</code></pre> bit <pre><code>x86</code></pre> program on <pre><code>64</code></pre> bit Windows, such transitions may occur to enable this application to make a native system call.\nAnswer to your second question is already here.\n",
