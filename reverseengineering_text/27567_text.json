    "content": "Given the above code, i am struggling to understand what happens in line 5 and 6\nAs i understand it, in line 5 the Adress of the ESP is loaded into the EAX register. While there may be the value 4 stored at ESP at that point, the adress is not known. So given this uncertainty, how can we know in line 6 what the value of EAX is, if we do not know the adress of ESP in Line 5?\n",

            "text": "Hi and welcome to RE.SE. Basically line 5 reads some sort of size/length field (probably a length of 2-byte elements) and line 6 loads the address of where <pre><code>esp</code></pre> points plus <pre><code>eax</code></pre> elements (likely of 2-byte size) + 4 ... so it's reaching into some sort of structure, I suppose. What's unclear about line 6? The first lines look like the prologue of a function, so <pre><code>esp</code></pre> will point to the top of the stack which we can assume to be already populated ...\n",
