Is there a plugin/workaround to fix this issue?\n",

            "content": "IDA recognizes standard library functions based on IDA's FLIRT libraries. If IDA isn't detecting statically linked standard library functions in your disassembly, it's likely because\n\nYou don't have the correct FLIRT library loaded, or\nIDA doesn't have a FLIRT library for the compiler that created your binary (IDA natively supports these compilers)\n\nYou can solve #1 by opening the Type Libraries subview in IDA (<pre><code>View</code></pre> -> <pre><code>Open subviews</code></pre> -> <pre><code>Type libraries</code></pre>) and pressing Ins and choosing the correct compiler.\nAlternatively, you can solve #2 by using FLAIR to create your own FLIRT library for the correct compiler.\n",
