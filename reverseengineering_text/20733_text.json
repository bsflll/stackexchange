    "content": "I have a function that seems to calculate the length of a string.\nI have made this type declaration and it does kind of work as IDA now flags the string correctly. \n<pre><code>__int64 __fastcall strlen(char strlen_string);</code></pre>\nNow, RAX seems to hold the length of the string. But doing <pre><code>strlen@<rax></code></pre> tells me that 'location rax is not allowed here'. Also, I'd like to flag exactly where the length is being used.\nThis is what I have now:\n<pre><code>mov     rdi, rcx ; strlen_string\ncall    strlen\nmov     [rbp+var001], rax  \n</code></pre>\nand this is what I want to have with the new type declaration:\n<pre><code>mov     rdi, rcx ; strlen_string\ncall    strlen\nmov     [rbp+var001], rax ; string_length\n</code></pre>\nHow can I do that? Is it even possible?\n",

I have also never seen IDA name return value locations so unless I've missed it the whole time, you'd probably need to write your own script for that.\n",

You can, however, write a short IDAPython script for that.\n",
