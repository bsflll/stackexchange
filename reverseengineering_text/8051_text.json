    "content": "I'm debugging an IDAPython script on my host machine and I have IDA running on my Windows VM. The folder containing the IDAPython script on the host machine is shared with the VM.\nThe first time I run the IDAPython script in IDA it works fine. However, for subsequent runs a cached version of the script seems to be running. I end up having to close and re-start IDA in order for the changes to get loaded up. Is there an easier way? I run scripts as <pre><code>File > Open Script file.</code></pre>\n",
