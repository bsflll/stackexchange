    "content": "I have 3 different encrypted configuration files.\nThe first line of the files are always the same (M1.28...).\nFollowing lines are as follow for exmaple:\n\n1N].1f01f (\"1N]\" is the checksum for the previous line, \".\" is the same in each line, \"1f01f\" is different per line, but always the same in the configuration files.)\n256 charactes long string (Algorithm for encrypting / decrypting this content I alredy figured out)\n\nSo we need to find out how the checksum (for example here \"1N]\").\n\nThe checksum changes if any changes in previous line string.\nThe checksum always changes if line number changes\n\nSo the checksum is calculated based on these 2 things.\nI also figured out that only following alphabet is used for all content of each configuration file:\n0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy\nAnd the first character of the checksum has only following alphabet:\n0123456789:;\nCan anyone please help me and find out the calculation algorithm ?\nConfiguration files:\nhttps://anonfiles.com/Pfx6x0h3zc/File1_lng\nhttps://anonfiles.com/Oex1x8hbz2/File2_lng\nhttps://anonfiles.com/a5y1x2h8z0/File3_lng\nSee Screenshot:\nhttps://ibb.co/Pt8YrnV\n",
