    "content": "I have this small subroutine (from Hopper, but IDA is similar):\n<pre><code>             sub_stringbegin:\n000127b8         push       {r11, lr}                                          \n000127bc         add        r11, sp, #0x4\n000127c0         sub        sp, sp, #0x8\n000127c4         str        r0, [r11, #-0x8]\n000127c8         ldr        r0, [r11, #-0x8]\n000127cc         bl         _ZNSs5beginEv@PLT                                   \n000127d0         mov        r3, r0\n000127d4         mov        r0, r3\n000127d8         sub        sp, r11, #0x4\n000127dc         pop        {r11, pc}\n                        ; endp\n</code></pre>\nThe parameter is passed to this in r0.\nWhy is this stored into the stack frame then immediately read out? It seems wasteful.\nI understand that r0-r3 aren't preserved in the ARM calling convention, but in that instance it would be sufficient to either just store it in the stack frame or pop it onto the stack.\nSimilarly, moving r0 into r3 and back again seems wasteful after the branch.\nThis is a ELF executable from a Busybox system.\n",
