The check for 16 is an optimization: if the shift is over 16, the low register value is lost completely, so it can be discarded and replaced by <pre><code>dx>>(shift-16)</code></pre>, while the high register is filled with the sign bit as the result of the <pre><code>cwd</code></pre> instruction.

If <pre><code>cl</code></pre> larger than 16, move <pre><code>dx</code></pre> (upper 16 bit) into <pre><code>ax</code></pre> and convert it to a 32 bit number, subtract 16 from <pre><code>cl</code></pre> because this is implicitly done by ignoring the lower 16 bit, then shift the upper part (which is now <pre><code>dx:ax</code></pre> thanks to the <pre><code>cwd</code></pre>) by that number.\nI didn't try to understand the top part, but my assumption is it does exactly the same for shift widths below 16 bits.\nBasically, it's a 32 bit right shift done in 16 bit architecture.\n",
