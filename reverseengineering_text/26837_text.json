    "content": "I have an ARM based Huawei router and Im trying to do injection vulnerability on page under diagnostics where's \"ping\" feature is. So first I tried this command <pre><code>-c 1 127.0.0.1</code></pre> and it worked\n<pre><code>--- DNS Statistics ---\nServer Response = Non-Existent Domain\nWanIP = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nName = -c 1 127.0.0.1\nAddress = -\nAliases = -\nTime = 15ms\n--- Ping Statistics ---\nOperation failed.\n</code></pre>\nthen I tried this command <pre><code>127.0.0.1; echo -c 4</code></pre> but I get\n<pre><code>Test failed.\n--- Ping Statistics ---\nOperation failed.\n</code></pre>\nand after some more google-ing I found this command <pre><code>ping -c 5 \"$(id)\" and when I click on </code></pre>start ping` it seams that's get stuck in some loop\nI suspect that maybe shell is open, here is how it looks\n\nSo I want to recreate sending that command with curl, I created mine curl like this\n\nI think <pre><code>maintenancend.cgi</code></pre> is resposable for ping requests. In zip you will find <pre><code>Diagnose Ping Configuration.html</code></pre> and ARM <pre><code>web</code></pre> utility which is responsible for\n.cgi web requests\nEdit:\nSo I made request directly to my web ping page and it look's like this\n\nfirst button should be <pre><code>start</code></pre> and second <pre><code>stop</code></pre> but they are in java so I need a way to refer to them by name. Also I found example of POST method on web end here it is\n<pre><code>curl -X POST -F 'name=linuxize' -F 'email=linuxize@example.com' https://example.com/contact.php\n</code></pre>\nbut I need names of buttons/fields to supply and there is non in that \"java button's\". Here you can find emulated web UI\n",
