It assists a reverse engineer in gaining sourcecode (.py's) back from bytecode (.pyc's), in particular it assists when the code that is being reversed has put some effort into trying to stop decompilation using standard toolsets.\n\npycdc, which works better than uncompyle, and is simpler to use than pyRetic\n\nDecompyle++ aims to translate compiled Python byte-code back into valid and human-readable Python source code. While other projects have achieved this with varied success, Decompyle++ is unique in that it seeks to support byte-code from any version of Python.\nDecompyle++ includes both a byte-code disassembler (pycdas) and a decompiler (pycdc).\n\nThe Manyard framework, which is dedicated to Python3\n",

            "content": "A challenge in writing a tool to extract the control flow of python bytecode is that there are so many Python bytecodes versions to choose from, about 25 or so by now (if you include pypy variants).\nThe bytecode in the example graph with its <pre><code>JUMP_IF_FALSE</code></pre> followed by some <pre><code>POP_TOP</code></pre>s and <pre><code>PRINT_NEWLINE</code></pre> instruction, reflect Python before 2.7. \nHowever the example in one of the comments from the Flare_bytecode_graph with its <pre><code>POP_TOP_IF_FALSE</code></pre> is 2.7. Python 3 drops the <pre><code>PRINT_ITEM</code></pre> instruction.\nAnyone writing such a tool will have to come to grips with that; or be happy with living in a single version of Python, for which 2.7 is probably the most popular choice. Or you could ensure that the version of Python you are running matches the bytecode you want to analyze and use the current dis and opcode modules that Python provides. But even here those modules change over time, not in the least being the particular bytecode instructions.\nI wrote a python package called xdis for those who want to work across all versions of Python bytecode, and don't want to be tied with using the same version of Python that the bytecode requires.\nThe next thing that you'll probably want to do in this endeavor is to classify instructions into categories like those which can branch and those that can't and if the branch is conditional or not. \nPython has some lists that cover some of this, (\"hasjrel\", \"hasjabs\") but alas it doesn't have the categories that are most useful. And for possibly historical reasons the categories are lists rather than sets. But again xdis to the rescue here; it fills this information in with sets \"CONDITION_OPS\", \"JUMP_UNCONDITIONAL\" and \"JUMP_OPS\". \nUsing this I've written https://github.com/rocky/python-control-flow which uses xdis and has some rudimentary code that will create a control flow graph and dominator tree for most Python bytecodes. There is some code to create dot files and I use graphviz to display that. I notice that Python, can create a lot of dead code.\nThe intended use of that package is to reconstruct high-level Python control structures. There is some rudimentary control structure detection, although this needs a lot more work. Python control structures are pretty rich when you include the try/while/for \"else\" clauses, and the \"finally\" clauses. Even as is, the annotated control flow of the basic blocks very helpful in manually reconstructing structured control flow.\nWhen this is finished, I can replace a lot of the hacky code for doing that in uncompyle6. \nAnd this leads me to the list of decompilers mentioned in the accepted answer...\nAs stated, those particular versions of uncompyle and uncompyle2 handle only Python 2.7. As suggested, there are older versions that handle multiple Python versions 1.5 to 2.3 or 2.4 or so. That is if you have a Python 2.3 or 2.4 interpreter to run this on.\nBut none of these projects are actively maintained. In uncompyle, there are currently 25 or so issues with the code, many that I have fixed in uncompyle6. And this is for a version of Python that no longer changes! (To be fair though there are some bugs in uncompyle6 that don't exist in uncompyle2. And to address those, I'd really need to put in place that better control flow analysis) \nA number of the bugs in uncompyle could easily be fixed by just doing the same thing that uncompyle6 does, and I think some of that I've noted in the issues. At this point uncompyle2 is much better than uncompyle, and if you are only interested in Python 2.7, that is the most accurate.\nAs for pycdc, while it is pretty good for its relatively small size (compared to uncompyle6), it too isn't maintained to the level that it would need to keep up with Python changes. So it is weak around Python 3.4 or so and gets progressively weaker for later versions. Uncompyle6 is like that too, but currently less so. pycdc has over 60 issues logged against it and I doubt those will be addressed anytime soon. Some of them aren't that difficult to fix. My own (possibly slanted) comparison of those two decompilers is https://github.com/rocky/python-uncompyle6/wiki/pycdc-compared-with-uncompyle6\n",
