I analyzed these binary files with binwalk:\n<pre><code>binwalk -E RDA-533.bin</code></pre>\nThe entropy of these bin files didn't give any information and when I opened these files with IDA, it didn't give subblocks and functions.\nIt seems these files are compressed or encrypted.\nHow can I analyze these bin files as efficiently as possible?\n",
