    "content": "I do kernel debugging by using a virtual com port. One machine (host) is debugging the other machine. I have a remote machine that has IDA, and I wish to connect to the debugging session in the host machine.\nThe setup is as here \nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/remote-debugging-using-kd\nI also followed the guide here. \nSo I setup a server using <pre><code>.server tcp:port=5004</code></pre> (on a kernel kd session). \nWhen I connect remotely by using <pre><code>cdb -remote tcp:Port=5004,Server=HOST</code></pre>\nit works. But when I try to connect using IDA, it doesn't work. \nI have IDA 7.0 x64. I tried to use windbg(x64) debugger with connection string <pre><code>tcp:Port=5004,Server=HOST</code></pre> and parameter <pre><code>-remote</code></pre> and many other variations. It failed to launch in all cases. \nIt usually types: \n<pre><code>Windbg: using debugging tools from 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\Debuggers\\x64\\'\nConnecting in kernel mode with 'tcp:port=5004,server=HOST'\nConnect failed: The parameter is incorrect.\n</code></pre>\nWhat did I do wrong?\nBTW, the version of the debugging tools of IDA and in the host machine is the same.\n",
