    "content": "I am analyzing a binary that is injecting code into another process (i.e., svchost.exe) to make the debugging more tedious. I can attach the new process to a debugger (e.g., ollydbg or the one featured by IDA Pro) and read the assembly code. However, I was wondering whether it is possible or not to take like a snapshot of this so I can later on analyze the code offline (as any other binary).\nThanks!\n",

Hopefully my answer matches your idea:\nDid you already take a look at the OllyDumpEx Plugin?\n\nThis plugin is process memory dumper for OllyDbg and Immunity\n  Debugger. Very simple overview: OllyDumpEx = OllyDump + PE Dumper -\n  obsoleted + useful features\n\nOf course you can simply dump the raw memory as described here with \n<pre><code>ollydbg</code></pre> itself.\n",
