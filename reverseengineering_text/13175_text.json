    "content": "Currently I'm reversing a Windows driver, and there are a lot of structs IDA doesn't automatically recognize, which means I have to import them manually by parsing C header files.\nHowever, there are way too many nested structs/unions and I have to modify each one so IDA can parse it correctly. They go so deep, they make me spend more time on adding structs rather than actually reversing.\nIs there any way of doing this?\nI did try parsing the file I need with Ctrl+F9, but IDA doesn't understand stuff like e.g. <pre><code>#include</code></pre>s and errors, making this option impossible to use\n",
