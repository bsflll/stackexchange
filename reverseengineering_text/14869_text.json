    "content": "I have a Finger pulse oximeter and inside I found a STM32F030C8T6 MCU.\nI'm looking to replace the firmware with one of my own.\nIs it possible to dump the current firmware and restore it, perhaps even to another dev board running the exact same cpu?\nExposed pins: TX, RX, GND, VBAT, 3.3V\nI have a ST-Link V2 clone and am familiar with uploading new firmware, just not downloading existing.\nTo upload new firmware, I run:\n<pre><code>st-util\narm-none-eabi-gdb new_firmware.elf\n(gdb) target extended localhost:4242\n(gdb) load\n</code></pre>\nNot sure what the process is to download existing though. Little help?\nPhotos of the board:\nhttps://i.sstatic.net/74ouV.jpg\nhttps://i.sstatic.net/ycmbU.jpg\n",
