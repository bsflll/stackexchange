            "content": "What may be confusing you is the fact that memory on x86 processors uses little-endian layout. The four bytes <pre><code>31 32 31 32</code></pre>, when interpreted as a 4-byte integer (dword), become <pre><code>0x32313231</code></pre>. If we perform xor operation  on it:\n<pre><code>0x32313231^0x1234567=0x33127756\n</code></pre>\nAnd putting  0x33127756 back into little-endian memory order we get:\n<pre><code>56 77 12 33\n</code></pre>\n",

For less bytes, you may use <pre><code>ax</code></pre>, <pre><code>al</code></pre> or <pre><code>ah</code></pre> and for higher (8-byte) values you may use <pre><code>RAX</code></pre> (on 64 bit systems).
