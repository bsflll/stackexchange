            "content": "There are multiple ways two processes can communicate. The general term for this is IPC (Interprocess Communications). On Windows, the following forms of IPC are commonly used:\n\nCOM \nWindow messages (simple messages for small data amounts, <pre><code>WM_COPYDATA</code></pre> for bigger amounts)\nFile mapping, or named shared memory  \nShared memory\nPipes (named or anonymous)\nSockets (e.g. TCP/IP)\npassing info via command-line arguments (though this is not really IPC)\n\nLess common but still possible:\n\nClipboard\nMailslots\nRPC (remote procedure call)\n\nWhich one is actually used is difficult to say with limited information you provided. Using an API monitor, as suggested by @dsasmblr may give you some hints. You can also just debug or RE the executable which processes user input and see what is being done with the entered information.\n",
