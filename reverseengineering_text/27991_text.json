I understand that the first check would check if it is even if it would be an int, but I don't understand it in this context.\nCould someone explain to me what this does?\n<pre><code>if (((byte)*password & 1) == 0) {\n  buf = password + 1;\n  len = (uint)((byte)*password >> 1);\n}\nelse {\n  len = *(uint *)(password + 4);\n  buf = *(basic_string **)(password + 8);\n}\n\nbp = BIO_new_mem_buf(buf,len);\n</code></pre>\n",

That low bit is not odd or even, it's a flag to decide if the password is a buffer or in a pointer.\nWhen the least significant bit is unset in the first byte, then the password is a buffer with the zero index byte containing the length in the high 7 bits followed directly by the password.\nWhen the least significant bit is set in the first byte, then the length is the first uint after this first byte (4-byte aligned) and password is stored in memory with a pointer.\nThis structure probably will default to the \"buffer\" when the string is less than 128 characters; otherwise, it will be in other memory with a pointer to the memory and a length value.\nstructs like this will not cleanly be represented by most decompilation tools.  There's just not enough information in the assembly to do so.\n",
