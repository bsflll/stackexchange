    "content": "So I'm learning Reverse Engineering / Software cracking.   I have a program that I am practicing on that requires a dongle in order for the program to start.   \nFrom looking through the disassembly of the program I figured out that at some point of the execution the program is calling  winscard.dll    When the dongle is inserted,  in Windows it comes up as a smart card reader.  \nWhen there is no dongle inserted, the software gives you a MessageBox stating The dongle not found.   I've found this execution point in user32.dll, but I can't figure out at which point does the main software call this.\nI'd like to be able to figure out at what point does the software call winscard.dll and what it's looking for as a return.    I've tried to figure this out with Ollydbg and also IDA Pro.    \nAny help for someone trying to learn would be great.\nThanks\n",

If you really want to do it, you have no choice as to first understand how the hardlock works by using a debugger, and then think about a way to remove the protection. Good luck!\n",

Try to set a breakpoint on common methods like <pre><code>SCardEstablishContext</code></pre> and <pre><code>SCardListReaders</code></pre> to find the right check.\nFor example, if no SmartCard is connected to the system at all, <pre><code>SCardListReaders</code></pre> will return 0x8010002E (<pre><code>SCARD_E_NO_READERS_AVAILABLE</code></pre>).\nI'm assuming the second check would involve the <pre><code>mszReaders</code></pre> parameter of the function to check if the right reader is connected.\nIf you knew the location of the 'success'-path (i.e. the address which is executed when everything is fine) you could try to jump there from these locations, else you will have to go though the next branches as well.\nGood luck.\n",
