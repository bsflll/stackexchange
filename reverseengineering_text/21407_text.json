    "content": "This is my first attempt at working with firmware. We have some SNMP cards that are flaky & my ultimate goal is to try to make them better.\nThe current firmware version is 12.06.0069. When downloaded, the firmware folder contains several files:\n\n<pre><code>pwralert.dat</code></pre>\n<pre><code>rom.12.069.0001.3078.sbz2</code></pre>\n<pre><code>rom.55.0.bin</code></pre>\n<pre><code>rom.69.0.bin</code></pre>\n<pre><code>rom.69.0.bin.sbz2</code></pre>\n\nI've been trying to use <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre> to locate the filesystem. So far, the only thing I've found is a few lines that say \"gzip compressed data, from FAT filesystem (MS-DOS, OS/2, NT), NULL date (1970-01-01 00:00:00). Here is how I got there:\n<pre><code>binwalk -e rom.12.069.0001.3078.sbz2\n\ncd _rom.12.069.0001.3078.sbz2.extracted\n\nls\n\n418\n\nbinwalk 418\n</code></pre>\n",
