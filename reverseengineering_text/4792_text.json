            "content": "The problem you face is quite common. A .NET application still loads many native DLLs. Most surprising for many people is that the .NET framework itself is native.\nYou can identify .NET DLLs in WinDbg using the <pre><code>lm v</code></pre> command. In case of a managed DLL it says:\n<pre><code>0:008> lmv m MyApp\nstart    end        module name\n10310000 10574000   MyApp(deferred)             \n    Image path: C:\\...\\MyApp.exe\n    Image name: MyApp.exe\n    Has CLR image header, track-debug-data flag not set\n    Timestamp:        Wed May 21 16:34:02 2014 (537CB95A)\n...\n</code></pre>\nNote the line <pre><code>Has CLR image header</code></pre> in the output. The .NET framework is also loaded in that process, but it is native and does not have such a line:\n<pre><code>0:008> lmv m mscorwks\nstart    end        module name\n79470000 79a1e000   mscorwks   (pdb symbols)          d:\\...\\mscorwks.pdb\n    Loaded symbol image file: C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\mscorwks.dll\n    Image path: C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\mscorwks.dll\n    Image name: mscorwks.dll\n    Timestamp:        Tue Oct 22 03:06:42 2013 (5265CFA2)\n...\n</code></pre>\nThere are good reasons to use native DLLs by a managed application:\n\nbecause it's already implemented and stable\nfor performance reasons: maybe C++ was just faster (maybe not in your case, since you don't seem to be happy with the performance)\n\n<pre><code>PhotoViewer.dll</code></pre> is a native DLL, even if dotPeek says \"Platform: .Net Framework 4.5\". This seems to be a bug, because it also reports .NET for <pre><code>kernel32.dll</code></pre>.\nThe properties <pre><code>Assembly platform</code></pre> and <pre><code>Module Runtime</code></pre> seem to be a bit inconsistent anyway. Here are some combinations I tried that caused results which at least would need some explanation:\n\nkernel32: Platform 4.5, Runtime: none\nJigfdt.fdt100: Platform 2.0, Runtime: 1.1.4322\nFdt.ProfibusTransformers: Platform 4.0, Runtime 2.0.50727\n\nAnother way of detecting .NET is Dependency Walker. A pure .NET assembly typically has only one dependency on <pre><code>mscoree.dll</code></pre> while native DLLs depend on different things.\n",
