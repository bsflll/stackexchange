    "content": "I am using OllyDbg 2.1.0.4 and I cant get any plugins to work. I have tried ODbgScript.1.82, OllyDump v2.1.0.2 and Advanced Labels v1.3.0.9. \nWhen I tried the first two I got Plugins tab greyed out. Advanced Labels makes OllyDbg crash.\nI have set the plugin path to ..\\OllyDbg 2.01\\Plugins in the .ini file. \nWhat is there that I am missing?\n",
