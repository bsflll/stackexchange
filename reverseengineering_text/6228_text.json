    "content": "Wasn't sure where to ask this on stack exchange, so vote to close if you think it is in the wrong place.\nI am analyzing a Windows security patch. Having never examined a windows security patch, and being unaware of their structure I am trying to figure it out for myself.\nIn the patch I have (this week's I.E patch) I have these files:\n<pre><code>_manifest.cix.xml <- obviously a manifest for the patch. \nBinary files numbered 0 - 130 \nDozens of files with similar names to this: amd64_1d07faac344e137a0d122aad24eb4e6e_31bf3856ad364e35_11.2.9600.17280_none_eaadf6b3ac7d9c33.manifest <- I am assuming that these are architecture specific changes. \npackage_1_for_kb2977629~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~11.2.1.0.cat <- A catalog of some sort. Not sure how it's used by the update. \npackage_1_for_kb2977629~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~11.2.1.0.mum <- more information about the update. \n</code></pre>\nMy question is: Is there comprehensive documentation for how all of these parts work together, if not, how do all of these parts work together? \nI imagine, what has to happen is that some mechanism has to tell the update where in the binary to patch, and then one of those files numbered 0-130 is the code to overwrite. I'm sure there is a standard format so that I can interpret these files. \nFor instance: \n<pre><code><?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<assembly xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3\" manifestVersion=\"1.0\">\n  <assemblyIdentity name=\"1d07faac344e137a0d122aad24eb4e6e\" version=\"11.2.9600.17280\" processorArchitecture=\"amd64\" language=\"neutral\" buildType=\"release\" publicKeyToken=\"31bf3856ad364e35\" versionScope=\"nonSxS\" />\n  <deployment />\n  <dependency discoverable=\"false\">\n    <dependentAssembly dependencyType=\"install\">\n      <assemblyIdentity name=\"Microsoft-Windows-IE-MemoryAnalyzer\" version=\"11.2.9600.17280\" processorArchitecture=\"amd64\" language=\"neutral\" buildType=\"release\" publicKeyToken=\"31bf3856ad364e35\" versionScope=\"nonSxS\" />\n    </dependentAssembly>\n  </dependency>\n</assembly>\n</code></pre>\nWould seem to suggest that we are about to patch assembly 1d07faac344e137a0d122aad24eb4e6e which might be named \"Microsoft-Windows-IE-MemoryAnalyzer. That's just a guess! I don't see any reference in here to the code to patch. I imagine one way of doing that is to just read through these manifests in order, and apply the patches in the order the manifests are read. First manifest gets binary file 0 and so on. That seems janky, and I bet I'm wrong about that. \nBased on the size of the files themselves, I would imagine that they aren't rewriting the whole module, although they might be compressed. Without any reference I haven't a clue as to their structure. I imagine there would be snippets of code, and offsets for where to rewrite the DLLs/Exes in question. Of course I ran strings on the binaries, but didn't find anything. \nWhat I would most like to figure out through this is which particular functions are being patched in IE.\n",

            "content": "I just downloaded the KB2977629 patch file (IE11-Windows6.1-KB2977629-x64.MSU). It looks like the information about which file corresponds to what is inside the <pre><code>_manifest_.cix.xml</code></pre> file (there is a single, very long, line inside). You have for example:\n<pre><code><File id=\"214\" name=\"amd64_microsoft-windows-s..-downlevel.binaries_31bf3856ad364e35_6.3.9600.17280_none_5f668c1aff756211\\msspellcheckingfacility.exe\" length=\"940032\" time=\"130528725776317394\" attr=\"32\"> ... </File>\n<Delta>\n  <Source type=\"PA30\" name=\"35\"> (...) </Source>\n  <Basis file=\"214\"/>\n</Delta>\n</code></pre>\n35 seems to be the name of one of the files in the archive. These files begin with 4 bytes that read \"PA30\", so it looks like a specific format. I've found some reference to this patching system in a patent application: http://www.google.com/patents/US20070260653.\nActually, most Windows updates do not use this delta patching system, but rather contain the full versions of each file they are going to replace.\n",

If you look at the <pre><code>tbl_Content</code></pre> table, you'll see some records where the <pre><code>Content</code></pre> field starts with the telling <pre><code>PA31</code></pre> signature.\nNow, TFS is all managed code. It could be that TFS taps into <pre><code>mspatchX.dll</code></pre> for resolving those records. Or alternatively, there might be a managed (read: easy to reverse) implementation of the PA31 decoding logic... Stay tuned.\n\nUPD: TFS makes a P/Invoke call into <pre><code>msdelta.dll</code></pre>. Here is a managed API wrapper, reverse engineered out of TFS' code: https://gist.github.com/sevaa/a49457319946379b60e885f6b5a9f5ca The debug symbols for msdelta.dll are out on the MS Symbol server.
