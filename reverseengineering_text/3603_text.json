    "content": "test Platform is \n32 bit Linux ELF and 32 bit Windows PE.\nI use IDC script to extract all the functions from binary and dump \ninto a file, then do the analysis based on the examples in IDA Pro book.\nBut I don't know how to extract .data .rodata and .bss\nsections from ELF file using IDC script.\nCurrently I use IDA Pro to create a asm file, and use Python script to \ndo the string parser work, extracting .data .rodata and .bss\nsections from this asm file.\nBasically It works fine, but a really tedious modification work is required, \nand as my test base is relatively large(notepad++ and others..), I have to\nspend lots of time do modify work to correctly extract this three sections.\nMy question is \"is there any idc script/idapython script can extract .data .rodata and .bss\nsections from ELF file?\" and any solutions on Windows are also welcomed.\nThank you!\n",

The challenge for items in these sections is to properly determine the size of each item and correctly choose <pre><code>db/dw/dd/...</code></pre> Dumping raw bytes with <pre><code>db</code></pre> may be the simplest approach here.\n",
