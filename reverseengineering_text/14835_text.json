    "content": "I have to write an <pre><code>IDAPython</code></pre> script and I came across many false positives in IDA's function/code/data recognition.\nCase 1 - Invalid function's end (rpcrt4.dll):\nIn some DLLs (especially in rpcrt4.dll) IDA recognize indirect/dereference calls as function's end and then misidentifies the next instructions (IDA's <pre><code>no-return</code></pre> kernel analysis flag is of course disabled so it is not the problem). \nExample (the unknown data is a valid <pre><code>jmp</code></pre> instruction):\n\nCase 2 - Data in <pre><code>.text</code></pre> section is identified as code (ExplorerFrame.dll):\nMost of Microsoft's DLLs are compiled with data at the beginning of the <pre><code>.text</code></pre> section and IDA successfully identifies it as data. However, sometimes IDA fail to treat these <pre><code>heads</code></pre> as data and treats them like code (my guess is that it has something to do with the misidentified <pre><code>ret</code></pre> instruction).\nExample:\n\nCase 3 - code inside a function is identified as data (mimeTools.dll):\nThis case is a little bit weird because I don't see any reason to make this mistake. As you can clearly see IDA identifies code as data inside the function (the misidentified code is a lea instruction).\nExample:\n\nCase 4 - mixed misidentified code (igc32.dll):\nNo need to elaborate, in the following example it should be all code but it gets identified as data:\n\nAnd another example:\n\nSo obviously my question is: did anyone experience one of these problem's before and know a possible fix to some of these problems? I need a solution that don't involve human interaction and can be applied using an IDAPython script.\nThanks in advance.\n",

            "content": "Disassembling an executable is hard. It is especially hard for machines to detect edge cases and similar nuances about small portions of code.\nThis is something IDA (and any other complete disassembler) puts a lot of effort into, but based on design decisions and heuristics used in different disassemblers, results vary. IDA has seen a consistent improvement in addressing such as similar issues throughout version updates.\nIt is however unrealistic to find and properly address all such cases, so these issues are prominent and are usually addresses manually or in a semi-manual manner. I bet there are plenty of plugins and scripts similar to Extrapass but perhaps better maintained. You're also encouraged to create one yourself, that addresses the issues you encounter.\n",

If time is not of the essence, you can use a disassembling-technique following all available paths (most likely based on an IR). It is not anywhere near performant, but the distinction between code and data as well as the resolving of indirect branches are a plus.</span>",

My intent is to write a script that improve the recognition, I know that I won't be able to get 100% success.My question's purpose was to ask the fellows around if they experienced these issues and have an answer for some of them - that's why I asked \"did anyone experience one of these problem's before and know a possible fix to some of these problems\".</span>",

I can offer an easy fix that does a partial job (it was good enough for my needs at the time).\nA fairly simple fix to implement using IDAPython is applying the following logic:\n\niterate over all addresses\nif addresses contains data and has a code xref pointing to it -> convert to code\nretry defining functions adjacent to the correction you just made\nif addresses contains code and has a data xref\npointing to it -> convert to data\n\nKeep in mind this is a general guideline to what you need to implement. The actual implementation requires some fiddling.\nThis doesn't solve everything but it solves many of the problems.\nIt helped me sort through a very troublesome IDB.\nHope this is what you were looking for.\n",
