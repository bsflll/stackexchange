            "content": "The classes <pre><code>0</code></pre>, <pre><code>1</code></pre>, <pre><code>2</code></pre> and <pre><code>3</code></pre> show patterns matching that of binscure, not Allatori. There are multiple open issues for java-deobfuscator on adding support for binscure, but there is no active development on the deobfuscator repo.\nAdditionally if you look around you'll find some code that looks like:\n<pre><code>method public static a (Lcom/bC; a)Lcom/bC;\n    getstatic 1.20 I\n    ifge A\n    invokedynamic while ()V handle H_INVOKESTATIC java/yeet.\\u0020̸̸̷͔̻̠̖̼̖̅̍ͭ̈̋ͩ̈́͊̏ͬͬ̆̀̋̍͐͛ͣ͘|̔̽̔ͥ̆̑̀ͨ̈̒̿҉̪͙̭̠̻̹̗͍͇̞̟͙̫̝̟̀\\u0020̸̥͔̭͈̈̈̾ͮ̃̾̾͛̀̍͐ͦ̾ͨ̍̉̓̈̚͝͝s̷ͨ̂̇ͨ̓́̋͗̈̒̑ͩ̆͊͏̩̯̩̙̝̯̣̪͉̳̘e̡͋̋̄̄ͧ̃ͪͨ͠͡҉̪̱̥̤͇̹͔͎̫͔̯͜ (I)V args  end\n    invokedynamic fuck ()B handle H_INVOKESTATIC a.a (IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII)Ljava/lang/Throwable; args  end\n    pop\nA:\n    aload a\n    areturn\nB:\nend\n</code></pre>\nThe <pre><code>yeet/fuck</code></pre> names are hardcoded names used by some of binscure's transformers.\nSo yeah, this isn't Allatori. What are your options (at the time of writing this)?\n\nWrite your own transformers (either for java-deobfuscator or make your own project)\nUse narumii's deobfuscator\n\nBe VERY careful when using narumii's deobfuscator. Only use it in a virtual machine, since it actually will attempt to load the classes to \"sandbox\" some of the decryption logic.\n",
