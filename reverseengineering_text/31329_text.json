    "content": "I'm trying to analyze a GCC static library which is a part of a commercial software.\nFirst, I used <pre><code>IDA Pro</code></pre> to analyze entire Lib file, but it could find only object files and was unable to disassemble objects.\nSo, I extracted all of the inside objects by <pre><code>ar -x</code></pre>. Next, I used <pre><code>binwalk</code></pre>, It shows multiple <pre><code>Zlib Compressed</code></pre> regions next to the 64-bytes header (EFI x64). Is this ordinary in static libraries (existence of several zlib region)? Is it a protection method?\nAnyway, I used <pre><code>zlib-flate -uncompress</code></pre> to extract sections in one of the objects after separating its zlib regions (by <pre><code>dd</code></pre>), and used <pre><code>IDA Pro</code></pre> to disassemble the output. Although, some of the sections contain some valid strings (Unix Path), <pre><code>IDA Pro</code></pre> shows invalid codes.\nThanks in advance.\n",

I tried <code>readelf -e file.obj</code>. it shows each Zlib-Compressed region is an <code>elf</code> section which has been determined in the sections header (Because offsets of sections are equal to offsets of <code>binwalk</code> zlib regions). Their name is like a function's name. A weird point is that all main sections (e.g. <code>.text</code>, <code>.data</code>,...) are zero-sized.</span>",

So depending on the kind of library you are looking at, chances are you are literally looking at data blobs, especially with those curious details about <code>.data</code> and <code>.text</code> sections.</span>",
