    "content": "I have an encrypted firmware based on 2 files uImage (kernel) and rootfs (filesystem) and I have got the encryption keys from someone who cracked it. However I don’t know where to start so I can mount those somehow and start modifying them. mkimage/dumpimage doesn’t return the header of the uImage however there is a header for the rootfs. I tried decrypting them but got nowhere as I don’t know which part is encrypted. If someone can please help. Thank you\nThis is the uImage output (dumpimage does not return anything :\n\nThis is rootfs from dumpimage:\n<pre><code>$ dumpimage -l rootfs  \nImage Type:   Freescale IMX Boot Image  \nImage Ver:    2 (i.MX53/6/7 compatible)  \nMode:         PLUGIN  \nPlugin Data Size:     302835498 Bytes = 295737.79 KiB = 288.81 MiB  \nPlugin Code Size:     0 Bytes = 0.00 KiB = 0.00 MiB  \nPlugin Load Address:  6c9053ca  \nPlugin Entry Point:   3533782f  \nU-Boot Data Size:     302835498 Bytes = 295737.79 KiB = 288.81 MiB  \nU-Boot Load Address:  6c9053ca  \nU-Boot Entry Point:   3533782f  \n\n$ dumpimage -l uImage  \nGP Header: Size 9411c123 LoadAddr 7f1c7cb5  \n</code></pre>\n",
