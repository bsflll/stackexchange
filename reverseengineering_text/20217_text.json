Data can be embedded in code, and the same sequence of bytes may be disassembled in different ways. Furthermore, code may be self-modifying. See \n\nWhy is disassembly not an exact science?\nSoundness of ARM disassembly\n\nFunction start detection in stripped binaries is an undecidable problem.\n\nArchitecture Agnostic Function Detection in Binaries\n\nCompilation is a lossy process, particularly when optimization takes place. Therefore decompilation cannot be fully automated and requires human decision making.\n\n\nCertainly, full automatic decompilation of arbitrary machine-code\n  programs is not possible, it is an undecidable problem like most\n  problems of program transformation. So, from the point of view of\n  theory no algorithm exists for  decompilation of all possible\n  programs. However, this (obvious) answer has no practical importance —\n  many problems are undecidable or NP-complete yet there exist\n  algorithms giving precise or approximate solutions for practical\n  important cases. Thus the challenges of decompilation are in\n  identification of subclasses of low-level programs and developing\n  methods and algorithms targeted for these particular classes. The\n  methods may even ask a human expert for help at key points. [ 1 ]\n\n\nCertainly, fully automated decompilation of arbitrary machine-code programs is not possible -- this problem is theoretically equivalent to the Halting Problem, an undecidable problem in Computer Science. What this means is that automatic (no expert intervention) decompilation cannot be achieved for all possible programs that are ever written. Further, even if a certain degree of success is achieved, the automatically generated program will probably lack meaningful variable and function names as these are not normally stored in an executable file (except when stored for debugging purposes). [ 2 ]\n\nWhy can't native machine code be easily decompiled?\n\nMachine learning - in this case, supervised learning - can simplistically be thought of  as using algorithms to construct models from data, and the constructed model is then used for prediction or classification. When we say that an algorithm is is learning from data, it means that an algorithm is building a mathematical model by optimizing a loss function for the given data. There is no mind, no thought, no thinking machine. Algorithms do not look at anything, nor do they study anything.\n\n\n1) C Decompilation: Is It Possible?\n2) Is Decompilation Possible?\n",
