  "content": "I have read the NAND memory MT29F2G08ABAEAWP contents via the RT809F programmer from IP Camera,\nwhen I have written the program (.bin) to the new NAND memory the Mac address and serial number of original camera has been copied to the new one.\n\nWhen I have modified the Mac address and serial number from the buffer contents of the programmer then written to the new NAND memory the camera no longer works.\n\nPlease advise who can I change the Mac address and serial number manually without affecting the program?\n\nRegards\n\n",
