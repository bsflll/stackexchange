      "text": "Note that developer can decide to deliver different app versions based on country, device  manufacturer, device model, ... Additionally beta versions can be released to a small percentage of users. Hence that someone is able to use a dark mode in an app does not have to mean that the app on your device has this feature, too. Usually reverse engineering an app takes you longer than it takes for the features you are looking for to be released on all phones. Especially Facebook apps are heavily obfuscated generated code that takes days or weeks to understand just the basics.",
