  "content": "I usually work with two or three IDBs open at the same time which are linked between themselves (basically the main .exe, and DLLs it loads).\n\nHowever, every now and then I open different files to take a look, and my \"recently used IDBs\" quickly gets filled up and the IDBs I work with disappear.\n\nIs there any way I can make IDA stick those IDBs at the top of the \"recently opened files\" so I can access them easily?\n\n",
