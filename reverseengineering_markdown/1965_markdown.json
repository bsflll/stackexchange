  "content": "I have an android application that uses a shared library which I would like to step through with a debugger.  I've had success using IDA 6.3 to debug executables with the android_server debug server included with IDA but haven't gotten it to work with shared objects yet.  \n\nFor a specific example, suppose I have the following Java code (This comes from the hellojni example in the Android NDK):\n\n```\nSystem.loadLibrary(\"hello-jni\");\ntv.setText( stringFromJNI() );\n\n```\nWith the JNI C code as:\n\n```\njstring\nJava_com_example_hellojni_HelloJni_stringFromJNI( JNIEnv* env, jobject thiz )\n{\n        return (*env)->NewStringUTF(env, \"Hello from JNI !\");\n}\n\n```\nIf the java code is run only when the application starts up, how can I break in the function Java_com_example_hellojni_HelloJni_stringFromJNI?\n\n",
