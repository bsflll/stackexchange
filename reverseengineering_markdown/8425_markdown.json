  "content": "I read the recent article \"Longest x86 Instruction\" \n\nhttp://blog.onlinedisassembler.com/blog/?p=23\n\nI attempted to reproduce the curious disassembly issue on a Win7x86 development platform using masm and as the article suggested, redunant prefixes.\n\nTalk is cheap, so here's a toy program (masm32):\n\n```\n.386 .model flat, stdcall\n\noption casemap:none\n\nincludelib \\x\\x\\kernel32.lib\nincludelib \\x\\x\\user32.lib\n\ninclude \\x\\x\\kernel32.inc\ninclude \\x\\x\\user32.inc\ninclude \\x\\x\\windows.inc\n\n.code\n\nstart:\n\ndb 0F3h\ndb 0F3h\ndb 0F3h\ndb 0F3h\ndb 0F3h\ndb 0F3h\ndb 0F3h\n;...6 more bytes later\ndb 089h\ndb 0E5h\n\nend start\n\ninvoke ExitProcess, NULL\n\n```\nAfter linking and assembling, I opened the resulting executable in windbg. \n\nTo my disappointment, when I single step, unassemble the $exentry, etc. windbg simply sees the prefixes/bytes as individual instructions, says 'to hell with it' and executes only the valid instructions.\n\nIs there something I'm missing?\n\n",
