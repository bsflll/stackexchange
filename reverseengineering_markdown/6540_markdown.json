  "content": "When trying to write an instruction set analysis tool for disassembled code (https://superuser.com/a/832440/384221) I have found opcode MOVABS which was not included in my opcode source database (Shirk's gas.vim file) and I am not sure in which architecture it has been introduced.\n\nAccording to What is the meaning of movabs in gas/x86 AT&T syntax? and other sources it seems that the instruction has been introduced before 64-bit architectures. But was it with i686 or earlier?\n\nThank you.\n\n",

It's still the same standard MOV opcode.\n\nI'm not sure where you got the notion that it was introduced before x64, it's obviously not correct. For example, the Solaris x86 manual mentions: \"movabs valid only under –m64\".\n\n",
