  "content": "I am very interested in about take root of Android phones and I'm noob of reverse engineering.\n\nI have some of old Android devices that already unused.  Some Android devices provide easier path to root with fastboot mode, But Some of others disabled it by vendor.\n\nWhat should I find to root non-easier Android device that disabled fastboot mode by vendor?\nIs it something privilege escalation?\n\nI have no idea what should I find and How to find it.\n\nThanks for regards.\n\n",
