  "content": "TAP cards have been around for a while now, but there seems to be very little information around that explains how they work, particularly by the LA transit system.  \n\nHere is an article saying that they are set to replace the MetroCard for the New York transit system with TAP:  \n\nMTA gets ready to dump the Metrocard\n\n\n\nThe official Transit Access Pass website has this to say:\n\nWhat's TAP?\n\nExcerpt:\n\nIt is some sort of contactless smart card, but looking around using that as a search term, TAP seems not to be listed as using the ISO 14443 standard.  Yet maybe it does.\n\nQuestion:  How do they work?\n\n",
