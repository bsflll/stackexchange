  "content": "Normally if I want to see the binary and resources for an app, I connect my iPhone to my Macbook, sync with iTunes, and then all of my apps are in /Users/cybergibbons/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications as .ipa files which I can extract as zips.\n\nI have recently been given access to a beta version of an app via TestFlight. Whilst TestFlight is in the above location, there is no evidence of the beta app.\n\nHow do I go about getting the .ipa for the TestFlight app?\n\n",
