  "content": "I'm trying to reverse engineer an Android app. I've tried using several decompilers, and while I'm getting java source codes to varying levels of accuracy, I'm not able to convert the resource IDs to the resource strings. In the Java source, all I'm getting is the 32bit resource ID, which is meaningless to me. Is there anyway to get the resource string from this resource ID? I did not find any R.java in any of the decompiled code.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

That's it.\n\nP.S.: You'll need to convert the 32bit resource id into HEX before you search for it.\n\n",

      "content": "Yunchao Guan's answer is correct.\n\nFor example, i recently unpacked an application (zaka.com.amperemeter-1.apk, yes, it's zaka.com, not com.zaka as it shoule be) to improve the bad German translation that had been done by google translate.\n\nUnzipping the .apk, using dex2jar on the .dex, and procyon on the resulting jar gave me, for example:\n\n```\nunzip/procyon/gluapps/Ampere/meter/Activity/MainActivity.java:240\n    return this.getString(2131099670)\n\n```\nALSO, procyon gave me an R.java that has a name for that number:\n\n```\nunzip/procyon/gluapps/Ampere/meter/R.java:909\n    public static final int Usb_plug_type = 2131099670;\n\n```\nSo you really should get a R.java source code from decompiling. In case you don't, apktool d zaka.com.amperemeter-1.apk gives you several files that have the same number, in hex, in smali files:\n\n```\nwork/smali/gluapps/Ampere/meter/R$string.smali:20\n   .field public static final Usb_plug_type:I = 0x7f060016\nwork/smali/gluapps/Ampere/meter/Activity/MainActivity.smali:477\n    const v1, 0x7f060016\n\n```\nthese are basically the same as in the decompiled java files. Additionally:\n\n```\nwork/res/values/public.xml:473\n    <public type=\"string\" name=\"Usb_plug_type\" id=\"0x7f060016\" />\n\n```\nThis is the key that maps to the actual, translated, string in the language-dependent file:\n\n```\nwork/res/values-de/strings.xml:25\n    <string name=\"Usb_plug_type\">USB</string>\n\n```\nSo, with a normal apk, if you use unzip/dex2jar/decompiler/apktool correctly, everthing should be there. If not, it would be best if you provided a link to the apk, because something weird might be going on with yours, but there's no way to tell unless you give us a chance to look at your specific apk.\n\n",
