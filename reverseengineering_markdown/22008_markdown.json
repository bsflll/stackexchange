      "content": "1) ollydbg and x64dbg are debuggers (with limited functionality to annotate knowledge).Their strength is dynamic reverse engineering.\n\nIDA and Ghidra are reverse engineering tools (IDA with some functionality for debugging). They are for static reverse engineering.\n\nBoth kinds of tools are useful, both have their places. Generally, the more complex a target is, the more you need IDA/Ghidra in addition to a debugger.\n\n2) I would actually start out by writing  your own crackme, starting close to „hello world“, and then gradually increasing the difficulty. First get to know the tools and concepts without additional complexity.\n\n",
