  "content": "I was working with an old ios game, and found that it saved most of its data (players, worlds, anything in-between) in MDB files.. titled data.mdb and lock.mdb. There is a pair for every object type (A players save data, world settings and config, world data (terrain))\n\nAt first I thought it was some strange microsoft database thing, but apparently they are PSI binary files after doing some more digging. I could be wrong.\n\nI am trying to understand how these formats work and if there is a particular known way to decompile them into something readable? Or are these a type of cryptographically sealed binary file, where they are compiled with a hash / password / key?\n\nI honestly have no clue where to start.\n\nHere is a sample from \"world_db\" which I assume represents the save data of the entire worlds terrain and items: https://github.com/MisterSirCode/world_db\n\nIf anyone could give me some clues or potentially has any information about these MDB files or PSI v1 binary files I would appreciate it.\n\nAll I can assume is that lock.db is the binary passcode / hash if it is a sealed binary file, since its so much smaller than the data.db file\n\n\n\nThe lock.db file just looks like a 4 letter term repeated randomly\n\n\n\nSomething else that might be related? https://github.com/LMDB\n\n",
