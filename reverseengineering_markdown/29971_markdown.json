  "content": "Why is there 2 places for structures in IDA: Local Types and Structures?\n\nWhat are Local Types local to?\n\nWhy do I have to synchronize a type in the Local Types window to the idb in order to edit it? Isn't it already in the database? It is certainly in the .idb database, isn't it?\n\nWhen I dump typeinfo to the .idc file(File > Produce File > Dump typeinfo to IDC File...) and then import it in the same or another database, why instead of importing defined Local Types to the Local Types window and defined structures in the Structures window to the Structures, it imports everything to both places?\n\n",

I don't think I'm violating any sort of important confidentiality considerations by simply copying and pasting the response here; I apologize in advance to Hex-Rays if I misjudged that:\n\n",

For example, the fact that it's impossible to refer to a member of a C type by its id is irrelevant: it's just a problem in their C-type system. There's nothing preventing them to make a single type system that supports both ways: and has the ability to refer to members of a type by id. You already can import C-type to the Structures and edit either of those 2, and the other one will update accordingly.",
