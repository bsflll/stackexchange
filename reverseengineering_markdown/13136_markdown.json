  "content": "I was disassembling a function using IDA's pseudocode view and for some reason, IDA did not associated labels to some of the variables\n\n\n\nTo fix that, I added some comments so I can work with it.\n\nIs there a way to manually add such variables ?\n\nI saw a SE post saying to make a script, I'm a new IDA user, I don't really want to bother with that yet.\n\nIf it's not possible or \"\"\"complicated\"\"\" (don't throw me rocks please ;) ) that's no big deal, the function is not that large I can work on it without problems, I'm asking this to get the hang of IDA or to get a general approach of this problem.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n",
