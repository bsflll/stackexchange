      "content": "Check out this script I made, it takes care of your ENTIRE plugin folder. Helps on fresh OS installs for sure.\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/\n\nfind . -name \"*.bundle\" -execdir sudo xattr -cr \\;\nfind . -name \"*.VST\" -execdir sudo xattr -cr \\;\nfind . -name \"*.vst3\" -execdir sudo xattr -cr \\;\nfind . -name \"*.component\" -execdir sudo xattr -cr \\;\nfind . -name \"*.dpm\" -execdir sudo xattr -cr \\;\n\nfind . -name \"*.bundle\" -execdir sudo codesign -f -s - {} \\;\nfind . -name \"*.VST\" -execdir sudo codesign -f -s - {} \\;\nfind . -name \"*.vst3\" -execdir sudo codesign -f -s - {} \\;\nfind . -name \"*.component\" -execdir sudo codesign -f -s - {} \\;\nfind . -name \"*.dpm\" -execdir sudo codesign -f -s - {} \\;\n\n```\nUseful as it is, it could use some improvement. I would like to further expand this script to include clearing/setting permissions to allow for this to work. With my current knowledge of how this works, you have tp use a tool like Batchmod to set permissions for each individual file, tediously, then running this script afterwards.\n\nIf anyone comes across this in the future, feel free to contribute.\n\n",
