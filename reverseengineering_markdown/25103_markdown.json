  "content": "I have decompiled a DLL, and in the Symbol tree, I have clicked a function.\nThis function looks like this in the Decompile window:\n\n```\nundefined4 process_something(undefined4 param_1,undefined4 param_2)\n{\n      thunk_FUN_1017e9e0(param_1,param_2);\n      return 0;\n}\n\n```\nI have right-clicked on FUN_1017e9e0, then I selected \"Rename Function\".\nI have renamed it \"process_something_internal\", and \"Namespace\" was set to Global.\n\nNow the function looks like this:\n\n```\nundefined4 process_something(undefined4 param_1,undefined4 param_2)\n{\n      process_something_internal1(param_1,param_2);\n      return 0;\n}\n\n```\nHowever, when I double click \"process_something_internal1\", it takes me to the function:\n\n```\nvoid FUN_1017e9e0(undefined4 param_1,undefined4 param_2)\n{\n    //do something\n    return;\n }\n\n```\nWhy has the function not be renamed as well?\n\nThank you!\n\n",

When you double-click on the thunk, Ghidra is bypassing it and taking you directly to the thunked function.\n\nIn the Ghidra symbol table, you should see 2 separate entries for \"process_something_internal1\" (thunk) and \"FUN_1017e9e0\" (thunked function).\n\n",
