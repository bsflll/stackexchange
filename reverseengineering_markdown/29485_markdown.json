  "content": "gdb-peda shows a very useful context each time it stops (b, si, etc.), but sometimes I don't want it.  Is there any way to quiet it so it won't show the context automatically (unless prompted context)?\n\n--\n\nSince there's no out of the box answer, I'll take, for the bounty, a custom or roll-your-own solution (e.g. a script or special command).\n\n",

In the absence of that, we can invoke those commands manually.  Note that gdb doesn't seem to allow nested defines, so we can't script the (re)defines themselves.\n\n",
