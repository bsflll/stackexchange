      "content": "\"File Size\" is the size of the file on disk, according to the file system.\n\n\"PE Size\" is the value of the SizeOfImage field in the IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER structure in the PE file. Its value is calculated as described here:\n\nSizeOfImage can be less than the file size if, for example, the file has an overlay appended to it.\n\nSizeOfImage can be greater than the file size if, for example, the sections' virtual sizes are larger than their raw sizes, as is often the case for compressed sections.\n\n",
