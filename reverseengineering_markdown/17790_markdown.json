  "content": "IDA shows this following code in separate subroutine. \n\nAssembly:\n\n```\nsub_180049410 proc near\njmp     rax\nsub_180049410 endp\n\n```\nPseudo-Code:\n\n```\n__int64 __usercall sub_180049410@<rax>(__int64 (*a1)(void)@<rax>)\n{\n  return a1();\n}\n\n```\nThe previous subroutine calls it as (off_180052510 and sub_180049410 are same)\n\n```\nmov     rcx, [rsp+0C8h+var_88]\nmov     rax, [rcx]\nmov     r8, rsi\nmov     edx, 5\nmov     rax, [rax+18h]\ncall    cs:off_180052510\nmov     rcx, [rsp+0C8h]\ntest    eax, eax\njs      loc_18000969B\n\n```\nSo, why IDA shows it in separate subroutine? Can I join that in it's previous function?\n\n",

      "content": "No. Ofc, you can modify assembly in IDA with API funcs by yourself, but there is no need in this. call instruction is not just jumping to code, it also modifies stack, pushing there return address, so called function can correctly return (read https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_26.html ). Thats why this code is shown in another subroutine, and thats why just inlining jmp rax to code won't be correct in this case.\n\nAlso, rax value will be known only in runtime, so IDA's static analysis can't provide information, which function exactly will be called here. So sub_180049410 its just function to call some other function via pointer to it.\n\n",
