  "content": "If I go to a random blog or informational website say, having pages with information, a sidebar with an overview of the archives. I know that this website is built with a CMS. How can I get to know which CMS was used?\n\nSo I'm looking for basic, general typicals of common CMSs, so that we can get to know the working power behind any informational website or blog.\n\nFor example, a typical might be that WordPress adds such a line to the HTML:\n\n```\n<meta name=\"generator\" content=\"WordPress 3.5.1\" />\n\n```\n",
