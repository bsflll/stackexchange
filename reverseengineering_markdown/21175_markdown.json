  "content": "I am trying to extract the firmware for a Panasonic WV-S2131L ip camera. It comes as a .zip file that contains a .img file. I have tried many methods to try to analyze this file and I have found nothing of value.\n\nBinwalk returned absolutely nothing\n\nxxd at least gave me back the firmware version\n\nA complete hex dump revealed no recognizable string\n\nFDisk said there was no recognizable file system\n\n7zip thinks it's corrupt\n\nI'm thinking that it has to be some type of binary image but since no tools, I've tried have given any indication that any recognizable partitions or files existed, maybe it's obfuscated or has some type of encryption.\n\n",

      "text": "What you have may be some sort of updater archive rather than the firmware in usable form.   One check would be that if the zip isn't much smaller than the contained image that indicates a high level of entropy compared to executable code meaning the image is probably compressed and/or encrypted.   Your best bet may to be physically open the product to see what sort of processor it uses, and see if there is a flash chip perhaps containing the executable version of the firmware in a more direct form.   But runtime decompression or decryption by a boot ROM or even hardware is possible....",
