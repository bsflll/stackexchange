  "content": "I have blocks 1 to 4 of an RFID card with 4-byte Hex data each. Block 5 contains some sort of 4-byte Hex data checksum which I would like to know how it was derived.\n\nPlease see the 3 sample data below:\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nPlease note that only changes in block 3 1st and 2nd column data resulted in the changes shown in block 5 data in each of the sample.\n\nCould anyone figure out how the checksums were calculated?\n\nMany thanks in advance.\n\n",

The Bytes are generated by hardware (card writer) The only way I can manipulate the Bytes in  Block 3 is to rewrite the Bytes to the RFID card using another card writer, which I can readily do. Please note that a change to any of the Bytes in Blocks 1-4 requires a corresponding change to Block 5  Bytes as well.",
