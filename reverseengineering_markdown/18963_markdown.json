  "content": "When I try to load a program to radare2 debug mode, most of the time I get the following error:\n\n```\n$sudo r2 -d a.out\nHello world!= attach 2851 2851\nCannot open '/proc/2851/maps': No such file or directory\nHello world!asm.bits 64\nCannot open '/proc/2851/maps': No such file or directory\n-- Now i'm like an evil engineer. MUAHAHAH\n[0x00000000]>\n\n```\nRadare2 works but doesn't load the program. Should I need to configure something else on the system?\n\nThis is on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS.\n\n",
