  "content": "I am trying to inject a jump instruction into another process (External injection), although the injection operation has been completed the address was not correct.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nunsigned int addr = 0x0048DA03;\nunsigned int jumpToAddr = 0x0048D9B2;\nunsigned char command[] = { 0xEA };\nWriteProcessMemory(hProcess, (void*)addr, (void*)command, sizeof(command), NULL); // this line for jmp\nWriteProcessMemory(hProcess, (void*)addr, (void*)jumpToAddr, sizeof(jumpToAddr), NULL); // this line for the address\n\n```\nThe result:\n\n\n\nAs you see, after executing that code, the jump address is wrong.\n\nAlso, the same problem occurs with the following code:\n\n```\nvoid* reservedMemAddress = VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, NULL, 100, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);\nif (reservedMemAddress) {\n    WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, (void*)addr, (void*)command, sizeof(command), NULL);\n    WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, (void*)addr, (void*)reservedMemAddress, sizeof(reservedMemAddress), NULL);\n}\n\n```\n",
