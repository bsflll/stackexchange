  "content": "I am working on an obfuscated binary. IDA did pretty good job distinguishing code from junk. However, I had started messing around with a function changing from code to data and  vice versa and completely messed the function up and destroyed the way it looked like. I don't want to start new database on the executable and re-do all my work. \n\nIs there a way to re-analyse a single function and return it to the way it looked like after initial analysis?\n\n",

IDA almost give you ability of doing anything wih obfuscated code to help you to understand code correctly.\n\nAddendum\nAfter converting to C (code), do Alt+P to create/edit function. In addition, rebuild layout graph by go to Layout view, right clicking empty space and selecting \"Layout graph\".\n\n",
