      "content": "You can extract some file from .exe using pyi-archive_viewer, modify them and put back. But be attention, all files in .exe are compressed using DEFLATE (zlib.compress() - you can watch this in source code of PyInstaller). So, when putting back you need compress file to the exact size, that was when you extracted it.\n\n",
