  "content": "I was playing around with some golang code I wrote, and I modified the Go BuildID. However, I had to pad whatever I wanted the buildID to be with characters so that it was the length of the original string.\n\nI found that both hexedit and Ghirda's Byte Viewer (which allows modifying bytes) do not allow you to delete bytes (unless I cannot figure out how) from a file. I am wondering whats the reasoning, is there some sort of checksum they don't want you to overwrite? What about files where a checksum is not a concern?\n\nWhich tool can I use to modify hex bytes, including deleting them from the file?\n\n",
