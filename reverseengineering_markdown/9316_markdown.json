  "content": "I'm trying to locate the function that handles the Enter key press event from a dialog box in a very simple game (no directx afaik, game has a spashscreen that says \"Made with Macromedia\"). I think I've found the WndProc function (by xrefing RegisterClass calls and looking at the struct argument), but when I set a breakpoint at the top of the WndProc function, its never getting triggered?\n\nAny tips? thanks\n\n",
