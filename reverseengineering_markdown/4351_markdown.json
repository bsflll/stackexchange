  "content": "I try to analyze a backdoor program with ollydbg. When I go through the assembly code by clicking the \"Step Over\"-Button, i stop sometimes to make a notice on a paper.\nLater when i want to go trough the code again, suddenly the malware terminates itself.\nI dont know why but it terminates.\n\nCould it be a anti-debugging mechanism ? Because the behaviour its not normal. \nSomeone has made same experiences and can help me?\n\nedit: I have read something about a \"Timing Checks\" as anti-debuging techniques used by malware. So, with that technique the malware itself is able to find out if it is debugged.\nCould it be something like that ?\n\n",
