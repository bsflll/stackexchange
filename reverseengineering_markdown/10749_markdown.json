  "content": "I've played with using software like cheat engine to modify memory, null out code and even inject some code of my own. However finding the right spot to modify is always a difficulty. I'd like to be able to identify the code that is run when I click my mouse on an object (eventually to simulate the entire process). Is there a tool or method for doing this that anyone could suggest?\n\nI've used ollydb and cheat engine a fair bit in the past.\n\n",

There is even some old code to get you started.\n\n",
