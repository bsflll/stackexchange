  "content": "I'm an absolutely beginner in the reverse engineering field.\nI've an exe program and I should find : address of main function/address of function that validate user input/address of hardcoded password.\nI have tried with Immuntity debugger and found those addresses : 00E31180(main function),00E31050(fn that validate user input),00E32100(@ of hardcoded password).\n\nBut, it seems that I got a wrong response (and i dunno which one of my responses is wrong because they should be all correct to know if i succeeded/no), so could anyone correct me.\n\nI'll be very happy for your help.\n\nHere is the exe file : https://www.sendspace.com/file/6q5xpi\nThanks.\n\n",

      "content": "It's a bit hard to help and correct what you did wrong as you are not showing any indications why you think specific function are what you think they are but let's try (I'll do this purely via static analysis).\n\nThe main function was correctly identified. It is the one at offset 0x1180\n\n```\n 115: int main (int argc, char **argv, char **envp);\n │           0x00401180      55             push ebp \n\n```\nbut the rest is wrong.\n\nIf we look at the code in the main function especially around the call to your first identified function we can see.\n\n```\n0x00401193      50             push eax\n0x00401194      6800214000     push str.Enter_Your_Pass_Key_:__n ; 0x402100 ; \"Enter Your Pass Key :   \n\" ; int32_t arg_8h\n0x00401199      e8b2feffff     call fcn.00401050\n\n```\nFrom the arguments passed to this function (const string \"Enter Your Pass Key\") we could indicate that the function at offset 0x1050 is more like a printing function than one that validates your input.\n\nAlso further code that looks like this\n\n```\n0x004011a4      51             push ecx                    ; int32_t arg_ch\n0x004011a5      6818214000     push 0x402118               ; \"%s\" ; int32_t arg_8h\n0x004011aa      e811ffffff     call fcn.004010c0\n\n```\nindicates that here we take the input from the user so it would be hard to validate it before getting it.\n\nSpotting function that does the validation is also simple in this task, as it is just before some comparison and printing good/bad info.\n\nIn here the comparison is at 0x11c1 and the function before is 0x0401100 and it takes the user input as an argument. So that's good indicators that it is the validation.\n\nAnd inside this function we can see that a interesting string is being loaded to a local variable\n\n```\n0x0040110d      c745f4f82040.  mov dword [var_ch], str.elite ; 0x4020f8 ; \"elite\"\n\n```\nand later it is being compared (byte by byte) with our input. So the valid input is for this program is \"elite\".\n\n\n\n",
