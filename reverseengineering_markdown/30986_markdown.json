  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/30986/how-to-change-the-equations-in-string-format-to-normal-equations-in-python",
  "content": "I have a set of equations in string format as given below. Need to assign some value to the left-hand side variable (In the below example: rsp, esp). Then have to calculate and store the results on the right-hand side variable (i.e., rax, esp, rsp).\n\nExample:\n\nrax = rsp\n\nesp = esp - 0x4\n\nrsp = rsp - 0x30\n\nThough I have used the eval function in python, it is throwing me an error message as it won't support =. Could someone please help me to find the answer?\n\n",
