  "content": "Sometimes, I see how someone puts on the github, some reverse engineering project for some famous game.\n\nBy researching these projects - I come to the conclusion that:\npeople just took the code from the exe and brought it gradually to an external dll - so they gradually tested the code.\nIn the end, from the main exe - they had only a small launcher and crt, and the rest of the place, of course, was filled with nop instructions.\nThey took out the code itself via copy / paste to MASM, and then, the resulting COFF obj-files, were added to the project with their new dll. (code reuse?)\n\nI also have a game project in which I found 3 statically linked libraries in the exe.\n\nThus, I would also like to get acquainted with this technique in more detail and take it into my arsenal.\n\nIf any of you are very familiar with this technique, please share your experience.\n\n",
