  "content": "I have just started teaching myself IDA and I have had some trouble with an array of structs.\n\nI have found and defined a struct similar to this: (simplified)\n\n```\nstruct {\nchar filename[50];\nint field2;\nint field3;\n}\n\n```\nI then found an array of these.\n\nSo I defined the struct, and then the array.\n\nBefore I defined them, the filename showed as a comment wherever it was referenced in the code.\n\nNow however, it only references the first element of the array and an offset.\nSo now looking through the code, I don't have comments with the file being referenced, which makes it hard to tell what file the code is working on.\n\nIs there a way for me to keep the array of structs and the comments, or do I need to undefine the array & struct to get the comment with filename back?\n\nEDIT:\nI forgot to add, the filenames also no longer show up in the strings window after I created the array of structs\n\nEDIT 2:\nHere is my struct definition\n\n```\n000000 file_data_struct_t struc ; (sizeof=0x4F)\n00000000 base_file_path  db 18 dup(?)            ; string(C)\n00000012 unknown         db 44 dup(?)\n0000003E loaded_data_ptr dd ?                    ; offset\n00000042 ptr2            dd ?                    ; offset\n00000046 file_length     db ?\n00000047 unknown3        db ?\n00000048 unknown4        db ?\n00000049 unknown5        db ?\n0000004A use_2nd_func    db 4 dup(?)\n0000004E flag            db ?\n0000004F file_data_struct_t end\n\n```\nThis is for the game Theme Park\n\n",
