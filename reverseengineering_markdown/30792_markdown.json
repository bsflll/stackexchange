  "content": "I'm using Ghidra to work out the structure of some binary files. No code.\n\nI can use the Structure Editor to define a struct, such as the header of the file format.\n\nBut I can only find a way to create the struct in the context of one of the files and then it will not be visible to the other.\n\nIs there a way to make it visible to both?\n\n",
