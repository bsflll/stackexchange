  "content": "I am VERY new to reverse engineering but I find it fascinating.\nI want to change the following code:  \n\n```\ncmp     [ebp+arg_0], 2  \njnz     short loc_41143B  \n\n```\nI would like to change the 2 to any other number, but when I try to change it to a 3 IDA says invalid operand size(s) when I use the edit assembly feature in IDA.\n\nWhy doesn't it accept say \"cmp     [ebp+arg_0], 3\" ?\n\nThe source code says:  \n\n```\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\nvolatile int a = 0x0a;\nvolatile int b = 0x27;\nvolatile int c = 0x3b;\nvolatile int d = 0x63;\nif (argc == 2) {\n    a ^= 0x42;\n    b ^= 0x42;\n    c ^= 0x42;\n    d ^= 0x42;\n    printf(\"%c%c%c%c  \n\", a, b, c, d);\n}\nreturn 0;\n\n```\n}\n\n",
