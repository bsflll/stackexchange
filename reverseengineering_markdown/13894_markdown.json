  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/13894/ollydbg-condition-based-on-windows-message-for-button-click",
  "content": "I am attempting to set a breakpoint after a user clicks a button on a Windows GUI program.\n\nI load the program into OllyDbg, type in ctrl+g to search for a function, I then use the GetMessageW function. I then set a conditional breakpoint by typing ctrl+f4 and type in [esp+4] under the expression and decode the expression as a Pointer to MSGW.\n\nAll of that is working fine. Now I want to refine it so it only breaks when the Msg == WMLBUTTONDOWN for example (only when the user clicks)\n\nIs that possible? What do I type in the conditional text box?\n\n",
