  "content": "Is there a way to display all the open handles of a process in IDA Pro while debugging it?\n\nI'm debugging a 64-bit binary on Windows OS with the win64_remotex64.exe as the debugging server.\n\nI want to display the list of all the open handles in the process:\n\n```\nOpen file handles\nOpen registry handles\nOpen socket handles\n\n```\nDebuggers such as Olly Debugger allow to see the complete list. Is it possible to see the same in IDA Pro?\n\nInformation should be as shown below:\n\n```\nhandle_id - path to the file\n\n```\nThanks.\n\n",
