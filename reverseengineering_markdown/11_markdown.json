      "content": "There is some academic research in this area, the keywords you want are 'toolchain provenance'. There was a pretty good paper by Nate Rosenblum on this topic, it's been a while since I read this paper but you can use many techniques to establish this information. I think some use machine learning and others can use a big pile of heuristics or axioms about compiler behavior. \n\nEstablishing this is of limited utility IMO. It could be useful in an adversarial situation where you're trying to get intelligence about a malware group or threat actor, but also keep in mind that this kind of information can be obfuscated or destroyed. One potential use of this information would be to establish that some binary software was compiled using some companies SDK that included a compiler with signature information unique to that company. Establishing the tool chain provenance can help you make a case that someone who bought your SDK is in violation of a license or contract, say by producing malware. \n\nAn example of behavior differences is parameter writing. There are two ways to place a value onto the stack, one using 'push' and another using mov with an address based in esp as the destination operand. So one compiler can do this:\n\n```\n\npush eax\npush ebx\n\n```\nAnd another can do this:\n\n```\n\nmov [esp+foo], eax\nmov [esp+foo+4], ebx\n\n```\nAnd they do. Generally, MSVC does the first example and GCC does the second example, at least in some very limited testing/observation just now...\n\n",

See list below.\n\nMajor       Minor\n\n0x5         0x0   (5.0)             Borland C++ / MS Linker 5.0\n\n0x6         0x0   (6.0)             Microsoft VIsual Studio 6\n\n0x7         0xA   (7.10)            Microsoft VIsual Studio 2003\n\n0x8         0x0   (8.0)             Microsoft VIsual Studio 2005\n\n0x9         0x0   (9.0)             Microsoft VIsual Studio 2008\n\n0xA         0x0   (10.0)            Microsoft VIsual Studio 2010\n\n0x2         0x15  (2.21)            MinGw\n\n0x2         0x19  (2.0.0.25)        Borland Delphi (linker 2.0.0.25)\n\nUnfortunately, packers and protectors tend to overwrite these value to write their own and/or harden the process of guessing the original compiler. \n\nAlso, the resource directory of an executable is a good place to search for specific linker info. e.g. RT_RCDATA having a resource named \"DVCLAL\" is a sign of Borland C++ or Delphi and the \"RT_MANIFEST\" in case of a MSVC-built executable can tell us about the specfic version of runtime DLL's it is linked to and hence the compiler version.\n\nAlso, an executable with the \"TimeDateStamp\" field set to 0x2A425E19 is a sign of being built with Delphi.\n\nNow, if you want to determine compiler from assembly code, then the sign of a recent MSVC compiler version is seeing the function that generates the stack cookie just at the entry point.\n\nSeeming, a JMP instruction at the entry point followed by the string \"fb:C++Hook\" is a sign of Borland C++, and so on.\n\n",

      "content": "If you just talk about the machine code (or Assembly code), there isn't much information. Most modern compilers will produce similar output or the output won't be enough to see differences. One thing that may give indication is compiler optimization, which I am not experienced with and someone else should chime in. If you do have the entire ELF file though, and symbols are available, you may be able to draw conclusions based on what kinds of libraries are linked (for example, libgcc would be a giveaway) or the names of compiler specific functions. If the ELF contains debugging information you may even see things like \"GCC: (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5) 4.6.3\". If you are dealing with C++ code the symbol name mangling can give it away.\n\nHowever, as you asked yourself, I am curious why you need this information. I don't know how much help you will get by knowing the compiler that made it will do. I do more work with ARM and I know with that platform, there is a Application Binary Interface that compilers/assembly code must adhere to. This ABI gives information about how functions should be called, what registers should be used for what, and etc. I know for platforms without a strict ABI, operating systems often give information to developers about such topics. Regardless, compilers all should create compatible code so I don't know of any use for identifying the compiler that created the code.\n\n",
