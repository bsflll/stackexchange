  "content": "I noticed that despite the imagebase for win32 executables be 0x400000, Ida Pro only starts the analysis at 0x401000. What is before that and how can I change IDA's settings to start the analysis at the imagebase? Thank you.\n\n",

A normal PE has no 32-bit/64-bit executable code there, so IDA doesn't load the header block unless you check \"manual load\".\n\nRelevant resources:\n\n",
