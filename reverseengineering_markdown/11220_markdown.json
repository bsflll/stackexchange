  "content": "I've set breakpoints on some Windows kernel functions using WinDBG. When the breakpoints are hit, I can query information about the invoking user-mode process using the !process or !peb commands.\n\nHow are these commands implemented? How can I find the relevant memory structures and \"manually\" trace back to the user-mode caller when one of my BPs hit?\n\n",
