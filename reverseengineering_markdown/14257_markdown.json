  "content": "I have a game on my PC that reads and writes registry keys and values to the HKLM hive. I am trying to see if it is possible to modify the game so that it uses the HKCU hive instead. \n\nThe source code for this game isn't available so I am trying to disassemble the game binary and see if the assembly can be modified to accomplish this.\n\nI am seeing sections like this in PE Explorer but I can't figure out what parts of it are used to target the HKLM hive:\n\n```\n L004036E0:\n        lea eax,[esp+1Ch]\n        lea ecx,[esp+08h]\n        push    eax\n        push    00020019h\n        push    ebx\n        call    SUB_L00401F70\n        push    eax\n        push    80000002h\n        call    [ADVAPI32.dll!RegOpenKeyExA]\n        cmp eax,ebx\n        jnz L004037E9\n        lea ecx,[esp+14h]\n        lea edx,[esp+000000A0h]\n        push    ecx\n        mov ecx,[esp+20h]\n        lea eax,[esp+1Ch]\n        push    edx\n        push    eax\n        push    ebx\n        push    SSZ00413090_InstallPath\n        push    ecx\n        mov dword ptr [esp+2Ch],00000104h\n        call    [ADVAPI32.dll!RegQueryValueExA]\n        cmp eax,ebx\n        jnz L004037E9\n        cmp dword ptr [esp+18h],00000001h\n        jnz L004037E9\n        lea edx,[esp+000000A0h]\n        push    0000005Ch\n        push    edx\n        lea esi,[esp+000000A8h]\n        call    SUB_L00406310\n        add esp,00000008h\n        cmp eax,ebx\n        jz  L00403775\n L00403763:\n\n```\n",

So, you just change those to 0x80000001.\n\n",
