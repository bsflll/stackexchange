  "content": "I am currently playing around with simple buffer overflows in a C program and I am trying to understand the program by stepping through it in IDA Pro. \n\nThe program takes an argument and writes it into a buffer with strcpy(). I can pass a simple argument like AAAA... to the program in IDA Pro (Debugger->process options) and see how the return address gets overwritten.\n\nWhat I would like to do now is pass some shellcode as a parameter and see in IDA Pro how the program writes the shellcode in the buffer and overwrites the return address.\n\nIn a shell, I would execute something like:\n\n```\n$ ./vuln \\`perl -e 'print \"\\x55\\x89\\xe5...\"'`\n\n```\nor\n\n```\n$ ./vuln \\`cat shellcode.txt`\n\n```\nSo my question is: how can I pass non-printable characters as an argument to a program in IDA Pro? \n\n",
