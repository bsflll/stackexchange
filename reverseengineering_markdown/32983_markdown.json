  "content": "I want to export the symbol addresses from all loaded modules in x64dbg. I know I can do this DLL-by-DLL from the Symbols tab (click on one module > right click in table > Copy > Export Table), but I want to do all of them at once. It doesn't matter if they're exported it one big file, or one file per module.\n\nI can't find any command that does this. Have I missed one? labellist only shows labels I've defined myself.\n\nI tried exporting the database, which is easily parseable JSON, but I don't see labels from system DLLs there, only labels in the main EXE module. This seemed promising but is missing the key info I want.\n\n",
