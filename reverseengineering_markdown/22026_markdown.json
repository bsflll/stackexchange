  "content": "I dont understand how people are finding offsets, So I want to know if there's a simple and easy method of just \"patching values\"\n\nI've been surfing the internet looking for VERY in depth tutorials on editing Assembly for ios apps, but it seems that either the tutorials are too difficult and vague, or are broken and old.\n\nfor example, how can I patch this function so it returns true rather than false:\n\n```\n; bool __cdecl -[ScrollingListTradePortal everythingFree](ScrollingListTradePortal *self, SEL)\n__ScrollingListTradePortal_everythingFree_\nADRP            X8, #_OBJC_IVAR_$_ScrollingListTradePortal.everythingFree@PAGE ; bool everythingFree;\nLDRSW           X8, [X8,#_OBJC_IVAR_$_ScrollingListTradePortal.everythingFree@PAGEOFF] ; bool everythingFree;\nLDRB            W8, [X0,X8]\nAND             W0, W8, #1\nRET\n; End of function -[ScrollingListTradePortal everythingFree]\n\n```\n",

Click Edit in menu bar > Patch Program > Change bytes.\n\n\n\nSwitch to \"Hex View\". Match the assembly mnemonic with the HEX value. This vary with every instruction. For example, cmp [rbp-4], 4 (in X86_64) is shows as 83 7D FC 04.\n\nPress F2 to edit in hex view. Edit the value. Press F2 another time to apply the change. Check the IDA view to review the change. Now go to Edit > Patch Program > Apply patches to input file.\n\n\n\nYou can also choose to create a backup.\n\nSimilar question: StackOverflow: Edit (patch) a binary file in IDA Pro\nAsk\n\n",

I know that this: \"AND             W0, W8, #1\" represents TRUE if your on creative mode.  But Im not entirely sure which one to patch if say I just want the value to ALWAYS return true.",
