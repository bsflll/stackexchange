  "content": "I am working on a site that was made years ago (not be me) and I need to identify a jQuery file manager plugin. This plugin shows a file manager view in a browser and allows the user to visually navigate a directory tree and view, upload, or download files.\n\nIn its code it refers to itself as documentLibrary or Document Library. Based on file dates, it looks like this may have been implemented circa 2017.\n\nI have tried a variety of Google searches, as you can imagine the terms \"jQuery file manager\" and \"jQuery document library\" yield a lot of results that have nothing to do with what I am looking for. I have tried searching for pieces of the code, but I do not have any luck.\n\nI have found similarly named products related to a WordPress plugin and Sharepoint services, but they do not seem to be related to the plugin I am looking at.\n\nHere are some snippets that seem like they could be identifiable by someone familiar with this plugin.\n\n```\n    $.documentLibrary = function(element, options) {\n        \n        var defaults = {\n            ajax_url        : false,\n            csrf            : false,\n            file_container  : false,\n            folder_table    : false,\n            tool_bar        : false,\n            drop_zone       : false,\n            is_media_modal  : false,\n            example_callback: function() {},\n            restrict_files : []\n        };\n\n```\n```\n        plugin.init = function() {\n            plugin.settings = $.extend({}, defaults, options);\n            plugin.open_folders = [];\n            if(plugin.settings.csrf===false){throw \"Configuation Error: The document library requires a csrf token for ajax calls.\";}\n            if(plugin.settings.ajax_url===false){throw \"Document Library requires an ajax url.\";}\n            if(plugin.settings.folder_table === false ){\n                throw \"Document Library requires a file holder.\";\n\n```\nThanks for any help. Let me know if I can provide more information.\n\n",
