  "content": "I am learning LLDB to debug ios apps, I have a jailbroken iPhone IOS 14.3 and a debugserver.\n\nScreenshot of start connect to remote process:\n\n\n\nSections of my process(image dump sections hidenseek):\n\n\n\nNext, I calculated the delta at the address from the disassembled unity engine as, Delta = end of PAGEZERO - start of TEXT\n\nThis is the address of the function where I want to put a breakpoint:\n\n\n\nHence, Delta = 0x104a60000 - 0x10000000 = 0x4a60000\n\nThen I consider the address, it will be equal to delta + offset in the disassembler,\n\n\n\nbut it turns out to be an unknown address, I did the same as in the training video.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? How to calculate the correct address?\n\nI would be glad for any help.\n\n",

      "content": "you can set a breakpoint using lldb on func.013e09a8 like this:\n\n```\nb -a 0x013e09a8 -s AppExecutableName\n\n```\nNo manual ASLR calculations required. If you continue in lldb with con you should see something like:\n\n```\n    frame #0: 0x013e19a8 AppExecutableName`___lldb_unnamed_symbol139640$$AppExecutableName\nAppExecutableName`___lldb_unnamed_symbol139640$$AppExecutableName:\n->  0x013e19a8 <+0>:  stp    x22, x21, [sp, #-0x30]!\n    0x013e19ac <+4>:  stp    x20, x19, [sp, #0x10]\n    0x013e19a0 <+8>:  stp    x29, x30, [sp, #0x20]\n    0x013e19a4 <+12>: add    x29, sp, #0x20            ; =0x20\n\n```\nThe formula for ASLR shift is now:\n\n```\np/x 0x013e19a8-0x013e09a8\n\n```\nFrom this point provided your executable doesn't change (presumably by the means of AppStore autoupdate) you can also revisit this function with a symbolic breakpoint if you want to:\n\n```\nb ___lldb_unnamed_symbol139640$$AppExecutableName\n\n```\nTo convert the other way round i.e. the ASLR shifted address to the 0x100000000 base one (suitable for disassembler) use:\n\n```\nimage lookup -a 0x013e19a8\n\n```\n",
