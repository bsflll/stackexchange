      "content": "2a. Analyzing in IDA can solve calling conventions issue. if before calling of a function, the stack should be prepared, you may find some [push]/[sub esp,X] right before call to that function. maybe calling with registers has been done (as in many cases of x64-bit). so you should know which register used for what parameter. this needs documentation of that function otherwise you have to analyse yourself! \n\n2b. invoking methods from dotNet assemblies is possible, nevertheless you need initialize/provide function requirements also. look at here.\n\n",
