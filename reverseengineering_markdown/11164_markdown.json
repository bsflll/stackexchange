  "content": "I wanted to know if it is possible to print out the assembly code which I analyze in ollydbg. I mean to have all of that on a paper. Sometimes I do not have access to my laptop. In such cases I would take the paper version and analyze it. Is that possible ? Is there a plugin or something like that available ?\n\nbest regards, \n\n",
