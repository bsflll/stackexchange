  "content": "I have a simple program:\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n  int a;\n  a = func(15, 3);\n  return a;\n}\n\nint func(int i, int j)\n{\n  int b1[5], b2[10];\n\n  b2[i] = 1;\n  printf(\"%d  \n\", b1[j]);\n\n  return 0;\n}\n\n```\nI am using python script to get local variables from the stripped binary, compiled using above program.\n\nI use: function.getLocalVariables() or something like function.getStackFrame().getStackVariables() to get the local variables. Interestingly I observed that, this script doesn't give me all the variables which can be seen in the decompiler window. For e.g., in the above case, I get following in the decompiled window (for function func):\n\n\n\nHere, the predicted buffers can be seen. But instead I get:\n\n```\nFUN_004004d6\narray(ghidra.program.model.listing.Variable, [[undefined4 local_5c@Stack[-0x5c]:4], [undefined4 local_60@Stack[-0x60]:4]])\n\n```\nwhich are clearly not the predicted buffers. Is there any way to get those buffers?\n\nNote: I also posted the same on ghidra github's forum.\n\n",

Note that I found differences in variables given by this decompiler interface and listing. Also, I couldn't find any api endpoint which gives address references by these variables (something like getReferencesTo).\n\n",
