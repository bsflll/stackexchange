      "content": "It doesn't work like that.\nAs you might know, bugs are worth money. The main reason for tgis is at it requires both skill and time to find these bugs.\n\nClearly you want to learn this skill, so in the future you might be able to do this.\n\nSo, you can't just point a fuzzer at something and find bugs in A-software. You either need to write your own, statebased fuzzer or find bugs by reverse engineering.\n\nI myself am a huge fan of the latter.\nRead the docs on how it should work. Reverse a complex part (complex = programmer bugs) and audit the code.\n\nWhen starting out, start with finding bugs in old software. That you know contains bugs.\n\nHappy bug hunting!!\n\nEdit: Read Fuzzing Adobe Reader - Exploit Development Joxean Koret posted a great comment there.\n\n",
