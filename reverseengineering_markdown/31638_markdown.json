  "content": "I started by reading a book on C language and then moved on to \"Programming From Ground Up,\" which teaches basic programming in x86.\n\nSchool just ended, I'm working on cracking a game called PwnAdventure Sourcery, which has been tough. I had to look up solutions and found that some involved buffer overflow and bruteforcing algorithms. It took me around 30 minutes to finally look up for a solution, and I feel like I'm so stupid :(\n\nIf possible, can you give a rough roadmap for reverse engineering along with some great resources?\n\n",
