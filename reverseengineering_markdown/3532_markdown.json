      "content": "I assume you want to extract a JAR file wrapped inside a .exe generated by launch4j. Launch4j places the jar file in the overlay of the executable, that is after the PE file. To extract it you can search for the string 'PK' from the bottom of the file to find the JAR archive, you should see something like this :\n\n\n\nOnce you found it, remove all the content before it and save it to a new file with \".jar\" extension. \n\nThere is actually a faster way to do it using 7zip. If you open the file with 7zip it will open the JAR file directly (a JAR is just a ZIP file), you can then extract the files and recreate the ZIP archive if needed. \n\n\n\n",
