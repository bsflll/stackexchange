  "content": "I just got a Zte ZXHN F660 GPON ONT Wireless router with my optic fiber internet provided by my telecom provider.\n\nMy first discovery was that the eth Lan ports are bricked wich\nmeans I can only use one Lan at time and there's a telnet default user and password i cannot remove or change - well i can do but only provisory:  I was able to bypass the problem using telnet and busybox console but the fix is provisory unfortunately. Each time the router reboots the old config gets installed, wich is normal I think.\n\nI decided to investigate a bit more and made a config backup threw the webui wich gives me a .bin file. Using binwalk i saw that there is 3 data blocks compressed with zlib. I made a quick and dirty script in python to unpack them and concatenate them in a XML file wich provides all the router's setup.\n\nI managed to modify and repack it, but here's the problem: the header contain some informations that make the config upgrade fail each time. With an hex editor I noticed that before each compressed zlib block there is the hex values of the pack inflated and deflated, so I was able to correct them. There's also in the header a CRC32 of the concatenation of each zlib compressed packs without headers, so I was also able to correct it when I repack the new file.  But next to it there's what I believe is an other CRC32, but I can't find out what that CRC32 is about so any help is welcome to this point.\n\nI've downloaded the httpd and cspd files from my router and try to disassemble them using IDA, but the loops I find in gives me the seasick and it's beyond my actual skills so that would be great to get some help and explaination about how to repack the xml file into the bin file.\n\nThanks for any help or advice.\n\nHere the first offsets of my dummy config.bin file:\n\n```\nOffset(h) 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F\n00000000  04 03 02 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 46 36 36 30  ............F660\n00000010  01 02 03 04 00 00 00 00 00 02 37 AB 00 00 36 79  ..........7«..6y\n00000020  00 01 00 00 97 10 5B C9 6E 6F 53 12 00 00 00 00  ....—.[ÉnoS.....\n00000030  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n00000040  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00  ................\n00000050  00 00 16 B8 00 00 17 00 78 DA ED 3D 5B 77 DB 38  ...¸....xÚí=[wÛ8\n00000060  73 EF FD 15 69 DA 3E 75 D7 E6 4D F4 E5 7C DB 53  sïý.iÚ>u×æMôå|ÛS\n00000070  99 94 1D 9D 95 14 46 94 AD AF FB E2 03 53 B0 CC  ™”..•.F”.¯ûâ.S°Ì\n00000080  13 1A 64 49 CA 97 FD F5 05 A8 1B 05 02 20 48 C9  ..dIÊ—ýõ.¨...
