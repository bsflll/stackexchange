(2) is get_local_vars is better than ida_hexrays.decompile(ea).get_lvars() if I only want to get the stack struct ? what is the diffrence?",

(as this seems independent or unrelated from your original question and their it'd be easier for someone to answer and you may get a quicker reply). 1) can u show an example code? 2) ida_hexrays uses decompiler interface and algorithm to infer types, and the former is without decompiler",
