  "content": "This is a decompile of an .so file, so it originated from C or C++. Can you kindly try to explain to me what this does?\n\nHow would one rewrite this into readable code? I don't mind any programming language.\n\nThe loop below is strange: I think it is a for loop but it uses a byte during checking... oh no, this is so wrong. There is one thing I am sure, in the function crackMe the *two is actually a byte array.\n\nAnd what about the ++keep? and (two++)[1]? Can byte minus byte result in (_BYTE *)(two - newByte)?\n\nThis is surely a short code but so much to analyse.\n\n```\nunsigned __int8 *__fastcall crackMe(unsigned __int8 *i, _BYTE *two)\n{\n  _BYTE *newByte; \n  int flag; \n  int rule; \n  _BYTE *rule2; \n  unsigned __int8 *result; \n  int currentNumCopy; \n  int currentNum; \n  int keep; \n  int forCompare; \n  int isFinal; \n\n  newByte = two + 1;\n  flag = (unsigned __int8)*two;\n  if ( !*two )\n    return i;\n  do\n    rule = (unsigned __int8)(two++)[1];\n  while ( rule );\n  rule2 = (_BYTE *)(two - newByte);\n  while ( 1 )\n  {\n    result = i;\n    currentNum = *i++;\n    currentNumCopy = currentNum;\n    if ( !currentNum )\n      break;\n    if ( currentNumCopy == flag)\n    {\n      if ( !rule2 )\n        return result;\n      keep = 0;\n      while ( 1 )\n      {\n        forCompare = (unsigned __int8)newByte[keep];\n        isFinal = result[keep + 1];\n        if ( !result[keep + 1] || isFinal != forCompare )\n          break;\n        if ( rule2 == (_BYTE *)++keep )\n          return result;\n      }\n      if ( isFinal == forCompare )\n        return result;\n    }\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\n\n```\nMy attempt to rewrite it in Java, you can rewrite it in C or C++ or C# or Python or any language you prefer:\n\n```\n        byte[] newByte;\n        int flag;\n        int rule; \n        byte rule2; \n        int result;\n        int currentNumCopy; \n        int keep; \n        int forCompare; \n        int isFinal; \n\n        newByte = two;\n        newByte[two.length + 1] = 1; //I am confused, did it convert array to integer then add 1 or add 1 to the end of array?\n\n        ByteBuffer wrapped = ByteBuffer.wrap(two); // big-endian by default\n        flag = wrapped.getInt();\n        for (int currentNum = 0; currentNumCopy == flag; currentNum++) {\n        ??? rule = ?\n\n```\n",
