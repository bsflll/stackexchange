  "content": "I am wondering if it is possible to reverse engineer the calculator on this url:\n\nhttp://www.contrelec.co.uk/index.php/en/motor-full-load-current-estimator-kw\n\nIt appears to be a Joomla site with the Fabrik plugin driving the calculator. Some research suggests Fabrik uses Ajax, a language I know little about other than it is client-side calculation, so the source should be accessible(?)\n\nGlad of anyone's help.\n\n",
