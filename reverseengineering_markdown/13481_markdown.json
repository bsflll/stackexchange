      "content": "In my understanding there are two major differences: \n\nProgram Slicing creates a reduced representant of a program which should still produces the same output for a given input. So you reduce the given program to its core functionality and you throw away all the clumpy/insignificant attachments.\n\nIn contrast a Taint Analysis traces the path of an information through an application and observes all the objects which are affected/visited/influenced by the corresponding information. Therefor a specific input is labeled or tagged, so it could be tracked during its execution.\n\nSo you have a reduced representation of a program with consideration of input output behavior VS the trail of a selected input/variable within a program and its dependencies.\n\nSee also detailed descriptions below:\n\nProgram slicing tries to reduce a given program P to a minimum form, a so called slice S, which produces the same behavior. More formally taken from these slides:\n\nTaint analysis can be seen as a form of Information Flow Analysis. A more formal definition ripped from here: \n\n",

      "content": "I'd say they are essentially the same, with slightly different focus:\n\nProgram slicing is, strictly, extracting code that operates on specific variables/memory, while omitting all other code;\n\nTaint analysis is tracking which other variables/memory are affected, via that code, by the ones you chose. Also, tainted data is usually stricter defined as \"user-controllable data\", while slicing can be done on any var.\n\n",
