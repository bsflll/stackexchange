  "content": "I'm trying to reverse-engineer a protocol (it's for a game whose server's are closing soon). I have two things: 1) the binary for the program 2) a packet dump from Wireshark (I am still able to get another dump, if needed). Now, the protocol, from what I can see from the dumps, is TLS/SSL (not sure which one) encrypted. I am aware that Wireshark has the capabilities to decrypt these packets, given that I have the required keys.. but how in the world do I extract the keys out of the binary?\n\ntl;dr Can I access plaintext SSL given the originating binary? \n\n",

There is a 48-byte secret, called the master secret, which is shared by both sides and used to generate the session keys for the connection.\n\nIf the application uses the standard Win32 API to make the SSL connection, the point to intercept the key generation is inside lsass.exe, at:\n\n```\nCaller:  ncrypt!_Tls1ComputeMasterKey@32+0x57 \nEIP:     ncrypt!_PRF@40+0x11a\n\n```\nMore information can be found in my answer to \"Decryping TLS packets between Windows 8 apps and Azure\".\n\nMore generally, I have (with several excellent co-authors) recently developed techniques for scanning all memory accesses for interesting data such as SSL/TLS keys. A paper on this (\"Tappan Zee (North) Bridge: Mining Memory Accesses for Introspection\") has been published at CCS, and the software to do it is available on github: PANDA/TZB. Particularly take a look at the keyfind plugin, which takes a sample (encrypted) packet and scans memory accesses for TLS master secrets.\n\nThe procedure for finding the place where TLS master key generation happens with a new application is:\n\nThe documentation is pretty sketchy at the moment, but looking at the source should resolve any questions you have (and feel free to ask for clarification here!).\n\nFor more information on using panda for this see: here\n\n",

As \nBrendan Dolan-Gavitt points out in his answer, you need access to the binary while it's running to do that. \n\nWhat you can try to do is set up SSL mitm using something like ettercap. Which might be a bit involved and might not work depending on the SSL implementation. \n\nNow, not a direct answer to your question, but it might help you achieve what you want:\n\nAnother thing you could to, since your goal is to analyze the underlying protocol is to make hooks on the higher level. I have use oSpy before to do similar work. \n\noSpy works by attaching to the process whose traffic you want to analyze and then monitor certain APIs. \n\n",
