  "content": "I am testing a malware that built as COM EXE service. This exe file has a digital signature.\nI succeeded to remove the digital signature for trying to modify it for reverse engineering tests.\n\nBut when I open it in OllyDbg and make any tiny change, the malware crash and not runs at all. Even if I tries to change one byte in the code cave to nop command, the malware not running.\n\nWhy can't I change it even in the code cave? Any idea?\n\n",

      "content": "@Karim's idea is right. Another thought is that your malware might be checking windows' registry debug flags. Since Olly runs dynamic analysis, your .exe recognises it and stops working if any changes applied during debugging proccess.\n\n",
