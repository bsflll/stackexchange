For instance in the symbols for ntdll.dll for Windows 10 now, there's a lot of debugging strings that give the following folder as the location of their source files: \"minkernel  \ntdll\\*****\"",

      "content": "Looks like a path that you might find in a checked (== with assertions) build of Windows 7 as a source path in the output of failed assertions. However, it could be a fake to make something appear more legit. You're tagging the question as malware but I don't quite see the connection.\n\nGiven the path it would not be inconceivable to think that this is some code that uses an older version of ntdll.dll loaded by another name. Stranger things have happened, such as loading a second ntoskrnl.exe to dodge a possibly patched running kernel.\n\nAnyway the RTM in w7rtm means release to manufacturer and refers to the very first release version of a Windows. And given that this refers to Windows 7, this is several years old by now.\n\n",
