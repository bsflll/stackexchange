  "content": "I had recently this situation where in a program I was debugging I found:\n\n```\n03CD38D4:  8B15 8C5FF703  MOV EDX, DWORD PTR DS:[3F75F8C]\n\n```\nIf I look for these bytes in the physical file I found nothing. I assumed this is because the reference to 3F75F8C, which might change over each instance of the program, is being randomised by Windows. So I could not change the value directly in an hexed - say change 3F75F8C to 3F75F88 (I suppose I can do it with some math involving the base, though).\n\nEDIT\n\nAs per the answer, what I undestood is that Windows will look into the .reloc section and will change one by one the references pointed in the section based on the random base. Then, if I modify the bytes of the instruction, since they have been defined in the .reloc section, my new bytes will be modified (probably I am wrong, but this is what I understood)\n\nHowever, I am not able to find out how Windows \"obtains\" the instruction:\n\n```\n03CD38D4:  8B15 8C5FF703  MOV EDX, DWORD PTR DS:[3F75F8C]\n\n```\nWhich is in file offset 482CD4 stored as:\n\n```\nMOV EDX, DWORD PTR DS:[B25F8C]\n\n```\nThe image base is 400000 and base of code 1000.\n\nI cannot find anything in the .reloc section that points to 03CD38D4,482CD4 or similar.\n\n",
