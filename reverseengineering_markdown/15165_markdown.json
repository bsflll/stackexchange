  "content": "My question is rather simple, I was analysing a piece of malware packed by some packer in IDA. I have found a memory mapped (via mmap2) region which contains the file I'm interested in. I've created a memory snapshot and I'd like to copy this specific area into a file.\n\nSadly I haven't been able to find good instructions on how to do this, any help would be most appreciated. \n\n",
