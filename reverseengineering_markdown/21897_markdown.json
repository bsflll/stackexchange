No other firmware exists, and the open-seasame command presents an encrypted challenge, so no root.\n\nIs there anything in this list that pokes at the ability to dump the firmware via uboot ?\n\nThere are pads for a micro-SD card, but I haven't soldered anything up or tested / probed it with a scope.\n\n```\nThe following commands are supported:\nboot    erase   help    reset\nsaveenv printenv        setenv  upbs\nformat  update  upfusb  upf\nupdatebusb      updateb gos     go\nmii     gpio    ping\nUse help to get help on a specific command\n\n```\n",
