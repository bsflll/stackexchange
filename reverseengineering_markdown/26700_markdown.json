  "content": "The only method i know to break on a DriverEntry of a rootkit driver when its loaded is to disassmble nt!IopLoadDriver and find an indirect call in it and break on it. Setting a break point on rootkitDriverName!DriverEntry doesn't work either for some reason.\n\nIs there any easier way to break on the rootkit driver entry? Why does rootkitDriverName!DriverEntry not work?\n\n",
