  "content": "I use Fiddler to get APK of applications that I need. I used it for a long time, and usually it is not a problem to find APK in Fiddler log.\n\nIn ancient times Google downloaded APK directly how it is installed. Later, Google started to use ZIP compression.\n\nLast time when I downloaded APK with Google Play Store 10.5.10, I saw it is not a ZIP, APK or any other file type that I know. Fortunatelly, it is possible to use obsolete Google Play version to still get understandable APK. However, I am thinking about future when Google may probably disable obsolete Google Play support.\n\nDoes anyone know how to unpack/decrypt APK file downloaded by modern Google Play Store version?\n\nHere you can download dump of 3 HTTPS requests that Google Play sends to download APK file (in Fiddler 4 format):\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!qch3HaqQ!BDPEf7_q9oFgMMsMojSV-w9BXYXb1-mZMw-uNXAJc64\n\nP. S. Please don't advertise other tools how to decrypt HTTPS. I know how to do it. There are a lot of tools, you may like one tool, I may like another one. The question is that at least some of APK are now encrypted and how to parse such APK without using of old Google Play that really allow to download encrypted APK in unencrypted format, because such old version may be disabled in future, and downloading of APK will become problematic.\n\n",

      "content": "Disclaimer: I took a different approach to find your solution. I don't use Fiddler, it has many adwares. You may use Fiddler and may find same result as I did. \n\nNo, Google doesn't encrypt the APK, at least I didn't found it to be encrypted. First install Packet Capture from Play Store. Allow it to install a 3rd party certificate to intercept the SSL encryption. Open that application, click on the green play button, choose the \"Downloads\" or \"Downloads Manager\" or com.android.providers.downloads in that list. The application will be intercepting the packets from Downloads. \n\nStart to download any app from Play Store. There will be a small 2-3 KB packet first which contains the real download link. The second packet will be the compressed APK package. Stop the download and Packet Capture, open the first packet. You may see the link as follows in this HTTP GET Location tag:\n\n\n\nCopy the full link starting with https://r6---sn-gwpa-jj0l.gvt1.com/play-apps-download-default/, place it in any browser the file will be downloaded. Link may expire in some time, so do it quickly. Here comes the important facts. The downloaded file is a GZIPed file, file command shows this: gzip compressed data, from FAT filesystem (MS-DOS, OS/2, NT). Extract the APK file from it with any decompresser tool (e.g. GZIP, 7ZIP etc). \n\n```\nGET /download/by-token/download?token=AOTCm0QN_iloMjhxZLX8cMBfVXIpmMrUUTyJcDi2Aa1h_yJVIT_f6STKoVKrJWPR6qpAVsb6_0IRDjzNoneXmeliSL9Zx6IxXva7zFmP4_WNHlpo2Yaf9LUe6SXrR0r5TNzkqm79fA0LmPKB_TObJOnT1-seAI2Szdi4wVAu_3baecu_KHMeXmcV7cyHEGdrsnHbgC9VfQJKnq4Pt00WzpKhqziwLnGRRcOAKGr0gvbF_wBjbHfks2VQPNlMnhlgSS4miJomoeoKwBBPuyexDHNWrSyian1BReyBtV9liH3ueB5iJJFbuFFMRpH3cO4K8h-0MrvzHTMeYEpkcwBT8T3GhA&cpn=w_2EoAbVy7CSoAaZ&isid=VUNzEjxjRROS-g4UxpZC2A HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: AndroidDownloadManager/6.0.1 (Linux; U; Android 6.0.1; Model XYZ Build/XYZ123)\nAccept-Encoding: identity\nHost: play.googleapis.com\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nContent-Type: application/binary\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate\nPragma: no-cache\nExpires: Mon, 01 Jan 1990 00:00:00 GMT\nDate: Thu, 28 Jun 2018 17:48:45 GMT\nLocation: https://r6---sn-gwpa-jj0l.gvt1.com/play-apps-download-default/download/by-id/AF3DWBexsd0viV96e5U9-SkM_V5zc7aWOEqZi1rsPmGPvWj2reBV2c5DlYCXyzUoWZfcuw0RJcQLF2IKDQXYmWT3mpm_b2KkdGTOgw07z67jzPdSHFfRpJI?cpn=w_2EoAbVy7CSoAaZ&ctier=L&initcwndbps=710&mm=31&mn=sn-gwpa-jj0l&ms=au&mt=1530208077&mv=m&pl=18&expire=1530380925&ip=12.12.12.12&ipbits=0&sparams=expire,ipbits,ip,q:,initcwndbps,mm,mn,ms,mv,pl,ctier&signature=5F361AC4E40D8665A674D9E71E971B867F0BBA71.C62F35F6BA6EE3B8D63258A950F70509544D36F2&key=am3\nServer: ESF\nContent-Length: 0\nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nAlt-Svc: quic=\":443\"; ma=2592000; v=\"43,42,41,39,35\"\n\n```\n",
