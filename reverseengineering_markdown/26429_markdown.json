  "content": "I want to find a static constant from a APK. Because of its use of obfuscation, the code is difficult to read. But I know that the constant is returned from a function after confusion, and I am sure that it is a fixed value. I think smalivm can find out the return value of this function, but I can't find a sample article that fully describes how smalivm is used except for this article. This got me into trouble.\n\nI don't know much about simplify. Does simplify work equally well when not using smalivm?\n\n",
