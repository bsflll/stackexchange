  "content": "Backstory: I have been trying to find a way to automatically turn batches of photos into WhatsApp stickers. I was able to do that, but now I am trying to figure out a way to actually import them into WhatsApp. For that, I am trying to piggyback off an app which can import it's own sticker pack files, with extension .wastickers\n(example here).  The app can be found here.\n\nUpon inspection with file, the format turns out to be a .zip archive (and indeed it unzips). Binwalk can also see all of the files inside the archive without unzipping it. As such I tried mimicking the contents of the container and zipping it with 0 compression ratio (\"storage\" mode) and changing the extension, but the app does not see the archive as a legitimate stickerpack. Furthermore binwalk can't see the contents of such an archive off the bat. \n\nWhat is contained inside an archive: a png called 0, which is the stickerpack icon; A bunch of .webp files numbered from 1 to at most 30, and two text files, title.txt and author.txt which, you guess it, denote the title and the author of the stickerpack.\n\nWhat is special about their container? How can I mimick it?\n\n",
