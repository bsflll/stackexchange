  "content": "I have very simple C code - compiled on MSVC using clang++ compiler. When I am running it under angr environment - it simply does not finds main() function, while it can do so for other things like strcmp etc. Also, the same program when run under linux (g++) works with no issues.\n\nAdditionally, I could see main() symbol in dumpbin.exe, gdb, x64dbg etc.\n\n```\npath_to_binary = \"D:\\\\angr_project\\\\angr training\\\\angr_ctf\\\\00_angr_find\\\\00_angr_find.exe\"  # :string\n  print(\"Started execution  \n\")\n  project = angr.Project(path_to_binary, load_options={'auto_load_libs': False})\n  main_fn = project.loader.find_symbol('main')\n  if main_fn:\n      print(\"main found\")\n  else:\n      print(\"main not found\")\n\n```\n",
