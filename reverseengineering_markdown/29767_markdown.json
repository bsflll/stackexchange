If they were just loaded then you may only find the in-memory representation of a loaded PDF file which has nothing to do with the PDF file and it's structure. Therefore I would instead try to figure out what parts of the app load the PDF files and hooke them to get the path or to understand how and from where the files are loaded so you can dump the original PDF data and save it to a file.",
