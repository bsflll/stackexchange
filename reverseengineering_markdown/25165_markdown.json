  "content": "The Radare2 command line (I believe it's called \"interactive mode\"?) allows bringing back history and editing it with the arrow keys. However, I prefer to use vi/vim keybindings for this. How do I configure this?\n\nI do have a $HOME/.inputrc file which contains set editing-mode vi, and this works for many programs (presumably all that use GNU Readline or a compatible library).\n\nAlternatively, is there an option available to build Radare2 with Readline?\n\n",

      "content": "You can e scr.prompt.vi = true to enable a limited form of vi key bindings for command line editing. However, this is very limited; it's even missing basic movement commands such as f and t, and some commands such as cw do not appear to work properly. Searching with vi keybindings is unavailable; you must still use the Emacs Ctrl-R syntax to search backwards in your history. And a special warning: Enter in command mode will do nothing; you must enter insert mode and press Enter to enter the command you've just brought up or edited.\n\n(I found the setting by searching the configuration variables using e scr. ~vi; thanks to @blabb for mentioning this to me.)\n\nRadare2 uses its own command line editing code, in libr/cons/dietline.c.\n\n",
