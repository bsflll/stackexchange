  "content": "I am working with some malware samples and I need to determine if one of them is primarily composed of 32-bit Intel Code. This would seem easy as I can just check the metadata describing it as a 32-bit executable. However, my instructor said that does not suffice.\n\nHow can I determine if this binary is primarily 32-bit Intel code without involving simply the metadata. I have a suite of tools at my disposal such as IDA-Pro, PEView, etc etc.\n\n",
