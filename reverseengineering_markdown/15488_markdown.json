However, many of these store apps contain standard W32 imports as well. ILSpy also cannot open any of them, it says they \"are not managed assemblies.\" I'm going to try dnSpy next. You're probably right it's just these have different characteristics from regular .NET assemblies it seems.  Also, by .NET are you also meaning Visual C++ managed? In Detect-It-Easy a lot of these show as VC++ too.",

There are some well-known older programs included in the store, which are mostly for computers that they were included as-are, so these might need different tools. But almos 90% of apps is in .Net, so ILSpy, a good hew editor and some PE header tools is the best way to wander around the code.",
