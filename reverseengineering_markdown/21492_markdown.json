  "content": "I am currently learning to use ghidra, and I found the Symbol Tree.\n\nGhidra found some namespaces that I would like to export.\nThese namespaces don't even have to be readable, just reusable, such that I can use them in another application.\n\nIs there any way in Ghidra to export those namespaces in a reusable form? And if not, what would be my best bet of achieving this?\n\nSome additional information:\n\nIf any more information or clarification is needed, please tell me.\n\n",
