Or this can be found only via trial and error method? CPU specification is not available.\n\nPCB image 1 and 2 (SPI Flash memory marked \"U42\")\n\n",

If it can be controlled, the chip can be re-programmed.\n\nIf Pin 9 is tied to the CPU, you may then be in the realm of trial-and-error to see how to control that pin.\n\n",
