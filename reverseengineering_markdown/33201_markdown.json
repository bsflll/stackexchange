  "content": "Ghidra shows in my decompile window the following warning at the top:\n\n```\n/* WARNING: Globals starting with '_' overlap smaller symbols at the same address */\n\n```\nWhen looking at my decompilation I notice that sometimes there is an underscore and sometimes there is none:\n\n```\nvoid UndefinedFunction_00000014(void)\n{\n_DAT_fffffa00 = 0x63cd;\n_DAT_fffffa04 = _DAT_fffffa04 | 0x4000;\nDAT_fffffa17 = 0xf7\n...\n\n```\n(It seems that only word addresses are having an underscore, not byte addresses.)\n\nThe warning tells that \"smaller symbols\" are overlapped, so I checked the Symbol Table. It is empty. I also checked the Memory Map, but there is nothing defined for that address range. And I also checked the labels, but there are no labels defined at all.\n\nSo why do I receive this warning? What does it refer to? And why do some of my assignments start with an underscore while some don't?\n\nIn case that there is no added value in that, how can I unify it?\n\n",

May be the struct or the symbol do not really exist (misinterpretation of something) or they do not exist at the same time.",
