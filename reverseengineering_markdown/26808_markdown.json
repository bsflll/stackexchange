  "content": "I have an app (and I don't know the source code), that freeze and crash everytime it loses focus (but the music continue). I've tried to debug it using windbg but it doesn't change anything, and I don't know how to log the freeze/crash properly.\n\nHow can i know what happened ?

      "text": "Hi and welcome to RE.SE! The app crashes on Windows 7 or it was written for Windows 7 and crashes when you run it on, say, Windows 10? The Windows you run it on is a 32-bit or 64-bit one? You give far too little contextual information to help you further. In general you could attempt to start it via WinDbg and hope for the crash to be replicated this way. Once it crashes you'd see a call stack of what happened. Alternatively procdump can be used for a similar effect.",

      "text": "@0xC0000022L It was written on windows 7,  and I run the app on a 64bit computer. But it crashes on windows 7 32bit too so, I don't really know, I guess the app don't handle the \"unfocus\" event properly or something. With WinDbg, the game freeze and stay frozen, it won't crash and it won't close even if I spam the \"close window\" button. I can't even move the process window. When I hit \"Stop debugging\" (only way to stop the process without closing WinDbg) it doesn't print anything.. I'll try with procdump.",
