  "content": "I'm new with gdb and I have spent hours looking for direction but I can't find any.\nI need to analyze an executable to find how this program process the arguments and where the output came from. I have it running on my system, got it working correctly to print some encoded string.\nAfter some days trying gdb, I figure that I need to trace the data inside every function, but I can't pass this function __libc_init where the program alwas exited with code 0235. The last process says __libc_init () from /system/lib/libc.so \nso i think it's doing something with this external library libc.so. How could I continue the debug process when I hit this type of process? I can't find any reference to understand this.\n\n",

You can try to either install symbols (usually in a package named libc-dbg or similar), or debug on assembly level by using si (step instruction) command. \n\n",
