      "content": "Well, most of the disassembler based on 'symbolic execution' are kind of symbolic. The problem is that you need to modelize so much from the environment (system calls answers, interaction with other programs, ...) that most of them also use concrete execution when the program venture outside of their model.\n\nBut, you should look for symbolic execution tools such as angr, miasm and many others.\n\n",
