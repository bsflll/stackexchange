  "content": "While reverse engineering a system I found a time stamp with a peculiar year:\n\n```\nUTC:'20.09.118 17:41:38'\n\n```\nIt seems as if this is the UTC timestamp since 1900, which would result in\n\n```\nUTC:'20.09.2018 17:41:38'\n\n```\nThis seems the most plausible explanation. But I am not 100% sure, it could just as well be the timestamp since 1901 or 1902, ...\n\nDoes anybody recognize this software pattern of saving a UTC timestamp since 1900?\n\n",
