  "content": "I want to run (simulating) MIPS file with Qemu:\n\n```\n$file httpd\nhttpd: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS32 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0, no section header\n\n```\nchroot to rootfs and then run my file:\n\n\ni found oalShm_init function into libcms_core.so library and decompile it with ghidra:\n\n\n\nfirst httpd file use shmget for create shard memory and then use shamt for give access to this space;\n\nbut Qemu error in this function and can't mapping or can't run it\n\nhow to i can resolve this problem?\n\n",

      "content": "Seems to have been a bug in qemu-user: https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/115\n\nIt's fixed in 9.x versions. As packages lag behind compiling qemu from source is probably needed.\n\nThere are a lot of weird bugs with user space emulation in general. Sometimes it's a good idea to spin up some light distro with qemu-system (and chroot to your target binaries/libraries) for a sanity check.\n\n",
