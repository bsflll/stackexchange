  "content": "Say I have a binary that I'm not able to execute (for example it runs on some device that I don't have one of), but I can disassemble it. I can get the docs on the architecture. (It's MIPS little endian in my case.) But the binary has very few imports, very few strings, etc., so it really seems like it's packed.\n\nHow can I go about statically unpacking it? (Edit: I mean, unpacking it without any access to the original device.)\n\n",

      "content": "Over the 30+ embedded device firmwares I've seen in the past I have rarely seen them using anything proprietary. Often it's just gzip/LZMA or a similar compression they're using (albeit sometimes with modified or stripped headers). \n\nThus as a first step I would try something like binwalk to search for known compression algorithms. If that doesn't help try tools for finding crypto constants such as Find Crypt or Sign search. This only works if the crypto is a software implementation. If it's a more sophisticated device, say a set-top-box, with a hardware accelerated decryption engine and OTP memory for storing the key then you're out of luck without run-time access (unless they greatly screw up passing the key from OTP to the decryption engine).\n\nFinally you could try to find out if they use some proprietary algorithm and either emulate that algorithm using QEMU or gxemul or write your own decompressor in higher level language.\n\n",

      "content": "My general answer would be \"by simulating self-modifying operations against the packed binary\".  So for example, this would encompass removing the compression that most packers are veiled under.  Doing so will require \"statically tracing\" the execution flow through the packer, whose code may be subject to self-modification.\n\nThat explanation works for a traditional style of packing, wherein the sections of the binary are merely compressed/encrypted.  It might be the case that more sophisticated unpacking strategies are required, for example as described in my paper \"Unpacking Virtualization Obfuscators\" 1.\n\n",
