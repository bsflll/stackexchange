All other things like data section, section table and other section will be intact, but i'm just deleting the Data directories from PE optional header. So what will happen will loading this PE file ?

From the TinyPE page:\n\nHowever, the resulting file won't work in Windows 2000 \"because the loader tries to call a function from KERNEL32, but KERNEL32.DLL is not loaded\". So normally you should add at least an Import Table directory, which needs NumberOfRvaAndSizes to be at least 2. (You also need an import directory if you want your file to do anything useful, like call functions from other DLLs :)\n\n",

If you edit the dard disc directory area with a hex editor and change the flag byte(s) which signify that a file is an extended directory then you can open that file as if it was a file.  I don't know what happens with later Ms DOSs, though.  Easy enough to test with WinHex, if you want.\n\n",
