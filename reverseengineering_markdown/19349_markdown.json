  "content": "I did a brief survey on malware unpacking and I found several theses on automated general unpacking:Eureka, PolyUnpack, omniUnpack, Malware Normalization.\n\nHowever, these theses are written years ago and I don't think these methods still work. A basic assumption of these methods is an unpacker routine restore whole protected code at a time. Thus, we can get original code dumping a certain memory region when an unpacker routine finishes its work.\n\nWhen it comes to more sophisticated packer (such as Maya's veil), it doesn't reveal whole protected code. As far as I know an attempt to attack this problem is to distinguish between code that performs unpacking routine and code does not and I think this is not really unpacking.\n\nOnly way to unpacking sophisticated packers is manually reversing it? \n\nThank you.\n\n",
