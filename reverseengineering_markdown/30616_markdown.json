  "content": "I have this digital crane scale. It has a 5 digit 7 segment LCD display. My objective is to be able to read what is displayed on the LCD display with a Raspberry Pi. This is what the PCB looks like: \nIt looks like there are 15 input pins to the LCD module at the top of the PCB. Could I read some of these with the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi to determine what is being displayed on the screen?\n\n",
