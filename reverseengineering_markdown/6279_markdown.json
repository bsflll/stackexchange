  "content": "I would like to step into some code which is ran on a new thread. Luckily, after the initial startup this is the only thread that is newly created in the program. I can set the debugger to break on the creation of a new thread. But all I see is the WinAPI and lower level calls that execute the thread. How can I step into the code that is executed on the thread to see what it does?\n\n",
