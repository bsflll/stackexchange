  "content": "Good day. I have these character codes in a binary file (Adobe After Effects Project) that represent a string. If  I change them the text inside the application changes. However, for the life of me, I do not understand what kind of character codes these are. They're not ASCII codes, they're not Hex codes, they're not anything I can recognize. Here's a couple of examples:\n\n```\n [ 42 42 80 72 85 82 82 81 3 ]\n\n```\ntranslates to: \"GGmeroon\".\n\nAnd\n\n```\n [ 38 68 80 72 85 68 3 ]\n\n```\ntranslates to: \"Camera\".\n\n(Uppercase/lowercase matters).\n\nCan you help me find a way to translate these codes?\n\nThanks.\n\n",
