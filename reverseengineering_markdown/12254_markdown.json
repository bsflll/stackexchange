  "content": "I'm trying to reverse engineering a simple program (learning purpose) using IDA and I got stuck on this instruction:\n\n```\nmov    dl, byte_404580[eax]\n\n```\nThis instruction stores in the first 8 bit of EDX a value derived from EAX and byte_404580 but I don't know how it is actually computed.\n\nLooking at byte_404580 is stored the hex value 69h:\n\n```\n.data:00404580 byte_404580     db 69h\n\n```\nIs it the same of [eax+69h] or not?\n\n",
