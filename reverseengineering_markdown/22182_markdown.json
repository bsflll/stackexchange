  "content": "I'm curious about this __security_cookie that I keep seeing all over the msvcp140.dll from my Windows 10 x64 (insider build.) \n\nHere's an example:\n\n\n\nNote that the address for indirect function call (or qword_18009FBD0) is taken somewhere from the .data section:\n\n\n\nThen it is XOR'ed with the __security_cookie:\n\n\n\nI thought that __security_cookie is something that is used on the stack to guard against buffer-overflows. So they must be using some new security technique. Any idea what that is?\n\nAnd a follow up question. I'm trying to statically analyze this binary code with IDA and this __security_cookie makes it very difficult to see what function is actually being called. For instance, here's how qword_18009FBD0 looks like:\n\n\n\nAny idea how to make those function addresses more legible?\n\n",

You can rename the pointer to the kernel32 function's name to better see what is happening:\n\n```\n  ;(from initialize_pointers)\n  lea     rdx, aClosethreadpoo ; \"CloseThreadpoolTimer\"\n  mov     rcx, rbx        ; hModule\n  mov     cs:qword_180092498, rax\n  call    cs:__imp_GetProcAddress\n  xor     rax, cs:__security_cookie\n  lea     rdx, aCreatethreadpo_0 ; \"CreateThreadpoolWait\"\n  mov     rcx, rbx        ; hModule\n  mov     cs:pCloseThreadpoolTimer_xored, rax ;<- variable renamed\n\n__crtCloseThreadpoolTimer proc near \n                sub     rsp, 28h\n                mov     rax, cs:pCloseThreadpoolTimer_xored\n                xor     rax, cs:__security_cookie\n                jz      short loc_180036A8A\n                call    cs:__guard_dispatch_icall_fptr ; calls CloseThreadpoolTimer()\nloc_180036A8A:  \n                add     rsp, 28h\n                retn\n__crtCloseThreadpoolTimer endp\n\n```\nThis mitigation is not actually new and was already used in VS2013 CRT although in a slightly different form. It is probably aimed at reducing the number of available API pointers in standard CRT DLLs to make exploitation harder.\n\nAlthough __security_cookie is most commonly used for protecting data on the stack (GS and EH cookies), nothing prevents programmers from using it for other purposes as a simple source of entropy.\n\n",

Unfortunately I can't load symbols to see its name. By the way, do you know the name of this security mitigation that they are using there? I haven't seen this before, although it uses the name of the stack canary cookie.",
