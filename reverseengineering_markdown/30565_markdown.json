In particular I'm trying to\n\nThere exists a custom firmware already that does this (and a lot more). Unfortunately it is very buggy, so I've decided to investigate modifying the original firmware.\n\nI've used radare2 to decompile the binary, following this guide, but I'm unable to identify the relevant parts in the code.\n\nI think that, using the custom firmware as a reference, we should at least be able to figure out where the Voltage is being read and what happens with it. The custom firmware also includes the default values for the three settings I want to edit.\n\nI'm looking for some resources and a structured approach here as I am new to using radare2 and decompilation of arm instructions. Are there some plugins / other tools that I should be using?\n\nHere are details on how to reproduce what I've done so far (using docker):\n\n```\naaaa\npdf @@ fcn* > pdf.txt\npdc @@ fcn* > pdc.txt\n\n```\n",

You have to look for clues.\nFor example, follow input pins and interrupts.For this, you can write a simple code for this processor. Then analyze its .out file. Now look for similar events in your firmware.\nFor example, define some pins that controls the motor in your project and find it inside your .out file.\nNow try to find the same pin inside the main firmware.\n\n",
