Be aware that Intel IA-32 and AMD64 are very complicated instruction sets and in order to hook a function which is not specifically designed to be hooked by injecting a jump you will run into a great number of different instructions. There is no guarantee that the function even has a stack frame set up. \n\nThere are libraries which can do the disassembly and hooking for you, such as Detours by Microsoft Research.\n\n",

I'd suggest looking at this OSDev wiki page to get an idea of how the instructions are encoded on a simpler level.\n\nFor all practical instruction-length-finding problems, I would advise using a disassembler.\n\nFunction hooking is an interesting challenge. This MSDN blog explains some of the difficulties well. Depending the requirements, it might be preferable to use the operating system's debugging functionality to attach to the process, \"break\" on functions, and implement your hook in a separate process.\n\n",

After reading this, more detailed references will make more sense.\n\nDue to many years of backwards-compatible evolution, the x86 instruction format is quite complicated, with all sorts of optional prefixes and instruction-dependent fields, so it is a bit tricky to work out the instruction length. If you want something robust, I would advise adapting existing software rather than rolling your own. But understanding these concepts will of course be very helpful.\n\n",

It is a human readable representation of the actual hex bytes that are encoding the instructions of the (first generation language) machine code. We typically talk about these bytes by their mnemonics for clarity.\n\nThis is unlike assembly (so, second generation language such as gas or masm) or C (third generation language). Both assembly and higher generation languages are source files with a character encoding (such as UTF-8) that encodes the letters of the source code. In the case of assembly, it needs to be assembled to raw x86 bytes. The raw bytes can be disassembled by IDA into a readable form; it's called disassembly because it's presenting the mnemonic representation encoded in a character set like UTF-8 and displayed to the screen (which resembles an assembly language (a second generation language) that would be assembled to machine code -- in this case it's obviously not going to be assembled and isn't really an assembly language on it's own -- it's showing you what the assembly that was compiled to the machine code would have been).\n\nx86 encoding looks like this (I created a diagram):\n\n\n\nBy the same token, CIL bytecode is a 1st generation language because the opcodes run directly on the virtual machine -- a virtual CPU. This means that the CIL bytecode does not need to be assembled or compiled from a source file with a source character set. ilasm shows a disassembled, mnemonic form of this bytecode.\n\n",
