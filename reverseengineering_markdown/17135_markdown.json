  "content": "Recently I got really interested in BIOS RE and I used chipsec to dump the content of SPI Flash ROM of my HP Omen Desktop PC to start my journey. But unlike older BIOSes, the binary file was pretty huge (8.4 MB). \n\nThe bios image is AMI A0.57 rev A\n\nI have a couple of problems with this BIOS image:\n\nThen I thought maybe Chipsec has failed with dumping the SPI Flash and the file is corrupted but I downloaded the BIOS image from HP's website (ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp81501-82000/sp81781.exe) and the file is the exact same. So, I have no clue and I need help to start learning BIOS reverse engineering.\n\nP.S. I have read BIOS Disassembly Ninjutsu Uncovered; and I can provide the binary if necessary.\n\nPlease be as specific as possible in your answer since I googled 100 times and I'm really disappointed.\nThanks!\n\n",

I thought it might be on the LPC flash but my laptop doesn't appear to have one, plus it looks like you can only send all bios accesses to either LPC or SPI on the chipset and not 0xF0000 to one and 0xFFFF0000 to another. I can't find anything on this. My laptop is booted into legacy bios and has EA at 0xFFFF0 and 90 90 E9 at 0xFFFFFFF0",
