      "content": "I can only properly answer your first question:\n\nI think this is fundamentally impossible to achieve with IDA, but in Ghidra it works and is fairly easy to use (though a bit hard to find)\n\nIf your \"firmware\" is a filesystem that you can unpack, you can automatically load the libraries by:\n\nGhidra will now import your binary and all libraries needed by it. They will automatically be linked, which means that your imports in your main binary are resolved and you can jump to the library code via the GUI when looking at an external function call in your main binary.\n\nI am not sure if this violates your \"not to open a new instance of IDA or add the library in a new tab inside Ghidra\" requirement, because this will open a new tab, in your Codebrowser's Listing window.\n\n",

With some scripting it shouldn't be that hard to automate searching for the library names in some path, adding the found ones, linking them like the External Programs window and then running FixupELFExternalSymbolsScript",
