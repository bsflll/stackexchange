  "content": "I like to view the path between 2 functions with IDA 7.0.\n\nI have already tried with \"function browser\" but not work becouse these 2 functions are not linked.\n\nFor what I see there is no way to choose multiple functions and see their position in the graph.\n\nThere is a way with IDA or other software to show the path between multiple functions ?\n\nThanks !\n\n",

To look for a given function, do that recursively for all the references from the list. A more time-saving method though would be setting two breakpoints in a debugger and logging all the in-between callers.\n\n",
