  "content": "I am trying to extract an object file (.obj) from a Windows static (.lib) library so I can patch it in IDA, then rearchive it back into the library.  I am doing this because IDA won't allow me to patch a static library containing multiple object files.\n\nI am trying to use the ar that comes with mingw.  The file I am looking to extract has a full path (e.g. \"E:/some/path/to/filename.obj\" - the forward slashes are correct).  I can see this file as listed when I run ar -t library.lib.  However, when I run ar -x library.lib E:/some/path/to/filename.obj I get an error \"no entry E:/some/path/to/filename.obj in archive\".\n\nWhat am I doing wrong please?   Or can I apply a patch to an object file within a static library using IDA directly?\n\n",
