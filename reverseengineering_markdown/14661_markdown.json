  "content": "Let's say i have a program.In this program i have a variable named PacketSize of type Short.I want to change the variable's type to Int.\n\nNow if i am able to locate this variable's location in the memory while running the program , how can i use this to accomplish my aim or is it done by another way?\n\nEdit : \n\n*The application is a client.\n\n*The variable is for the tcp packet's length which is sent in the packet header by the server to the client.\n\n*I would guess that it's either a part of a structure (Maybe PacketHeader) or a stack one.\n\n",

But you'll then need to rewrite all commands that reference it to use the new data size, and that's reasonably likely to mean you'll need more space for the instructions. This will be significant work.",
