  "content": "Apologies if this is a duplicate. Don't know what words to search for as that's what the question is about.\n\nI'm relatively new to reverse engineering binaries and while using Ghidra I've noticed that it frequently decompiles the binary to produce functions along these lines:\n\n```\nvoid FUN_803adb50(void)\n{\n  int in_r11;\n  undefined4 unaff_r26;\n  undefined4 unaff_r27;\n  undefined4 unaff_r28;\n  undefined4 unaff_r29;\n  undefined4 unaff_r30;\n  undefined4 unaff_r31;\n  \n  *(undefined4 *)(in_r11 + -0x18) = unaff_r26;\n  *(undefined4 *)(in_r11 + -0x14) = unaff_r27;\n  *(undefined4 *)(in_r11 + -0x10) = unaff_r28;\n  *(undefined4 *)(in_r11 + -0xc) = unaff_r29;\n  *(undefined4 *)(in_r11 + -8) = unaff_r30;\n  *(undefined4 *)(in_r11 + -4) = unaff_r31;\n  return;\n}\n\n```\nWhich is created from the following disassembly:\n\n```\n                     *                          FUNCTION                          *\n                     **************************************************************\n                     void __stdcall FUN_803adb50(void)\n                       assume GQR0 = 0x0\n                       assume GQR1 = 0x0\n                       assume GQR2 = 0x40004\n                       assume GQR3 = 0x50005\n                       assume GQR4 = 0x60006\n                       assume GQR5 = 0x70007\n                       assume GQR6 = 0x0\n                       assume GQR7 = 0x0\n                       assume r13 = 0x805dd0e0\n                       assume r2 = 0x805e6700\n     void              <VOID>         <RETURN>\n                     FUN_803adb50\n803adb50 93 4b ff e8     stw        r26,-0x18(r11)\n                     **************************************************************\n                     *                          FUNCTION                          *\n                     **************************************************************\n                     undefined GetVCTypeSomething()\n                       assume GQR0 = 0x0\n                       assume GQR1 = 0x0\n                       assume GQR2 = 0x40004\n                       assume GQR3 = 0x50005\n                       assume GQR4 = 0x60006\n                       assume GQR5 = 0x70007\n                       assume GQR6 = 0x0\n                       assume GQR7 = 0x0\n                       assume r13 = 0x805dd0e0\n                       assume r2 = 0x805e6700\n     undefined         r3:1           <RETURN>\n                     GetVCTypeSomething\n803adb54 93 6b ff ec     stw        r27,-0x14(r11)\n803adb58 93 8b ff f0     stw        r28,-0x10(r11)\n803adb5c 93 ab ff f4     stw        r29,-0xc(r11)\n803adb60 93 cb ff f8     stw        r30,-0x8(r11)\n803adb64 93 eb ff fc     stw        r31,-0x4(r11)\n803adb68 4e 80 00 20     blr\n\n```\nIt happens frequently enough that it must be some kind of common pattern, always with many variables of an undefined type with the \"unaff_\" prefix which are assigned to an equal number of variables with the \"in_\" prefix. They also commonly appear at the beginning of the caller functions. My instinct is that it's something related to a class structure (I'm unsure of whether or not the original binary was C or C++) but given that I've had no luck with my searches, I figured I'd ask here.\n\nWhat (if any) is the common code pattern that would produce such decompiled code?\n\nBonus points if there's a way to edit the function definition to produce something more legible.\n\n",

      "content": "Regarding unaff_ and in_ prefixes (source):\n\nSo, if you encounter them in decompilator, it means that their values are used before they are initialised in the function (they contain the values assigned earlier, in one of the previous functions). To fix that, you can add these registers as arguments to this function (right click -> edit function signature). You can see more details here and here.\n\nAs for the pattern you are asking for, the r11 register in ARM (I suppose this is the architecture of your binary) is used for accessing local function variables placed on the stack. So, it seems that your function (probably 6 - argument constructor) initialises some class (having 6 members), which was a type of some local variable (declared in caller function) in the original code.\n\n",
