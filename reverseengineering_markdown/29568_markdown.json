  "content": "The x64dbg calculator can evaluate hex expressions.\n\n\n\nIs there a syntax to calculate the sum of a hex value and a decimal value? For the example in the snapshot, is it possible to treat 10 as a decimal? The expected result is 939936F59A. If it can't, what's the most convenient tool to do this kind of calculation?\n\n",
