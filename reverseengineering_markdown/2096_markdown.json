      "content": "Such small snippets are not too hard to decompile manually. Let's try it.\n\nYou have already figured out that cl holds a character, this means that eax where it's read from is a pointer to a character array. Let's call it p. Now, let's do a dumb translation for every assembly statement to C:\n\n```\nl1:            ; l1:\nmov cl, [eax]  ;   cl = *p;\ncmp cl, ' '    ;   if ( cl < ' ' )\njb short l2    ;     goto l2\ncmp cl, ','    ;   if ( cl != ',' )\njnz short l3   ;     goto l3\n\nl2:                      ; l2:\nmov byte ptr [eax], ' '  ;   *p = ' '\n\nl3:                  ; l3:\nmov cl, [eax+1]      ; cl = *(p+1)\ninc eax              ; p = p + 1\ntest cl, cl          ; if ( cl != 0 )\njnz short l1         ;   goto l1\n\n```\nAnd cleaned up:\n\n```\nl1:               \n  cl = *p;\n  if ( cl < ' ' ) \n    goto l2;\n  if ( cl != ',' )\n    goto l3;       \nl2:       \n  *p = ' ';\nl3:           \n  cl = *(p+1);\n  p = p + 1;     \n  if ( cl != 0 )\n    goto l1;\n\n```\nNow, let's have a look at the second if. It has the following form:\n\n```\nif ( condition )\n  goto end_of_if;\n  <if body>\nend_of_if:\n\n```\nAnd here's how we can get rid of the goto:\n\n```\nif ( !condition )\n{\n  <if body>\n}\n\n```\nApplying it to our snippet:\n\n```\nl1:               \n  cl = *p;\n  if ( cl < ' ' ) \n    goto l2;\n  if ( cl == ',' )  {\nl2:       \n    *p = ' ';\n  }\n  cl = *(p+1);\n  p = p + 1;     \n  if ( cl != 0 )\n    goto l1;\n\n```\nNow, how we can get rid of goto l2? If you look at it carefully, you can see that the body at l2 will get executed if either cl < ' ' or cl == ','. So we can just combine the two conditions with a logical OR (||):\n\n```\nl1:               \n  cl = *p;\n  if ( cl < ' ' || cl == ',' ) {\n    *p = ' ';\n  }\n  cl = *(p+1);\n  p = p + 1;     \n  if ( cl != 0 )\n    goto l1;\n\n```\nNow we have one goto left. We have: 1) label at the beginning of a statement block 2) check at the end of the block and 3) goto to the start of the block if the check succeeded. This is a typical pattern of a do-while loop, and we can easily convert it:\n\n```\ndo {\n  cl = *p;\n  if ( cl < ' ' || cl == ',' ) {\n    *p = ' ';\n  }\n  cl = *(p+1);\n  p = p + 1;     \n} while ( cl != 0 )\n\n```\nNow the code is almost nice and pretty, but we can compress it a bit more by substituting equivalent statements:\n\n```\ndo {\n  if ( *p < ' ' || *p == ',' )\n    *p = ' ';\n  cl = *++p;\n} while ( cl != 0 )\n\n```\nAnd, finally, the last assignment can be moved into the condition:\n\n```\ndo {\n  if ( *p < ' ' || *p == ',' )\n    *p = ' ';\n} while ( *++p != 0 )\n\n```\nNow it's obvious what the code is doing: it's going through the string, and replacing all special characters (those with codes less than 0x20 aka space) and commas with the spaces.\n\n",
