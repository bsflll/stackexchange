      "content": "The allocation for most executive objects (like semaphores) is done inside the ObCreateObject() function. As you can see in ObCreateObject()'s prototype, one of the parameters is ObjectSizeToAllocate.\n\nWhen a function like NtCreateSemaphore() is called, it calls ObCreateObject() with the size of the kernel object to be created (for example, sizeof(KSEMAPHORE)) as the value for ObjectSizeToAllocate.\n\nSo the easiest way to answer your question is to set a breakpoint on ObCreateObject() and examine the value of ObjectSizeToAllocate when it's called to create your object of interest.\n\n",
