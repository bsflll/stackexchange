  "content": "Hello I'm playing with my native android library, everything was going smoothly till now. I have problem with opcodes, i don't know how to tell radare2 to write str opcode with specifc registry,  and point it to stack pointer and local variable. \n\nDetails below:\n\nLib loaded via : \n\nBefore changes\n\n```\n|           ; var int local_ch @ sp+0xc\n|           ; var int local_10h @ sp+0x10\n|           ; var int local_18h @ sp+0x18\n[...]\n|           0x0000946c      e00f00f9       str x0, [sp + local_18h]\n|           0x00009470      e10b00f9       str x1, [sp + local_10h]\n\n```\nApplying changes\n\n```\n[0x00009470]> wa str x1,sp+local_10h\nWritten 4 byte(s) (str x1,sp+local_10h) = wx e10300f9\n\n```\nUnwanted output\n\n```\n[0x00009470]> pd 1\n|           0x00009470      e10300f9       str x1, [sp]\n\n```\nOutput that i want but don't know how to get it (note the  \"+ local_10h\" label) \n\n```\n  [0x00009470]> pd 1\n  |           0x00009470     e10b00f9       str x1, [sp + local_10h]\n\n```\n",

      "content": "So to make an order from the comments - you can do it by using two approaches.\n\nIn general, handling function's local variables can be done using the afv command and subcommands. Execute afv? to see its subcommands:\n\n```\n[0x00000000]> afv?\n|Usage: afv[rbs]\n| afvr[?]                     manipulate register based arguments\n| afvb[?]                     manipulate bp based arguments/locals\n| afvs[?]                     manipulate sp based arguments/locals\n| afv*                        output r2 command to add args/locals to flagspace\n| afvR [varname]              list addresses where vars are accessed (READ)\n| afvW [varname]              list addresses where vars are accessed (WRITE)\n| afva                        analyze function arguments/locals\n| afvd name                   output r2 command for displaying the value of args/locals in the debugger\n| afvn [old_name] [new_name]  rename argument/local\n| afvt [name] [new_type]      change type for given argument/local\n| afv-([name])                remove all or given var\n\n```\nBy executing afv you'll see a list of all arguments, and both bp and sp based local variables. For example, by executing afvs you'll see a list of all stack-pointer based variables. Use afvb to see variables that are base-pointer based.\n\nAfter executing these commands, you'll see how these variable names were defined:\n\n```\nvar int local_8h @ rsp+0x8\nvar int local_10h @ rsp+0x10\n\n```\nFor example, you can see that local_8h is defined for rsp+0x8, and local_10h for rsp+0x10.\nWhile debugging, you can use afvd [var_name] to shed more light on the variable.\n\n",
