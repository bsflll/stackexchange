  "content": "gdb allows setting arbitrary convenience variables:\n\n```\nset $a = \"test\"\nset $b = 3\np $a # => \"test\"\np $b # => 3\n\n```\nIs there a way to do something similar in radare2? I'd like to be able to e.g.:\n\n```\nset $len = 0x100\npx `$len` # => does px 0x100\necho $len # => echos 0x100\n\n```\n",
