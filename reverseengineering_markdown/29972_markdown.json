  "content": "Reverse engineering the protocol of a remote-controlled wall socket (433MHz On-Off-Keying) revealed an embedded pattern which apparently uses three symbols (besides 0s).\n\nThe receiver identifies the remote via the sync word K = ABBBBCBACBACBBACBACABBCABC.\n\nThe remote can control up to four individual sockets which learn one of those fixed four codes when a button is pressed to trigger learning mode.\nI assume that different remotes have individual sync words and thus won't interefe with one another. But I cannot confirm that, as I only possess one remote.\n\nTo turn on the first socket, the remote sends DN[0], where\n\nThe remote features a global mode which is able to control all devices simultaniously.\nTo turn on all devices, the remote sends GBB[0], where\n\nI assume that the underlying semantic code (to turn the device on) is the same, no matter if all devices are controlled simultaniously (via GBB) or via a single device instruction (DN).\n\nI have the gut feeling that BB is actually analog to the bits 00,\n that the device codes are analogous to the bits 00, 01, 10, and 11 respectively.\n\nSomehow, the analogy doesn't hold in any case. But the relationship between codes does:\n BBBB for device index 0, binary 00\n BBCA for device index 1, binary 01\n BCAB for device index 2, binary 10\n BCBA for device index 3, binary 11\n It definitively reminds me of an incrementing counter, but it has been passed through some encoding scheme that I was unable to figure out so far.\n\nAll codes I initially thought of (like Non-Return-To-Zero, etc.) encode data using two symbols.\n Does anybody of you have an idea which encoding results in something similar to the three-symbol-encoding I described here?\n\nWhile pressing a button on the receiver, it can be paired to one of the four constant sender codes.\n\nTo turn on the first device (ID 0) the sender has to send\n\n```\nIndividual Device,              ON,             ID_0\n = D                            N               [0]\n = KB                           AB              BBBB\n = ABBBBCBACBACBBACBACABBCABC   AB              BBBB\n = 00000100000101000001010000\n   01010000010100000101010000\n   01010000010000010101000001\n   01000001000001010100000101\n   00000101000001000001010100\n   00010100000100000101010000\n   01000001010000010100000101\n   01000001000001010000010101   00000100000101  00000101000001010000010100000101\n\n```\nSo inside a continuous stream of OOK data (at the right sample rate), it would look like this:\n\n```\n...000000000000000000000000000000010000010100000101000001010000010100000101010000010100000100000101010000010100000100000101010000010100000101000001000001010100000101000001000001010100000100000101000001010000010101000001000001010000010101000001000001010000010100000101000001010000010100000000000000000000...\n\n```\nLabel on the receiver says\n00121949 / hama F3400257 / Hama GmbH & Co KG / www.hama.com\n\n",

This is the same in your case, meaning that receiver identifies the transmitted code, not the sender specifies the unit that is addressed with an action.\n\nLooking at you full data stream, I can see that it is pulse length coded. I think your interpretation of semantic is guiding you the wrong direction at the moment.\n\nWhat is the real physical length of a \"1\" and \"0\"? Is their length exactly the same? I can see only \"1\", \"0\" and \"00000\", so 3 different time lengths, is this correct?\n\nWhat device has been used for capturing the stream?\n\nIs there anything known about your device?\nOOK on 433MHz is standard method, and a lot of codes had been identified and made public, by example here. That will shorten the process if successful\n\nDoing it the long way the transcoding of your bitstream and using above assumption (0=longLow, 1=shortHigh, 2=shortLow) gets:\n\n```\n..000101210121012101210121210121010121210121010121210121012101012121012101012121010121012101212101012101212101012101210121012101210000..\n\n```\nThis needs to be transcoded into data stream next to identify the \"0\" and \"1\" and identificationID of sender actions etc.\n\n",
