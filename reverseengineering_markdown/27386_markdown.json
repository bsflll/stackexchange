  "content": "I am still quite inexperienced in reverse engineering. I have a small program that establishes an HTTP connection to a server and send data via POST method to the servert. I see strings like Winhttp.dll, WinHttpOpen, WinHttpOpenRequest, etc. I have added breakpoints for all the commands I have found. However, the breakpoints never hit. I see that the program connects to the server and sends encrypted data via POST to the server. I see that the sample starts multiple threads. I'm guessing that I need to jump into the correct thread, right? If this is true, how do I do this in X32dbg? I this sample I have set breakpoint at 12345678 and abababab. These addresses are pseudo adresses.\n\n```\n12345678 | mov eax,sample.123343|String=\"winhttp.dll\"\nabababab | mov eax,sample.5B33E0|String=\"WinHttpOpenRequest\"\n...\n\n```\n",
