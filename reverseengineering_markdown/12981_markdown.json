      "content": "You need to create FLIRT signatures from the static libraries using the FLAIR kit and then apply those signatures to the loaded file. Note that this will only work if the exact same libraries were used in the binary's compilation (e.g. compilation options must match) since FLIRT relies on byte matching. For more info about FLIRT see https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/tech/flirt/in_depth.shtml\n\n",

      "content": "probably this ida pro plugin can help syms2elf\nThe plugin export the symbols (for the moment only functions) recognized by IDA Pro and radare2 to the ELF symbol table. This allows us to use the power of IDA/r2 in recognizing functions (analysis, FLIRT signatures, manual creation, renaming, etc), but not be limited to the exclusive use of this tools.\nSupports 32 and 64-bits file format.\nEXAMPLE\nBased on a full-stripped ELF:\n$ file test1_x86_stripped \ntest1_x86_stripped: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, stripped\n \n\nhttps://github.com/danigargu/ida-syms2elf\n\nedit\nanother plugin wsym Adds symbols to an ELF file. Sort of the opposite of strip. This is in a very early stage of development and should be considered PoC/beta software.\nhttps://github.com/wapiflapi/wsym\n\n",
