  "content": "(Cross-posted from Stack Overflow)\n\nAre there any debuggers that constantly show a visual of the stack and where everything is within it? For example, taking some random image:\n\n\n\nI use gdb for most debugging/learning, and while it does show the registers, I have to do something like x/8gx $rbp-32 everytime I want to see the stack -- and from that I usually figure out how I want the data to show.\n\nAre there any debuggers that make this information friendlier and more visual? I am very, very new to asm and the visual does help when debugging the information. (I'm hoping some off-the-shelf product such as Hopper, IDA, x86db, etc.)\n\n",

      "content": "I assume you are using *nix based systems since you mentioned gdb. If you just want to print the stack/registers when you hit a break point, you can use command to set up some print statements. See here.\n\nInstalling pwndbg makes it a lot less exhausting as it prints out the stack and registers every time you step, with  labels on the stack identifying rbp and rsp. Additionally there are tools like GEF and PEDA that are similar, but I don't have any firsthand experience with them.\n\n\nAdditionally, there are a few debuggers with GUIs, if that is what you are looking for:\n\n",
