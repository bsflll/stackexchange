  "content": "I want to add a remark for all non direct function calls.\ne.g. say i have\n\n```\nmov EAX [functionEP]\ncall EAX\n\n```\nAssuming i have many such calls to various functions, I would like to run the debugger and every time there are calls to such function add a remark which states the real call address/function name so that it will be:\n\n```\nmov EAX [functionEP]\ncall EAX ; functionName\n\n```\nIs this possible?\n\n",
