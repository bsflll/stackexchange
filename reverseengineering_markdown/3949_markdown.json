      "content": "You can disassemble a DOS 16-bit executable using radare2 as follows:\n\nExample using TEXTINST.EXE from the FreeDOS 1.1 CDROM image:\n\n```\nbash$ radare2 TEXTINST.EXE\nSS : 214f\nSP : 4c00\nIP : 0\nCS : 0\nNRELOCS: 1\nRELOC  : 1c\nCHKSUM : 0\n[0000:0020]> aa\n[0000:0020]> pd 10\n   ;      [0] va=0x00000020 pa=0x00000020 sz=67272 vsz=67272 rwx=-rwx .text\n            ;-- section..text:\n            0000:0020    b93b03       mov cx, 0x33b\n            0000:0023    be7406       mov si, 0x674\n            0000:0026    89f7         mov di, si\n            0000:0028    1e           push ds\n            0000:0029    a9b580       test ax, 0x80b5\n        |   0000:002c    8cc8         mov ax, cs\n        |   0000:002e    050510       add ax, 0x1005\n        |   0000:0031    8ed8         mov ds, ax\n        |   0000:0033    05f010       add ax, 0x10f0\n        |   0000:0036    8ec0         mov es, ax\n(etc)\n\n```\nIf required, you can force the disassembler, etc. to assume DOS as follows:\n\n```\ne asm.arch=x86\ne asm.os=dos\n\n```\nIf you think you have a DOS executable and the above doesn't work, there may be something more subtle going on, and you should post a question showing specifically what you tried, what you expect and what is not working.  \n\nNote: showing what you tried, etc. is more likely to elicit answers on the SE sites...\n\n",
