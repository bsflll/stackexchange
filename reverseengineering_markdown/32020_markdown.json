  "content": "I managed to log BLE communications with a Nordic chip based device I am interested in on my Android phone and loaded the log in Wireshark, applying btatt as filter.\n\nIt uses some default BLE \"transmissions\" like \"Battery Service: Battery Level\" as well as UART for actual control. Wiresharks Info column shows e.g.:\n\n```\nSent Write Request, Handle: 0x0011 (Nordic UART Service: Nordic UART Tx)\n...\nRcvd Handle Value Notification, Handle: 0x000e (Nordic UART Service: Nordic UART Rx)\n\n```\nHow can I set a filter to get only the UART Rx and Tx raw data as a list?\n\n",
