  "content": "I cam using the capstone disassembly framework to disassemble intel x86 code. I need to find out which operands are read to or written from (or both). According to the website, this is possible by doing operand.access, which holds CSACREAD | CSAWRITE flags.\n\nhttp://www.capstone-engine.org/op_access.html\n\nHowever, if we look at the definition on github:\n\nhttps://github.com/aquynh/capstone/blob/master/include/x86.h#L183\n\nno operand[0].access exists!\n\nWhat's going on? Does this feature not exist yet? Was it removed?\n\n",
