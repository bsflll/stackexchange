There is very little information on the Internet on how to solve such problems.That's why I decided to study obfuscation to understand how it works, if I can understand how it works then I will be able to find signatures in the code.\nWhere can I read more about obfuscation? What are the good resources to understand the techniques and required programming?\n\nI'm solving this crackme.\n\n",
