  "content": "The source file is in intel 32 bit .hex format, it was built for a nuvoton NUC220LE3AE. I want to decompile it to C++, or at least assembly. I have some experience with assembly, but mostly with MIPS and that was years ago - so high level code is preferred. \n\nLink to .hex file: http://www.3fvape.com/images/3fvape-blog-img/20150806-4384-xcubeII-upgrade/SMOK_X_CUBE_II_firmware_v1.07.hex\n\nThe device it resides in is a SMOK Xcube 2 (e-cig box mod.)\n\nMy goal is to add an option to control the LED color based on the atomizer temperature.\n\nI searched but could not find an applicable how-to.\n\n",

There's discussion why elsewhere on this site, so i won't get into details.\n\nAlso, note there's not an easy walk-through or how-to. You need to experiment, and you'll need some experience as well. \n\nTo get you started, you might:\n\n",
