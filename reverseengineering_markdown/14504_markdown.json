  "content": "I am in search of looking an open source sandbox that has the following features: \n- route my network traffic to the sandbox for analysis\n- perform analysis on network traffic to detect malicious activities or generate intelligence from traffic\nwhat I am mostly interested is to route netflow data if possible!\nI have checked cuckoo sandbox but it only has the ability to submit samples! I could not find a way that I can route my network traffic to cuckoo.\n\n",

      "content": "If you are analyzing ELF binaries, then the open source online sandbox detux may prove useful:\n\nDetux logs network data including IP addresses the program sends signals to, DNS queries, URLs accessed and TCP raw streams:\n\n\n\nIf you are performing analysis of Windows PE binaries then FakeNet may be of interest to you:\n\nNote that FakeNet is not a sandbox but is employed when analyzing binaries on an isolated system.\n\nIf neither of these tools are what you are looking for, here is a long list of online scanners and sandboxes: https://github.com/rshipp/awesome-malware-analysis#online-scanners-and-sandboxes\nand here is Lenny Zeltser's list of free automated malware analysis sandboxes and services: https://zeltser.com/automated-malware-analysis/\n\nIf there is no tool that meets your requirements you can always create your own analysis lab. Books that will provide guidance for such an endeavor include \"Practical Malware Analysis\" by Honig and Sikorski (creators of FakeNet) and \"Malware Analyst's Cookbook\" by Ligh and Adair.\n\n",
