  "content": "Device: i was able to recover bricked Chinese IOT a Sous Vide cooker. Replaced damaged capacitor. it works.\n\nit has \n\nLacks features: i would like to start the timer only after the device reach the target temperature: with meats, it is ok to add food to the water as it heats. Not for Poached eggs!\n\nI downloaded the firmware update payload motorola srecord SREC format concatenated with a big blob of data like BMP & i18n files. i used ghidra to look inside the code SREC : ARM 32bit/16bit big endian. \n\nQemu emulation with unicorn framework: i traced mcr instructions. it seems the firmware is configuring the MPU this way:\n\n\n\n\nRecon Then i was able to id \"Boot_console_put(char *)\" function and a memory address where the firmware write char by char all the boot  message related strings: 0x3402f404\n\n\n\nConsole Output Then the emulated firmware update payload seems to be stuck on a loop when trying to acces and I2C slave (could be the eeprom) printing this:\n\n```\n[boot] entering HW_MCASIC_init\n[boot NVM] I2C: SDA seems stuck low!\n[boot NVM] I2C: SDA seems stuck low!\n[boot NVM] I2C: SDA seems stuck low!\n\n```\nthe code dealing with I2C seem a bit too much convoluted for a rapid understanding\n\nThe question :  i would like to guess What are all the others address the firmware is referencing in the code. Searching google and github for similar constant/base address & offsets didn't help... google search result returning off topic commercial links.\n\n",
