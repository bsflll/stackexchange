  "content": "I'm in a reverse engineering class. Our current assignment is to edit a notepad.exe application. Just to start out, I opened my notepad.exe in FlexHex, went to the end of the.rsrc section, changed a byte in one of the stock text strings from \"70\" to \"31\" and then saved the new file as an .exe. The size of the section and the overall file remains the same. Below is the line I changed.\n\n\n\nWhen I try to run the file, I get an error that Windows cannot run the file, specifically \"This app cannot run on your PC\". I didn't think that I changed anything essential. I'm wondering if Windows is preventing me from running a modified version of a Window's program. Is there a way to specify that Windows should run this program?\n\nAny help is appreciated, thank you.\n\n",

If you try to execute notepad.exe from another designed folder (e.g. desktop), the application won't run and you won't get any error message. This is because the .mui is not present is the current folder. I suggest you share the modified executable for further investigations.",
