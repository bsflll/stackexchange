  "content": "I am attempting to debug a process with windbg (with admin privileges) and I am getting the following error:\n\n```\nCould not attach to process XXXX =, NTSTATUS 0xC0000022\n\n{Access Denied} A process has requested access to an object, but has not been granted those access rights\n\n```\nI know some anti-debugging tricks are at play, but I am not sure where to start looking. This program is running multiple processes, including a few with interesting names such as InjectionService, I cannot attach to any of them. And the binaries themselves are obfuscated. I am wondering if someone can point me in the right direction to get started, for example by referencing some reading material.\n\n",

Provided Microsoft's implementation of it is flawless (I don't think it is, but let's use that as the premise), I don't see how you'd be able to circumvent this on a running system. The very purpose is that the ELAM carries public key material that allows usermode AM services to be secured. You won't get around static analysis unless you are the one to find a flaw in Microsoft's implementation.",

This can be done by observing the system behavior and by dumping the kernel various times. Usually on-demand crash dumps are allowed.\n\nOnce you managed to understand it, you have to find your way in having your code executed at ring 0. I usually find library side loading or patching an easy technique to have my code loaded when the signature is not enforced.\n\nYour code should be able to disable the ACLs that prevent you from attaching a debugger. Note that, at ring 0, you are at other side of the airtight and ACLs do behave differently. Just escalating your privileges to ring 0 is usually enough.\n\nJust for reference, a couple of times, the processes to allow to attach a debugger where stored in a list on a kernel driver. The driver couldn't be touched as signed, therefore the patching was done in RAM.\n\n",

          "text": "While there are a few gems in this answer, it also cripples certain aspects. ACLs in KM are completely irrelevant for calls hailing from KM. Checking is typically only done for calls hailing from UM. This explains why the \"same\" functions (ntdll.dll vs. ntoskrnl.exe) behave differently. The SSDT is the key here. Furthermore I think static analysis of the drivers is more likely to yield helpful pointers. The ELAM itself is probably no useful target as it has restrictions that make it unlikely that it contains additional functionality. Also, mastering dump analysis is no small feat either ;)",

To give you an example: if a driver creates a DO oftentimes the ACL won't be explicitly set. It can be done, but the default is plenty restrictive. And a Win32 service - running in the TCB - will typically be able to deal with a restrictive ACL. Also, since the OP came forward with ELAM-related aspects, I don't think that ACLs alone suffice to cover the possible angles (initially I thought of typical run-of-the-mill software, not AV/AM).",
