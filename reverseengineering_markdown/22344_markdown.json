  "content": "Sorry if this is a stupid question but couldnt find the answer by googling\n\nRight now I analyze a malware by using remote debugger of IDA, and i run the debugger on a isolated VM that has shared a folder to my IDA's VM, as of right now the way i analyze a sample is by putting it on that shared folder so i can run the remote debugger, because if i set the path to a location in my IDA's VM then it won't work (it says wrong parameters), so it looks like the sample has to be in a location where both my IDA's VM and the isolated VM can reach (i think) \n\nso to solve this i just put samples i want to analyze in the shared folder\n\nthe problem is that the .idb file spawns there as well and if its a ransomware then my .idb file will get ruined  ( i have to say that IDA's VM is also in a isolated host only network)\n\nso two questions :\n\n",

After creating the IDB you can even delete the input file or move it elsewhere; IDB is completely self-contained and does not need the file anymore.\n\nHere's a suggested workflow:\n\n",
