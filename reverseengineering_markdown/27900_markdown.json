  "content": "I'm reversing a Delphi program and have a part where it says:\n\n```\nResult = *(Self - 44);\n\n```\nBut I want it to say something like:\n\n```\nResult = *(Self - offsetof(VMT_ClassDefinition, vmtClassName));\n\n```\nBeing VMT_ClassDefinition the following struct:\n\n```\nstruct VMT_ClassDefinition {\n    Cardinal vmtSelfPtr;\n    Cardinal vmtIntfTable;\n    Cardinal vmtAutoTable;\n    Cardinal vmtInitTable;\n    Cardinal vmtTypeInfo;\n    Cardinal vmtFieldTable;\n    Cardinal vmtMethodTable;\n    Cardinal vmtDynamicTable;\n    Cardinal vmtClassName;\n    Cardinal vmtInstanceSize;\n    Cardinal vmtParent;\n    Cardinal vmtSafeCallException;\n    Cardinal vmtAfterConstruction;\n    Cardinal vmtBeforeDestruction;\n    Cardinal vmtDispatch;\n    Cardinal vmtDefaultHandler;\n    Cardinal vmtNewInstance;\n    Cardinal vmtFreeInstance;\n    Cardinal vmtDestroy;\n};\n\n```\nWhere cardinal is unsigned int. The problem is that after using \"Right Click > Struct offset\" on top of the number 44 it generates the following result:\n\n```\nResult = *(Self - offsetof(VMT_ClassDefinition, vmtSafeCallException));\n\n```\nI was doing what is said in New features in Hex-Rays Decompiler 1.6 section 3, but as you can see the expected result and what I got is totally different.\n\nMy guess is that it forgets about the \"-\" sign and just advances from the start +44. Is there a way to reverse this behavior? I know it can be done in ASM view by inverting with \"_\" and then pressing \"T\" like in Negated structure offsets, but that does not apply to the Pseudocode view.\n\n",
