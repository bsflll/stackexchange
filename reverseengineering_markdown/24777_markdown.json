  "content": "Reverse engineering some Automotive CAN data and the CRC is getting me. \n8 bytes per message, with Byte 0 being the CRC.\nByte 1 & 0xF contains a counter [0x0 to 0xF]. The rest of the message is data.\n\nI've tried running lines of data through various CRC calculations but getting nowhere fast. Any help would be appreciated. csv on the link below \n\nI've been running lines of this through reveng and getting the odd match but it's a bit hit and miss\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1w7diZetSim7hVV1P-2Qls3DfFkB-57vT\n\nData here is:\nID,B0,B1,B2...,B7 in Hex\n\n40F8000000C0000000\n409C010000C0000000\n4030020000C0000000\n4054030000C0000000\n4047040000C0000000\n4023050000C0000000\n408F060000C0000000\n40EB070000C0000000\n40A9080000C0000000\n40CD090000C0000000\n4061100000C0000000\n4005110000C0000000\n4016120000C0000000\n4072130000C0000000\n40DE140000C0000000\n40BA150000C0000000\n\nThanks in advance,\nD\n\n",
