  "content": "I have a PE executable (32 bit) GUI program and I tried to reverse engineer it. I opened it in Ghidra and discovered the entry calls wWinMainCRTStartup. However, when I checked wWinMainCRTStartup all the bytes are filed with ?? and when I tried to disassemble it Ghidra says Can't disassemble uninitialized memory. I'm confused... if the memory is uninitialized then how can the program run at all? But the program does run.\n\n",
