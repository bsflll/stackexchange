IDA saves internally the original as well as the patched content.\n\nMake your modifications using the sub menu commands of Edit -> Patch program\n\nIf your modifications are completed you can apply the modifications on an external file. To do so use menu Edit -> Patch program -> Apply patches to input file. \nIt allows you to select an external file and apply the changes you have made to it.\n\n",
