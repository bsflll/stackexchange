While working with write-mode you can work regularly with radare2 as you are used to. It doesn't change a thing.

      "content": "Just to update @Megabeets answer. \n\nWhen you start with an empty file (created by touch), the w command will not work by default even if the r2 will be started in write mode. The missing information is, in that case, the mapping\n\n```\n[0x00000000]> om\n[0x00000000]\n\n```\nReturns an empty result. Apart from listing, the om command can also be used to create the mapping:\n\n```\nUsage: om[-] [arg]   # map opened files\n| om                                       list all defined IO maps\n...\n| om fd vaddr [size] [paddr] [rwx] [name]  create new io map\n...\n\n```\nIn order to do the mapping, one needs to specify (for example) the following command\n\n```\n[0x00000000]> om 3 0x0 12\n[0x00000000]> om\n 1 fd: 3 +0x00000000 0x00000000 - 0x0000000b rwx\n\n```\nThat will create, for the file description 3, a 12 bytes in size mapping starting from an address 0x0. \n\nAfter that w will work:\n\n```\n[0x00000000]> w Hello world!\n[0x00000000]> px 32\n- offset -   0 1  2 3  4 5  6 7  8 9  A B  C D  E F  0123456789ABCDEF\n0x00000000  4865 6c6c 6f20 776f 726c 6421 ffff ffff  Hello world!....\n0x00000010  ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff  ................\n[0x00000000]>\n\n```\n",
