  "content": "I don't know if this is the right community to ask this to but I have this speaker and I want to change the startup, shutdown sound effect of it. It is not a chinese BT speaker but a Hama soundbarrel. I can't disassemble it to reveal the circuit board. Any way to pull the firmware to my PC and then push back the modified firmware? I only have an AUX, USB and a Type C port.\n\n",

I suggest you always do it on a device you will not use or you are not currently using because there is always a chance of bricking the device or shorting circuitry so if you want to do it on your speaker just buy another one and try it on that second one.\n\n",
