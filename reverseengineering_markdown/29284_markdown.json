  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/29284/pascal-string-representation-in-hex-rays-decompiler-of-ida-pro",
  "content": "I'm trying to prettify a representation of Pascal-string \"Could not access file \"\" in Hex-Rays decompiler's output. As you can see below,\n\n\nnow its type is char[25] due to inclusion of hexademical string length. How can I force IDA to perceive Pascal-strings properly during their depiction in Hex-Rays pane? I want to see for all Pascal-string in corresponding window something like\n\n```\nLODWORD(v90) = ConcatenateStrings_R8_R9_to_RCX(v140, 255i64, \"Could not access file \\\"\", v158);\n\n```\nI tried to change types via \"Set item type...\" as showed below.\n\n\nUnfortunately, these options didn't help.\n\n",
