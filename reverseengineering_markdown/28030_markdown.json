This might be related for some protections? I'm new to RE and to IDA. I did not yet analyze deeply the routines before the int 2Dh anti-debug technique.\n\nThe view during static analysis is:\n\n\n\nThe view during debug is:\n\n\n\nAs you may notice, the original int 2Dh command has been reverted.\n\n",
