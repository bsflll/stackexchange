  "content": "I'm working with a binary file that has been encrypted using the AES cipher, but I'm unsure of which mode of operation was used (e.g., ECB, CBC, GCM, etc.). I need to automate the process of identifying the mode, if possible. The binary file is encrypted, and I don't have the key and don't want to brute force the key.\n\n",
