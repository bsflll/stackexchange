  "content": "I've had this idea for a while for a tool I'd like to make to assist people in getting used to keybinds in EVE Online. Not sure how useful it'd actually be, but seems like a fun project nonetheless.\n\nI've plenty experience with C#, C++ and .NET so that's all fine, my struggle is trying to understand the format this stuff is stored in.\n\nI have done some very, very basic reverse engineering in the past but my brain is far too smooth for something more complex like this.\n\nI've generated 2 files, Old.dat and New.dat, they should be identical - the only difference being I changed one keybinding. Which should be charSheetSelectedPanel.\n\nOld.dat should have that feature bound to ALT-A.\nNew.dat should have that feature bound to CTRL-ALT-A.\n\nI have set up a DiffChecker here. The change in question should be on line 59.\n\nI've looked at this with HxD, but am not able to make any sense out of it. I'm aware that the shortcuts are most likely not gonna be strings, but rather integers that refer to keycodes. I'm hoping that they use known keycode formats.\n\nBut so far no dice and have no idea how to approach this or if it's even feasible. Any pointers/help would be greatly appreciated!\n\n",
