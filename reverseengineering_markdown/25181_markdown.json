  "content": "I wanted to run an app on a VM but there are PUSH PUSH RETs stopping me from looking at their anti VM code. There is a messagebox when I run it on a VM. I set a breakpoint at MessageBoxA and it gets triggered as well as EAX is showing the message for the VM. It's all good until now.\n\n\n\nI'm using x64dbg and I opened Call Stack tab and double-clicked on the address after user32.MessageBoxA (basically 2nd record), so I could trace back the calls before the actual MessageBoxA. It landed me here:\n\n\n\nI heard that PUSH RET is like a jmp, PUSH PUSH RET is like a call. How do they work? Can they be deobfuscated with a tool/plugin or something?\n\nPUSH 0xC9DFBF leads me here:\n\n\n\nPUSH 0xA4DB49 leads me here:\n\n\n\nWhen I follow that jmp, it leads to similar code to PUSH 0xC9DFBF's image which ends with a jmp to MessageBoxA.\n\nWhat could you recommend me to step into the code before the actual MessageBoxA call, so I can find their anti VM code and patch it? Do I need to step the instructions from the beginning one by one?\n\nDumps: http://ufile.io/56c5b2z6. Rebase to 0x1270000 and find 0181E65C address. This address is in the executable file. I attached two dumped DLLs as well, because they were referenced.\n\n",

      "content": "The RET instruction transfers control to the return address located on the stack. Normally this is used to go back from a function to where the function was called, as the address of the next instruction was pushed into the stack by the CALL instruction.\n\nHowever, RET can be misused: a PUSH before a RET instruction is a typical obfuscation technique. In this case, when executing the RET, instead of coming back to the caller function, it behaves like a jump to the previously pushed address. This is not something your decompiler expects, which may result in a jump to a memory zone that hasn't been decompiled or has been incorrectly decompiled.\n\nPUSH PUSH RET can be used to implement a CALL as you mention. In that case, the first PUSH pushes the return address into the stack (the one after the RET). The second PUSH pushes the function address. The RET (as explained before) jumps to the function address (and removes this address from the stack). When the function address executes its RET, it jumps back to the address currently located on the stack (the one of the first PUSH), coming back to the caller of the function. Note though that this is not your case. In your case the first address pushed is not in the current function. This means that this is not implementing a CALL. Most likely this it is used as an obfuscation technique, making more complicated to follow the calls and maybe tricking your disassembly to show you the code incorrectly.\n\nAlso, note that executing a PUSH doesn't lead you anywhere. It just pushes the address into the stack. It is the RET instruction which actually jumps to the last pushed address. This also means that the second pushed address is visited before the first one. This means that the code you are looking for is reached from A4DB49 (the first address to which RET jumps) that is another JUMP.\n\nI recommend you to check the Anti-Disassembly chapter of the Practical Malware Analysis Book, where this kind of techniques are covered in detail and with examples.\n\n",
