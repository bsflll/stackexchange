      "content": "By far the easiest way to work with a .NET DLL is to just add it to a console app in the IDE.\n\nHowever you're then at the mercy of any static initialisation in that class or any classes referenced by that class, which might be something to worry about if you think this is malicious code. (But in that case you should be reading it not running it I expect.)\n\nTo make your existing loader work you can just call the static method on your type directly without making an instance, e.g.\n\n```\ntype.GetMethod(i).Invoke(null, null);\n\n```\n(relevant StackOverflow question)\n\n",
