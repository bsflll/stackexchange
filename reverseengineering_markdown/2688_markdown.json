  "content": "I was working on a C#.NET application on windows platform, I was just testing the code and I don't know somehow I messed it up and after making too much efforts on undoing, I am still not able to recover my code. I don't want to write the whole code again.\n\nI only left with its .EXE file that executes well here, I want to know about some techniques or tools so that I can decompile my EXE code into its source code, Is it possible if it is, then please tell me some good decompilers. Any help will be appreciated, Thanks.\n\n",

Both of them will decompile the program into the intermediate language to roughly the same results but I've had better experiences (i.e. smoother, easier) parsing variable values using IlSpy.\n\nBut if it's your own code and you remember what all of your variable values are then either one will work fine. Just my two cents.\n\n",
