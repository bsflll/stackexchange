  "content": "I have a problem that NtdllDefWindowProc_A function from ntdll is\ninside user32 thunk.\n\n\n\nFollowing @Jason Geffner answer in ImpRec invalid thunks seem valid I tried to change it to NtdllDefWindowProc_A from user32, but when I rebuild it after the fix with PE tool the file didn't work at all.\n\nThen I tried again and cut NtdllDefWindowProc_A function from the chunk,\nand the rebuild work and the file run without a problem.\n\nits probably not a good idea to cut NtdllDefWindowProc_A from the file....So what did I did wrong?\n\nThanks you all for the help :-)\n\n",

If you look at the exports from user32.dll, you'll see DefWindowProcA is alphabetically between exports DeleteMenu and DefMDIChildProcA. 2. The function name NtdllDefWindowProc_A sounds like it might be a hook or forwarded-function for DefWindowProcA.",
