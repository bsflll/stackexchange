  "content": "When trying to understand the behavior of web apps, I find myself stumbling against the fact that some network messages do not appear on the network tab of the web developer tool of the browser. For example, on the web app of whatsapp (https://web.whatsapp.com/) sending or receiving a message will not leave a line on the network tab.\n\nHere's what I tried to do:\n\nAny explanation or pointer much appreciated.\n\n",
