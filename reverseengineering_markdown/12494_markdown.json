  "content": "I am looking at a 32 byte sequence, the chksum I believe is either the 1st two bytes or last 2 bytes (I am leaning on the last 2 bytes).  I think it is a straight 16bit xor but I can't find the crunch number to put against it.  It could be crc or citt too, I can't say for sure.\n\nHere are 3 packets to work with, any help will be greatly appreciated.\n\n55 00 53 4D 34 34 51 49 00 00 00 00 00 00 4F 1F \nDF F1 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 C7 CC\n\n16 02 53 4D 31 30 30 54 51 47 00 00 00 00 C8 7F\nA8 F4 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 41 F5\n\n11 00 53 4D 34 38 44 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 69 DC\n9C F3 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 F3 48 \n\n",

I am trying to build custom sockets for my chip programmer system and the socket modules contains an EE with the code(s) above which identify the socket  Is there a way I could send you the firmware from the unit to look at.
