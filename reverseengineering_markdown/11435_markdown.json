  "content": "I have address of virtual function in export table , is it possible to get implementation function address, that makes whole logic of virtual ? \n\nCode sample:\n\nthis is virtual function that goes to export table\n\n```\nclass CORE_API FArchive\n{\npublic:\n    virtual ~FArchive()\n    {}\n    virtual void messageboxer(char* messagetext){}\n};\n\n```\nand this is virtual function implementation\n\n```\nclass FArchiveFileReader : public FArchive\n{\npublic:\n\n    void messageboxer(char* messagetext)\n    {\n        MessageBoxA(0, messagetext, \"alert\", MB_ICONERROR);\n    }\n};\n\n```\nSo in export table goes only virtual - like that ?messageboxer@FArchive@@UAEXPAD@Z\n\nIf i go on that address(in memmory via debugger) i get this \nhttps://i.sstatic.net/se3Tb.png - i dont see there nothing usefull, like jmp or call.\nand this https://i.sstatic.net/ZmKgV.png is where function implementation is, is it connected somehow ? so i can calculate it.\n\nOr having virtual function address from export table - is nothing, in terms of getting address of function(with actual logic) ?\n\nIf so - can someone give me an simple and good article describing on how to get address of actual function(not virtual).\n\nP.S.\nAnd sorry if i talk little strange, english isnt my common language, if you think that some place in my text is unclear, pls tell me where and i would try to explain better !\n\nHope someoe would help me\n\nthx!\n\n",
