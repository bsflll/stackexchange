  "content": "I am reverse engineering a very old game and when I load up the executable in Ghidra, I see a handful of imported dlls\n\n\n\nI do however not see one of the DLLs the game uses to wrap various client rendering Direct X 7 calls. I have loaded (and analyzed the separate dll) but can't seem to figure out how I can get the game exe to recognize the dll. My hope is (because the DLL has function names that I can see via Dependency Walker), that I can see the calls by name to the DLL. I am able to see them via ollydbg (possibly because the game is running).\n\nAm I missing something?\n\nI found this post here which looks relevant.\n\nI do not see the EXTERNAL identifier, but instead something like this:\n\niVar3 = (*(code *)FLOAT_006e5188)(param_1[1],iVar3,&local_24);\n\nThis is a function pointer pointing towards the function in the DLL. How can I fix this?\n\n",
