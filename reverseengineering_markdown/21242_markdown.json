  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/21242/handling-pointer-to-middle-of-struct-in-ghidra",
  "content": "Sometimes I encounter pointers to the middle of a structure, and the code uses a negative offset to refer to earlier code.  This can result in assembly that looks like this, using MIPS as an example architecture:\n\n```\nlw -0x4($s0)\n\n```\nIn IDA Pro, I can highlight the \"-0x4\" part of that instruction and press T to open a new dialog that allows me to set a \"delta\" (the feature is described fully in detail here: http://www.hexblog.com/?p=63).  If I knew that $s0 pointed to the 4th byte of a structure, I could set the delta to -4 and get something like this:\n\n```\nlw struct.field0+4($s0)\n\n```\nIs there an analogous way to operate on the middle of a structure in Ghidra?\n\n",
