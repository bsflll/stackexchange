  "content": "I am playing an online MMORPG game, based on player versus player idea. In this game, characters have skills. I want to capture the sent packet, when a specific skill is pressed on keyboard or etc. Basically, I want to analyze byte flow after a specific event. Which tools can I utilize to achieve this?\n\nI tried Wireshark, but as there are lots of packets are being sent in an arbitrary instance, I couldn't observe which one was sent on my specific event.\n\np.s. As an additional info, the game has illegal bot softwares. I want to understand how they developed the bot.\n\n",

Therefore as a good start you should enter an area where you are completely alone (no other players or AI controlled NPCs) and do some actions. Note the time and try to find something in the data stream that is different at those specific times.",
