  "content": "I have the following Assembler Code in a x86 Program and I need to modify it as it is buggy:\n\n```\nfld     ds:(flt_203B8 - 29C48h)[ebx]\nfdivr   dword ptr [esi+44h]\nfmul    ds:(flt_203BC - 29C48h)[ebx]\nfisttp  [ebp+var_334]\nmov     eax, [ebp+var_334]\ncmp     eax, 0Fh\njg      short greater\n\ntest    eax, eax\nmov     edx, 0\ncmovs   eax, edx\njmp     short valueWithinLimits\n\n\ngreater:\nmov     eax, 0Fh\n\nvalueWithinLimits:\n....\n\n```\nIn Pseudocode this is\n\n```\nv29 = (signed int)(*(float *)(v3 + 68) / 40.0 * 15.0);\nif ( v29 > 15 )\n{\n  v29 = 15;\n}\nelse if ( v29 < 0 )\n{\n  v29 = 0;\n}\n\n```\nI need to insert the following line as second line:\n\n```\nv29 = 15 - v29;\n\n```\nIs there any way I can do that without needing any more space? I assume no but maybe someone has a smart Idea here what can be done in this case.\n\n",

      "content": "It's hard to say, since you didn't post the entire assembly related to the pseudocode. It seems however, that the \"if\" block is implemented via jumps. In that case, you may use conditional moves instead. For example, assuming that \"if\" block is implemented like this (uses 28 bytes):\n\n```\n  cmp eax, 0Fh\n  jg greater\n  cmp eax, 0\n  jl less\n  jmp continue\nless:\n  mov [ebp+var_334], 0\n  jmp continue\ngreater:\n  mov [ebp+var_334], 0Fh\ncontinue:\n\n```\nYou may implement it like below:\n\n```\n  mov ebx, 0Fh\n  cmp eax, 0Fh\n  cmovg eax, ebx\n  xor ebx, ebx\n  cmp eax, 0\n  cmovl eax, ebx\n  mov [ebp+var_334], eax\n\n```\nThis implementation uses 22 bytes, which is 6 bytes lower than the previous one - exactly the space you need to insert fsubr instruction to compute 15 - st(0) before storing the result in v29.\n\nConsider this implementation:\n\n```\n  xor ebx, ebx    ; ebx = 0\n  mov bl, 15      ; ebx = 15\n  neg eax         ; eax = -eax\n  add eax, ebx    ; eax = 15 - eax\n  cmp eax, ebx    \n  cmovg eax, ebx\n  xor ebx, ebx\n  test eax, eax\n  cmovs eax, ebx\n\n```\nIt's even shorter (occupies 20 bytes), does the whole job and doesn't require additional operations on floats.\n\n",
