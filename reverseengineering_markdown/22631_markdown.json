  "content": "I have a list of messages from a control unit that i'm trying to replicate.\nI have the body of the message correct, however, i can't seem to work out what CRC or checksum is being utilised.\n\n```\n00 FE 0F 32 A8 80 84 90\n00 FE 0F 32 A8 80 84 54\n00 FE FF 31 A8 80 84 38\n00 FE 0F 32 A8 80 84 DC\n00 FE 0F 32 A8 80 84 90\n00 FE 0F 32 A8 80 84 54\n00 FE 0F 32 A8 80 84 18\n00 FE 0F 32 A8 80 84 DC\n00 FE 0F 32 A8 80 84 90\n00 FE 1F 32 A8 80 84 44\n00 FE 0F 32 A8 80 84 18\n00 FE 0F 32 A8 80 84 DC\n00 FE AF 31 A8 80 84 4C\n00 FE BF 31 A8 80 84 F0\n00 FE CF 31 A8 80 84 A4\n\n```\nI know the checksum is the last 4 bits in the last byte of the message. the other 4 bits in the last byte are a counter, that counts from 0 to 3 and then wraps back around.\n\nI know the whole message is little endian as well.\n\nI have run this in reveng (probably done it wrong) and it does not return any results.\n\nI was hoping someone smarter than me would be able to assist with identifying this.\n\n",
