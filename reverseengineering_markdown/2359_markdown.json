As far as I know, executable code is located in .text section, so why compiler would add the other one? \n\nIf you need more information for answer I'll try to provide as much as I can.\n\n",

      "content": "In general .code and .text sections are synonymous. Both of those section contain executable code. Whereas, .data section contains non-executable data. \n\n.bss segment is usually added due to optimization. The size of .bss is usually really small since it is designated to hold uninitialized data. In comparison, .data segment is designated to hold global/static variables and data structures.\n\nSecond code segment was most likely added manually. \n\nNow, it is impossible to answer why the binary has two sections of code just by looking at the names. I think it is obviously unusual. I can state one thing for sure, you have two sections for a reason. However, you gonna have to fig in to figure out what the reason is.\n\nFirst thing I would do is try to confirm segment permissions and CLASS. True code segment will have Read and Execute permissions. You can use lots of different tools to verify it. For instance, if you were to use IDA, it is done with Segments Subview, which could be accessed with Shift + F7. You might get lucky and spot the fake right from the get go. \n\n",
