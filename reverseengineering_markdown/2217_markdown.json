Compare results of dotPeek versus those of Hex-Rays. The VM is a lot less \"organically grown\" than the x86 architecture (read: much cleaner), and the managed binaries contain a lot more metadata.",

      "text": "As to .NET versus Java, I find that .NET IL is generally easier to decompile than Java bytecode.  For example, the way locals are managed in Java bytecode is more complicated (e.g., double-word types occupy two slots); the end offset of exception handler blocks must be computed manually, as it is not included in the metadata; ranges of local variables may need to be computed if code is compiled without debug information; since Java 5, finally blocks have been inlined.  I'm sure there are other minor inconveniences that I am overlooking, though .NET surely has several of its own.",

      "content": "Reverse engineering .net without any anti-reverse engineering protections is trivial.\n\nThe reason is that programs like these are compiled down to an intermediate language that we call bytecode which contains high level information (symbol names,data definitions etc) making it possible to recover source code almost similar to the original which simplifies the reverse engineering process.\n\nBecause of that obfuscation is very common, so take a look at these .NET Deobfuscation Tools posted at woodmann.\n\nI doubt malware authors want something like .net converted to native code.\n\nThe reason behind someone using .net malware is i guess because it can run on many platforms without caring about processor architecture so in .net malware they definitely want CIL to be there.\n\nAlso think about the different languages .net supports.\n\n",

Of course the processor architecture plays an important part however if you are not targeting too exotic devices, you can came up with an acceptable portability assuming only common instruction sets are used. Moreover I think it's actually possible to compile every references into native format, which should make a framework free app. This post has definitely exhausted my curiosity, I will have to try that!",

Still this article is pretty interesting, ntcore.com/files/netint_native.htm. It introduces a native loader for what I guess - not read everything yet - are a .NET 3.5 native images. Yet the author says it himself : this is just a mess. Shipping the framework along with the app and cheating ngen to target an older CPU. No comment, but still funny!",

      "content": "In general, bytecode is easier to reverse engineer than compiled code.  It (usually) contains a lot more metadata and uses an idealized computing model.  A good obfuscater can make this much harder, but still not nearly as complex as native code written with reverse engineering in mind.  This is because bytecode languages don't allow nearly as many 'tricks' as real-world processors because they are designed to be higher level, safer, and portable.\n\nTo address your specific issue, you can see how simple the CIL for .NET is at Wikipedia, and MS provides a disassembler in their .NET SDK.  Higher-level tools are just a google away.\n\n",
