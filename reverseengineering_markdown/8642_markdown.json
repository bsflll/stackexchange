  "content": "I've discovered recently PIN which allows to dynamically instrument the binary code while still making the program believe it is running unmodified.\n\nEven more recently, I've heared about Dyninst and DynamoRIO. Do you know some other tools like this? And more importantly, do you know the difference between those? What are their strenghs and their weaknesses for the topic of reverse engineering and binary code analysis?\n\nMore specifically, the properties I'm interested in are:\n\nBut of course, other usual properties are also very welcome, like low overhead and ease of use.\n\n",
