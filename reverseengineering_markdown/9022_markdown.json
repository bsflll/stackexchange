  "content": "I've been trying to (reverse) a Lua script to source code again. Only problem I've got is that all variables are named \"L**\", is there a way to decode that ?\n\nit looks like this if I decompile it with unluac (with chunk spy it isn't really readable)\n\n```\n    if L5_1415 then\n  if L5_1415 then\n    if L5_1415 == L6_1416 then\n      if L5_1415 > 0 then\n        if L5_1415 then\n        elseif L5_1415 >= L6_1416 then\n          if L5_1415 then\n            L8_1418 = A0_1410\n\n```\n",
