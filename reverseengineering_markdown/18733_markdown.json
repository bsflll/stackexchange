  "content": "I'm trying to set a conditional hardware breakpoint on Windows Kernel-Mode in Windbg by using the following syntax :\n\n```\nba w1 ffff802312345678 \"j(@rip==ffff802387654321 || @rip==ffff802387654330) 'gc';''\"\n\n```\nI used the above command in order to ignore every access to my target location (ffff802312345678) from ffff802387654321 or ffff802387654330, so everytime access from somewhere else is taken, then I would be notified.\n\nBut the problem is, it still breaks on ffff802387654321 or  ffff802387654330 among the other locations. \n\nI also read it's official documents about \"Conditional Breakpoints and Register Sign Extension\" and also test something like this:\n\n```\nba w1 ffff802312345678 \"j((@rip & 0xffffffffffffffff)=ffff802387654321 || (@rip & 0xffffffffffffffff)=ffff802387654330) 'gc';''\"\n\n```\nBut it still won't work.\n\nSo my question is:\n\n",
