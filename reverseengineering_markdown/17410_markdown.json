  "content": "I am running on 64-bit Windows 7 and am using radare2 to attempt both static and dynamic analysis of a binary executable. The issue is that I cannot seem to find the entry point of where the program proper begins. I am still very new to radare2 and reverse engineering in general, so all of the techniques I currently know of have failed to determine this. \n\nMy questions are:\n\nI have documented my attempts (in chronological order), below:\n\nI use radare2 to open the binary in debug mode (via -d), like so:\n\n```\n$ radare2 -d bin.exe\nSpawned new process with pid 6204, tid = 6408\nr_sys_pid_to_path: Cannot get module filename.= attach 6204 6408\nbin.baddr 0x00400000\nUsing 0x400000\nSpawned new process with pid 5764, tid = 1936\nr_sys_pid_to_path: Cannot get module filename.asm.bits 32\n\n```\nRadare2 enters at address 0x772201c4 and I then run aaa:\n\n```\n[0x772201c4]> aaa\n←[32m[x]←[0m Analyze all flags starting with sym. and entry0 (aa)\nTODO: esil-vm not initialized\n←[32m[x]←[0m Analyze len bytes of instructions for references (aar)\n←[32m[x]←[0m Analyze function calls (aac)\n←[32m[x]←[0m Use -AA or aaaa to perform additional experimental analysis.\n←[32m[x]←[0m Constructing a function name for fcn.* and sym.func.* functions (aan)\n= attach 6204 6408\n6204\n\n```\nAll of the checks appear to fail, so I attempt to display the address of the entry point, via iM, to no avail:\n\n```\n[0x772201c4]> iM\n\n[0x772201c4]>\n\n```\nThere is also no listing for sym.main with afll either:\n\n```\n[0x772201c4]> afll\naddress     size  nbbs edges    cc cost   min bound range max bound   calls locals args xref frame name\n=========== ==== ===== ===== ===== ==== =========== ===== =========== ===== ====== ==== ==== ===== ====\n0x772201c4   41     1     0     1    4 0x772201c4    13 0x772201d1     2    2      0    0    24 fcn.eip\n0x7723df5c   69     1     0     1   29 0x7723df5c    69 0x7723dfa1     0    5      0    1    28 fcn.7723df5c\n0x7723dfa1   20     1     0     1   14 0x7723dfa1    20 0x7723dfb5     0    1      0    1     0 fcn.7723dfa1\n0x7724989f   69     4     5     3   23 0x7724989f    18 0x772a034a     0    0      1    1     4 fcn.7724989f\n0x772498ba   28     1     0     1   22 0x772498ba    28 0x772498d6     2    1      2    1    24 loc.772498ba\n0x772498db   54     2     1     0   24 0x772498db    54 0x77249911     4    1      2    1    16 fcn.772498db\n0x77266fa6   66     4     5     3   48 0x77266fa6    66 0x77266fe8     5    1      1    1    48 fcn.77266fa6\n\n```\nVery confused, I try pdf, and get only three lines of assembly mnemonics:\n\n```\n[0x772201c4]> pdf\n            ;-- eip:\n/ (fcn) fcn.eip 41\n|   fcn.eip ();\n|           ; var int local_4h @ esp+0x4\n|           ; var int local_8h @ esp+0x8\n|           0x772201c4      89442404       mov dword [local_4h], eax\n|           0x772201c8      895c2408       mov dword [local_8h], ebx\n\\       ,=< 0x772201cc      e9e9960200     jmp loc.772498ba\n\n```\nEdit 1: Following Megabeet's advice, this is my output:\n\n```\n$ radare2 bin.exe\n[0x00404161]> ie\n[Entrypoints]\nvaddr=0x00404161 paddr=0x00004161 baddr=0x00400000 laddr=0x00000000 haddr=0x00000118 type=program\n\n1 entrypoints\n\n[0x00404161]> ood\nSpawned new process with pid 4776, tid = 4528\nr_sys_pid_to_path: Cannot get module filename.File dbg://bin.exe  reopened in read-write mode\n= attach 4776 4528\nSpawned new process with pid 5720, tid = 4780\nr_sys_pid_to_path: Cannot get module filename.Unable to find filedescriptor 3\nUnable to find filedescriptor 3\n4776\n[0x772201c4]>\n\n```\n",

With MSVC tools you can find the entry point with dumpbin /headers, although that's actually some code supplied by the C runtime that initialises state and then calls main, not main itself.",

Notice that Main() =! Entrypoint.\n\nThere might be several reasons why radare2 failed to detect main. With strip binaries it is harder for the RE framework to detect it since it lacks the symbols. You can start from the entrypoint and go with the flow of the program until' you reach main.\n\nWell, since radare2 failed to detect the main function, it wasn't able to rename the function to main. Probably, the main function was detected by radare2 as a regular function and it should be in the table you attached.\n\nOn a personal note, make sure to use the latest version of radare2 from git. The project is actively developed and improvements are added every day. Including better detections for symbol like main().\n\n",
