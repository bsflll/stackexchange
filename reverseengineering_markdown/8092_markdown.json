  "content": "Hopper offers a GDB/LLDB Debugger Server companion to the standard program. I'm unclear on what this should / can  be used for. When I run the debugger server on the same machine that I'm using I see this:\n\n\n\nThere aren't really any options or built-in help. When I open Hopper.app's debugger panel I only see the program running locally. I was initially thinking that the Remote Debugger was maybe used to offload some of the processing to another computer, but I've also tried running Hopper Debugger Server on another mac on my LAN but I don't see it come up in the list, only my local machine:\n\n\n\nAs there are no settings to specify remote connection information, I think I need to do something remotely that would specify a the address of the machine running Hopper so that it can sort of 'dial in' and then show up on the list.\n\nI haven't had any luck with the Hopper website, forum, FAQ.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nCan anyone give me a brief outline of how the GDB/LLDB remote debugger\nis intended to be used (with Hopper) ?\n\n",

      "content": "I'm surprised nobody posted an answer, but here's what I eventually came to realize:\n\nA lot of times disassembling is used for taking apart potential malicious apps like viruses, worms, or malware to understand how they affect a system. There is both static and dynamic disassembly. Static disassembly poses (little) threat to your system as it is only looking through the code - however dynamic disassembly is actually running the code ( with breakpoints, etc ) - which is something you probably don't want to do on your main computer if the code is potentially malicious.\n\nHere's what IDA says in a tutorial about disassembling a \"hostile\" executable:\n\nThis finally made sense as an explanation for why you may want to use a remote debugger - seems so obvious now!\n\nI'm still not exactly sure on how to setup and/or use Hopper's remote debugger but I'm sure I'll figure that out eventually.\n\n",
