  "content": "I'm planning to read a MX25U1635E chip using the CH341a reader.\n\nThe specs for that chip say it has a max voltage of 1.6-2.0 volts. The reader has an output of 3.3-5.0 volts.\n\nMost tutorials for the reader instruct you to just clamp it on the chip and start reading.\n\nCan I do that in my case, or do I have tweak the CH341a voltage down somehow before reading the chip? \n\n",
