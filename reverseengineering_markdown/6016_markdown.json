      "content": "You can open multiple disassembly MDI windows by going to View → Open subviews → Disassembly in IDA's menubar. For example, if you already have a disassembly window open and open a new disassembly subview, your original disassembly window tab will be named IDA View-A and your new disassembly window tab will be named IDA View-B. You can then rearrange the disassembly windows (drag and drop the window tabs) to create a split-view.\n\n",
