  "content": "I'm reversing some windows drivers, and IDA never converts numbers to their corresponding major function name like IRP_MJ_CREATE = 0x00, how can i force this? is there anyway i can convert a number to major function name?\n\nALSO : why doesn't IDA convert it itself? for the first parameter of IoBuildSynchronousFsdRequest is always a major function number, why can't ida just name its MAJOR function name instead of giving me its number?\n\n",

From there, type IRP_MJ_, and the chooser window should jump to the proper enumeration element.\n\nTo have Hex-Rays automatically display function arguments as symbolic constants, change the type of the argument to e.g. MACRO_IRP_MJ, or whatever the name of the enumeration is.\n\n",
