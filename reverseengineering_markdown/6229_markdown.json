Be sure you understand the function's side-effects, use of global variables, etc. since it may not be thread-safe to call it from your DLL.\n\n",

      "content": "Do you mean calling functions from host executable, in which you have injected your DLL?\n\nIf this is the case I don't suggest you using direct addresses because there is possibility that the image is loaded at different address than intended (especially if 'IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_DYNAMIC_BASE' flag is set). Better use 'GetModuleHandle' to get process image base and call your functions using RVA plus the value returned.\n\nThe above will be true if the target functions aren't in the EAT of the host image. If this is the case you can just declare their names and use those functions in your source if you have the proper host image libraries.\n\nThis is the best I can say because your question is a bit unclear.\n\nEDIT: The code you have written in OP, can be re-written as follows:\n\n```\nconst wchar_t* (__fastcall *get_string)(const char*, int, const char*, int) = (decltype(get_string))0x6f9ec0;\n\nint& g_cx = *(int*)0x8523e0;\n\n```\nIf your compiler supports C++11 or above because of the 'decltype' keyword.\n\n",
