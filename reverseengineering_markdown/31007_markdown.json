  "content": "I'm currently learning RE. I've chosen to do so by trying to RE Skyrim for PC. I'm trying to call the ingame function for printing to the console, I'm doing this via an Injected DLL.\n\nThe function call looks like this\n\n```\nmov eax,tesv.1095FB8\nmov edx,dword ptr ds:[1B10B58]\npush eax\npush tesv.1095FAC\npush edx\ncall <tesv.ConsoleLog>\nadd esp,C\n\n```\nWhen called the arguments look like this\n\n\n\nI believe the typedef for this function would be\n\n```\ntypedef void(__cdecl *f_ConsoleLog)(uintptr_t ptr1, const char* ptr2, ...);\n\n```\nHowever calling the function causes an access violation, I've even tried to call it using inline ASM exactly as the aforementioned assembly does.\n\nI'm quite stuck and don't know where to look next, could anyone point me in the correct direction?\n\n",
