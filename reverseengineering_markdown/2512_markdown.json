  "content": "What should I look for when building a malware lab on a budget?  $800 USD or less. I'm talking about hardware and virtualization capabilities, or alternatives (e.g. FOG Server).  Not user programs that load the actual malware for analysis (Olly, IDA, etc.).\n\nESXi seems popular with virtualization, but does that have any advantages over a malware lab with VirtualBox, aside from performance?\n\n",
