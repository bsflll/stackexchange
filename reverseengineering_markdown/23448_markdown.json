  "content": "I found this javascript file on one of those online movie streaming services and was interested in finding out what it does.  However, after trying many deobfuscators I am still stuck.  A major problem preventing me from making progress was that when I tried staying on the page too long, Chromium (Firefox had the same problem) would run out of memory and freeze.  Running it in node resulted in the same thing (\"FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory\").  This also prevented me from trying to add console.log statements because it would simply freeze.  I am not experienced enough to see what is actually causing these massive allocations to occur.  Any advice as to where I should look next?\n\nOriginal File URL: https://videospider.in/js/play2.min.js\n\nArchived: https://pastebin.com/ycw6MSLQ\n\n",

      "content": "Based on the \"deobfuscated\" output posted by @Supreme, the code appears to be encoding very basic information about the click event when the user clicks on a video's play button. Here it is tidied up, with some comments:\n\n```\nvar alreadyClicked = false;\n\n$(document).on(\"click\", \"#play\", function(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n\n    if (!alreadyClicked) {\n        $(\".loading\").text(\"Loading video... Please wait.\");\n\n        // Generate random numbers between 10-20\n        var idLength1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * (20 - 10 + 1)) + 10;\n        var idLength2 = Math.floor(Math.random() * (20 - 10 + 1)) + 10;\n\n        // Generate random numbers between 0-9\n        var randInt1  = Math.floor(Math.random() * (9 - 0 + 1)) + 0;\n        var randInt2  = Math.floor(Math.random() * (9 - 0 + 1)) + 0;\n\n        // Create \"ID\" with random IDs + the event name and mouse X/Y coordinates\n        var encodedId = randInt1 + \"\" + idLength1 + \"\" + generateId(idLength1) + \"\" + btoa(String(e.originalEvent) + \"*\" + e.pageX + \"*\" + e.pageY) + \"\" + generateId(idLength2) + \"\" + idLength2 + \"\" + randInt2;\n\n        // Prevent submitting the form again if #play is clicked\n        alreadyClicked = true;\n\n        $(\"#playID\").val(encodedId);\n        $(\"#playForm\").submit();\n    }\n})\n\nfunction generateId(length) {\n    var id = \"\";\n    var idCharacters = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789\";\n\n    for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n        id = id + idCharacters.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * idCharacters.length));\n    }\n\n    return id;\n}\n\n```\nThe encodedId variable would look something like:\n\n```\n\"618iNXtzD0htGiVKXSV9EW29iamVjdCBNb3VzZUV2ZW50XSo4ODYqNzY56i9zvoRJQ16pPj143\"\n\n```\nReversing this is fairly trivial as we can see how it's constructed in the above code.\n\nGuess: this is probably a basic method of checking for bots.\n\n",
