  "content": "I am trying to reverse engineer software to extend its functionality as expected of me. So I don't have the source code with me. Anyways, I am used to seeing codes that start like the one below, and is clear to me what is actually going on there. \n\n```\npush ebp\nmov ebp,esp\nsub esp,10h\n\n```\nBut my worries came when I saw one that looks like this below\n\n```\nmov edi,dword ptr [0E9A474h];\nimul eax,dword ptr [edi+5AF4h],70h;\ncmp dword ptr [ebp+eax-35DCh],0h;\nje some_location\n\n```\nAnd the prologue for the function doesn't have any instruction like this\n\n```\nsub esp,10h\n\n```\nAt least I could have known the size of the stack the function is using for local variable storage.\n\nAnd additional question is:\n\n",

Yes i suspect maybe another function is responsible for setting this value or maybe within the program itself. But what exactly is setting this value in the stack for this other function to test it. I am really confuse here. Any idea i will greatly appreciate",

      "content": "The function prologue (push ebp, etc.) is common in assembly, but not required. ebp is often used for local varible access, but can as well be used as a general purpose register, just like eax.\n\nAssembly allows the code to manipulate stack pointer at any place and doesn't force it to follow any convention - as long as there are no exceptions, CPU will not care; it will simply execute the instructions pointed by eip register. It will not stop you from accessing (even modifying) other function's memory as long as your program has enough privileges to do that. I think this answers your first two questions.\n\nRegarding your third question, in general, it is not possible. However, usually, you can look for the instructions modifying esp (like push, pop, etc.) and infer it from them. If you showed us the entire function, it would be easier to tell the size in this particular case.\n\nIn fact, the instructions you have shared with us don't seem to access local variables of this function or of any other either. I don't know what are the values stored in edi and ebp registers, but I guess they point to some dynamically allocated data on heap.\n\n",

Indeed you have help me. thanks",
