  "content": "Good day!\n\nSorry to come up with something very old. Since I am currently teaching myself hardware hacking, I wanted to use my old router for this. I soldered pins to the JTAG interface and connected them to my Pi2 GPIO. I connected them as follows:\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot dump the firmware because the device does not want to switch to halt. Only time-out for halt request appears.\n\nI have changed the freq, checked for cold solder joints. (I don't have any errors)\n\n```\ninit\nreset halt\nJTAG tap: bcm5352e.cpu tap/device found: 0x0535217f (mfg: 0x0bf, part:\n0x5352, ver: 0x0)\nHalt timed out, wake up GDB.\ntimed out while waiting for target halted\nTARGET: bcm5352e.cpu - Not halted\n\n```\nAny ideas?\n\n",
