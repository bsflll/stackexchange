  "content": "The files (idx, dat) are from a plant/facility operational historian. The .dat file is supposed to have entries, each with identifier (tag name/id/key), value (decimal/float) for different times (timestamp) along with their confidence rating (int/percentage).\nThe application is windows-based. Each .dat file would represent entries of few days.\n\nI've managed to identify timestamps at specific byte offsets. It also looks like the \"records\" are of 2049 byte chunks. The timestamp (and additional timestamps) repeat within each 2049 chunk (which is a bit strange), but perhaps it's also keeping a reference to the last recorded time, or maybe there's a nesting (parent/child) of records.\n\nI'm a stuck as to how I should proceed.\n\nSample dat file (truncated):\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8ACIyH1qALnLUY2cEdzVWp6T1U\n\nFull dat file:\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8ACIyH1qALnNU5wYkotMktVWVk\n\nOne of the first time values: 80CAFEBB168DD201 at offset 2061 decimal []  (131322467930000000 -> 2017-02-27 7:19:53 AM)\n\nSample idx file:\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8ACIyH1qALnQzVueEJuRWNfUk0\n\nAppreciate the help.\n\nUPDATE\n\nAs requested, some further information:\n\n",

Hopefully it saves other interested parties a little work.\n\npossible type of database that uses dat, idx files\n\nHow do I open .bin/.idx database files?\n\nWhat database uses these specific type of .dat and .idx files?\n\nAnd most interestingly: \n\nHow can I extract data from DAT and IDX files of SCADA CIMPLICITY software?\n\nSCAN00356-sample.dat and SCAN00356.idx were examined. The full .dat file, SCAN00356.dat, is 4.0GB in size and too large load into memory on the VM being used and so has not been examined.\n\nsample .dat file SCAN00356-sample.dat\n\nThe structure of SCAN00356-sample.dat is non-uniform:\n\n\nAdditional visualization allows us to further appreciate the heterogeneous distribution of data within the file:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a very brief header in which the the string \"SCAN\" appears, composed of 16-bit characters.\n\n```\n$ hexdump -C -n 100 SCAN00356-sample.dat\n00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00  |................|\n00000010  00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00  80 fa 6d 1c a5 8b d2 01  |..........m.....|\n00000020  00 f1 d7 49 75 8f d2 01  e8 07 00 00 53 00 43 00  |...Iu.......S.C.|\n00000030  41 00 4e 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |A.N.............|\n00000040  00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000050  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n*\n\n```\nsample .idx file SCAN00356.idx\n\nUnlike SCAN00356-sample.dat, the structure of SCAN00356.idx is fairly uniform:\n\n\nVisualization:\n\n\n\n\nSCAN00356.idx also has a very small header.

      "content": "The SCAN00356.idx file has easily identifiable structures.  The data region begins starting at offset 0x800 and continues to the end of the file.  Each 0x400 page contains 18-byte records.  When a page fills up (or data ends), it ends the current set of records with a 1-word index value after the last record. \n\nFYI - Just change the view width of your hex editor to 18 bytes.  The structures will pop right out at you.  Here is an excerpt from your file:\n\n```\nEF 73 05 50 01 00 FF 72 7F 46 88 72 2D 7E 00 00 00 05 \nC7 14 05 50 01 00 7F E4 1C 09 8C 72 2D 7E 00 00 00 05 \nA0 20 05 50 01 00 FF 55 BA CB 8F 72 2D 7E 00 00 00 05 \n67 18 05 50 01 00 7F C7 57 8E 93 72 2D 7E 00 00 00 05 \n44 D6 05 50 01 00 FF 38 F5 50 97 72 2D 7E 00 00 00 05 \n0F 84 05 50 01 00 7F AA 92 13 9B 72 2D 7E 00 00 00 04 \nCA A0 05 50 01 00 FF 1B 30 D6 9E 72 2D 7E 00 00 00 04 \nA9 49 05 50 01 00 7F 8D CD 98 A2 72 2D 7E 00 00 00 04 \n76 89 05 50 01 00 FF FE 6A 5B A6 72 2D 7E 00 00 00 04 \n4D 6F 05 50 01 00 7F 70 08 1E AA 72 2D 7E 00 00 00 04 \n2C BF 05 50 01 00 FF E1 A5 E0 AD 72 2D 7E 00 00 00 03 \nFD 5B 05 50 01 00 7F 53 43 A3 B1 72 2D 7E 00 00 00 03\n\n```\nSome of the columns never seem to change, such as the byte string 0x72 7D 7E 00 00 00.  \n\nOthers appear as flags, such as the column that alternates between 0xFF and 0x7F.\n\nThere seem to be a few different types of records stored, although they all conform to this format.  Some will use more of the data bytes than others.\n\nThis has the feel of some type of logging record, though I don't know what the values of the data fields mean.  I hope this helps.\n\n",
