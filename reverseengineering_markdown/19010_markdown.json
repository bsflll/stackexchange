Linux kernel employs a few tricks to appear like a valid PE file so that it can be booted by a UEFI-compliant firmware.\n\nThere is no \"elf bibnary\" to extract because the kernel has been linked into the PE file format and does not contain any ELF headers anymore. IF you want to disassemble it, just disassemble it as raw AArch64 binary (e.g. pass -bbinary -maarch64 flags to an ARM objdump) - the second instruction will jump to the real entrypoint:\n\n```\n0000 4D 5A 00 91    ADD             X13, X18, #0x16\n0004 57 00 00 14    B               stext\n\n```\n(see arch/arm64/kernel/head.S in kernel sources for more details).\n\n",
