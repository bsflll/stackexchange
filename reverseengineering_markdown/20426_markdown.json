      "content": "This chart describes the different Sections and Memory Segments in your binary.\n\nEach row in the chart is a different section where its name is in the rightest column. From the left, you can see its start address, from the right you can see its end-address and next to it you can see the sections' size (decimal). That means, Start-Address + Size = End-Address.\n\nThe ASCII bar itself is an imaginary range of addresses and the hash sign # will mark where on this range the section appears. In your example, the chart begins at 0x08000000 which is the lowest address and ends at 0x08000348 which is the highest. The .symtab is the biggest section in your example since it in size of 144. This is why it has the biggest amount of # characters.\n\n",
