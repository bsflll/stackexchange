If code is PIC, you usually see some typical patterns like call $+, pop to get the current address, or call xxx, pop to push some address on the stack.",

      "content": "It will highly depend on the compiler used, but here are some constructions that will differ between position independent and position dependent code:\n\nYou may also take advantage of the fact, that when you load position independent program and check address of some function, main for example, it will change each time you load it (because of ASLR). The same won't be true for PDC - all addresses will remain the same.\n\nWhy making your job hard analysing the executable, while it provides explicitly the information you need. As you noted in the comment, ET_EXEC value of e_type will be present in PDC, while ET_DYN will appear in PIC. And, according to the second answer to this question, this is the information used to determine whether ASLR may be used, in Linux.\n\nYou may of course use other tools for this purpose, like file or readelf for instance.\n\n",
