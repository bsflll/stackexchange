      "content": "Unpacking a generic wrapping packer or cryptor usually involves the following steps:\n\nThis is not difficult with simple packers but might be tricky with the more advanced ones. They may employ timing checks (rdtsc), exception-based control transfer, using debug registers for calculations etc. Using a VM or an emulator here usually helps against most of them.\n\nThere are many ways to do this. Sometimes the jump to OEP is obvious when it follows a chunk of looping code and there's nothing reasonable-looking after it. Or you may recognize the code at OEP if you're familiar with the entrypoints produced by different compilers. A couple other tricks:\n\nIf you're using IDA, you don't actually need to dump the file into a separate file - it's enough to take a memory snapshot that would copy the bytes from memory to the database so you can analyze them later. One thing to keep in mind here is that if the packer used dynamically allocated memory, you need to mark it as \"loader\" so it gets included in the snapshot. More here.\n\nI'm not very familiar how it's done in Olly or other debugger, but AFAIK you need to use a tool like ImpREC on your dump and a copy of the process in memory.\n\nIt's somewhat simpler (IMO) in IDA. You just need to find the import table and rename the pointers according to the functions they are currently pointing to (this should be done while debugger is active). You can use either renimp.idc script or UUNP \"manual reconstruct feature\" (see here).\n\nFor finding import table there are two tricks I sometimes use:\n\nThis is optional but it may be useful to remove the remains of the packer code that would only distract you. In IDA, you should also apply a compiler FLIRT signature if you recognize the compiler used.\n\nI don't do this step as I rarely need to run the unpacked file but in general you usually need to fix up the PE header so that offsets to the section's code in file match those in the dump.\n\nNow, there are many variations and tricks not covered by the above steps. For example, some packers don't fully resolve imports initially but put jumps to stubs that resolve import on first call and then patch it so it goes directly to the target next time. Then there is \"stolen code\" approach which makes it harder to find and recover OEP. Sometimes the packer runs a copy of itself and debugs it, so that you can't attach your own debugger to it (this can be solved by using emulator or a debugger that doesn't use debugging APIs like Intel PIN). Still, the outlined steps can cover quite a lot of what's out there.\n\nI will conclude with the video that Elias made showing the process of unpacking the Lighty Compressor: https://www.hex-rays.com/video/bochs_video_2.html\n\n",

Virtualization obfusactors compile the original binary into a custom instruction set when is executed by an simulator at runtime. If you encounter a binary obfuscated in this way you have no choice but to write a disassembler from the custom instruction set to an instruction set that you understand.\n\n",
