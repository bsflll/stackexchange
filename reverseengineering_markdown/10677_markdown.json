      "content": "Interesting idea.  There could be a service to do this, but then the need is probably to small that no one could run a business of it.\nYou could try posting a request for one of the many freelancing sites.\n\nBut like the \"feed a man a fish\" proverb, you are better off learning how to do this stuff your self then, then you can do it your self.\n\nA lot of the better packers these days leave less of a signature and thus are harder to detect with old/outdated packer detectors.\n\nGo to the forums on:\n\nhttps://tuts4you.com/\n\nIt's pretty much THE site to go to for unpacking info, and if you do your\nhomework (read up and study first) people will probably help you there. \n\n",

Later I plan to learn more about unpacking. I am new here and I don´t know if it is allowed to ask but if anyone can help me with this I am willing to pay.",
