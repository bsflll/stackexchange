  "content": "I'm analyzing the 3 binaries for updating firmware to the Inmarsat Isatphone Pro phone. Additionally, I'm following the Groundworks Technologies paper, and attempting to recreate their work as a learning exercise.\n\nIt was explained that in both File1.bin and File2.bin there was both ARM926EJ-S code and Blackfin DSP code combined. I'm interested in looking at the ARM code, but am not clear on how to separate one from another. Using binja and Ghidra at the moment...\n\nHow can the ARM code get isolated, and what's the best way to decompile down to seeing functions like RegisterATCmdHook() and RegisterPendingATCmdHook()?\n\nPaper is available here: https://uploadfiles.io/2l0f9ulc\n\n",

So basically, the Blackfin firmware is 0x08000000 -> 0x05040000, with the ARM firmware being 0x04C00000 -> 0x04000000. This matches what the Groundworks paper had. The question then is - how did they figure out this memory map? Are there ASCII strings that indicate this?",
