I've searched the Idapython documentation and previously similar questions and could not find an answer\n\n",

I'm not sure exactly where you're _supposed_ to set it if using IDAPython, but it's part of idainfo. So, you can prolly use the idaapi.inf_* functions, ctypes with the IDA library to call setinf directly, or I think even the \"Root Node\" netnode iirc.",

      "content": "As hinted by Ali, this info is stored in the global inf structure. It used to be an actual global variable accessible via the idaapi.cvar wrapper, but now you need to use the various getters/setters in the ida_ida module.\n\nWhile you can indeed go down that road and use inf_get_cc/inf_set_cc or inf_set_cc_cm, in case you only need to change the pointers to 64-bit, normally it should be enough to call inf_set_64bit(True).\n\n",
