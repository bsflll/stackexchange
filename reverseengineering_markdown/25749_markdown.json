  "content": "I'm reverse engineering a C++ binary using IDA, and there's one function that I don't quite understand.\n\n```\nx = dword ptr -8\nvar_4 = dword ptr -4\n\npush    rbp\nmovss   rbp, rsp\nsub     rsp, 10h\nmovss   [rbp+var_4], xmm0\nmov     eax, [rbp+var_4]\nmov     [rbp+x], eax\nmovss   xmm0, [rbp+x]\ncall    _sinf\nleave\nretn \n\n```\nThe eax register is overwritten right away, and I can't imagine that eax was loaded to pass as an argument to \"sinf\". What's the use of this? Or is it just a weird compiler optimization?\n\n",

      "content": "It looks like that the binary has been compiled without optimization. With optimization enabled the redundant instructions would have been removed. A similar example is shown below.\n\nCompiler:  GCC 7.5 for x86-64 on Compiler Explorer\n\n```\n#include <math.h>\n\nfloat calculate(float v)\n{\n    return sinf(v);\n}\n\n```\n```\ncalculate(float):\n        push    rbp\n        mov     rbp, rsp\n        sub     rsp, 16\n        movss   DWORD PTR [rbp-4], xmm0\n        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]\n        mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-8], eax\n        movss   xmm0, DWORD PTR [rbp-8]\n        call    sinf\n        leave\n        ret\n\n```\n```\ncalculate(float):\n        sub     rsp, 8\n        call    sinf\n        add     rsp, 8\n        ret\n\n```\n```\ncalculate(float):\n        jmp     sinf\n\n```\nAs you can see above, the redundant moves are generated only when optimizations aren't enabled. With higher levels, it progressively leads to smaller code.\n\n",

Usually, on 64 bit, the first parameter to a function is passed through rdi, and the return value is stored in rax. Is it just different for floating point functions? I can't find a whole lot of documentation on the matter.",
