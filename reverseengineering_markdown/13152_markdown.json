  "content": "I know that there are some obfuscation techniques which can lead to slowing or even failing the detection of malware when static analysis is used. \n\nHowever, is there a similar technique that changes the order of the malware behaviour, which belongs to the same family or variants?\n\nAn example with Malware 1 and Malware 2 from the same malware family X: \n\nIf it does exist is their a known name for this kind of obfuscation?\nAre there any papers, which refer to such a obfuscation technique?\n\n",

It relied on a plug-in framework, and the order in which the plug-ins were acquired changed the behavior of the resulting variant.  We didn't require a name for that.There were viruses going back to DOS days, such as BadBoy, which changed the order of their subroutines so affect the appearance of the layout, but the call flow remained the same.  We call those \"block-swapping\" viruses.",
