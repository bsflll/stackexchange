  "content": "In the IDA View, I frequently use the Escape key to move the cursor back to the previous location.  However, sometimes I accidentally hit the Escape key while the focus is still on another view, which causes that view to close.  Reopening and positioning the affected view every time this happens can be cumbersome.  Is there a way to disable the Escape key only for particular views?\n\n",
