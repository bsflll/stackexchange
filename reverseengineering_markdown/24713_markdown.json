      "content": "While you can potentially prove that two pieces of binary code are equivalent (i.e. they produce the same results given the same input), this does not by itself mean that the source code was the same. For example, the following two snippets will likely be compiled to the same binary even though the source is different:\n\n```\n int f(int x)\n {\n  return x+1;\n }\n\n int g(int y)\n {\n  return ++y;\n }\n\n```\n(check on https://godbolt.org/)\n\nThat said, if you do want to prove that (for example) two functions are equivalent, you can try many different approaches, e.g.:\n\nA more generic problem of detecting authorship of arbitrary code is called \"code provenance\" and there are several papers on the topic, e.g.:\n\n",
