  "content": "I am trying to extract data from a proprietary file type: .take.  I am unfamiliar with file compression and encoding, but it appears as if this file type is acting as some sort of wrapper for other files.  Refer to the following Google Drive \"preview\".  I guess the file has some sort of MIME metadata so Drive can figure out it's contents, but I can't open it with any unzip programs!\n\n\n\nFrom the looks of this, this file contains some very common file formats (XML, videos, pictures,  protobuf).  I need to extract these files, but cannot download them directly!  The only application I can open the file in is a text editor, and when I do the data is neatly organized in 32-bit chunks.  Possible FourCC identification?\n\n\n\nI can obviously write a script to read this data in but I am unsure of even the encoding!  What suggestions or techniques might I employ to extract the files? . Can I leverage the fact that I know the details of the compressed files?\n\nDownload the file here: http://www.filehosting.org/file/details/666710/QkDRIV0yPMo9llWF/file.take\n\n",
