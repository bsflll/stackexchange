  "content": "After failing to find a solution to this I have started using Gdb  and have encountered another error.\n\nGdbfails to set hardware watchpoint when I'm remote debugging a rooted arm7-a target. It supports hardware watchpoints and breakpoints according to the Technical references manual.\n\nIf i set a hardware watchpoint on gdb then it says failed to set hardware watchpoint. But if i change the parameter using:\n\n```\nset can-use-hw-watchpoints 0\n\n```\nI can set the software watchpoint successfully but it is very slow and laggy. I really dont understand why its failing. Could it be because the watchpoint is not correctly aligned?\n\nThe processor is an arm cortex-a7 and i can link the technical references manual if needed. Help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",
