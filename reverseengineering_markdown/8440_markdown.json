  "content": "I've got a procedure in IDA Pro with a few local stack variables, but part of them belong to an array. I would like to define the array, but pressing * (Create Array) fails, and pressing Y (Set Type) just brings up the type for the procedure, not the variable.\n\nThe same happens if I hover over an instance of its usage rather than its definition in the function prologue.\n\nOddly enough I seem to be able to rename them just fine.\n\nHow do I define a range of local variables to be an array; or, why is it not working for me?\n\n",
