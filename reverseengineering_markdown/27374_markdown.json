I want to understand what resource is the one failing.\n\n",

There is something here related to strace equivalentes on windows (stackoverflow.com/questions/864839/â€¦). Sysinternals is probably the place to start.  2) If you have source, you could search for HV_EVENTLOG_BAL_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES in a source file.",

Not an easy route, but you could emulate the system in Qemu (qemu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/gdb.html), halt it early in the boot with the monitor, attach GDB and do some forensics.  More complex would be using Panda (github.com/panda-re/panda).",
