  "content": "I have a SQLite database that contains a dictionary (just words and definitions) that can be opened with free but proprietary software. To use with the software, it requires an 'unlock' key, which I have. I'm able to see it in this program, but I'd like to manipulate the data and re-arrange it.\nCurrently, I'm paying freelancers on Fiverr to copy/paste every entry to a text document. Old-School Scraping.\n\nI can open these documents in a SQL viewer like DBBrowser for SQLite. The entry listings are in plaintext, but the definitions are in BLOBs. I've tried hex(), which didn't work. I thought there was somewhere I could paste my key in to decrypt this, but I can't find that. What should I do here?\n\nThis is my first venture into reverse engineering, so I appreciate your help and patience.\n\n",

      "content": "There exists an official encryption addon for SQLite but from your description it sounds more like the data is simply stored encrypted in the blobs and the application decrypts it internally before displaying its content, however:\n\nTo solve your problem you need to find the answers to these questions (and possibly others I did not think of).  You can try doing it by guessing and trying different algorithms but I doubt youâ€™ll get lucky with just that.\n\nIf I had to do it, I would probably proceed like this:\n\nP.S. for a more low-tech solution you could try some UI automation solutions (e.g. possibly AutoIt) but this is out of scope on this site.\n\n",
