  "content": "I would like to use ildasm on Linux. The original one, that comes with the .NET SDK and can be found on Windows e.g. at c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v8.0A\\bin\\NETFX 4.0 Tools\\.\n\nI found dotnet-ildasm and managed to install it on my Ubuntu 18.04. But I am unsure if this is the same as the \"original\" one.\n\n",

      "content": "The original one was a native executable and this one is build in .NET by utilizing a Mono.Cecil library to get the assembly information so if I would have to answer your first question I would answer - no, they are not the same.\n\nNot sure about your second question as original one was Windows executable so there's no point installing it on Linux. I would use the one you linked dotnet-ildasm or ikdasm from the Mono project.\n\nWhy are you so focused on having the \"original\" one?\n\n",
