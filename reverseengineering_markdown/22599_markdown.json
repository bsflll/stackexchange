  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/22599/x64dbg-break-when-a-register-contains-a-value",
  "content": "Is there a way to break code execution when a register contains a particular value with x64dbg? I'm not talking about setting a conditional breakpoint at a specific location, but about watching the registers permanently and breaking as soon as the value is found. Ideally, I'd like to check the registers for string references, if possible.\n\nIf such functionality doesn't exist, I'd be willing to try and implement it myself, if you could point me in the right direction, maybe.\n\n",
