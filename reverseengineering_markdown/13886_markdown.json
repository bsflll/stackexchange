  "content": "I have some dead pixels in top couple of rows of my cheap Win 10 tablet. To alleviate that, I wanted to use the custom resolution option in Intel graphics management panel, however, I cannot choose advanced options in the custom resolutions options and it is driving me crazy.\n\nI remembered Intel GFX drivers used some *.inf to enable some options and I believe it is in igdlh64.inf. \n\nHas any of you  tried to modify this or have some knowledge on this (and no there is not a documentation provided anywhere)?\n\n",
