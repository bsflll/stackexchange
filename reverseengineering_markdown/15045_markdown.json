  "content": "I am trying to add a 1000 byte code cave using LordPE to a standalone exe. From what I understand I have to edit the PE header with a new section of 1000 bytes then open the exe in a hex editor and add 1000 bytes to the end of the file.\n\nWhen I add the new section the offset is not at the end of the file and It actually points to existing code. If I change the RawOffset to match the actual end of file 0xAE370 it gets corrupted. \n\nWhy won't the new section get added at the real end of file? Also, how can I add a new 1000 byte section without corrupting the file?\n\nUpdate:  The debugger still wasn't perfect on the location of the new section in the memory map but I can see my new bytes ~200h down from where they are listed. To get it to work I had to:\n\nStill not sure why the memory map is slightly off but it's not too bad. I suppose once you find them you could edit the virtual address of the section to reflect where it actually is once loaded into memory.\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "Please note that there is hardly any point in creating a cave like this. It would be much easier to inject code the 'traditional way' (allocate memory in a running process). In the context of process injection, code caving is a sophisticated technique searching for usable gargabe / alignment / zero bytes. Often, you need to support using to smaller caves instead of a larger one. Or do you want to infect an executable to run your code on startup?",

I tried fiddling with the raw offset and even adding a couple large sections to ensure that I am getting past the previous section but no luck the file gets corrupted or I end up outside of RWE areas somehow. If it helps I am using the 32 bit portable Putty.exe for this example.",

      "content": "Adding sections to PE files is not always as simple as editing the sections table. Sometimes you'll have to handle several edge cases such as menifest, signatures and other potential end-of-file optional \"extensions\".\n\nAlthough LordPE is a great tool, it isn't the best tool for this task. It is too low-level, and doesn't let you create a complete new section transparently. It will let you edit the different fields as required for adding the new section, but you'll have to handle everything yourself.\n\nThere are more advanced PE editors, such as CFF Explorer, that provide the functionality to create sections from scratch. It will increase the file size of you and create a section you can directly edit from within CFF Explorer.\n\nTo add a new section, open a file with CFF Explorer, select the Section Headers option from the lefthand tree view, right click on the sections table, select the \"Add Section (Empty Space)\" option like in the following picture:\n\n\n\nThen, specify the size of the new section.\n\nTo edit the new section select it, and use the bottom panel to modify, paste, copy or fill the hex view of the section. You can right click on it to open a menu with additional editing options.\n\n",
