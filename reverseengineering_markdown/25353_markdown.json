  "content": "I want to write a script which imports an exe file, analyzes it, extracts some features and saves it using python.\n\nThe part which I am not able to understand is, how to import a file from the script itself. I do not want to use the askFile function and i do not want to use the headleassAnalyzer.\n\nAre there any functions which let me do this from the script itself?\n\n",

Is the file you want to import already referenced or available when the script is run? How should the script know which file should be imported?",
