Some researchers from UCLA claims to have achieved a breakthrough in software obfuscation through 'mathematical jigsaw puzzles'. \n\nTheir scientific paper can be found on IACR eprint website.\n\nCan someone sum-up what is really the content of the paper (and does is really worth it) ?\n\n",

      "content": "There are three main contributions of the research\n\nSo, lets look at these in turn.\n\nIndistinguishability obfuscation (contributions 1 and 2)\nFrom the paper\n\nThus, the main contributions when it comes to Indistinguishability obfuscation of this paper is to show a construction for IO that works on all circuits, then pair that with a few other things to get functional encryption for any circuits.\n\nNote that the usefulness of IOs will only become greater as time goes one. As seen in another paper by some of the same authors and hopefully they will become more practical as new constructions are proposed.\n\nFunctional Encryption (contribution 3)\nPrior to this work FE has only been possible on small circuits. Using 1 and 2, with some other crypto primitives, the authors were able to build FE on all circuits. That is a very significant result.\n\nWhat does this mean for Anti-RE\nIt would appear that by itself, indistinguishability obfuscation means very little for anti-reverse engineering. FE on any circuit, however, could be significant. Here is the reason. FE allows for results of a computation to be in plaintext. Compare this with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) where results will be encrypted or with Multiparty Comptuation were we require multiple parties (but can have plaintext results). Thus, I could give you a key which would allow you to, say, AES decrypt any data I send to you. You would never know the AES key though. There are techniques that also allow you to hide the function (not just the inputs).\n\nImagine if you had the ability to allow someone to compute only a specific function(s) on private data that I send you and still get plaintext results. Furthermore, the function is hidden, so they can't reverse engineer the function. That is the contribution of FE, and FE on any circuit is what this work enables.\n\nPracticality\nFrom what I see in the paper, contribution 1 could be practical for real world use, though I am not completely sure. Multilinear maps are pretty inefficient at the moment, but the construction used here is somewhat simplified. Since 2 uses FHE, it isn't practical yet. Since 3 uses 2 and some other heavy-weight crypto, it is also, not practical at the time.\n\n",

      "content": "I still wonder should I add a comment on this because my knowledge on the cryptography is extremely limited. The paper on the jigsaw obfuscation uses a term named functional encryption, that means with the private key in hand the obfuscator can design some functions working on the encrypted data. And someone without the private key can use these functions on the encrypted data, but still know nothing about the data. \n\nFor example, the obfuscator designs a function plus1 satisfying: \n\nthe attacker will know that if he uses plus1, he can increase x by 1, but he does not know anything about the value of x. \n\nNow with the jigsaw obfuscation, given a program P with some input a, the obfuscator will encrypt the obfuscated program p as p = encrypt(P), then design a function F with input is some pair (p, a) satisfying: \n\n(note that F satisfies the equivalence above but the design of F is not trivial like that), and that means the attacker can always use F and p to get the output P(a), but he does not know anything about P.\n\n",
