  "content": "I'm trying to hit a breakpoint that I set in LLDB (CLI), but for whatever reason I'm not hitting my breakpoint.  I am messing around with the stock Calculator.app on OS X, and am trying to call / hit my breakpoint when I open the About dialog box of the Calculator.app.\n\nI launch the Calculator.app, then I start lldb from a Terminal window.  I find the process of the Calculator.app using ps and grep.  I attach to the running process using LLDB.  I then issue the continue command in LLDB to allow the Calculator.app to continue running.\n\nThen I set a breakpoint in LLDB when the following method is called, showAbout\n\nI type the following command into LLDB,\n(lldb) breakpoint set --method showAbout\n\nHowever when I click About Calculator from the menu bar it doesn't halt the program, but rather shows the About dialog box for the Calculator.\n\n",

      "content": "The Calculator app is stripped as can be seen by running nm.\nYou will need to find the address of the method using class-dump:\n\n```\n$ class-dump -A /Applications/Calculator.app | grep showAbout\n- (void)showAbout:(id)arg1; // IMP=0x0000000100009939\n\n```\nHowever as the Calculator application is already running, the address has been slided because of ASLR.\nTo find the ASLR slide you can use my tool called get_aslr, like so:\n\n```\n$ sudo get_aslr $(pgrep Calculator)\nASLR slide: 0x9508000\n\n```\nYou then add the two numbers together:\n\n```\n0x0000000100009939 + 0x9508000 = 0x109511939\n\n```\nThat is the current address of the showAbout: method.\nNow you just need to set the breakpoint in lldb:\n\n```\nb *0x109511939\n\n```\nAnd it works!\n\n",
