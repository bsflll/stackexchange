  "content": "I want to enable telnet in my router (ZTE F670L V9.0.11P1N20D), So, I backup my router and i have a file config.bin, Size 23.5KB. I fired up kali and when i issue this command:\n\n```\n$ file config.bin\nconfig.bin: OpenPGP Public Key\n\n```\nI got this above output, I tried to extract this via binwalk, but no success.\n\nEven though, Telnet is enabled on my router by default but the port is filtered:\n\n```\nPORT    STATE    SERVICE\n21/tcp  open     ftp\n23/tcp  filtered telnet\n53/tcp  open     domain\n80/tcp  open     http\n139/tcp open     netbios-ssn\n443/tcp open     https\n\n```\nI tried resetting the router but still Port is filtered.\nSo, I hope there's a solution to extract that config.bin.\n\n",
