Here are some of the SDB files I have under ./libr/bin/d/dll/, what do these do?\n\n```\n./libr/bin/d/dll/csmfpapi.sdb\n./libr/bin/d/dll/atl.sdb\n./libr/bin/d/dll/msvbvm60.sdb\n./libr/bin/d/dll/msi.sdb\n./libr/bin/d/dll/mfc90u.sdb\n./libr/bin/d/dll/msvbvm50.sdb\n./libr/bin/d/dll/dsound.sdb\n./libr/bin/d/dll/mfc71.sdb\n./libr/bin/d/dll/olepro32.sdb\n\n```\n",

      "content": "SDB stands for String Database. \n\nYou can see the SDB commands listed with the k command,\n\n```\n|Usage: k[s] [key[=value]]Sdb Query\n| k foo=bar                 set value\n| k foo                     show value\n| k                         list keys\n| ko [file.sdb] [ns]        open file into namespace\n| kd [file.sdb] [ns]        dump namespace to disk\n| ks [ns]                   enter the sdb query shell\n| k anal/meta/*             ist kv from anal > meta namespaces\n| k anal/**                 list namespaces under anal\n| k anal/meta/meta.0x80404  get value for meta.0x80404 key\n\n```\nThere's a whole post about it in radare2 blog, check it out here.\nYou can read more about it in this link from radare2's repository.\nThere's also a short, and not so detailed, chapter about it in r2book.\n\nEdit: You added another question so I'll expand my answer accordingly.\nThese sdbfiles contain function names (DLL's exports) and their equivalent ordinals for each dll in ./libr/bin/d/dll/. Each file contains a key-value line in this format:\n\n```\nordinal_num=export_name\nanother_ordinal_num=another_export_name\n\n```\nSo, if we'll take msi.dll from the list you've mentioned, its sdb file will look like this:\n\n```\n...\n232=Migrate10CachedPackagesW\n1=MsiAdvertiseProductA\n223=MsiAdvertiseProductExA\n224=MsiAdvertiseProductExW\n2=MsiAdvertiseProductW\n...\n\n```\nThese files are then compiled by MakeFile. To add sdb files for DLL you can follow \"sdb_ordinal.md\" article from radare2 docs.\n\n",
