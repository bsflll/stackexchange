  "content": "There is not enough info on the web from what I have seen.\n\nMost write ups/guides/blog-posts are like this:\n\nSo, I was never able to find a guide that I can replicate on just the same model but with a different key or signature not a single full guide.\n\nNow let's say you have a firmware file & the config file. Knowing that you can extract the firmware files using 7-zip/binwalk or whatever, how to proceed from there to figure out the encryption of the config file?\n\nNote that the answer doesn't have to go into much detail; just a quick walk through the steps in general is fine.\n\n",
