  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/6266/windbg-debugging-without-symbols",
  "content": "So I am trying to learn how to debug files that I don't have the symbol files for.  The most common advice is to issue bp $exentry or bu @$exentry.  However, neither of these work.  Once I g the executable it breaks on ntdll32!LdrpDoDebuggerBreak+0x2c.  Nothing in the call stack gives any useful information.  If I issue g again, the executable runs to termination.\n\nAny advice on how to get to main() without manually stepping through all the startup code?\n\n",
