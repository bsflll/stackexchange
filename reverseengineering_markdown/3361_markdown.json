  "content": "I wanted to debug a game using OllyDBG. When I'm in the game main menu, I can debug and set breakpoint without problem and when I open the game process using Cheat Engine, I can view the memory.\n\n\n\nBut when I start to play the game and enter the game map, the game crash when the breakpoint triggered. And also, when I try to reattach the Cheat Engine, the memory cannot be read.\n\n\n\nAnd when I go back to the main menu again, the protection is being turn off... I can view the memory, and debug again.\n\nAny idea which on which function should add bp in order to trace this memory protection? I already add bp on the IsDebuggerPresent, but it doesn't trigger, so I'm pretty sure it's not the one..\n\n",

You might want to try breaking once you hit start, and then doing some static analysis to figure out what's going on from that point. Best of luck!\n\n",
