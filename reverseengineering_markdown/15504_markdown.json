  "content": "** Edit ** After some great help from @tylernygaard I have discovered that the same variable is being written to two difference places in the memory. They are both 'static' addresses. Problem solved. Original question below....\n\nI posted a question earlier regarding \"reading\" a variable from an executable here (Please excuse my naivety in this area)\n\nI simply wanted to \"read\" a Total variable from an executable whilst it was running.\n\nI was recommended a program called Cheat Engine which I have downloaded, completed the tutorial and then used.\n\nOn one PC, Cheat Engine showed the variable at address \"0096E0B4\".\n\nOut of curiosity I installed Cheat Engine on another PC and the variable was at address \"0096E0A4\"\n\nThese addresses are so close that I'm assuming this isn't just dynamically chosen at runtime (is it?). So I wondered if anyone knew why they would be different?\n\nAnd whether it would still be possible to write some code to read the correct value?\n\n",

I would suggest browsing that memory region and also seeing if the disassembly that writes/reads that value are the same to verify.  Also, if the address is found using a base pointer with module + offset, that module could possibly vary ever so slightly from your PC to the other's? Different OS, executable version, etc.",

If they aren't actually consecutive, then it could be conditional (maybe it jumps to one or the other depending on). That should be easy to tell though! :)",
