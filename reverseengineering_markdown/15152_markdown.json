      "content": "EBP stands for extended base pointer keeping track of the current stackframe.\n\nSince the current ESP (extended stack pointer) changes frequently in functions as stuff gets pushed to and poped of the stack, the base pointer remebers the value of ESP at the beginning of the function (convention).\n\nFor this reason, EBP is often used to referr to arguments or local variables (depending on if you add or substract from it). Remember the stack grows downwards - so positive offsets may referr to arguments passed to the function. Wikipedia offers a great illustration of this layout below:\n\n\n\n",
