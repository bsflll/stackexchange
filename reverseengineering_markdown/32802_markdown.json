I tried:\n\n```\nbp xxxxxxxx \"j (@ebp+0C==115) ''; 'gc' \"\n\nbp xxxxxxxx \"j (ebp+0C==115) ''; 'gc' \"\n\nbp xxxxxxxx \"j (poi(ebp+0C)==115) ''; 'gc' \"\n\nbp xxxxxxxx \"j (poi(@ebp+0C)==115) ''; 'gc' \"\n\nbp xxxxxxxx \"j (poi(@ebp+0xC)==115) ''; 'gc' \"\n\nbp xxxxxxxx \"j (@ebp+0xC==115) ''; 'gc' \"\n\nbp xxxxxxxx \"j (@ebp+0x0C==115) ''; 'gc' \"\n\nbp xxxxxxxx \"j (poi(@ebp+0x0C)==115) ''; 'gc' \"\n\nbp xxxxxxxx \"j (ebp+0x0C==115) ''; 'gc' \"\n\nbp xxxxxxxx \"j (poi(ebp+0x0C)==115) ''; 'gc' \"\n\nbp xxxxxxxx \"j (poi(ebp+c)==115) ''; 'gc' \"\n\nbp xxxxxxxx \"j (ebp+c==115) ''; 'gc' \"\n\nbp xxxxxxxx \"j (ebp+0x0c==115) ''; 'gc' \"\n\nbp xxxxxxxx \"j poi(ebp+0x0c)==115 ''; 'gc' \"\n\n```\nThe 115 value is in hex.\n\nAnother thing I need is to have two conditions. Like:\n\n```\nbp xxxxxxxx \"j ((poi(ebp+0x0c)==115)&&(poi(ebp+12)==7)) ''; 'gc' \"\n\n```\nNothing works!\nThanks in adv\n\n",

      "text": "Are you intending 115 in to be in hex, or decimal? By default the MASM number base is 16, which you can change with n. I know you suggest \"115\" to be in hex, but in your last expr, you dereference an unaligned pointer at 0x12 past %ebp.  Btw, you can specify decimal numbers with the \"0n\" prefix (as opposed to \"0x\" for hex). It's a good habit to use a prefix whenever you specify _all_ of your numbers. This way you can prevent a symbol lookup in case you mistype a hex number that's full of alpha-digits. Same deal with registers, by prefixing them with \"@\".",

      "text": "With regards to combining numerical expressions, the && isn't a numeric expression, but you probably realize that \"==\" returns a 0 or 1 (you can test your expressions with ? expr). So, if you just use a binary & between both comparisons, you can get the entire expr to return 1, which'd result in j executing the first command.  Wrt your list, at least one of those should work. It might help to clarify whether you're trying to deref a pointer at @ebp+0xc and check its value for 0x115, or check that @ebp+0xc == 0x115. You can also use .if (...) {} if quoting is messing you up.",
