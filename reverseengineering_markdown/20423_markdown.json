  "content": "I am trying to decompile a dylib called libConfigurer64.dylib, which is loaded from the environment variable \"DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES\"  \n\nI want to analyze what it really does, so I dragged it in to IDA, and found that it exported \"_sub_06adf\",\"_sub_06bdf\",\"InitFunc_0\"  \n\nIn _sub_06adf:\n\n```\ndb 'VfhT2zwxQpLeHRL6j4Oe4mrsmrjEAW',0\nalign 10h\n\n```\nIn _sub_06bdf\n\n```\ndb '(c) 2014 - Cryptic Apps SARL - Disassembling not allowed.',0\ndb    0\ndb    0\ndb    0\ndb    0\n\n```\nThey aren't correct asm code! And I have no clue what tool obfuscated this file.\nAnd I'm also curious about how can this dylib overwrite exisiting functions?\n\nNote: I've read https://alexomara.com/blog/a-silly-anti-disassembly-trick/, however this dylib isn't that trick, but is really obfuscated XD\n\n",
