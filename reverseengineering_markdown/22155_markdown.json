  "content": "Using the New Vegas Script Extender C++ API for Fallout New Vegas, I am able to write to the process' memory directly at runtime through a .dll plugin that's loaded by the NVSE injector. But it is not a debugger, like CheatEngine, so there's no automatic handling of inserting new code to an existing assembly function.\n\nBeginning of the assembly function, TryOpenPipboy, I want to inject code into: https://i.sstatic.net/xIqmA.png\n\nEquipPlayerPipboy() function I want to inject: https://i.sstatic.net/Gaujf.png\n\nThe game has a loop called MainUILoop which runs every frame, and when the player presses tab without holding it down, TryOpenPipboy is called.\n\nMy guess is that I need to somehow create a new empty block of memory, edit a copy of the original TryOpenPipboy function, then replace all TryOpenPipboy calls with my modified variant. But that would make a hard incompatibility with any other NVSE plugins that also modify the MainUILoop in any way, as well as any that edit TryOpenPipboy.\n\nEdit: Another possible way would be to change the jmp assembly to my C++ function, then call TryOpenPipboy from my function. That would mean TryOpenPipboy is still called, but is unmodified, increasing potential compatibility.\n\nSo how should I go about doing this?\n\n",

I'm happy to explain the details of how it works if you want, but I suggest just using an existing library like MinHook either way. Note that if this game is online then it's very likely you'll be kicked or banned, CRC hashes on code sections is about the simplest detection of unwanted modifications you can have.",

      "content": "If you just want to run code before or after TryOpenPipboy is called, you can overwrite the prologue of the function with a jmp to your function. Before you overwrite it, copy the instructions in the prologue to a new memory buffer, and add a jump to the rest of the function on the end, this is called a trampoline. You can use the trampoline to call the original function.\n\nBefore:\n\n```\n:originalFunction\npush ebp ;55\nmov ebp, esp ;89 E5\nsub esp, 0x40 ;83 EC 40\n;...\nret\n\n```\nAfter patching:\n\n```\n:originalFunction\njmp yourFunction ;?? ?? ?? ?? ??\nnop ;this used to be the 0x40 byte at the end\n:trampolinetarget\n;...\nret\n\nyourFunction:\n;do stuff\ncall trampoline ;calls the original function\n;do stuff\nret\n\ntrampoline:\npush ebp\nmov ebp, esp\nsub esp, 0x40\njmp trampolinetarget\n\n```\nIf something else tries to hook the original function, they'll just overwrite that jmp instruction, and their trampoline will call your function. Microsoft's Detours library can handle all of this for you.\n\n",

I did however find a more simple example of Detours: github.com/Alenett/TES-Reloaded-Source/blob/master/TESReloaded/…  So how would I use this? I've got the address where the ASM function is called, and I want to insert my own C++ function in the call's place, and then call the ASM function from it.",

When they commit it, the first thing it does is suspends all other threads, this is to prevent race conditions and is why you need to tell it what thread you're running on. After that, it does similar patches to what I showed in my answer. Just give it the addrof the func you want to hook, and ur func",
