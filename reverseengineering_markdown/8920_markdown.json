The Idle is (I think) written in python (Tkinter ?).\n\nI have tried to find the function which reads the textbox.text through checking the exports function inside the tk85.dll but I coudn't find it.\nA normal windows exe would be easier since I have to search for GetDlgItemText(). But how I can done something like this with python written code :O\n\n\n\n",
