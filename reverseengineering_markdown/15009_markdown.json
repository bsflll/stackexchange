  "content": "I found a breakpoint in OllyDbg that works for my purposes. But now I want to use WinDbg for scripting and when I try to set the same breakpoint, I get no breaks. \n\nIn OllyDbg, the following breakpoint gets me exactly what I want: \n\nAddress=75B0C4FA |  Module=KERNELBA | Active=Always | Disassembly=CMP EAX,103\n\nBut when I try to set a breakpoint in WinDbg , it never comes back with anything:\n\nbp 75b0c4fa\n\nAccording to the MS Dev Center documentation for the bp command, I should be able to reference addresses specifically, but in my searching, most people are using bp to reference API calls, such as bp ReadFile (which does break as expected). \n\nMy questions: is it possible to use the breakpoint (75B0C4FA) using WinDbg?\nAnd if so, what am I missing in terms of adapting the address I have to make it work in Windbg? \nDoes it have to do with bp ReadFile accessing the ReadFile API calls for the main process, while with my breakpoint, it is trying to put breaks into sub module?\n\n",
