  "content": "I'm taking my first steps in memory exploitation in Linux. I'm following a tutorial for a practice VM($ uname -r -> 3.13.0-32-generic)\n\nThe tutorial makes a call to mprotect to set a certain region of memory executable, then uses read to manually input some shellcode.\n\nI occurred to me that perhaps I could load my shellcode on the stack using the buffer and use mprotect to set the buffer region on the stack as executable and return to it. But that throws an error for reasons I'm not sure of.\n\nIn short, this call to mprotect works:\n\n```\n# mprotect: set memory executable\npayload += p(0x080523e0) # mprotect addr\npayload += p(0x08048882) # return to: pop, pop, pop, retn\npayload += p(0xb7ffd000) # arg1: address of 'mapped' region\npayload += p(0x2000)     # arg2: length\npayload += p(0x7)        # arg3: rwx\n\n```\nBut this call fails:\n\n```\n# mprotect: set memory executable\npayload += p(0x080523e0) # mprotect addr\npayload += p(0xbffff6c0) # return to shellcode in buffer on stack\npayload += p(0xbffff6c0) # arg1: beginning of shellcode on stack\npayload += p(0x2000)     # arg2: length\npayload += p(0x7)        # arg3: rwx\n\n```\nStepping through mprotect in that second example shows me that it takes an error jump:\n\n```\n=> 0x80523fa <mprotect+26>: jae    0x8053870 <__syscall_error>\n\n```\nAs the only difference between the two is the address I want to set executable, I'm wondering if it's simply that mprotect can't set the stack as executable?\n\n",
