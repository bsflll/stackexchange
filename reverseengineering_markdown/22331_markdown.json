  "content": "I am doing reverse engineering on some network protocol. It is client to server communication and I am pretty stuck with identifying checksum (or CRC) algorithm used in packet structure.\n\nI tried reveng util but without any result (so maybe it is not CRC). Also I lookout on standard CRCs algorithm online but nothing fits my samples.\n\nHere are some examples of packets:\n\nclient to server:\n\n```\n66  01 00 01 fa 00 00 00  b7 33  00 00 fc 00 00 00  99 \n66  01 00 03 fa 00 00 00  c7 d9  00 00 fd 00 00 00  99\n66  01 00 03 fa 00 00 80  d1 c2  08  99\n66  01 00 03 fa 00 00 71  46 42  00 00 05 00 00 00 ab 55 52 5c 5b 50 51 55 55 55 54 73  99\n66  01 00 03 fa 00 00 04  45 a2  00 00 6b 00 00 00 ab 55 40 5c 49 3e 47 1d 55 b4 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 45 bb  99 \n\n```\nserver to client:\n\n```\n66  01 fa 00 00 01 00 00  91 57  0a  99\n66  01 fa 00 00 03 00 00  8a bb  0a  99\n66  01 fa 00 00 01 00 96  9d 37  00 00 00 00 00 00 ab 55 55 55 ab  99\n66  01 fa 00 00 03 00 7f  61 68  00 00 44 00 00 00 ab 55 51 54 56 11 54 55 1e  99 \n66  01 fa 00 00 03 00 7a  70 dd  08 99\n\n```\nI think checksum is 16-bit number begin on 9th byte. Also, I believe that the first and last bytes are not significant to count the checksum algorithm (start and stop constat).\n\nI can provide more samples if it helps.\n\nI will be grateful for any help or advice from you.\n\n",

      "content": "Finally, I figure it out by myself.\n\nAll bytes, including start and stop byte, must be passed to CRC algorithm. Important part is CRC bytes must be substituted with zero.\n\nFor example\n\n```\n66 01 fa 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 0a 99\n\n```\nget result 0x9157 in standard CRC-16/TELEDISK algorithm.\n\nI found very useful this online CRC calculator: https://crccalc.com/\n\n",
