  "content": "For the bit of background, I'm a robotic engineer. \nRobotics manufactures hide some parameters of their robots in order to avoid their competition. Now, I need these data to compute the dynamics model of the robot. I'm working on establishing an ideal \"pathfinder\" in term of energy consumption.\n\nBasically, I have a .dat file gathering all the parameters I want, but I don't know \"which one\" is \"which one\".\n\nI've copied the code from the robot and dissasembled it using Ida pro. Now, I have some pseudo code that I analyse.\n\n```\n  FILE *__cdecl CDynamicData::loadRobcorFile(CDynamicData *this, char \n\n*filename, unsigned __int16 a3)\n{\n  int v3; // eax@4\n  const char *v4; // ebx@6\n  int v5; // eax@6\n  signed int v6; // edx@6\n  int v7; // eax@7\n  int v8; // eax@8\n  const char *v9; // ebx@11\n  int v10; // eax@11\n  signed int v11; // edx@11\n  int v12; // eax@12\n  int v13; // eax@13\n  signed int v14; // ebx@16\n  int v15; // eax@16\n  signed int v16; // edx@16\n  int v17; // eax@19\n  signed int v18; // edx@19\n  int v19; // eax@20\n  int v20; // eax@25\n  int i; // esi@28\n  float v22; // ST34_4@31\n  int v23; // eax@32\n  int v24; // edi@34\n  int v25; // esi@35\n  float v26; // ST34_4@38\n  FILE *result; // eax@41\n  int v28; // [sp+28h] [bp-400h]@27\n  int nbParam; // [sp+2Ch] [bp-3FCh]@27\n  int v30; // [sp+30h] [bp-3F8h]@34\n  char s; // [sp+40h] [bp-3E8h]@29\n  char src; // [sp+140h] [bp-2E8h]@4\n  char v33; // [sp+240h] [bp-1E8h]@30\n  int v34; // [sp+340h] [bp-E8h]@23\n  int v35; // [sp+3A0h] [bp-88h]@23\n  char v36; // [sp+3B8h] [bp-70h]@23\n  char v37; // [sp+3C0h] [bp-68h]@23\n  char v38; // [sp+3C8h] [bp-60h]@23\n  int v39; // [sp+3D4h] [bp-54h]@23\n  FILE *stream; // [sp+3ECh] [bp-3Ch]@1\n  void *v41; // [sp+3F0h] [bp-38h]@1\n  int v42; // [sp+3F4h] [bp-34h]@1\n  double v43; // [sp+3F8h] [bp-30h]@23\n  double value; // [sp+400h] [bp-28h]@29\n  int v45; // [sp+408h] [bp-20h]@4\n  int indice; // [sp+40Ch] [bp-1Ch]@27\n  int v47; // [sp+410h] [bp-18h]@25\n  int v48; // [sp+414h] [bp-14h]@32\n\n  stream = 0;\n  v42 = 256;\n  readIntValues((CFileParser *)&stream, \"$DYN_DAT\", \"REAL $DYN_DAT[%d]\", &src, 1, &v47);\n  v20 = operator new[](8 * v47, &std::nothrow);\n  *((_DWORD *)this + 3) = v20;\n\n\n  v28 = *((_DWORD *)this + 3);\n  nbParam = v47;\n  indice = 0;\n  if ( v47 > 0 )\n  {\n    i = 0;\n    do\n    {\n      CFileParser::getLine((CFileParser *)&stream, &s);\n      if ( sscanf(&s, \"$DYN_DAT[%d]=%lf\", &indice, &value) != 2 )\n\n      { // Can't acquire data\n        snprintf(&v33, 0x100u, \"%s konnte nicht gelesen werden\", \"$DYN_DAT[%d]=%lf\");\n        extended_internalError(\n      }\n      v22 = value;\n      *(double *)(v28 + 8 * indice - 8) = v22;\n      ++i;\n    }\n    while ( nbParam != i );\n  }\n\n```\nBasically, I don't understand the meaning of:\n\n```\n  *((_DWORD *)this + 3) = v20;\n\n```\nand:\n\n```\n      *(double *)(v28 + 8 * indice - 8) = v22;\n\n```\nDo you have any ideas ?\n\nSo far, I think it's a pointer of pointer, but I don't understand \"the meaning\" of it because it seems like v28 is a \"local variable\" with unaloccated space ?\n\nHere is the \"pseudo code\" of the constructor of the object DynDat:\n\n```\nint __cdecl CDynamicData::CDynamicData(int a1)\n{\n  int result; // eax@1\n\n  result = a1;\n  *(_BYTE *)a1 = 0;\n  *(_DWORD *)(a1 + 4) = 0;\n  *(_DWORD *)(a1 + 8) = 0;\n  *(_DWORD *)(a1 + 12) = 0;\n  return result;\n}\n\n```\nBonus question: Do you have any idea of the most efficient way to trace back the parsing and use of some values ?\n\nKind Regards,\n\n",

      "content": "Sorry for posting in Answer section (but i can't post comments without a reputation >= 50)\n\nso after using google a while my knowlege is: its a KUKA robot, $DYN_DAT is part of the $robocor.dat (which also contain other Arrays/Vars) - http://www.wtech.com.tw/public/download/manual/kuka/krc2/System_Variables_manual.pdf: \"Contains the model data of the robot, which are required for acceleration\nadaptation, the higher motion profile and the calculation of kinetic energy\n(moments of inertia, friction values, etc.)\" so $DYN_DAT is an Array of REAL aka double/float64 values and some of them are known - infereable by combining serveral docs spreaded over the internet, its not clear to me if the $DYN_DAT Array is of same and equal meaning for every type of KUKA robot\n\nand i understand that the content of $DYN_DAT is not full documented, and that is what you want\n\nQuestion:\n\nThe given decompiled (always impressed by hex-rays results) code looks like an textfile parser or something, and i don't think that parsing a textfile is your problem here, or?\ncan you provide us with a sample of the $robocor.dat (pastebin.com) to make it clear what we've really got to base on\n\nIdeas:\n\nIf im right (and it is an textfile and parsing is no problem) the next thing will be to find out whos using what parts of the $DYN_DAT:\n\nthere are several \"attack strategies\" available but \"I've copied the code from the robot and dissasembled\" makes i a little bit hard\n\nCrazy idea: What about a small Challenge homepage, with a selection of KUKA/Robot-Types which shows your current knowledege of the $DYN_DAT line by line, add the ability to upload $robocor.dat files - make it a crowd problem, post it on reddit/serveral KUKA forums, reach faster information from others\n\nNice and small tutorial about C++ reversing\nhttps://blog.0xbadc0de.be/archives/67\n\nmemory layout description etc.\n\n```\nstatic_assert(sizeof(int) == 4, \"wrong size\"); // are we 32bit\ntypedef unsigned int _DWORD;\nstatic_assert(sizeof(double*) == sizeof(_DWORD));\n\n//1. find allocation(new) of CDynamicData then you know how many (vtable+)member-bytes the class containts\n// give IDA a header with the class then is hex-rays able to give you even better results\n\n#pragma pack(push,1)\nclass CDynamicData\n{\npublic:\n    //already known\n    unsigned char unknown0 = 0;\n    unsigned char unknown1 = 0;\n    unsigned char unknown2 = 0;\n    unsigned char unknown3 = 0;\n    _DWORD unknown4 = 0;\n    _DWORD unknown5 = 0;\n    double* dyn_dat_values = nullptr;\n    //unsigned char unknown6[x] -> fill that up\n\n    CDynamicData()\n    {\n       unknown0 = 0;\n       unknown4 = 0;\n       unknown5 = 0;\n       dyn_dat_values = 0;\n    }\n};\n#pragma pack(pop)\n\nvoid test()\n{\n    assert(offsetof(CDynamicData, dyn_dat_values) == 12);\n\n    CDynamicData dd;\n    void* _this = &dd;\n\n    int v42 = 123456; // readIntValues...\n\n    double* v20 = new (std::nothrow) double[v42];\n\n    //*((_DWORD *)this + 3) = v20;\n    assert((char*)&dd.dyn_dat_values == (char*)((_DWORD *)_this + 3));\n    dd.dyn_dat_values = v20;\n\n    double* v28 = dd.dyn_dat_values; // in code a int --> int == ptr-value\n\n    double v22 = 123456.0; // scanf...\n    //*(double *)(v28 + 8 * indice - 8) = v22;\n    //start with pointer to double array, + 8 because of sizeof(double), -8 because of indice starting with 1 not 0\n    int indice = 1; //= 1..n\n    v28[indice - 1] = v22;\n}\n\n```\nbeware of thinking that int means value - hex-rays output is high high level asm so every int could also be just a pointer to something\n\nLoad C header:\nhttps://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/1367.shtml\ni prepared this header-file for IDA: https://pastebin.com/PWNAAj7T, just load before\nanalyze and hex-rays, then you will see much clearer whats happening\n\nthen follow every occurence of CDynamicData and tell IDA to use your struct type - that will help alot\n\n",
