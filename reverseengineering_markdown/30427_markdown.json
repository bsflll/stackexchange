  "content": "The program I'm messing with has builtin logging. Using a proxy DLL, I managed to activate it by calling the right functions from the real DLL. However, I got stuck at using the actual logging functions, as the program crashes with Error 0xC0000142 whenever I get close to using them.\n\nHere's what I'm doing in my proxy DLL:\n\n```\ntypedef void (*FDLAddr_t)(void);\nFDLAddr_t ForceDebugLog;\n\ntypedef void (*LIAddr_t)(char const *, ...);\nLIAddr_t LogInfo;\n\nvoid setupFuncs() {\n    HMODULE trueDll= GetModuleHandleA(\".\\\\trueDll.dll\");\n    ForceDebugLog = (FDLAddr_t)GetProcAddress(trueDll, \"?ForceDebugLog@@YAXXZ\");\n    // LogInfo = (LIAddr_t)GetProcAddress(trueDll, \"?LogInfo@@YAXPBDZZ\");\n}\n\n```\nNow, I can just do ForceDebugLog(); and logging gets enabled. However, as soon as I uncomment the LogInfo line, the program crashes on startup with Windows showing the error 0xc0000142.\n\nFurther experimentation shows that GetProcAddress returns the address of LogInfo in the DLL. Also, the line appears to be fine if LogInfo was a FARPROC, as that works without a problem. As soon as I add the cast to LIAddr_t, the error comes back.\n\nHow can I work around this issue? Or do I need to take a different approach? All binaries involved are 32 bit.\n\n",

As it turns out, some old object files from earlier experiments were accidentally linked into the DLL. One of the experiments was a reimplementation of LogInfo which caused the compiler/linker to produce an incorrect result.\n\n",
