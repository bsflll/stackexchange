  "content": "I am studying binary lifting and the impacts of intermediate language representations. I have a binary that is an x86 PE file with a stripped header. I have many of these files so I need a more sample agnostic processs.  I need to exfiltrate all code detected by Ghidra and its relevant PCODE to do my comparison.\n\nI used Binary Ninja to pull apart the same binary and I am struggling to get Ghidra to output anything. This is due to Ghidra viewing everything as part of the .ram memory map section I think. I tell both that it is an x86 based binary.\n\nSee screenshot for comparison of how the different tools loaded the same stripped binary. I used default analysis settings for both tools. Any thoughts on how to get Ghidra to see the code within the binary properly so I can get the PCODE?\n\n\n\n",

Obfuscated malware with intact PE headers can be acquired from VirusTotal, vx-underground, and many other places. Removing the header is not an obfuscation technique, it's a measure taken to prevent binary execution by ensuring no OS loader can parse the binary.",

Creating a valid header for the PE will allow more tools to load the file correctly.\nhttps://github.com/hasherezade/pe-bear\n\nAnother solution would be to use Cutter, an open-source static analysis tool like Ghidra which also features a decompiler.\nhttps://cutter.re\n\n",
