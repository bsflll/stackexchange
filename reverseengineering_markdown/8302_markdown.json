Obviously such a change would mess up the offsets.\n\ne.g. Say I have the byte sequence 4F 3E 23 and wish to change it to 23 56 7E 74 21\n\n",

      "content": "I suppose you have two options:\n\nIn both cases, you'd need to preserve the program state\n   (probably a PUSHAD then POPAD when you're done), then JMP back\n   and resume execution.\n\nAn example (second approach, assuming MSVC):\n\n```\nvoid __declspec(naked) MyCode()\n{\n    __asm PUSHAD\n    //your code here\n    __asm POPAD\n    __asm PUSH returnAddress\n    __asm RETN\n}\n\n```\nand to patch it:\n\n```\nDWORD AddrToPatch = 0xC0DE;\n\nDWORD RelAddr = (DWORD)(MyCode - (DWORD)AddrToPatch) - 5;\n*AddrToPatch = 0xE9;\n*((DWORD *)(AddrToPatch + 0x1)) = RelAddr;  \n\n```\n\nHonestly, I think you're better off doing it like that - the first method is a lot more hassle, and injecting a DLL is fairly easy, you can automate that by playing around with the IAT or TLS callbacks.\n\n",
