  "content": "So I have a few files from a game on my pc, most of which are .toc files\n\nI believe this means they are a \"table of contents\" as the ending suggests, but my attempts to read them have been unsuccessful.\n\nThe contents of the files aren't inherently human-readable, and I haven't been able to really \"read\" them, as I am not very good at this sort of thing.\n\nweapons.toc - one of the files in the game\n\nThis game uses a \"developmental\" Frostbite engine, I dunno how that could affect the game itself / its encryption of these files.\n\nI am curious as to how I could possibly extract data from these files\n\n",
