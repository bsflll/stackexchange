  "content": "I'm trying to figure out how this .RBB file is packed it's from a gamecube game I'm trying to learn how to reverse engineer it so I can extract the file and look at its contents. \n\nI don't know were to start honestly so I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction. I've added a link to the file below incase anyone wants to take a look at it.\n\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/227520696/CITY.RBB\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nThe game is called Extreme G Racing\n\nEdit: I've looked it with a hex editor and it shows some japanese text\n\n\n\n",
