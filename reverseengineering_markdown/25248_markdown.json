      "content": "When you use bindiff e.g.,\nbindiff original.BinExport patched.BinExport\nit will create a BinDiff file, e.g., original_vs_patched.BinDiff. In the current version (6) that file is an sqlite3 database. You can find some of the information you're looking for in the tables in that database-- specifically, the functions table contains the number of basic blocks and edges.\n\nSince you're using IDA, I also recommend you check out ida_haru, it may also export some of the information you're looking for.\n\n",
