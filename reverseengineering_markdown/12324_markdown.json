  "content": "Not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but I am having some questions regarding the legality of reverse engineering firmware.\n\nSpecifically, I was looking into the Nintendo 3DS firmware. The EULA clearly states:\n\nAnd yet you see blog posts like these: http://gaasedelen.blogspot.ca/2014/03/depackaging-nintendo-3ds-cpu.html\n\nMy question is, what are the legal implications of reverse engineering the 3DS firmware and posting your finding in a blog post?\n\n",

      "content": "This depends on a multitude oft things, especially your location, and you should really ask a lawyer. If Nintendo sues you, \"a random guy in the internet said it was ok\" won't help you anything; your lawyer can at least help you in court and should have insurance to cover up if things really go wrong.\n\nThere are limits to what an EULA can forbid you to do. But this depends a lot in your location. In the US, EULAs tend to overrule rights that laws give you, in EU, law tends to overrule EULAs. There is an EU directive that, greatly simplified, says you are allowed to reverse engineer stuff if you want to interface it with other stuff and the manufacturer doesn't give you neccesary documentation.\n\nThis is sometimes misinterpreted to mean \"as long as you live in the EU, reverse engineering is ok\". This is wrong. A EU directive is not comparable to US federal law; it just means the individual states have to pass laws with a general content. They have considerable leeway in doing so, and sometimes, EU directives don't get turned into national law at all. So what might be ok in one state might not be in another one. Or, you might be required to prove you asked for documentation and were refused before you reverse engineered anything.\n\nAnd even the existance of a blog post does not mean the blogger isn't breaking any laws. Nintendo might just not know about the post, or not care, or not want to draw the attention a lawsuit means. This doesn't mean they won't sue you.\n\nAnd of course, you may be doing something that turns out to be legal after a 3 year lawsuit that cost you several dozen thousand dollars. Companies have far greater resources than you do; winning your case in the end can still mean lots of trouble in the first place.\n\nSo, any advice you can get on the internet will be bad advice. Don't take it. Ask someone who can take into account the specifics of your situation, and whom you can hold responsible in the case of bad advice.\n\n",

If you REALLY need to put some information on the internet, creating a fake account with a proxy (Tor, whatever) and posting it is enough. If it's THAT important it'll get spread, and suing won't be an effective tool to censor it.

Good point about EU directives not being law, though. Also I wholeheartedly agree that a lawyer needs to be consulted when unsure (which is, after all, why the question was posited).",
