  "content": "Say, I have a command in radare which produces multiple input, say afl. I can run it and extract many addresses:\n\n```\n[0x5579ca2e2196]> afl~[0]\n0x5579ca2e2060\n0x5579ca2e4fe0\n0x5579ca2e2090\n0x5579ca2e20c0\n0x5579ca2e2100\n\n```\nHow do I do run another command on each of those addresses? Let's say I want to print first byte of each of them or set a breakpoint with db on each address.\n\nI read about iteration, but it looks like it only works on flags with something like sym.*, but not on arbitrary outputs, so I can't do this:\n\n```\np8 1 @@ `some command which produces many addresses`\n\n```\nI know that I can save output to a file and then use something like p8 1 @@.my_file, but it looks strange that I need to create a file for that.\n\nBasically, I want a way to run a single radare command (possibly with parameters) for every line of output of another radare command.\n\n",
