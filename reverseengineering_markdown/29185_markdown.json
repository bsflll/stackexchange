      "content": "Hmm, the setup should register it for you (and even bundle the Python 3 setup). If it didn't you can point it to the appropriate python3.dll by using the Python3TargetDLL (REG_SZ) value at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Hex-Rays\\IDA.\n\nSo for a current Python 3.10.x you could set it to the value C:\\Program Files\\Python310\\python3.dll. After a restart IDA should pick up on it.\n\nYou didn't specify the OS you run on, so I am assuming Windows.\n\n",
