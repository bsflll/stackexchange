  "content": "I'm using the Capstone disassembler for decoding a RISC-V ELF binary but need the ability to reassemble modifications that I'm making to it programmatically to accomplish a reverse-engineering goal. Ideally, this would be an assembler that takes Capstone syntax or represents the assembly data in a similar structure. I know someone has previously (Capstone in reverse mode) asked whether there's a Capstone-like project for assembling code. My question is, are there any Capstone-like assemblers which also have good RISC-V support?\n\n",
