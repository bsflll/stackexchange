  "content": "New to decompiling, and code generally. Trying to decompile a windows 3.1 game (text adventure), so I can build it up again. Because at the moment it doesn't work (even on windows 3.1).\n\nI decompiled the exe with DoDi (7z File) which was recommended in one of the answers to this question on SO.\n\nThis threw an error when decompiling the exe 'an already known error occurred'. Probably not very helpful, but I mention it just in case.\n\nSo, it decompiled fine to .mak, .frm and .bas files. I compiled the program again in Visual Basic 4, after correcting some syntax problems, but I get a totally non-interactive window in which none of the buttons work.\n\nThis makes me think that it needs to talk to the code in the dll, but is not doing so. DoDi won't decompile dlls, and I have yet to find a decompiler which will handle 16-bit (NE/New Executable) dlls.\n\nSo, I assume I need to decompile this dll too. How? The game files are in  draquest.zip, which is here archived here.\n\n",

COMMDLG.DLL is the dll that has the standard windows dialogs (File open/save dialog, color chooser, that kind of stuff), so it shouldn't have anything that's specific to your game. Everything that's going to be needed to interface with it will probably be in Cmdialog.vbx.",

If the event handler functions aren't firing, it's likely because the handlers aren't properly registered in ONLYFORM.FRM. However, you already have the code, so any future questions on how to fix the event handler registration should go to https://stackoverflow.com/.\n\n",
