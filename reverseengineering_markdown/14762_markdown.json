  "content": "My friend and I am trying to decrypt the Assembly-CSharp.dll file from an Android game which was written in Unity3D.\nNormally these files are readable when using something like JustDecompile, but this one is encrypted.\n\nWe managed to modify the APK so that it is debuggable and also managed to get the stuff running so that we can debug the APK in IDA Pro.\nThis runs fine so far and we can also set breakpoints and all that stuff.\n\nBut when debugging the APK in IDA Pro we are not able to find the points where the client is decrypting the Assembly-CSharp.dll file as this seems to happen in libmono.so.\nHere is an example what the encrypted DLL looks like right now:\n\n\nand what it should look like (from a game, made by me with unity):\n\n\nAfter making some adjustments of how the files are loaded from the APK, we were able to load libmono.so and also libunity.so into IDA, but we can not debug these files.\n\nWhenever we want to debug them the IDA system tells us that these files can not run by themselves. Now we have 3 possible ways how to get to the point we want to:\n\n",

      "content": "I think the solution is a very simple one, with one small tweak.\n\nTo decrypt the file,\nXOR the encrypted data with the bytes 0xFCC6DC7FDCC7DFE0 and you will get the unencrypted file.\n\nYou can see this pattern by looking at the encrypted file and a valid dll.  You can see a repeating pattern that is easy to pick out if you find areas that are supposed to be all 0's.\n\nIt appears that the encrypted files have a 16-byte header that is likely\n\n```\n    4-byte     file-signature  (0x0b25c4fa)\n    4-byte     file size\n    4-byte     file size (duplicated ?)\n    4-byte     flag?\n\n```\nThe rest of the file is the encrypted file.\n\nWith one small difference .. at least the first 2 bytes of the unencrypted file is mangled somehow to obscure it further.  For a dll, start by setting the first 2 bytes to 0x4D5A, that should get it recognized by some tools such as 010Editor.  You may have to play with the DOS_HEADER (the first 64 bytes of a dll) structure to see if it makes sense.\n\n",
