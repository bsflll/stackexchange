  "content": "I am writing a PinTool, which can manipulate certain register/memory value. However, after manipulation, one challenge I am facing now, is the deadloop. \n\nIn particular, due to the frequent manipulation of certain register value, it is indeed common to create deadloop in the execution trace. I am thinking to detect such case, and terminate the execution.\n\nSo here is my question, what is a good practice to detect a deadloop in a PinTool? I can come up with some naive solutions, say, record the executed instructions, and if certain instruction has been executed for a large amount of times, just terminate the execution. \n\nCould anyone help me on this issue? Thank you.\n\n",

Once the area identified, you can open the tool in IDA to do further inspection or \"connect\" your source to debugger.\n\nAnother way, is to log every Trace or basic block that is executing - check in the examples. This log should also show you the problematic area.\n\n",

      "content": "I assume by deadloop you mean infinite loop.\n\nGenerally, the loop should have one or more exit condition. The exit condition has one of the control-transfer instructions (jz, jg, ja...) that keeps the loop going. So it's enough to log the control-transfer instructions.\n\nLogging the instructions can be expensive, and you may need to narrow the algorithm to specific thread and module.\n\nYou may also want to consider to diagnose the infinite loops to know more about the cause before implementing algorithm to detect it.\n\n",
