  "content": "I am using qemu to emulate a binary like this\n\nqemu -strace XXXXX .\n\nI saw that the first 2 system calls of this process were TCGETS to stdin and stdout. From man pages\n\n```\nGet and set terminal attributes\n      TCGETS Argument: struct termios *argp\n              Equivalent to tcgetattr(fd, argp).\n              Get the current serial port settings.\n\n```\nAnd after those 2 syscall the process got SIGSEGV.\n\nIs there any simple way to handle those syscall so the process continues without a segfault?\n\n",
