      "content": "The online IDA SDK has an excellent description: https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/sdkdoc/netnode_8hpp.html\n\nAn IDA database is one large table of key/value pairs.\nAll keys associated with a single address together form a netnode.\n\nThere are two kinds of netnodes:\n\nThese internal items usually have addresses which start with 0xFF0....\nBecause of this it can be a bit of a challenge to reverse engineer binaries which happen to use that address range.\n\nA list of items which are stored in netnodes can be found in netnode.hpp and nalt.hpp\n\n",
