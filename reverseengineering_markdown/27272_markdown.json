  "content": "I want to edit the compiled DLL code to bypass the variable checking condition. I tried to change the value in the condition but it causes an application crash. How can I \"remove\" this condition?\n\nHere is the condition (if statement)\n\n\nAnd here is ASM code\n\n\nI was trying change the HEX from\n83 F8 FF\nto\n83 F8 01\nbut application crashes.\n\nI don't want crack anything, i want remove version checked because library is older than actual game version\n\n",

Try to debug the patched version: put a breakpoint at 1800060EA and keep pressing F8 (step over) until it crashes. You will find the procedure causing error.",
