  "content": "I am using qemu-arm to run a statically linked binary on an Ubuntu system. There is little to no chance of emulating the entire system.\n\nThe binary reads /proc/cmdline as it starts up, to check for a specific parameter concerning MTD partitions. Obviously, my /proc/cmdline does not match.\n\nIs there any easy way to alter the contents of /proc/cmdline for this emulated binary?\n\n",

      "content": "The typical way to do something like this is to write a small library that intercepts open/read and fakes out the data your program is looking for, and then arrange for that library to be loaded by passing in an LD_PRELOAD environment variable (QEMU's -E option).\n\nIt's pretty straightforward; you could adapt the instructions here on emulating NVRAM in QEMU.\n\n",
