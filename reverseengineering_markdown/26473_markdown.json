  "content": "I am reversing a binary using Ghidra. In the disassembled output, I have the following lines in the main function:\n\n```\n(code *)mmap((void *)0x0,0x55,7,0x22,-1,0)\n\n```\nI am quite confused here since the file descriptor appears to be -1 and I remember reading that file descriptors should be non-negative.\n\nCan someone please tell me what I am missing here?\n\n",

You could find further proof by looking at the headers for the system you're REing to confirm that MAP_ANONYMOUS is indeed being used as part of the flags.\n\n",
