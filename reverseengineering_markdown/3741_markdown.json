  "content": "Being a beginner in C# I wonder if it is possible to patch a .class file inside a .jar?\n\nSince jar files tend to act like \"zip\" files, the approach I think might work is to decompress the jar, patch the hex offset in the *.class then zip back the jar and overwrite the original.\n\nAny examples or tutorials showing how to do this? is there a better approach?\n\n",

Why; because I want to learn C# :). Second thing; It is related to RCE because I'm \"patching\" an offset adress rather than modifying the original code.. maybe I should have put it in the main stackoverflow forum but I taught it belong to this forum.",
