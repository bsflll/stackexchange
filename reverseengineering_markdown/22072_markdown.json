  "content": "followed that post from Wordpress \n\nExtracted the 4 Hex strings needed. But, looks like there is a twist. the IV is 64 bits long.. so the .Py script he shared gives an error that the IV is too long.\n\nuploaded the 4 files (GetInfo 1 through 4) and the extractkey.py script. also included is the output from that script as a proof.\n\nEDIT : can anyone get me in contact with that person on the wordpress ? Maybe he can help\n\n",
