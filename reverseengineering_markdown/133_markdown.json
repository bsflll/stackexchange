      "content": "First I would recommend reading through the specifications of the SWF file format and ActionScript. I wouldn't recommend reading it all (it does get boring). Just the first three or four chapters. This will help with having a foundation of knowledge for the structure and keywords. Here are the two I would recommend.  \n\nSWF File Format PDF, ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview PDF\n\nOnce you have a basis of knowledge check out some posts on Flash Exploits. Here is a list of posts in no particular order or value 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Searching the RE Reddit is also another good resource for SWF/Flash analysis. \n\nFor better or for worse a lot of great work has been done by the exploit community for reverse engineering SWF/ActionScript/Flash/etc. There a number of researchers I would recommend google stalking their work. Haifei Li is one notable individual. A quick google search for filetype:PDF + \"Haifei Li\" will bring up a lot of great resources. Example: link. \n\nIF you are sick of reading I'd recommend downloading some samples. Contagiodump is a good place to grab samples. Typically the sample have the proper CVE number. This can be helpful because a quick google of CVE-number + \"analysis\" will allow you to do the at home follow along version. Of course you will need tools. I personally would recommend REMnux by Lenny Zeltser. Almost all the tools listed in this thread are already installed in it. If you are working with SWFs embedded in documents I'd recommend xxxswf.py for extracting them. The source code isn't that badly commented so it will give you some basics about the file structure. Disclaimer: my tool. \n\nA couple of tools that aren't listed that I'd recommend is Flash Decompiler by Trillix and Yogoda. Both of these tools are for Windows. \n\n",

The nice thing about swfdump is that it will show the output in human-readable p-code format which helps very much with analysis.\n\nAlso, there are commercial decompilers such as Sothink SWF Decompiler and Flash Decompiler Trillix. I don't have any experience using them and can't recommend as to how well they work.\n\n",

Although it's commercial it's really worth it if you occasionally reverse engineer flash files.\n\nThe full version (which I own and use) can decompile whole SWF files back to FLA, supports latest versions of AS (when other free tools were not), lets you modify and run SWF files as well as create a modified SWF version, allows editing all resource types (not just code), and has a full-blown feature-rich GUI.\n\n",
