  "content": "i have the following assembly lines:\n\n```\n....\nLEA   EAX, DWORD PTR DS:[0x404212]\nMOV   DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-0x3CC], EAX\nPUSH  DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-0x3CC]\n...\n...\n...\nLEA   EAX, DWORD PTR DS:[0x404213]\nMOV   DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-0x3D0], EAX\nPUSH  DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-0x3D0]\n...\n...\n\n```\nSo, I asked myself how I can that piece of code translate into a higher language like C? Or a pseudo C language?\n\nBut, for the the two blocks I have the following:\n\n```\n UNKNOWNTYPE *eax_pointer_1;     //points to 00404212\n UNKNOWNTYPE *eax_pointer_2;     //points to 00404213\n\n```\nIn ollydbg, I see that at the address 00404212 there is the following line :\n\n```\nADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX], DH\n\n```\nand at the address 00404213, there is:\n\n```\nXOR BYTE PTR DS:[EAX], AL\n\n```\nSo my question would be : Is that a correct transformation? Have you some ideas how I can the instructions at 00404212 and 00404213 make part of my transformation into a pseudo-C language?\n\n",
