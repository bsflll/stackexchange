  "content": "Recently I have come across a few parts in a binary that looked odd to me, and I wanted to ask if this is something common compilers do, and if there is a way to undo it.\n\n(The binary is from a raw flash dump)\n\nA few examples:\n\n```\nIn Binary File:\n4C 65 76 FF 65 6C 3D 30 28 4F 46 46 FF 29 2C 31 28 45 52 52 29 FF 2C 32 28 43 4D 44 29 2C FD 33 1C 41 50 52 4F 43 29\nLevÿel=0(OFFÿ),1(ERR)ÿ,2(CMD),ý3.APROC)\n\nWhat it actually should look like:\nLevel=0(OFF),1(ERR),2(CMD),3(....PROC)\n\n```\n```\nBin:\n45 D2 60 67 65 6E 63 79 DA 50 FF 6F 70 20 54 65 73 74 20 33 4F 4E\nEÒ`gencyÚPÿop Test 3ON\n\nActual:\nEmergency Loop Test ON\n\n```\n```\nBin:\n53 FF 65 72 76 69 63 65 20 55 FF 6E 61 76 61 69 6C 61 62 E3 6C 65\nSÿervice Uÿnavailabãle\n\nActual:\nService Unavailable\n\n```\nThanks in advance.\n\nEDIT:\n\nHow do you know what it should look like ?\n\nBecause when the board is running, it is showing the exact same string in the GUI.\n\nCan you diff your dump and the binary found on disk ?\n\nSince this image is extracted from a flash, I'd say it actually is stored like that on it.\n\nCan you update your question with hex bytes in order to aid investigation ?\n\nSure.\n\nAre you aware of the compiler used ?\n\nNo, I do not know what compiler was used. It has to be something for embedded systems tho, since it was running on an mcu.\n\nCould you provide some environment information ? (OS, arch, compiler...)\n\nEmbedded System Board running some sort of RENESAS Processor (exact model unknown)\n\nUPDATE:\n\nEvery 8 bytes there is some sort of indicator. In my case mostly FF (ÿ) which indicates that the next 8 bytes are not encoded/compressed.\nIf the byte is something like FD (ý) which in Binary(MSB) is 10111111, means the 2nd byte is encoded.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nLevÿel=0(OFFÿ),1(ERR)ÿ,2(CMD),ý3.APROC)\n678 12345678 12345678 12345678 12.345678\n\n```\nMeaning (APROC) isn't actually (APROC) but rather something more like (....PROC)\n\n",

Think something like LZSS.\n\nThe fact that there is a mystery byte containing eight 1 bits, followed by eight literal and correct bytes, indicates that maybe the mystery bytes are actually flags that use each bit position to differentiate uncompressed data bytes from pointers to earlier data. Cases where the mystery byte is not FF are followed by text that is more corrupted than the other instances, leading credence to the idea that 0 bits mean pointer data.\n\n",

My guess would be that you're either looking at UTF8 bytes that are not being interpreted correctly or your dump has differences from executable file on disk that cause such corrupted characters. \nI'll ask a couple more questions:\n\nAs for undoing the corruption, can't you do it yourself by hand ? In case it is not feasible / you don't want the questions above become more relevant\n\n",
