  "content": "I'm trying to unpack a binary packed with aspack I loadded it into ollydbg 1.0 with ollydump tool. I setup hardware breakpoint at ECX and then I step over it and it is stopping at this statement: MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EDI],EBX I bypassed it by shift+F8 but it keeps giving access violation error multiple times. How can I proceed further in UnPacking Binary. Binary is working fine when executed without debugger. \n\n",
