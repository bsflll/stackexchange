      "content": "In fact, the assembly instructions does not have addresses built-in... But, when analyzing a program, you may encounter more than once the same instruction. In order to make it 'unique' in the program (and, thus, understand the role it plays in the program), you have to link it to the address it has in the program.\n\nSomehow, it is very similar to line numbers associated to a program you write in a programming language. The if (test) line 10 is not the same than the if (test) of line 25.\n\n",
