  "content": "Suppose I reverse a dll, and searching for a Function, say for instance Send(), I have reversed the ws2_32.dll now How Can i calculate the number of bytes from there to know that i need 5 bytes of instruction using say ollydbg or immunity debugger??\n\nI am very new to this and I do not want to use a disassembly library like Minhook and Microsoft Detours. Just something done manually.\n\n",

Make sure to get any argument types correct; a simple jump jz can be from 2 to up to -- I think -- 5 bytes long.",
