  "content": "I have a .img file which will not mount, open, extract or anything within Windows using either the tools built into Windows 10, WinRAR or 7-Zip, they all return errors.\n\nI'm trying to look at data contained within the file which is destined for a Telenav system and would add an update to existing data - or overwrite. I do not know the file system of the .img file which makes life even more interesting.\n\nI need some help pointing in the right direction as to how I may be able to view the information? It originally resided within a compressed folder. I'm fairly new to this stuff so please be gentle and guide me in the right direction if possible.\n\nI do have a ubuntu machine but yet to try on that. Still a Linux newb.\n\nI also can't add new tags so sorry if they're wrong too!\n\n",
