      "content": "The SCAS instruction is used to scan a string (SCAS = SCan A String). It compares the content of the accumulator (AL, AX, or EAX) against the current value pointed at by ES:[EDI].\n\nWhen used together with the REPNE prefix (REPeat while Not Equal), SCAS scans the string searching for the first string element which is equal to the value in the accumulator. \n\nThe Intel manual (Vol. 1, p.231) says:\n\nSo, basically, this instruction scan a string and look for the same character than the one stored in EAX. It won't touch any registers other than ECX (counter) and EDI (address) but the status flags according to the results.\n\n",
