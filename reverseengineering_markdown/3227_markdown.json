If there are, I would love to know about them.\n\nAs an alternative (and I am sure you have done this), try searching for examples of MIPS shellcode and crafting exploits that work on your own framework. This is a lot of work, but there are definitely examples of MIPS shellcode and malicious embedded logic described in articles (like www.shell-storm.org/shellcode, metasploit, etc.) that you could use. They are just not in a unified database. Also, you may need to do some work to craft things that will exploit things in MiBench.\n\n",
