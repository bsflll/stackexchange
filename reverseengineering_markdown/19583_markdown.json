  "content": "I have the following assembly (x64) function:\n\n```\n400700: sub  rsp,0x18\n400704: mov  QWORD PTR [rsp+0x8],rdi\n400709: cmp  QWORD PTR [rsp+0x8],0x0\n40070f: jne  400718 <bar+0x18>\n400711: mov  eax,0x0\n400716: jmp  400734 <bar+0x34>\n400718: mov  rax,QWORD PTR [rsp+0x8]\n40071d: sub  rax,0x1\n400721: mov  rdi,rax\n400724: call 400700 <bar>\n400729: mov  rdx,rax\n40072c: mov  rax,QWORD PTR [rsp+0x8]\n400731: add  rax,rdx\n400734: add  rsp,0x18\n400738: ret\n\n```\nI've figured out that the beginning part is just the header for any assembly program. Also, I think that the two QWORD are either from longs or characters. I'm guessing that the jne jump is probably a conditional statement, but I'm not too sure. It looks like the function is recursive since it has a line that calls \"bar\" again. \n\nMy guess for the overall function is that it takes two longs and recursively adds them (Fibonacci, maybe?). I don't have much reasoning for this guess though, and I could be incorrect. \n\nCould anyone please help me solve this problem? Or, if there's a way for me to pass in parameters (I don't even know what kind of argument the function takes) and see the output, then I can try to backtrack and figure out what the program is doing. \n\nThanks\n\n",
