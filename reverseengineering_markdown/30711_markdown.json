  "content": "I am trying to solve an elf CrackMe. I opened it with IDA Pro and I saw start function is on address 0x1E8. I opened the elf with HxD and I saw entry point is 0x1E9 (and no results on file for 01E8)...\n\nIf I run on Kali terminal:\n\n```\nreadelf --symbols CrackMe\n\n```\nI don't get any result. If I run:\n\n```\nreadelf --sections Crackme\n\n```\nI get over 20 sections.\n\nIf I try to execute the binary on Kali terminal:\n\n```\n./CrackMe\n\n```\nI get\n\n```\nzsh: exec format error.\n\n```\nI changed manually the byte of entry point that is different with HxD, E9 --> E8, but I don't get any different results when I execute all again using the edited file.\n\nAny ideas? Thank you.\n\n",
