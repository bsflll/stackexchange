  "content": "Will every .exe file start from 00401000 or am I wrong assuming such a thing.\n\nEdit: total beginner here.\n\nwhen the program is first loaded onto x64dbg it immediately goes into a DLL, so I could not see the address 00401000, but indeed it is present by going into the memory map. \n\nQuestion: the program goes directly into a DLL, how can I make x64dbg start it from 00401000, I tried setting a breakpoint(software and hardware) at 00401000 and also breaks on events such as \"entry breakpoint\" and \"system breakpoint\"\n\nthanks for the welcome\n\n",

However, it's not quite clear what you're asking. Please edit your question to clarify and then click the \"reopen\" link. Thanks.",
