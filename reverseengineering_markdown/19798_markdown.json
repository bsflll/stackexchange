  "content": "In Windows 10, I can easily intercept traffic of an application using Proxifier and route it to Charles proxy, so that I can inspect and edit the data.\n\n```\n exe -> Proxifier (Socks proxy to localhost:8889) -> Charles (socks listen localhost:8889)\n\n```\nI now would like to replace Charles with my own Java server.\n\n```\npublic void StartListener(int port) throws Exception {\n    HttpServer server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(8889), 0);\n    server.createContext(\"/MyHandler\", new MyHandler());\n    server.setExecutor(null);\n    server.start();\n}\n\n```\nWhile this works fine if I turn off Proxifier (or even if it's on) open Chrome and navigate to localhost:8889/MyHandler it does not when the exe tries to connect to ExeWebsite.com:80/MyHandler.\n\nI tried settings up Proxifier either as Socks or Http proxy but nothing.\n\nI also tried to edit the Java server like this, as per specs:\n\n```\nHttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(\"ExeWebsite.com\", 80), 0);\n\n```\nThe result I see in Proxifier log is:\n\nWhich tool should I use to quickly and painlessly redirect all the traffic to my local server?\n\n",
