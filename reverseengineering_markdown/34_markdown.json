You can easily see this by opening a JSmooth executable with Resource Hacker as the following screen shot shows (I used sun's deploy.jar from the java lib folder):\n\n\n\nFor other utilities it might be different but you could use a tool like binwalk to look for the jar/zip signature inside the exe.\n\n",
