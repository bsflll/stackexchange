  "content": "I have hexadecimal data from first 5 blocks of T5557 125KHz RFID card. The 5th block appear to be some kind of checksum which I like to know how it is derived.\n\nBelow are 11 different samples of the data. Rows 1 to 5 in the tables represent block 1 to 5 of T5557 125 KHz RFID card.\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nPlease note how changes in block 3 column 1 data  for samples 1,2,3 and 4,5 and 6,7 and 8,9 and 10,11 affect block 5 data.\n\nIs anyone able to figure out how data in row 5 was derived?\n\nMany thanks in advance.\n\n",
