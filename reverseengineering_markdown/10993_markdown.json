  "content": "I'm trying to reverse-enginering a Win7 32bit legacy driver.\n\nIf I break when the system is loaded I can see that the driver is loaded because the corresponding DRIVER_OBJECT is created (!drvobj name show a real object). \n\nBut I can't see the driver name in the module list with lm command. Is there an explanation for this?\n\nBecause of this I am also unable to break when this module is loaded with sxe ld name but I think that the driver is loaded just after the loading of umbus (because at this time the corresponding DRIVER_OBJECT is created). \n\nSearching on internet I found that this is the \"User mode bus enumerator\" but I don't understand because it is a kernel mode driver (.sys file).\n\n",

But I'm still unable to set a bp on driver entry. ln addr of DriverEntry doesn't show anything. I tried also bu module_name+offset of EntryPoint with no luck. I think the problem is windbg does not know what \"module name\" is before I do .reload and so is unable to break on EntryPoint. Any clues?",
