  "content": "I really liked the answer in this post:\n\nDefeat rsa hash verification\n\nHowever I do not really understand this part:\n\n\"taking the signature s raised to the power of 3 modulus n we wind up with the following value\"\n\nI see where the strings come from but could someone point me to a box filling operation or perhaps some OpenSSL code so that I can generate the resultant string shown. \n\n```\n1ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff003021300906052b0e03021a050004145e3246e50a4dad079a61f99fa3297c01d802e038\n\n```\nI have a VAG MIB2 with QNX, which uses the metachecksum and signatures. So I feel that if I can emulate the process described, I'd have a go and see where it leads.\n\n",

Not sure what unit the original poster had except it was QNX based but sort of assumed that the keys would be the same. Supplementary question on \"Just modify the parts of the file you need to modify, recalculate the SHA1 and update MetafileChecksum.\". Is there a process that I can do to re signature the file after I have changed it with the same \"public keys\". Thanks.",
