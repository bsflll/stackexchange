  "content": "While reversing a bootloader, i have a lot of msr/mrs instructions, but i cannot find in the arm documentation the meaning of the parameters.\n\nFor example in IDA i have things like :\n\n```\nMSR             #4, c6, c0, #4, X0\n\n```\nor\n\n```\nMSR             #5, #0\n\n```\nCould someone explain how to parse these instructions and point me to the right documentation ?\n\nMaybe there is a script or plugin to automate the process ?\n\n",

      "content": "The presence of X0 and the use of MSR to access a system register tells me that you are on 64-bit ARM / ARMv8.\n\nThe reference manual for this architecture can be found here\n\nSection C6 describes the instructions.  You can find MSR (register) at C6.2.131 and MSR (immediate) at C6.2.130. These both access system control registers.\n\nSection D7 describes the generic ARMv8 system control registers. In D7.2.34 you can find the information that your MSR instruction is accessing the HPFAR_EL2 register which contains the \"Hypervisor IPA Fault Address.\"  (see the table at the bottom of the section that shows the values of op0/op1/CRn/Cm/op2 that correspond to this register.)\n\nThe two instructions you show above are therefore -\n\nMSR HPFAR_EL2, X0\n\nMSR PSTATEField_SP, #0\n\n",
