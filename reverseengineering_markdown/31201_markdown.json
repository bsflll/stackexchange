  "content": "I have a game that has (\"ex: GameGate.exe\") file to open.\nI found out later that file is not responsible for opening the game directly but it's just a gate to open another file (\"ex: GameMain.exe\") internally using the kernel32.CreateProcessInternalA function.\nAlso, I found that file \"GameMain.exe\" among the rest of the game files but when attaching that file to the debugger calls the ExitProcess function after a few steps, so I can't debug that file directly.\n\nBy the way, I am using x64dbg.\n\nHow can I debug that file, is there a way to make me debug that file?\n\n",
