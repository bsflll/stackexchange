  "content": "I am doing some android malware analysis work and downloaded many android samples in virus share, but I found some of them are windows malware e.g. labeled 'win32' or something.\n\nAre these windows malware samples able to execute automatically in my computer even if I didn't add a proper extension name for them e.g '.exe'?\n\nI am afraid it may damage my computer or leak some private data...\n\nThe samples that I downloaded is from this zip file.\n\n\nTo simplify the question that I want to ask is:\nWhether a sample that has no extension name can excute automaticallyï¼Ÿ\n\n",

It usually involves exploiting a known vulnerability within a program which will handle the file in some way. Here are some examples:  \n\n",
