  "content": "I'm working on an iOS target. I'm effectively interested in running the program and its metadata through strings. I've noticed a simple grep does not return expected results and I suspect its because of compressed/binary plist files.\n\nHow can I search trough the IPA and dump the key value pairs from a compressed/binary plist?\n\n",
