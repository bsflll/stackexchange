Sections on disk are usually aligned by 512 bytes which is the traditional size of a disk sector (stored in IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER.FileAlignment). In memory, they are usually page aligned (stored in IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER.SectionAlignment). It allows the loader to apply different memory protection permissions on different sections since permissions are applied on page by page basis. Example: .text can have PAGE_EXECUTE_READ while .data might have PAGE_READONLY permission only, if .data isn't aligned, it's content that fits in the last .text's page will have PAGE_EXECUTE_READ permission instead of PAGE_READONLY.\n\n",
