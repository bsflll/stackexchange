  "content": "I am trying to do some dynamic analysis on a couple of ELF binaries with gdb. However, since those two are directly downloaded (ELF binary file only) with no additional information related to compilation/linking etc., I am not able to set up the proper environment in order to run them within gdb.\n\nIn particular, I am receiving the following errors:\n\nDo you know how could I possibly resolve those issues or what can I do in order to set my environment properly for dynamic analysis?\n\nThank you so much in advance for all of your input.\n\n",
