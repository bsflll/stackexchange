  "content": "While reversing a binary, whatever symbols we name inside IDA IDB database, is it possible to load the same in GDB while debugging? e.g. I tried wsym which attempts to inject those as symbols. However, the project seems to be in too beta to work properly. I want to use pwndbg for debugging, so using IDA's integrated remote debugging support is not really an option.\n\n",

In theory that can be used in gdb to provide symbols.\n\nP.S. according to pwndbg documentation, it already has some kind of \"IDA integraton\", so I'd suggest you to try that and contact the project if you can't get it working.\n\n",
