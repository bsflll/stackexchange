  "content": "I'm trying to understand what an android application is sending over the network and as such am trying to hook into it with Frida, specifically a method called storeKeys .\n\nI was able to perform the Android tutorial from Frida's website, so I know it's working. But when I issue this command, it tells me it hooked 0 functions:\n\n```\nfrida-trace -U -i storeKeys com.vendor.app\n\n```\nI thus fired up apktool to get a readable set of source files and I could find storeKeys in two places. The first is the place where it gets called:\n\n```\n# virtual methods\n.method public a(Ljava/lang/String;)I\n    .locals 2\n\n    const-string v0, \"jwtToken\"\n\n    invoke-static {p1, v0}, Lkotlin/e/b/i;->b(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/String;)V\n\n    .line 20\n    invoke-virtual {p0}, Lcom/vendor/alljoynbridge/provisioning/f;->getProxyObject()Lorg/alljoyn/bus/ProxyBusObject;\n\n    move-result-object v0\n\n    const-class v1, Lcom/vendor/alljoynbridge/provisioning/ProvisioningMediationTransport;\n\n    invoke-virtual {v0, v1}, Lorg/alljoyn/bus/ProxyBusObject;->getInterface(Ljava/lang/Class;)Ljava/lang/Object;\n\n    move-result-object v0\n\n    check-cast v0, Lcom/vendor/alljoynbridge/provisioning/ProvisioningMediationTransport;\n\n    .line 21\n    invoke-interface {v0, p1}, Lcom/vendor/alljoynbridge/provisioning/ProvisioningMediationTransport;->storeKeys(Ljava/lang/String;)S\n\n    move-result p1\n\n    return p1\n.end method\n\n```\nThe second appears to be its declaration:\n\n```\n.class public interface abstract Lcom/vendor/alljoynbridge/provisioning/ProvisioningMediationTransport;\n.super Ljava/lang/Object;\n.source \"ProvisioningMediationTransport.java\"\n\n# interfaces\n.implements Lorg/alljoyn/bus/BusObject;\n\n\n# annotations\n.annotation runtime Lorg/alljoyn/bus/annotation/BusInterface;\n    announced = \"true\"\n    name = \"com.app.standard.infrastructure.api.device.mediation.client\"\n.end annotation\n\n.annotation runtime Lorg/alljoyn/bus/annotation/Secure;\n.end annotation\n\n\n# static fields\n.field public static final INTERFACE_NAME:Ljava/lang/String; = \"com.app.standard.infrastructure.api.device.mediation.client\"\n\n.field public static final OBJ_PATH:Ljava/lang/String; = \"/Provisioning\"\n\n\n# virtual methods\n.method public abstract storeKeys(Ljava/lang/String;)S\n    .annotation system Ldalvik/annotation/Throws;\n        value = {\n            Lorg/alljoyn/bus/BusException;\n        }\n    .end annotation\n\n    .annotation runtime Lorg/alljoyn/bus/annotation/BusMethod;\n        replySignature = \"n\"\n        signature = \"s\"\n    .end annotation\n.end method\n\n```\nWhat I'm most interested in seeing is the content of the String parameter given to storeKeys\n\nIt seems that because the method is virtual abstract, there is nothing for Frida to hook into.\n\nWhat have I missed here?  \nWhat would you suggest that I try next?\n\n",
