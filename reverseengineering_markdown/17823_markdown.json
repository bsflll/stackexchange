  "content": "I'm using dnSpy (version: 4.5.3) to debug a .NET binary. I can successfully view the values of Local variables in the Locals window but I cannot view the values of static fields.\n\nHowever, per this github discussion: https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy/issues/334 for dnSpy, this feature was already added in version 4.0\n\nPlease refer the image below. The locals windows doesn't show the value of Static Fields.\n\n\n\nIs there a way to view them? How can I use the C# Interactive feature of dnSpy to view these values?\n\nThanks.\n\n",
