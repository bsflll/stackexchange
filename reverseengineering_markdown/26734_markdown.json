Since disassemblers search for ASCII characters and nullterminated strings, it could be more difficult to identify the encrypted strings if your encryption generates invalid/unprintable characters or creates an array that is not nullterminated.\n\nYou will need to encrypt the string before compilation and decrypt at runtime.\n\n",

      "content": "One way to kind of easily \"obfuscate\" strings is to store them on the stack.\n\nExample: instead of declaring strings like char string[9] = \"MyString\" you can store them on the stack by declaring them like char string[9] = {0x4d, 0x79, 0x53, 0x74, 0x72, 0x69, 0x6e, 0x67, 0x0}. This way the string will be stored in the .text section insted of the .data section. Which will hide it from the strings view of a smart disassembler or the string dumping tools.\n\n",

Aside from that if the string isn't meant to be writable, it's a rather bad idea to make it writable this way. Aside from that any reverse engineer who is beyond noob level will try to find interesting functions and take it from there. You'd have to store the string bits in some out-of-order array of unsigned ints or so, to hide something. And even that's a rather weak protection. There's a reason security through obscurity is seen as no security at all ...",
