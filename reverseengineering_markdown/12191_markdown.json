  "content": "I'm in the process of learning the Windows API and reversing in general, so I apologize if this is a fairly dumb question. \n\nAfter reading a section of 'Practical Malware Analysis' discussing the Native API  I decided to have a look at some of ntdll.dll's exported functions. I came across the NtLoadDriver which simply loads a specified driver from the registry. \n\nWould this driver exist in user space, or in kernel space? Is it even possible for a non kernel mode driver to exist?\n\nIf it's that simple to load a driver in kernel mode (I'm assuming it's not) then why don't we see more malware in the form of drivers?\n\nAny insight or clarification would be greatly appreciated. \n\n",
