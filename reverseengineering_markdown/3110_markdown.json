  "content": "I have _fgets call in a program I want to debug in IDA. My program receives SIGTTIN while calling it, that's normal. But when I mark to pass SIGTTIN to application, program waits for input in terminal, but neither pressing Enter key, nor Ctrl-D stop reading from input. What should I do to finish the input?\n\n",
