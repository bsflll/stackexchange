      "content": "Let me try to break down what you're asking.\n\nYes, that's correct.  A jailbroken device can access an iOS device's root file system from a shell or any application (such as iFile).  As of iOS 8, the Applications directory has changed to /var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application.\n\nWell, not necessarily.  If the application is running as root (think iFile or Filza), you can have read and write access to any directory on the device.\n\nIn theory, any application can ask to read or write a file to any directory.  This is frequently how jailbreak checks are done in production apps.  If the file manager does not return an error when trying to read from /var/mobile, then you know the application is being run as root on a jailbroken device.\n\n",
