  "content": "So I have DVR with 2*Hi3511RBC CPU: ARM926EJ-Sid(wb) [41069265] revision 5 (ARMv5TEJ) and when I enter U-boot (how do I know that I'm in U-boot ? ) well over UART I get following message\n\n```\nU-Boot 1.1.4 (Nov 17 2008 - 19:48:18)\n\nU-Boot code: E0500000 -> E05174C0  BSS: -> E051E23C\nHI_VERSION=U_BOOT_1_1_4-M06C0303B0301 @Hi3511v110_OSDrv_1_0_0_1 2008-11-03 18:27:45\nRAM Configuration:\nBank #0: e0000000 256 MB\n## Unknown FLASH on Bank 1 - Size = 0x00000000 = 0 MB\nFlash:  0 kB\n*** Warning - bad CRC, using default environment\n\nIn:    serial\nOut:   serial\nErr:   serial\nMAC:   00-00-00-00-00-00\nHit any key to stop autoboot:  1\n\n```\nand I press any key and I get following\n\n```\nhilinux # ?\n?       - alias for 'help'\nbase    - print or set address offset\nbdinfo  - print Board Info structure\nbootm   - boot application image from memory\nbootp   - boot image via network using BootP/TFTP protocol\ncmp     - memory compare\ncp      - memory copy\ncrc32   - checksum calculation\ndhcp    - invoke DHCP client to obtain IP/boot params\necho    - echo args to console\nerase   - erase FLASH memory\nflinfo  - print FLASH memory information\ngo      - start application at address 'addr'\nhelp    - print online help\nloadb   - load binary file over serial line (kermit mode)\nloop    - infinite loop on address range\nmd      - memory display\nmm      - memory modify (auto-incrementing)\nmtest   - simple RAM test\nmw      - memory write (fill)\nnm      - memory modify (constant address)\nping    - send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network host\nprintenv- print environment variables\nprotect - enable or disable FLASH write protection\nrarpboot- boot image via network using RARP/TFTP protocol\nreset   - Perform RESET of the CPU\nsaveenv - save environment variables to persistent storage\nsetenv  - set environment variables\ntftp    - download or upload image via network using TFTP protocol\nversion - print monitor version\n\n```\nthe after some time 10-15 sec. device just reboots and I cant dump content of ram with md.b command so one guy suggested me that I can disable watchdog with mw command when I'm in U-boot so I just need to find which register to alter. I have little experience with this stuff can someone take a look at datasheet and figure out command for this ? Datasheet can be accessed at link https://mega.nz/file/9c4CVK6T#P78EU3Yrt2oUr2El_78M7Bp3EjzNiT8HFtr5HOuUrLw\n\nEdit: Add printenv\n\n```\nhilinux # printenv\nbootargs=mem=32M console=ttyAMA0,115200\nbootcmd=bootm 0xe1000000 0xe1500000\nbootdelay=1\nbaudrate=115200\nethaddr=00:00:00:00:00:00\nipaddr=192.168.1.10\nserverip=192.168.1.1\nnetmask=255.255.255.0\nbootfile=\"uImage\"\nstdin=serial\nstdout=serial\nstderr=serial\nverify=n\n\nEnvironment size: 261/131068 bytes\n\n```\n",

Sry, cant help you with the registers. u-boot has a config option + command option to enable/disable the timer u-boot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/cmd/wdt.html but at least the latter does not seem to be available. It looks like there could be some uboot sources available for your device on some chinese forums. There may be also some alternative ways to get RAM (JTAG) in case your board supports that.",
