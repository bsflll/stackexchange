  "content": "So I'm trying to reassemble an PE to ELF so I can debug it with rr.\n\nHowever masm report duplicate symbol errors. It's because it doesn't enforce scope to it's variables so smart names cause conflicts. If they were postfixed with stack or data offset respectively there wouldn't be such problems.\n\nAlternatively maybe there is a switch in masm which can correct those errors.\n\n```\n; LINE somewhere in the code above\nDest            = byte ptr -404h\nArgs            = byte ptr  10h\n\n; LINE 1058192\n; char Args[]\nArgs            dd ?                    ; DATA XREF: _Caption_Draw:loc_523425\\u2191r\n\n; LINE 2724112\n; char Dest\nDest            db ?                    ; DATA XREF: sub_42DF68+38\\u2191o\n\n```\nApparently there was even a case where Memory was both a local variable and a data reference in the same function.\n\n",
