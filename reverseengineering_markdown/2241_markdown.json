  "content": "Long time ago I noticed that using\n\nin GDB on FreeBSD doesn't really work.\nThis problem occurs very often with some challenges on various Capture The Flag contests.\nFor example, a server will spawn a child which would handle the connection.\nThe child code has a vulnerability which I would like to debug, but gdb just never follows\nthe childs execution and I can't really observe the vulnerability being triggered.\n\nSo far, I've solved this problem in two ways:\n\nThere are some other tricks that can be employed, but these are enough to illustrate my point.\n\nNow I know there have been some limitations on FreeBSD in the past regarding this but has anything improved?\n\nIs there any way to patch GDB to add this functionality? Any suggestions for an easier way of overcoming this?\n\n",

It is imminently useful in many cases, your own included.\n\n```\ndefine assemble\n # dont enter routine again if user hits enter\n dont-repeat\n if ($argc)\n  if (*$arg0 = *$arg0)\n    # check if we have a valid address by dereferencing it,\n    # if we havnt, this will cause the routine to exit.\n  end\n  printf \"Instructions will be written to %#x.  \n\", $arg0\n else\n  printf \"Instructions will be written to stdout.  \n\"\n end\n printf \"Type instructions, one per line.  \n\"\n printf \"End with a line saying just \\\"end\\\".  \n\"\n if ($argc)\n  # argument specified, assemble instructions into memory\n  # at address specified.\n  shell nasm -f bin -o /dev/stdout /dev/stdin \\\n    <<< \"$( echo \"BITS 32\"; while read -ep '>' r && test \"$r\" != end; \\\n                do echo -E \"$r\"; done )\" | hexdump -ve \\\n        '1/1 \"set *((unsigned char *) $arg0 + %#2_ax) = %#02x  \n\"' \\\n            > ~/.gdbassemble\n  # load the file containing set instructions\n  source ~/.gdbassemble\n  # all done.\n  shell rm -f ~/.gdbassemble\n else\n  # no argument, assemble instructions to stdout\n  shell nasm -f bin -o /dev/stdout /dev/stdin \\\n    <<< \"$( echo \"BITS 32\"; while read -ep '>' r && test \"$r\" != end; \\\n                do echo -E \"$r\"; done )\" | ndisasm -i -b32 /dev/stdin\n end\nend\ndocument assemble\nAssemble instructions using nasm.\nType a line containing \"end\" to indicate the end.\nIf an address is specified, insert instructions at that address.\nIf no address is specified, assembled instructions are printed to stdout.\nUse the pseudo instruction \"org ADDR\" to set the base address.\nend\n\n```\n",

He has the exact same problem like I do, and exactly the same motivation for finding a solution.\n\nSo I was digging around some more and it turns out freebsd until recently didn't have support for forks in it's ptrace. There was a patch submitted but I can't really figure out if it's applied. Will try to apply it myself and see if it will start working then. \n\n",
