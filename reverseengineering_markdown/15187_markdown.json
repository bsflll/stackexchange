  "content": "IDA has the following function idc.MakeNameEx which accepts multiple flags values that set properties about the given name (such as whether it's public, auto-generated, etc).\n\nSo far all is good and well, but I would like to do the opposite - get those flag values of a name. I'd like to test if a name is public, weak, auto, etc. but I cant seem to find a idc.NameFlags method anywhere.\n\nAm I missing something or is this functionality unavailable?\n\nThanks\n\n",
