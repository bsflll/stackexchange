  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/3689/how-to-force-ida-to-analyze-a-packed-exe-after-the-program-has-unpacked-itself",
  "content": "I know it is a very newbie question and sorry about that, but I can't really find any way how to make IDA analyze the code after the unpacking was done. What I mean is that when I unpack an exe and dump it to a new exe file (using another software, not IDA), and then load the unpacked exe in IDA, everything works fine (all the API calls are recognized etc). But when I load the unpacked exe in IDA and put a bp on OEP, I just finish with \"unscanned\" code and don't know how to ask IDA to scan it and recognize the API calls. Thank you in advance for any help and tips.\n\n",

It's quite annoying, OllyDbg doesn't have any problems to comment the code after reaching the OEP, so why couldn't Ida automatically do this? Btw. I don't need any unpacking support/plugins, just would like to make Ida reanalyzing the code..",
