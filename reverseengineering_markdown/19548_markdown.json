  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/19548/how-to-get-index-register-from-the-instruction-in-ida",
  "content": "I have the instruction:\n\n```\nadd     edx, ds:dword_7BFC7A50[eax*4]\n\n```\ni.e.\n\n```\nadd     edx, [eax*4+7BFC7A50h]\n\n```\nAnd I decode it via decode_insn(). Then I try to get the information about the second operand. I can get 7BFC7A50 from insn_t.addr, but I can't get any information about  [eax*4]. I mean I expect register number to be in insn_t.ops[1].phrase, but there's an invalid value. And for some reason insn_t.ops[1].type is o_mem, not o_displ.\n\n",
