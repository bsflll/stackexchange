  "content": "I am using IDA pro to follow along a youtube video of RE from OALabs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdNQhfgoQoU&t=1575s\n\nI am facing a problem when i try to put a break point on functions in ntdll, when i double click c:\\windows\\system32  \ntdll.dll in the modules windows I get warning saying \"Module c:\\windows\\system32  \ntdll.dll has no names\". When i right click on c:\\windows\\system32  \ntdll.dll in the modules window and select load debug symbols, it downloads something but I am still not able to see the functions i would like to put break point on like NtResumeThread.\n\nAppreciate any assistance or suggestions. Pic attached for reference.\n\n",

      "text": "Hi and welcome to RE.SE. Wait, what's your problem here? From user mode the Zw* and Nt* functions are literally identical. Just their names differ, entry points to the kernel will be identical. And typically they are exported in pairs, so that's somewhat odd in your case. But still placing a bpx on ZwResumeThread should do the job. Also, your question lacks details such as what exact environment you were running in.",

In kernel mode these functions (of ntoskrnl.exe instead of ntdll.dll) have implementation differences indeed.\n\nYou may want to brush up on Windows internals a bit. This article by Geoff Chappell may help.\n\n",
