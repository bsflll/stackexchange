  "content": "I was reversing some executable and came across to this code:\n\n\n\nAs I found out later, it's using function pointer to call function sub_4011C0 and that could be the reason. \n\nMy question is why does dissambler show this kind of output? why doesn't it recognize the function pointer and call the function twice? thanks.\n\n",

      "content": "In assembly there is only one explicit reference to the target function, and that's where its address is moved to the variable at point 1 (you can see that the reference is marked 'o' (offset) and not 'p' ([procedure] call)). While IDA could in theory track stack var assignments and add xrefs also at the points the variable is used for an indirect call (2 and 3), this:\n\nSo it's better to add only explicit cross-references and let the human decide if extra ones need to be added manually.\n\nThat said, IDA does some limited amount of register tracking to handle the most common situations, e.g.:\n\n```\nmov     esi, ds:__imp__sprintf\npush    edi\nlea     edx, [esp+0BCh+szOffset]\npush    offset Format   ; \"%08X\"\npush    edx             ; Dest\ncall    esi ; __imp__sprintf\n\n```\nYou can see that it added a comment at the call esi instruction with the actual destination loaded earlier into esi. (it also adds a call xref in such case).\n\n",
