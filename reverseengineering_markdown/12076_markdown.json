  "content": "I'm a Olly newbie... whenever I set a breakpoint at an address and found I need to restart the target program, the previously set breakpoints are all removed. Is there anyway to let Olly to remember the breakpoints for certain executable, so that everytime when I want to debug that executable, the previously set breakpoints are still there?\n\n",
