      "content": "Instead of using Immunity Debugger (which is a forked from OllyDbg1.10), you might want to consider using OllyDbg2.0.\n\nOne of the new features in ollydbg 2 is the Debug Child Processes feature shown here:\n\n\n\nWhen this checkbox is on when you start debugging a process, a new instance of ollydbg will automatically start whenever the debugged process creates a new process. This cannot be nested though, as a process started/debugged that way is not started by ollydbg.\n\nAdditionally, you can search for all imported functions, go over them manually and add a breakpoint on each API used to create processes, there shouldn't be more than a few of those.\n\nThen, just let the process run until it hits one of those breakpoints and make the API call create the process in a suspended state (look up the specific API's documentation for the specifics).\n\nYou won't be able to attach to the process (because it's suspended) until it's resumed by calling ResumeThread on the process single thread. there's a common trick here that involves several steps:\n\nKeep in mind that a process might be creating additional threads in the child process, and those might get past the suspension. Use at your own risk :)\n\nThere are ollydbg v1.1 plugins (which means immunity plugins) that will do that for you, but you'll have to find them because I can't recall the name. tuts4you.com is a good place to start.\n\n",
