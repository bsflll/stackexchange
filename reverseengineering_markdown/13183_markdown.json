  "content": "I try to decompile a function that is obfuscated by having split \nup the controlflow into asmblocks scattered around the .text section \nand connected by \"jmpq\" jumps. \n\n```\n<func1>:\n0:    insn..\n1:    jmpq xx100\n2:    callq sub\n3:    jmpq  xx104\n...\n<nonfunc>:\n..\nxx100: insn...\nxx101: jmpq 2\n..\nxx104: insn \n...\n\n```\nIs there a tool/plugin that can reassemble the function code by following the jmpq blocks and appending the chunks? I guess it is not that\ntrivial because you also have to account for relative offsets and patch\nrelocation sections, etc. .\n\n",
