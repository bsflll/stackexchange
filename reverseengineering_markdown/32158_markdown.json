I would like to find an equivalent type of documentation to the following, but for .NET resources:\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/menurc/resourceheader\n\nAs an example, here is a screenshot of four .NET resources in a sample of AgentTesla:\n\n\n\nFocusing on one of them as an example and saving it to a file, in a hex editor, you can see the header and where the PNG data begins. Where is documentation about the specific structure of this header and data?\n\n\n\nFor reference, here is the hash of the file in the screenshots above:\n40cd96e25835eeba956645398ed73a0f0e14563375530fa5f2db3bcf44dd88d7\n\n",

As dotnet's runtime is open-source (dotnet/corert) you can use the constant you provided to find the details within its repository.
