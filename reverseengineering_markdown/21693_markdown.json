  "content": "I'm working on reverse engineering a firmware which I was able to get its functions control flow graphs to display successfully on Ghidra. I am trying to see if there is a way to save those control flow graphs as a text file or something parse able so that I can write a parser for it and use it in my program (I want to recreate the graph programmatically to train my program to detect certain functions). Thank you!\n\n",

      "content": "You can do this using [headless analyser] (https://ghidra.re/ghidra_docs/analyzeHeadlessREADME.html#recursive) script.\n\nCheck out it's usage here. You can find this file in ghidhra/support directory.\n\nThe ghidra api is available here. You can use this api to write custom scripts, either in java or python 2.7.\n\nThen you can do:\n\n```\n./analyzeHeadless /projectloacation projectname -import /binary_location -postscript /yourscript-location -deleteproject\n\n```\nTo run your analysis. This command runs your script on binary by creating a new project and then deleting it later (-deleteproject flag, which is optional).\n\nYou can find a lot of examples in their github repository. e.g. script.\n\nAs you said in your question, if you want to work with functions, you can:\n\n```\nfunctions = currentProgram.getFunctionManager().getFunctions(True)\n\n```\nget the list of functions (in python, changed the syntax if you are using java).\n\n",
