  "content": "I have an old DOS program compiled using Borland C++ (1991 version)\n\nThe end of the executable contains many strings preceded by an underscore which looks like debug/symbol information :\n\neg:  _HandleMemory, _AddKey, _SetPalette, ...\n\nMost of these strings seems to be functions or variables names.\n\nHowever once the exe is opened in IDA, that information is not used, most functions are simply named this way (except some known C functions like _qsort) :\n\n```\nsub_XXXXX\n\n```\nIs there a way to import that info back to IDA ?\n\n",

      "text": "The year 1991 pegs this as Turbo C++ 1.0 or thereabouts, and it is indeed very likely that the tail data in question is Borland-style debug info (16-bit TDS format). Experiments show that the available IDA freewares - 3.7 through 5.0 - do not recognise the 16-bit Borland debug info. If the debug info is stripped into a separate TDS file (via tdstrip.exe) then you get a rejection message in the output window for those versions that can deal with TDS in principle but expect the newer 32-bit format (as of BOA 4.0 and beyond). Same for the 'Load TDS' menu item, if present.",
