  "content": "How do I call the user_cmts_* functions from the IDAPython API? I am quite new to the SDK and IDAPython, so I'm kind of lost as to what I'm supposed to pass to these functions, as it's not the user-friendliest docs imo. I tried passing a map as such for user_cmts_begin:\n\n```\nimport idaapi\n\ndef print_cmt(cmt):\n   print cmt\n\ncumap = map(print_cmt, [some address here to test])\n\nidaapi.user_cmts_begin(cumap)\n\n```\nBut it throws a type error, so obviously I must be doing something wrong...\n\nFor now I've had to resort to doing this:\n\n```\nimport idaapi\nimport re\n\naddr = 0x80000000\n\nwhile addr < 0x80200000:\n    cmt = idaapi.get_cmt(addr, 0) # get non-repeatable comment at current address/line\n\n    if cmt is not None: # skip if the line has no comment\n        if re.search(\"insert regex for non-auto-generated comments here\", cmt) is not None:\n            print \"%08X: %s\" % (addr, cmt)\n\n    addr = idaapi.next_not_tail(addr)\n\n```\nThe IDAPython docs can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idapython_docs/\n\nCould someone show an example?\n\n",

      "content": "You might want to use the IDAPython wrapper functions. As you mentioned, the IDA API is quite poorly documented. One of the best, but not easiest way to actually understand it is to check the IDAPython wrapper library in your IDA/Python/idc.py folder. \n\nBased on what I've seen in the idc.py file, there's some functions you might want to check out to help you out. \n\n```\nMakeComm(ScreenEA(), \"Comment Test\")\n\n```\n```\nMakeRptCmt(ScreenEA(), \"Repeatable Comment\")\n\n```\nSpecify 1 to get the repeatable comment or 0 to get the normal comment as the second argument. Note that the function CommentEx is a wrapper around GetCommentEx.\n\n```\nc = GetCommentEx(ScreenEA(), 1)\nprint(c)\n\n```\nOr even easier is to use Comment(ea) or RptCmt(ea), which are wrappers onGetCommentEx():\n\n```\ndef Comment(ea):                return GetCommentEx(ea, 0)\n\"\"\"Returns the regular comment or None\"\"\"\n\ndef RptCmt(ea):                 return GetCommentEx(ea, 1)\n\"\"\"Returns the repeatable comment or None\"\"\"\n\n```\nAnd then you have all the special functions to retrieve comments from specific structures such as Enums, Functions, Constants...I don't believe I have seen a specific function to retrieve all comments, but it's fairly easy to build, as you did:\n\nI've made this code that looks for lines containing a 'jump: 0x???' comment/repeatable comments. Not the best code (slow), but it illustrates the use of the IDA Python comments functions.\n\n```\ndef get_comments(_startea, _endea, _filter):\n    matches = []\n    ea = _startea\n    for ea in range(_startea, _endea):\n        cmt1 = Comment(ea)\n        cmt2 = RptCmt(ea)\n        cmt = \"\"\n        if cmt1:\n            cmt += cmt1\n        if cmt2:\n            cmt += cmt2\n        if (cmt):\n            re_match = re.match(_filter, cmt, re.I)\n            if (re_match and len(re_match.groups()) > 0):\n                matches.append(re_match.group(3))\n    return matches\n\nMakeComm(ScreenEA(), 'jump: 0xBADC0DE')\nfilter = r'(.*)(jump: 0x)([0-9a-fA-F]+)(.*)'\naddrs = get_comments(MinEA(), MaxEA(), filter)\n\n```\n",
