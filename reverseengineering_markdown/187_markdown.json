  "content": "I've seen numerous examples of people essentially dissolving away the resin from integrated circuits in boiling high strength acid in order to expose the raw silicon chip underneath. My general understanding is that this has, from time to time, allowed for attackers to determine 'secret' information like crypto keys and the like. \nIn addition, undocumented functionality can be determined and unlocked by doing this in some cases. \n\nHow can one go about 'reading data' from raw silicon? What kind of other benefits can you obtain from hardware level reverse engineering?\n\n",
