  "content": "As part of my work, I'm debugging a malware found and his behavior is pretty basic after execution:\n\nNow one issue i was thinking about, is the fact i dont know what the EntryPoint is so i dont know what part of the memory bytes i would change to EB FE (JMP < ToSelf >) To be able to debug the process from the start\n\nOnce the new process is created and im attaching a debugger to it - OLLYDbg for that case (And the process is on Pause state) Pressing F8 - step over causing the application to have a huge delay of like 10 seconds untill the Opcode is finished - which makes no sense.\nAlso if i watch the newly created process on Sysinternals - ProcessExplorer I can see that after i press F8 the CPU usage of that process is very high 50-90 for all that time, until the opcode is finished. Which also results in all of the computer to run very slowly\n\nWhat could cause that? and how would i be able to bypass that?\n\nIt does not happen if i dont debug the process.\n\n",
