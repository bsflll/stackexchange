In an EXE, \nit   holds the actual size of the code or data. This is the size \nbefore   rounding up to the nearest file alignment multiple. The   \nSizeOfRawData field (seems a bit of a misnomer) later on in the   \nstructure holds the rounded up value. The Borland linker reverses   \nthe meaning of these two fields and appears to be correct. For OBJ   \nfiles, this field indicates the physical address of the section. The      \nfirst section starts at address 0. To find the physical address in   \nan OBJ file of the next section, add the SizeOfRawData value to the   \nphysical address of the current section.  \n\n```\n",
