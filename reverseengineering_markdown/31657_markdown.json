  "content": "I am analyzing some malware on Windows 10. I installed FLARE VM, disabled tamper protection and disabled the virus scanner in the registry. However when I attempt to run a malware, Windows is still preventing me from running it. What am I missing to get this to work?\n\nI disabled it by adding DisableAntiSpyware toHKLM/Software/Policies/Microsoft/Windows Defender and setting it to 1.\n\n\n",

I did try Windows 11 and on 11 even with everything off Windows 11 still removes it from the machine. I had to add it to allowed threats. But it does not move itself to another folder like it should. I have a feeling it might just not work correctly on newer OSes.",
