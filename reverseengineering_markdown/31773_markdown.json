      "content": "The answer to this question is to simply use Hex-Rays instead of IDA. It automatically does everything you've suggested, and the end result is the function's prototype, which will indicate register arguments in standard and non-standard locations.\n\nIf you don't want to do that, then the answer is to re-implement everything that Hex-Rays does in the course of producing that information: namely, prolog analysis, data flow analysis, and call analysis.\n\n",
