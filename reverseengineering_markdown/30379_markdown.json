The console version of this tool (dnSpy.Console.exe) works on all platforms via mono.\n\nFor deobfuscation of most standard obfuscators, de4dot will help. Supported obfuscators/packers enumerated in README.\nIt should be noted that dnSpy supports the debugger with which you can unpack most non-standard packers by hands.\n\n",
