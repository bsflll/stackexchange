To archieve it I need to install drivers, but brother only provide x86 and x64 drivers, any way to do it?

What you are looking for, in effect, could be done with code lifting (or as described in the single answer existing at this point). Code lifting has a huge potential for reverse engineers and could - in theory - be used to re-target binaries.",

Basically it will be running a small x86 virtual machine with that driver loaded and passing the USB device directly through to the VM. Then you can set something up to let the Raspberry Pi host send print jobs into the VM (e.g. through a listening lpr/CUPS server).\n\n",
