      "content": "The classes 0, 1, 2 and 3 show patterns matching that of binscure, not Allatori. There are multiple open issues for java-deobfuscator on adding support for binscure, but there is no active development on the deobfuscator repo.\n\nAdditionally if you look around you'll find some code that looks like:\n\n```\nmethod public static a (Lcom/bC; a)Lcom/bC;\n    getstatic 1.20 I\n    ifge A\n    invokedynamic while ()V handle H_INVOKESTATIC java/yeet.\\u0020̸̸̷͔̻̠̖̼̖̅̍ͭ̈̋ͩ̈́͊̏ͬͬ̆̀̋̍͐͛ͣ͘|̔̽̔ͥ̆̑̀ͨ̈̒̿҉̪͙̭̠̻̹̗͍͇̞̟͙̫̝̟̀\\u0020̸̥͔̭͈̈̈̾ͮ̃̾̾͛̀̍͐ͦ̾ͨ̍̉̓̈̚͝͝s̷ͨ̂̇ͨ̓́̋͗̈̒̑ͩ̆͊͏̩̯̩̙̝̯̣̪͉̳̘e̡͋̋̄̄ͧ̃ͪͨ͠͡҉̪̱̥̤͇̹͔͎̫͔̯͜ (I)V args  end\n    invokedynamic fuck ()B handle H_INVOKESTATIC a.a (IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII)Ljava/lang/Throwable; args  end\n    pop\nA:\n    aload a\n    areturn\nB:\nend\n\n```\nThe yeet/fuck names are hardcoded names used by some of binscure's transformers.\n\nSo yeah, this isn't Allatori. What are your options (at the time of writing this)?\n\nBe VERY careful when using narumii's deobfuscator. Only use it in a virtual machine, since it actually will attempt to load the classes to \"sandbox\" some of the decryption logic.\n\n",
