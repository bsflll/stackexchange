      "content": "Did you miss the two underscores in this function? Most Google results show that it should be __vbaVarIndexLoad.\n\nIf so, it is a function reserved for internal use and you shouldn't care too much about it. Judging by its name it probably pushes a variable on the VM stack by the index.\n\nWhile working with Visual basic programs, you should check if it is p-code compiled or native code compiled, then choose correct tools, since usually you don't want to reverse the whole VM.\n\n",
