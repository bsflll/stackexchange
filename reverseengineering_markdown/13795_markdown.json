      "content": "Yes, according to the documentation there's an additional API supported by LocationManager, called requestSingleUpdate that can be used to receive a single location update.\n\nSince both requestSingleUpdate and requestLocationUpdates use overloading and have multiple prototypes (and thus implementations) please make sure to hook and support them all.\n\nAs a side note, there are ways (that require user interaction) to add a test LocationProvider that can spoof locations through the API. see this for example.\n\n",
