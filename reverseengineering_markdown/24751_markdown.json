  "content": "I would like to know how to change the read destination of the data in the game.\n\nI now want to modify the player data and fonts in a psx baseball game.\n\nHowever, the player data in the target game(called jikkyou powerful pro yakyuu premium ban) has a compressed data file (P_SC_M.BIN) and an uncompressed data file (P_SEL.BIN), and the one that is loaded in the game is compressed. \n\nI can modify uncompressed data, but I can't modify compressed data.\n\nSo, in this case, I would like to know how to change the in-game data read destination from compressed data to uncompressed data.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any hints or information about useful tools.\n\nThank you.\n\n",
