  "content": "I need to rename some memory address \"names\" in IDAPython. I'm talking about the dword_805672 formatted ones. Please see the screenshot below:\n\n\n\nI've placed red boxes around the names which I would like to rename with IDAPython. I've searched the API docs and I came up with: idc.MakeName(ea,name) however, as you can see, this only placed a name in the spots labeled dynamic_1, dynamic_2 and so on. I want to rename the actual operand.\n\n",

      "content": "idc.MakeName should be the correct api command. I'm assuming that you did something like idc.MakeName(0x123772cd, 'dynamic_3') instead of doing the make name on the actual dword in the instruction.\n\nSomething like this should be done instead:\n\nidc.MakeName(idc.GetOperandValue(0x123772cd, 0), 'dynamic_3')\n\nIn this case idc.GetOperandValue will return the value of the zeroth operand (ie. 0x123ef5e0). That address will then be labeled 'dynamic_3' and IDA should update the UI to show the change. \n\n",
