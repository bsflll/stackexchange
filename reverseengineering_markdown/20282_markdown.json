  "content": "I have a function of the format:\n\n```\nsub_ABCDEF(&global, \"stringName\", unimportantValue)\n\npush    offset string\nmov     ecx, offset global\ncall    sub_410010\n\n```\nThat is called in several places, each varying the &global and string location.\n\nI am wondering if it's possible in IDAPython to bulk rename all the &global's to the string value.\n\nI used XrefsTo(410010, 0) to obtain a list of places the function is called from, but I am unsure how to get the parameters it was called with.\n\n",
