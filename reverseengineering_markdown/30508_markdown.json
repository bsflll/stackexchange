      "content": "As we know there are limitations to using watchpoints: there are a finite amount of watchpoints permitted per architecture (typically 4) and the “watched” size of memory usually caps out at 8 bytes. Therefore, it is important to delete them after they are no longer needed.\n\nYou can delete a watchpoint in lldb using the watchpoint delete command and passing the watchpoint ID as an argument.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n(lldb) watchpoint delete 1\n1 watchpoints deleted.\n\n```\nOr we can use,\n\n```\n(lldb) w delete 1\n1 watchpoints deleted.\n\n```\nTo delete all watchpoints - simply omit the last argument.\n\n",
