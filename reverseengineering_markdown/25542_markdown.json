      "content": "In a nutshell, stripping a binary means removing sections containing symbol and debug information from the file. These sections lie at the end of the binary, separate from the code. Removing this information has no bearing on the code itself, so the locations of functions in the file (their file offsets) will be the same after stripping the binary. Function addresses (their location in virtual memory), on the other hand, may either be hardcoded or position independent; it depends on how the binary was compiled (this is also unaffected by stripping symbol info).\n\nFinding the boundaries of functions in stripped binaries is an undecidable problem, but workarounds and heuristics exist, such as a signature-based approach to function detection. Here are some examples:\n\nHere is an interesting article on the subject: Architecture Agnostic Function Detection in Binaries\n\n",
