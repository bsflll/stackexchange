The target and host machine are Windows.\nI can run the process on the remote machine and debug it with IDA using remote debugging but I need that the process will run with high privileges.\nIn IDA I only have the option start the process (F9 or the green play button) but it doesn't run it with high privileges.\n\nHow can I do it?\n\nI searched also in the options of the debugger and didn't see such option.\n\n",

I checked on Procmon and when I run it with privileges local on the system it call RegSetValue for some keys while with the remove debugging it doesn't happen although now it runs with High integrity. Oh, maybe it identify when I use the debugger.. I will need to check it.",
