  "content": "I need some help in decrypting the file config.bin generated by the page backup_setting.html from Huawei B5328 router.\n\nI have access to all files in the router, even the www files hosted on the www folder for the router. After analyzing the page backup_setting.html and checking the JavaScript .js files, I think someone who understands the JavaScript and some coding language will be able to encrypt and decrypt the config file easily.\n\nThe reason why I'm asking is that I want to enable telnet for this router from the WebUI, and I think it can be done through JavaScript or config file restore or maybe CGI command.\n\nHere is the link for all files including backup_setting.html and the whole\nwww folder is posted [here][1], you can get the .js files etc.\n\nThanks for helping.\n\nYou were correct, analyzing the file  maintenance.cgi  gets this :\n\n```\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0             0x0             ELF, 32-bit MSB executable, ARM, version 1 (SYSV)\n67144         0x10648         Unix path: /var/tmp/update_info\n68293         0x10AC5         Unix path: /var/config/ucfg_config.xml\n68975         0x10D6F         Unix path: /var/config/ucfg_config.xml\n71140         0x115E4         XML document, version: \"1.0\"\n71741         0x1183D         HTML document header\n71804         0x1187C         HTML document header\n78624         0x13320         XML document, version: \"1.0\"\n81900         0x13FEC         PEM RSA private key\n\n```\nNow, assuming I have the decrypted config file, if I encrypt this file into  config.bin file, I think it should work.\n\nCan someone help into decrypting or encrypting the file in the correct format? Thanks.\n\nAnalyzing a piece of code of maintenace.cgi gives the encrypt and decrypt cmd used :\n\n```\n No Command [WebUpd]%s, recive file error case Parameters Abnormal.

      "content": "Unfortunately, knowledge of JS probably isn't going to help. The HTML passes along the uploaded file to the cgi-bin/maintenance.cgi file which is a compiled ARM BE8 binary that's a bit more work to analyze than just looking at some javascript.\n\nAfter a very brief look, there is an RSA public/private key pair embedded in the binary that might be useful for extracting the contents of the config. \n\nThat said, I'm not sure that decrypting the config will necessarily get you what you want. You might actually have everything you need already. For example, there's a ton of calls to system inside those files. There's a decent chance that you could use one of those to get command-injection on the router to enable a terminal that way.\n\nAnd even that might actually be overkill if the router itself listens on telnet as a part of its bootup process which is fairly common.\n\nFinally, there appears to be a telnet enabled config you can load from the backup_setting.html page as there is a snippet there that references a config with telnet in the name. In fact, that's the only mention of telnet in all the files, so there's not likely some default intended way to enable it via the built in binaries. \n\n```\n        if(filename.match(\"(.*)telnet(.*).bin\") == null){\n            AlertBlock('The router will restart after you restore it to the backup settings.Are you sure you want to import the config?','preConfigImport()','refreshpage()');\n\n```\n",
