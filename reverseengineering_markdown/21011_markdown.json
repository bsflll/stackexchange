  "content": "I am trying to solve a GUI based crackme. https://crackmes.one/crackme/5c68758633c5d4776a837cc4 so that I learn security. I want to set a conditional Break point on user32.CallWindowProcA. Microsoft Documents this function as follows\n\n```\nLRESULT CallWindowProcA(\n  WNDPROC lpPrevWndFunc,\n  HWND    hWnd,\n  UINT    Msg,\n  WPARAM  wParam,\n  LPARAM  lParam\n);\n\n```\nI set the following conditional break points for WM_LBUTTONDOWN (0x202) as follows. But they are not being hit when I click the button :( help\n\n```\nType     Address  Module/Label/ State   Disassembly                            Hits Summary                                              \nSoftware                                                                            \n         0041A995 crackme-4.exe Enabled push ebp                               3255 sub_41a995 ?dialogProc?, breakif(arg.get(1) == 0x202)\n         0041B9A2 crackme-4.exe Enabled call dword ptr ds:[<&CallWindowProcA>] 1713 breakif((1:[esp+0xc] == 0x202) )\n         0041F086 crackme-4.exe Enabled call dword ptr ds:[<&CallWindowProcA>] 0    breakif((1:[esp+0xc] == 0x202))\n         0041F11B crackme-4.exe Enabled call dword ptr ds:[<&CallWindowProcA>] 273  breakif((1:[esp+0xc] == 0x202))\n         00437E9E crackme-4.exe Enabled mov byte ptr ss:[ebp-4],21             0    \n         749055C0 user32.dll    Enabled mov edi,edi                            636  breakif(arg.get(1) == 0x202)\n\n```\nI have read through and tried \nx64dbg - Conditional breakpoint based on function argument but i could not get it to work for me.\n\n",
