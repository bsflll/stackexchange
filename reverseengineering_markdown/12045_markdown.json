      "content": "I don't think it is a different result, only a different representation.\nThe radare2 output tells you at which absolute address will the jump take you (in this case 0x004044e0), while the rasm2 output tells you how far from the current address (in this case 0x0040425f) will the jump take you.\n\nTo make it more clear: Your current instruction starts at address 0x0040425f, while your destination address is 0x004044e0. If you substitute the two addresses you get: 0x004044e0 - 0x0040425f = 0x00000281, which is the parameter to the jump in the rasm2 tool.\n\nAlso, the opcode 0x0F 0x84 stands for JE rel16/rel32 and since you haven't specified at which address your instruction 0f847b020000 resides the rasm2 tool is correctly telling you that it is 0x281 bytes from wherever the instruction is: parameter_value(0x0000027b) + instruction_length(0x06) = 0x00000281\n\n",
