  "content": "I'm trying to RE a program which has a limit of n iterations.\nI already found the interesting part in the disasembled code with static analysis and analysis with the local win32 debugger.\n\nThere seems to be a correlation between being BELOW / ABOVE the limit\nand a number.\n\nWhile I'm below the limit the value is set to 1.0. \nIf I go above the limit of the value keeps being 0.0\n\nA mouseover tells me the \"magic\" value.\n\n\n\nNow I have two problems:\n\n\n\nManual check\n\nESP = 0x0072EB40\n\nvar_838 = -0x838\n\n\n\nputting it all together: \n0x0072EB40 + 0x880 - 0x838 => 0x0072EB88\n\nCan someone help me out please and tell me what my error is?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",
