  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/19598/find-base-address-and-memory-size-of-program-debugged-in-gdb",
  "content": "I want to find out the base address and the imagesize of the program being debugged in gdb. As in, where it got loaded in memory. For shared libraries I can do \"info sharedlibrary\"  and I get very nice output like so:\n\n```\n0x00007ffff7dd5f10  0x00007ffff7df4b20  Yes         /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2\n\n```\nHow can i get this output for the main program i am debugging?\n\nI know that gdb disables ASLR and I could just inspect the ELF file myself to find out, but there has to be a way via gdb too. \n\n(Background: I am using gdb's mi, and I can keep a basic overview of where things are by parsing sharedlibrary-load messages. But it never sends such a message for the main program, which is the most important thing.)\n\nThanks!\n\n",
