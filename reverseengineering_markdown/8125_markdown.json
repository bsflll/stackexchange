  "content": "You have the IDA View and Hex View right. When on IDA View you select an instruction you can see the instruction selected in Hex View as well. However, if you select a \"data instruction\" like \"Format          = dword ptr -10h\" which is a stack variable, you don't see it in the hex view. It doesn't select the bytes corresponding to the variable definition. I mean I know the variable is going to be there in memory but somewhere on the hex view should tell me \"hey allocate this stack variable\" but it doesn't.\n\nIt's probably obvious by now, I'm a beginner in reverse engineering, I've been reading the book from http://beginners.re/ . While I do know some assembly and have been able to reverse simple things, I have these knowledge gaps I'd like to fill. Thank you!\n\n",

However in memory there are 2 more segments that don't exist in the module's space address, which is stack and heap. I thought the variables in the data segment(module's address space) were loaded to the stack, so I know where they come from, but what about these stack variables that aren't defined anywhere in the program, how do they end up in the stack? Thank you.",

Similarly, the program's code may create multiple heap memory regions in the process's address space. The variables in the data segment are global variables (not stack variables); they are not automatically loaded onto the stack. Stack variables (also known as local function variables) are written to and read from the stack at runtime by the functions to which they belong.",

Sometimes the compiler overlays local variables on the stack space occupied by function parameters, if it doesn't need those anymore (i.e. when they're past their live ranges).

It's a declaration that allows it to put a meaningful name to stack references, even though the stack pointer keeps fluctuating (at least in 32-bit mode). IDA does it by picking a fixed frame of reference (usually the return address) and accounting for the current value of ESP with a literal number, e.g. push [esp+4+foobar] if the 'logical' stack pointer has a value of 4 currently. That way one and the same stack location always gets the same name; otherwise it would be [esp] in one place and [esp+10h] in another.",
