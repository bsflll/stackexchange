  "content": "I want to generate all xrefs from function just to check what api it uses in its call-tree. I know I can generate call tree graph by right clicking on function name and \"Xrefs from\", but I would like to have this functions listed just as text or something like that, so I could read it easily.\n\nReading it from WinGraph is pretty hard, and I have trouble with this nasty colors..\nI mean, how is it readable? It is really hard to read white text on cyan background. And I dont see any way to configure it. My eyes just cant stand looking at it.\n\nSo how can I get this xrefs in some friendly format? I am sure it is possible.. \nI am using IDA 6.1 \n\nThanks in advance\n\n",
