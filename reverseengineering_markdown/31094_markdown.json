  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/31094/how-to-use-ida-pro-to-convert-a-batch-of-binary-pe-files-into-assembly-code",
  "content": "Currently, I'm generating a bunch of .idb files in a batch via idaw.exe -B <FILE>. (I'm using IDA Pro 6.8.) This process also creates many .asm files - one for each .idb file created. I don't need these files, so they just get ignored/deleted.\n\nIs there a way to generate .idb files from the command line without also generating the .asm files?\n\n",

      "content": "At the bottom of the help page you can see the following:\n\nI.e. the actual analysis and writing of .asm is done by analysis.idc. Looking into it, we can see:\n\n```\nstatic main()\n{\n  // turn on coagulation of data in the final pass of analysis\n  set_inf_attr(INF_AF, get_inf_attr(INF_AF) | AF_DODATA | AF_FINAL);\n  // .. and plan the entire address space for the final pass\n  auto_mark_range(0, BADADDR, AU_FINAL);\n\n  msg(\"Waiting for the end of the auto analysis...  \n\");\n  auto_wait();\n\n  msg(\"  \n  \n------ Creating the output file.... --------  \n\");\n  auto file = get_idb_path()[0:-4] + \".asm\";\n\n  auto fhandle = fopen(file, \"w\");\n  gen_file(OFILE_ASM, fhandle, 0, BADADDR, 0); // create the assembler file\n  msg(\"All done, exiting...  \n\");\n  qexit(0); // exit to OS, error code 0 - success\n}\n\n```\nSo just make your own copy of the script, remove the part writing out .asm file (gen_file call), and run IDA with your own script:\n\nida -c -A -Smyanalysis.idc -Lida.log input-file\n\n",
