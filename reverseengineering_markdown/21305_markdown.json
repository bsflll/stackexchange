  "content": "Loading the source into IDA, I have this function:\n\n\n\nAccording to the source for Lua, this function should be passed a pointer to the Lua_State struct:\n\n```\nLUA_API int lua_gettop (lua_State *L) {\n  return cast_int(L->top - L->base);\n}\n\n```\nI'm currently trying to figure out what pointer is being passed to this procedure (In this case arg_0). I can attach a breakpoint and it correctly breaks, but how would I find the associated .data location for where it's stored?\n\n",
