It seems that this is heavily related to the segment registers %fs, %gs, %cs, %ss, %ds, %es. \n\nCan somebody explain how these registers are used, both, in user and kernel-land programs ?\n\n",

I don't know about linux, but as you later pointed out in your answer, NT still use segments, for protection (on x86 at least). Privilege levels, or rings, are linked to segments. Hence the subdivision of the address space in (at least) four segments. The address space still look like 4gb flat, but the lower 2 (or 3) GB are one segment with ring 3 access, the upper 2(or 1) is a segment with ring 0 access.",

      "content": "FS points to the exception handling chain, CS and DS are filled from the OS with code and data segment. SS is the battery/stack segment. From what I remember, GS and ES are free.\nIt shouldn't matter much if kernel or user mode (they are used by some instructions like XLAT, MOVS, and some others, so you have to use them in the same way), but just in case I'm talking about programming in user space.\n\nI had not noticed before, but you're using the notation %fs, not FS, so probably you're meaning Linux, which is another story (also you could be more clear on protected/real mode). You can see also from other answers on stackexchange that linux apparently gives you, in FS and GS, 'thread local storage' and 'processor data area'. CS, DS, and SS should still be code/data/stack.\n\nFor the sake of the argument, I have no idea how on a Mac you use those registers.\n\nFor 64 bit it depends: if not in compatibility mode (where you can execute 64 and 32 bit code) then DS, ES, and SS are ignored, and instructions like POP SS give an error. There is no segmentation (the memory model is flat), there should be no real mode (but I think you only mean protected mode?), and if I'm not wrong there isn't hardware task switching.\nThere are further details on CS, FS, and GS (expecially the hidden part) in 64 bit mode, but since it's not used often maybe it's better to omit them.\n\nYou can check the manuals for the AMD family of processors especially in the case of 64 bit legacy mode:\nhttp://developer.amd.com/resources/documentation-articles/developer-guides-manuals/\n\n",
