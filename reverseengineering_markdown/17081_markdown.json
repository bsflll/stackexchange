      "content": "To quote from the \"X86 Assembly book\" in WikiBooks:  \n\nIn other words, EIP tells the computer where to go next to execute the next command and controls the flow of a program.\n\nThis simple example shows the automatic addition to eip at every step (source):\n\n```\neip+1      53                push    ebx\neip+4      8B 54 24 08       mov     edx, [esp+arg_0]\neip+2      31 DB             xor     ebx, ebx\neip+2      89 D3             mov     ebx, edx\neip+3      8D 42 07          lea     eax, [edx+7]\n.....\n\n```\nTo spot EIP in OllyDbg you just have to look at the right panel and you'll find where EIP is pointing to. \n\n\n\nSo, in your example EIP = 0x51BDE1, thus the address of the next instruction  will be 0x51BDE1. From the sentence you quoted, it seems like the writer want you to do something on this address. By default, OllyDbg would show you EIP in the disassembly window so it would be easy to spot it.\n\n",
