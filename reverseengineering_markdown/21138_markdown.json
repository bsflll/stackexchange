  "content": "I have implemented a basic coverage guided fuzzer that is sending inputs to programs accepting ONE command line argument or ONE standard input. I am trying to find a complex code to fuzz that can meet my requirements:\n\nI have tried finding open source projects but they are not meeting my requirements.\n\nIf someone knows how can I go about finding one please let me know OR if you are aware of such a code then also please let me know. \n\nP.S. I do not want to write my own buggy code. \n\n",

Prove it.\n\nIf this particular suite of binaries is not to your liking, I recommend reading the paper The Art, Science, and Engineering of Fuzzing: A Survey, which includes 240 references. If the paper does not discuss fuzzer benchmark suites, some of the cited papers surely will.\n\nAn additional option is to examine fuzzer-related repositories on github such as Google's fuzzer test suite.\n\nIf no existing test suites meet your specific, particular requirements, then either a) change your requirements or b) create your own test suite.\n\n",
