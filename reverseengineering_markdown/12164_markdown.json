  "content": "Has anybody gotten Immunity Debugger to work on windows 10 yet? I downloaded it on Windows 10, launch it as administrator, and the GUI opens for about half a second and then it exits, no errors or messages. I have python installed, I reinstalled immunity multiple times, and I tried running it in Windows 7 compatibility mode. Nothing seems to work. My theory is that some dll is missing or changed. Any ideas or is it just my computer? Also, Ollydbg does work on 10, but I find Immunity debugger more useful.\n\n",
