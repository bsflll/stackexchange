      "content": "It corresponds to calculating mesh_indices[i] / 2. The formula it's implementing is f(v) = (v - (v >> 31)) >> 1, with the shifts being arithmetic (i.e. the most significant bit is preserved). Implementing the operation this way respects the signedness of the original value. What is quite surprising here is that this is a miscompilation, as mesh_indices[i] is unsigned - the formula being implemented should simply be f(v) = v >> 1 (logical shift). For example, msvc correctly implements it in such a manner: https://godbolt.org/z/MGsYqTG13\n\n",

You can work through the formulas for e.g. eax=0xFFFFFFFF and see that the more complicated formula will return zero, while only shifting to the right will return 0x7FFFFFFF.
