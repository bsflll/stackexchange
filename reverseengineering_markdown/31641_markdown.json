  "content": "Right now I have a obfuscated driver, that in order to call something like KeDelayExecutionThread, it does the following:\n\n```\nmov     rax, cs:KeDelayExecutionThrea\nlea     r8, [rsp+28h+arg_0]\nxor     edx, edx\nxor     ecx, ecx\ncall    cs:trampolineFunction_Address  \n\n```\nand:\n\n```\ntrampolineFunction_Address dq offset trampolineFunction\n \ntrampolineFunction proc near\njmp     rax\ntrampolineFunction endp\n\n```\nSo it just pushes the destination function in rax, and calls this trampolineFunction indirectly using call    cs:trampolineFunction_Address.\n\nThe problem is, in the decompiled output, every call is now shown as trampolineFunction_Address( ... ) :\n\n```\nif ( trampolineFunction_Address(&v34, 1i64, &v22, v31, 0i64, v13, v16) >= 0 )\n        {\n          *&v20 = trampolineFunction_Address(v7, v6, v8, v9, v11, v14, v17);\n          if ( trampolineFunction_Address(&v33, 64i64, &v27, &v20, v12, v15, v18) >= 0 )\n...\n\n```\nSo how can I make IDA's decompiler to show me the correct function name?\n\nNote that for example, KeDelayExecutionThread in above assembly is basically the address of KeDelayExecutionThread, which this rootkits resolves during initialization and puts it in its data section, and as you can see after I renamed that address to that, IDA correctly knows the function definition:\n\n```\n.data:FFFFF80019E5F000 ; NTSTATUS (*KeDelayExecutionThread)(KPROCESSOR_MODE WaitMode, BOOLEAN Alertable, PLARGE_INTEGER Interval)\n.data:FFFFF80019E5F000 KeDelayExecutionThread dq 0FFFFF8001A2CFB30h\n\n```\n",
