  "content": "I have a binary compiled in Rh850 using green hills compiler from the looks. Luckily, it still symbols attached ,but I am struggling to read the symbols and it is worth my time to demangle them. Is there a script or better yet a rule set that I can extract somehow to start this process? I am wanting to avoid the whole compiling binaries until I solve all the symbols myself.\n\nI assume there is a symbol conversion table or something documented somewhere, but either will be great.\n\nI found a couple of scripts, but they are very incomplete.\n\nhttps://github.com/Chadderz121/ghs-demangle\n\nhttps://github.com/jackwakefield/ghs-demangler\n\n",
