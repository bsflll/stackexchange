  "content": "Right now I'm looking at an office document (most likely rtf based on it exploiting equation editor) that opens just fine when you double click it, but on further examination in a hex editor and in entropy analysis is technically encrypted, even without a password. It seems as thought the workbook is protected, and I'm not sure how to access the cleartext version of the document\n\nI need to know which vulnerability the document targets to determine coverage, but I don't know how to remove it.\n\nHow do I remove the \"protection\" from the workbook so I can save it without knowing the password? Trying password crackers \"works\" but it seems to corrupt the file such that I can't save it as cleartext to examine it's internals.\n\nI should mention that this is an .xlsx file.\n\n",
