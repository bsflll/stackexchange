  "content": "Since React Native 0.60.4 developers can opt-in to use the Hermes JS Engine. This generates an index.android.bundle binary that contains Hermes JS bytecode.\n\nThe Hermes documentation mentions hbcdump which is described as a \"Hermes bytecode disassembler\"\n\nBy using hbcdump -pretty-disassemble -c disassemble -out out.txt index.android.bundle I do get something that is at least a little more human readable but it does not look like it can be compiled back again and is not easy to work with.\n\nHow can I decompile Hermes JS bytecode into JavaScript?\nAlternatively: How can I modify the bytecode? Is there a tool that understands this bytecode?\n\n",
