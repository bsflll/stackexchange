      "content": "Like others have said, you might have to take the hardware route, and physically connect a Bus Pirate or similar device to dump the firmware.  When the device is running, you will get a decrypted firmware dump.\n\nHere's a series about this with an airport express, it's taken from this blog: http://www.hsorbo.no/ but i will copy and paste the whole thing here because i don't trust this blog to stay online.  I've pieced in some photos using archive.org as well. Unfortunately the link to the key at the end is a dead link.\n\nFor quite some time I‚Äôve wanted to reverse engineer the airport express base station. There are two reasons for this. The first is that within this firmware are the private Airtunes keys. The second and more important part, at least for me, is that it is almost identical to a wrt54g plus it adds usb and sound-card. Getting linux/openwrt running on this would be wicked cool. The main issue with reversing apples firmwares for these access points is that they are encrypted and the airport express decrypts the firmware when flashing so you can‚Äôt really do anything fun with the firmware-update files.\n\nA time back I posted on twitter that I needed a broken airport expresss! I go really lucky, a friend of mine saw the tweet and gave me his broken airport. I disassembled it and found out that the flash was AT45DB321B, which is nice because Atmel keeps their datasheet public, the not so good news was that it was BGA-mounted and my old soldering station wasn‚Äôt up for this. Everybody knows I‚Äôm a real ebay-whore, so I went to ebay and ordered this excellent hakko rework-station clone (YIHUA 852D+). This had the hot-air-gun that I needed. Here is a short video when I‚Äôm detaching the IC:\n\nAfter desoldering I glued it to a breadboard and hooked up some wires, this was a bit tricky as this is quite small.\n\nPhoto of flash [missing from blog]\n\nAfter everything was hooked up, I attached it to my Bus Pirate and after a lot of trial and error managed to communicate with the chip.\n\nPhoto of my desk [missing from blog]\n\nFinally i wrote this small python-script that dumped the content of the chip.\n\nI‚Äôm now in the possession of the unencrypted firmware for airport express, but still there are a lot of stuff remaing. The firmware is compressed, and I have had no success brute-force inflating it, so I may have to start reverse-engineering the bootloader just to get to the uncompressed firmware. Another option could be running it under qemu, the decompression-part that is, should be fairly generic MIPS-code. A third option would be to flash it on my wrt54g and do jtag-debugging, if I‚Äôm really lucky I‚Äôd get serial-port and bootloader on the linksys.\n\nThere are a lot for options going forward, I‚Äôll post a new blog-entry when I make further progress. Please excuse the bad language in this post, I don‚Äôt want to spend time on grammar now that I have this very sexy binary blob right in front of me.\n\nHappy hacking!\n\n23 February 2010\nYesterday I was analyzing my firmware-dump and I couldn‚Äôt make sense of very much. One thing that got my attention was that scattered around the firmware-dump were a lot of 0xFF. I Found a pattern, and I tried to convince myself that this was some sort of container or padding between important chunks of data. Then as the night approached BOOM, it hit me. The pattern was like this: 512 bytes of data, 16 bytes of 0xFF, 512 bytes of data and 16 bytes of 0xFF. This was significant and here is the problem/solution.\n\nThe flash chip on AT45DB321B is like a book with 8192 pages and 528 letters on each page. When I dumped it my program just read through the book carefully noting every letter. Now the airport express doesn‚Äôt do it this way, the airport just turns to the page it wants and reads what is needed (random access). Now there is one other limitation, the Airport Express doesn‚Äôt read more than 512 letters from each page. This means that he doesn‚Äôt care about the last 16 letters I have been carefully putting into my dump/analysis. I Fixed this and my brute-force decopression-program (15 line python script) found both the bootloader and the main firmware. Their md5-sums are: ff4c561a6dcce8686749594d84ff4e7d and 7db70daf035f085eb455d8de3c2099fb. A guy name James seems to have done the deployment of this firmware :) I think all that remains now is spending time with IDA Pro. I need to get a memory alignment as the start address of memory seems to be 0x8000000 + some offset.\n\nA screenshot of the strings-window in IDA Pro (strings used in the Airtunes authentication):\n\n\n\nI really think this discovery makes for part 2 as I now am pretty sure the rest is doable, albeit time consuming.\n\nPS. I had to replace every occurence of dump with firmware-dump as the text became very questionable\n\n26 February 2010\nA small update. Memory alignment took a few hours. I did this by dumping a lot of the string offsets in the firmware using standard unix console tools: strings -n 10 -o | grep \"Audio\" | awk '{print $2}' I then wrote a IDA script that dumped all load operation offsets, made a second script that brute-forced matching the offsets. The best match was 0x80010000 and not to anybody‚Äôs surprise this made IDA pro very happy and she started auto analyzing the firmware. Here is a screen shot of the memory-offsets:\n\n\n\nHere is a in-action screen shot of IDA:\n\n\n\nI‚Äôve done a good amount of reversing and everything is going well, still have no ETA on anything though. Subscribe to the blog or check back after the weekend if you are curious.\n\n11 April 2011\nThe RAOP/Airtunes key is here http://static.hsorbo.no/0xff/airtunes.pem Although i have had the key for quite some time it was first made public here: http://www.mafipulation.org/blagoblig/2011/04/08#shairport\n\n",
