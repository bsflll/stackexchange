  "content": "```\n#include<stdio.h>\n#include<stdlib.h>\nint main() {\n    puts(\"Enter input: \");\n    char buf[100];\n    fgets(buf, 100, stdin);\n    printf(\"%s\", buf);\n}\n\n```\nSuppose I am debugging a program, such as the one above, where I need to type in some input. Usually, what radare2 does is that it will allow me to type in any ascii input whenever the program demands that I have user input, and it will look like the following:\n\n```\nEnter input: Hello\nHello\n\n```\nHowever, what if I need to type in hex input? Normally, if I wanted to use hex input for my program outside of radare2, I would use a command that looks like the following:\n\n```\npython -c \"print('\\x48\\x65\\x6c\\x6c\\x6f')\" | ./program\n\n```\nBut if I am debugging the program with radare2 and use something like \\x48\\x65\\x6c\\x6c\\x6f as the input, radare2 will literally interpret the backlash x as a string that looks like \"\\x\" instead of interpreting the input as hexadecimal. How would I go about inputting hex while inside of radare2 properly?\n\n",
