  "content": "I am tracking down a data structure whose address is inside the second operand:\n\n```\nmov rcx, qword ptr ss:[rbp+E0]\n\n```\nWhen I look at the value of [rbp+E0] I see the following dump:\n\n```\n21 C4 FC 5E 00 00 00 00\n\n```\nThis is the pointer to the data structure but it is stored as little endian. So I cannot simply copy the address. I have to transform it by hand into:\n\n```\n000000005EFCC421\n\n```\nIs there a common and easy way to handle these situations? I am currently using x64dbg as a debugger.\nThanks!\n\n",
