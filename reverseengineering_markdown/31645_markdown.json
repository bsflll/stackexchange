  "content": "I have IDA freeware version 5 and version 8, v5 is running on wine, v8 is directly on kali OS, and I am trying to create an IDC script to generate asm+lst files for all files in a certain folder.\n\nWhat I have so far is a script that gets a list of files from an input folder and saves the list into a file, then I read the file line by line for each input file I want to process. My problem comes here, It seems I can't use loadfile() when I do not have a database opened, ready to receive the file, and when I try to load the file with a database opened and a loaded file I don't get any result back!\n\nAny answer to those questions would help greatly.\n\n",
