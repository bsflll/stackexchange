  "content": "I have an indirect call to a function. I traced the program and added the target to the xref, so this works fine. The problem is though, that on the position where the call is, there is no link shown. I thought, that, when I add an XREF, both positions are shown, because this is also the behaviour with the other referenzes, IDA automatically finds out.\n\nTo illustrate what I mean:\n\nThe call is here without showing me where it points to:\n\n```\nCODE:004A3F07 00C                 call    dword ptr [edx+28h]\n\n```\nThe xref I added is here showing the link:\n\n```\nCODE:004A3390     DecryptMemory proc near            ; CODE XREF: sub_4A3EC0:loc_4A3F07 P\n\n```\nIs it possible to make IDA show the reference on both addresses? I know I can create a manual xref there as well, but then IDA creates a label as well, which makes it a bit confusing, when revisting. I tried to remove the label, but this doesn't work either (would this be possible?).\n\n",

In most cases it's not necessary, as the destination is usually printed as part of the instruction or data item.\n\nHowever, for resolved indirect calls the processor module may display a comment to help the user. For some processors (including x86) you can use the \"Change callee address\" plugin (Alt+F11) to manually set the destination of an indirect call. It adds both an xref and makes the processor module print an auto-comment.\n\n",
