  "content": "I am reverse engineering a binary in IDA Pro and I came across the function sub_8048FB6 which I think provides the address to a function pointer. The decompilation of the subroutine is as follows and I'm trying to find result.\n\n```\nint __cdecl sub_8048FB6(int a1)\n{\n  int result; // eax\n  int v2; // [esp+0h] [ebp-10h]\n  int v3; // [esp+4h] [ebp-Ch]\n\n  v2 = *(_DWORD *)dword_804C0D4;\n  v3 = *(_DWORD *)(8 * a1 + 4 + *(_DWORD *)dword_804C0D4);\n  if ( a1 & 1 )\n    result = *(_DWORD *)(8 * a1 + v2) - v3;\n  else\n    result = *(_DWORD *)(*(_DWORD *)(8 * a1 + v2) - v3);\n  return result;\n}\n\n```\nThe dword_804C0D4 variable I will guess is pointing to a memory location and is only referenced 2 times in the binary as follows:\n\n```\nUp  r   sub_8048FB6+6   mov     eax, ds:dword_804C0D4\nUp  w   sub_804A24E+3   mov     ds:dword_804C0D4, offset unk_804C0B8\n\n```\nSo, my guess is the offset to the variable unk_804C0B8 is the value which is in the address pointed by ds:dword_804C0D4. If that's the case, with respect to where is the offset calculated? Once I double-click on unk_804C0B8 I get:\n\n```\nLOAD:0804C0B8 unk_804C0B8     db 0E8h   ; DATA XREF: sub_804A24E+3↑o\nLOAD:0804C0B9                 db 0FFh\nLOAD:0804C0BA                 db 0FFh\nLOAD:0804C0BB                 db  8Bh\nLOAD:0804C0BC                 db  85h\nLOAD:0804C0BD                 db  68h ; h\nLOAD:0804C0BE                 db 0BFh\nLOAD:0804C0BF                 db 0FBh\nLOAD:0804C0C0                 db 0FFh\nLOAD:0804C0C1                 db  89h\nLOAD:0804C0C2                 db 0C2h\nLOAD:0804C0C3                 db 0B8h\nLOAD:0804C0C4                 db    0\nLOAD:0804C0C5                 db    0\nLOAD:0804C0C6                 db    0\nLOAD:0804C0C7                 db    0\nLOAD:0804C0C8 dword_804C0C8   dd 0FFEB0EE8h   ; DATA XREF: sub_8049D1E+2B1↑r\n\n```\nBut I don't know how to read the value with all those dbs. What is the size of offset unk_804C0B8 and it's value? Am I proceeding correctly?\n\n",
