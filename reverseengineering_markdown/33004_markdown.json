  "content": "I recently extracted the firmware (u-boot system) from an old Sagemcom router and analyzed it using the binwalk utility for a personal reverse engineering project.\n\nDespite identifying a root filesystem (likely JFFS2 based on string analysis), binwalk was unable to recognize or extract it.\nI know that the filesystem is JFFS by examining the boot info, and performing strings analysis on my dump. (You can check the git repo given further down)\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nMemory Extraction steps:\n\nQuestions:\n\n",

      "content": "There's no need for binwalk to be further utilized for JFFS2 extraction.\n\nSince Binwak detect ubi filesystem (and not JFFS2) it is smarter to use tools like ubireader to extract it from the firmware.\n\nSo i've installed ubireader from the AUR, and performed ubireader_extract_images firmware.bin which cave me a set of .ubifs files that could be extracted by binwalk.\n\nFurther investigation still need to be done sine /etc/passwd & /etc/shadow from ubirootfs does not contain password hash for root user\n\n",
