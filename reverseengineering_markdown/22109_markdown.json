  "content": "For the record, I've read all stackexchange relevant answers on the topic (here and here) plus other articles to fully grasp the concepts of memory alignment and CPU natural boundaries.\nBut for some reason, I just can't understand the meaning of the following main preamble (given out by radare2)\n\n```\n(fcn) sym.main 99\n|   sym.main (int argc, char **argv, char **envp);\n|           ; var int local_78h @ ebp-0x78\n|           ; arg int arg_10h @ ebp+0x10\n|           ; var int local_4h @ esp+0x4\n|           ; DATA XREF from entry0 (0x8048417)\n|           0x0804867d      55             push ebp\n|           0x0804867e      89e5           mov ebp, esp\n|           0x08048680      81ec88000000   sub esp, 0x88\n|           0x08048686      83e4f0         and esp, 0xfffffff0\n|           0x08048689      b800000000     mov eax, 0\n|           0x0804868e      83c00f         add eax, 0xf\n|           0x08048691      83c00f         add eax, 0xf\n|           0x08048694      c1e804         shr eax, 4\n|           0x08048697      c1e004         shl eax, 4\n|           0x0804869a      29c4           sub esp, eax\n\n```\nThere seems to be a local array on the stack frame that takes up  78h = 120d bytes on the stack, indicated by this line :\n\n```\n|           ; var int local_78h @ ebp-0x78\n\n```\nSo far so good.\nNow the stack pointer is moved to make space for such an array on the stack, manipulating esp to make sure the stack is aligned on 16-bytes boundaries :\n\n```\n|           0x08048680      81ec88000000   sub esp, 0x88\n|           0x08048686      83e4f0         and esp, 0xfffffff0\n\n```\nWhich effectively makes esp a multiple of at least 16 (least significant nibble zeroed out), but let's for the sake of mathematical rigor say that esp is now a multiple of 16k, with k an arbitrary integer.\nAll this makes perfect sense (see here and here to fully understand the need for 16-bytes stack alignment, having to do with SSE and whatnot).\nNow what I really can't seem to wrap my head around is the relevance of the subsequent instructions :\n\n```\n|           0x08048689      b800000000     mov eax, 0\n|           0x0804868e      83c00f         add eax, 0xf\n|           0x08048691      83c00f         add eax, 0xf\n|           0x08048694      c1e804         shr eax, 4\n|           0x08048697      c1e004         shl eax, 4\n|           0x0804869a      29c4           sub esp, eax\n\n```\nWhich as far as I could understand :\n1 - Made eax equal to 10h (by the way why all these instructions to get to such a simple result for eax ? Why not just make a mov eax, 0x10 ?)\n2 - Subtract that quantity from esp, which is just gonna zero out the least significant 1 bit in esp (given that the first nibble is null anyway) which is just gonna make esp a multiple of 16(k+1), thus making the stack aligned on 32-bytes boundaries if it was aligned on 16-bytes boundaries, or make it aligned on 64-bytes boundaries if it was aligned on 32-bytes boundaries, and so on and so forth. \n\nWhat do we need that for ?\nIs there something I got wrong in this whole analysis ?\n\n",
