  "content": "I have following instructions in Android shared library:\n\n```\nMRC p15, 0, R3,c13,c0, 3 \nLDR R3, [R3,#4] \nMOV R0, #0 \nSTR R0, [R3,#0xC]\n\n```\nAccording to ARM documentation:\n\nThat's nice, but what is implementation of this register value in Android or ARM Linux?\n\nFrom the code, it tries to read Thread and Process ID Register value as structure,and it reads some field with offset 4. This field is pointer to structure itself, and it writes 0 to field with offset 12.\n\nSo, the register value is for sure not pthread_t, because, according to Android source codes, pthread_t field with offset 4 is unsigned int and not pointer to any structure.\n\nDoes anyone know where can I find definition of structure returned by MRC c13::c0::3 in Android ARM?\n\n",

It looks like it is required to force getpid to read real pid value instead of using cached one (PID caching is known source of bugs in some glibc versions).\n\n",
