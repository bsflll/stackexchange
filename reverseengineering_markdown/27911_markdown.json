  "content": "I was working on a practice binary. It opens the file at C:/WINDOWS/system32/filename#123.dat, if the file does not exist, the check compares the result to -1 (An invalid handle). However, even after creating the file, then re-running (Using ollydbg) the handle value is still invalid (-1). I am following a walk-through where the individual goes through the exact same steps. and a valid handle is returned. I am running as administrator. Is this a known issue? Anyone have a solution to it? Been stuck for 2 days\n\nFile being accessed via:\n\n```\nCreateFileA\nAccess = GENERIC_READ\nShareMode = 0\npSecurity= NULL\nMode = OPEN_EXISTING\nAttributes = NORMAL\nhTemplateFile = NULL\nFileName = \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\filename#123.dat\"\n\n```\nI originally tried on Windows 10, did not work, so then I hopped over to windows XP 64 bit (what the walkthrough was using - still did not work.)\n\n",
