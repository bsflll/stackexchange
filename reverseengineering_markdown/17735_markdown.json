      "content": "I might be wrong, but it sounds to me like you loaded the binary file at the wrong imagebase. It sounds like you loaded it at the default base address of 0x0, whereas the base address really ought to be 0x2000000. Load the file into IDA again from scratch and try putting 0x2000000 in the \"Loading offset\" box on the initial \"Load a new file\" dialog box.\n\nAs for why I think that: based on your examples, e.g. the second one:\n\n```\njsr     $200CA4C\n\n```\nYou're claiming the real address is 0x0CA4C, a difference of 0x2000000 from what's displayed. Your first example also differs by 0x2000000. So I'm guessing those instructions have hard-coded addresses in them, with all of them just above 0x2000000. That tells me the binary probably expects to be loaded at that address, which is why I'm advising you to try loading it at that address and see what happens.\n\n",
