      "content": "It's simply the common way to state that this is a double word (32 bit integer, signedness isn't as much a concern at this level) with unknown value.\n\nSee here for an overview. The summary for the most common ones is:\n\nThe ? denotes that this value is unknown and will only be known at runtime. And example of this are variables inside an uninitialized data section.\n\nIf you start a debug session with IDA, the address will eventually contain some value. But since you use static analysis without running the code, there is no information what value it will contain.\n\nAnd you can't know the value during static analysis. This is one of the big limitations of static (not running the code) versus dynamic (running the code) analysis.\n\n",
