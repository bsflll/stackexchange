The files are used at runtime for the game images and sounds.\n\nIf I try and open one of the mp3s or jpgs directly windows will give me an error, the files are obviously packed/encrypted/obfuscated/compressed.\n\nHow can I determine the obfuscation type of the files?\n\nI have determined that the first 4 bytes are the same in each file, 43 46 31 30 (CF10 in ASCII). Maybe this information would be useful.\n\n",
