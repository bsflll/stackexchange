  "content": "The title seems little crazy, but I think that it is possible. Just think about it. If you create text file like this:\n\n```\nHello world!\n\n```\nYou get this checksum:\n\n```\n0ba904eae8773b70c75333db4de2f3ac45a8ad4ddba1b242f0b3cfc199391dd8\n\n```\nBut if you change any letter like this:\n\n```\nHallo world!\n\n```\nYou get this:\n\n```\nbf1adae4567d9fb6b3bfb30cbf4dfdd2503e89a831cf3472c399b39fb9c73289\n\n```\nThat means, that if I change any letter I always get another checksum, so there must be any way to get source file back.\n\nMy question is: Is there any way to get source file back without creating all possible combinations and checking checksum?\n\n",

      "content": "This is actually one of the main attributes of Cryptographic Hash Functions. As mentioned in the wiki page, they are designed so they cannot be reversed:\n\nAdditionally, the property which dictates a small change in the message will result in a completely different output value is also a requirement of cryptographic hashes:\n\nThe only ways to actually achieve that is by trying all possibilities (which is intentionally impossible with today's computing power) or finding a weakness in the hashing mechanism.\n\nNowadays, MD5 and SHA1 are considered broken because of such weaknesses (see here and here respectively)\n\nThere are, however, caches or common strings and their different hash values and some of the message values can be found online. https://crackstation.net/ is such a repository of many hash functions.\n\nFor example, the hash 0ba904eae8773b70c75333db4de2f3ac45a8ad4ddba1b242f0b3cfc199391dd8 you gave as an example can be found here.\n\n",

      "content": "No there isn't.  The act of hashing and checksumming both lose information in the process.  Thus, there can be multiple files that produce the same hash and the same checksum.  The only way to know that you have recovered the original file is to compare it with the original file.\n\n",
