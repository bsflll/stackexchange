  "content": "I have a string which has a XREF to a func. This func changes of address at every updates of the app I am working on. So this string is the only \"stable\" point I can rely on to access to func.\n\n```\n                     aOpensslCertVer:\n00000000047fef1d         db         \"openssl cert verify error: \", 0            ; DATA XREF=sub_342df4+412\n\n```\nSo I'd like to obtain the XREF pointer with a Frida script, how can I do that ? Is it even possible to do ?\n\nI found out here that it seems you can do it with IDA in python, but I use something else than IDA, and I'd like to do it dynamically from Frida JS.\n\nHow can I do it ? Is it even possible to do ? Thanks !\n\n",
