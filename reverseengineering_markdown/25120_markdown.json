  "content": "I've been probing this CCTV DVR board trying to find a serial port to see if I can get console access to it. I found a set of 4 through holes with no headers that looked like a good candidate. I hooked up to my Bus Pirate in UART mode at a baud rate of 115200 and it seemed promising at first:\n\n```\nSystem startup\n\nU-Boot 2010.06 (Dec 27 2018 - 17:06:41)\n\nCheck Flash Memory Controller v100 ...

The next line has legible text but some garbage in it, then after that nothing but garbage:\n\n```\n�P���Starting the controller\n+*/�)))!)       �!�+!%) !      �)*+��\n\n%+���5�!                                -��5�!\n        !�!\n           +-���\n                !���\n�%      %!-     �)�����+��+     !       %!!5!!�)!+!\n+)      %%�+\n                %!5                                                                                                                                                                                          )\n                   ��)5 !5)!)   %               �)!%\n        -\n         %)     )       5)�-�\n!                               )��!�   !\n -      )!\n%-\n  !%!   !       !\n\n!��\n%)!�%   %%)!    !�      �\n%!�))   !)!)!)!%-\n�-))!   ��      ��)))!! ��%\n�%!)�!)%)�))%              �)           %-%+�\n�)      !�5�    !       �               !       -!!\n            )%!\n��)�)%�)���)\n\n```\nIs this because the baud rate is suddenly changing? Or is it more likely that the output is switching to some proprietary format?\n\nI also didn't have a super solid connection to the board when trying this, could it be that the connection dropped and then reconnected out of sync or something?\n\n",
