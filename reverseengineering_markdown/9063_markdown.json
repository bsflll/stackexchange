  "content": "I have a board that I'm reversing - and attempting to dump the image out of the NAND flash.\n\nBoard has a SAMSUNG s3c2440 SOC CPU, and there's a SAMSUNG k9f1g08u0d 128 MB NAND flash device.\n\nI'm using a BusPirate through JTAG to connect. I am able to run OpenOCD and view the chip, dump registers, etc.\n\nHowever, the whole setup is unstable. I'm running on a Linux host PC. Steps are:\n\nI have a Buspirate 3, with the latest version 6.1 firmware.\nOpenocd is version 0.9.0\n\nAny suggestions to get a setup to be more stable is welcomed.\n\n",

      "text": "devttys0's comment is a good hint, especially if it always happens at the same stage in the boot process. However, your description of 'start openocd', 'telnet into openocd' seems to explain that this happens after the system has been running for a while. I'd expect a problem with the signal itself, maybe caused by  a bad power supply or similar, that disturbs the signal on the JTAG pins. Do you have a scope to hook up to the pins to verify this? Also, the folks at the electrical engineering SE might have more experience with this.",
