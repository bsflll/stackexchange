  "content": "I'm using IDA Pro and WinDbg as a debugger. So I loaded an executable process into it. And now I need to know the entry point (or base address) of that loaded executable, the same as I would get from calling these APIs:\n\n```\nMODULEINFO mi = {0};\nif(::GetModuleInformation(::GetCurrentProcess(), ::GetModuleHandle(NULL), &mi, sizeof(mi)))\n{\n    //Needed entry point is:\n    pEntryPoint = mi.EntryPoint;\n}\n\n```\nI found this reference, but when I do:\n\n```\nidaapi.get_imagebase()\n\n```\nit gives me the error:\n\n\n\nSorry, I'm new to IDA. What am I doing wrong?\n\n",

      "content": "You need to switch to a different command line. Currently, you're using the WinDbg command line, which allows you to send commands to WinDbg instead of IDAPython:\n\n\n\nClick on WinDbg, or press Ctrlâ†‘ to switch to IDAPython, where idaapi.get_imagebase() works fine:\n\n\n\nHowever, this doesn't really answer your question. What you want is the entry point, and to find it, you can either press CtrlE in IDA, or find it with WinDbg:\n\n\n\nThe command is:\n\n```\n.printf \"0x%X\", $exentry\n\n```\n",
