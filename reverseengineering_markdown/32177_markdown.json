  "content": "I'm learning a bit about PE files. The thing I've struggling a bit now it the First Thunk and Original First Thunk fields. To understand the difference between them I've read this post and that article. To test the problem \"live\" I've opened said shell32.dll or notepad.exe files in PE-bear and IDA BUT that appears the there is NO import binding in case of that files in contrast to what the articles say. Here are my question now:\n\nWhy there is NO import binding in these files?\n\nHere are the first and the second article.\n\nPlease don't down-vote the question if it appears to lame because I'm just newbie in the topic.\n\n",
