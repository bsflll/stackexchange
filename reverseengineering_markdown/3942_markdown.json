You can unzip the classes.dex from your apk file on the mac, and dex2jar should work on a mac as well. \n\nThe last part, jd, is a windows program, but they have an online demo on their project site - click \"live demo\" in the header, then drag and drop your jar file on the input files box.\n\nEdit\nI just noticed there are download links for jd on mac as well, so you don't need to use the online version. You can even use the jd for eclipse plugin on a mac.\n\n",
