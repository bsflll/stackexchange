Am I missing something?\n\n",

I'd say that it looks like kind of work with memory mapped registers - I had seen such a things before with various IOT devices ROMs . I'd suggest to do the following:\n\nThis should cause IDA to threat all these things as offsets in memory.\n\nIf this is low level code that deals with hardware directly you'll probably find all segment addresses either in it SDK or in the corresponding datasheet.\n\n",
