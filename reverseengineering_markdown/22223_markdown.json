      "content": "Linux binutils tools, such as objdump, gdb etc. rely on the BFD library, meaning they take well-formed ELF files, not arbitrary byte values or ASCII hex strings, as input. If you want to create your own libopcodes-based disassembler that does this, the following article will help you get started: Basic disassembly with libopcodes.\n\nGCC is a compiler toolchain, which performs preprocessing of the source file, translates source code to assembly, translates that to machine code, and then performs relocation via the link-editor, producing an ELF binary. It sounds like you are interested in going the other way, that is, disassembling object (binary) code. Therefore GCC is not relevant here.\n\nIf you want to disassemble individual bytes, you can use the Capstone disassembly framework's Python bindings to write scripts that disassemble the byte values that you specify. Here is an example:\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/python3\n\nfrom capstone import *\n\nCODE = b\"\\x55\"\n\nmd = md = Cs(CS_ARCH_X86, CS_MODE_32)\nfor i in md.disasm(CODE, 0x1000):\n    print(\"0x%x:\\t%s\\t%s\" %(i.address, i.mnemonic, i.op_str))\n\n```\nThe output is 0x1000:  push    ebp\n\nWhen we consult the x86 opcode table, we see that a value of 0x50 + the register = Push Word, Doubleword or Quadword Onto the Stack. So if we change 0x55 to 0x54 the output becomes 0x1000:   push    esp - a different register is pushed. 0x50 = push    eax. And so forth.\n\nHere is a modified version of the above script:\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/python3\n\nfrom capstone import *\n\nCODE = b\"\\x50\\x51\\x52\\x53\\x54\\x55\\x56\\x57\"\n\nmd = md = Cs(CS_ARCH_X86, CS_MODE_32)\nfor i in md.disasm(CODE, 0x1000):\n    print(\"0x%x:\\t%s\\t%s\" %(i.address, i.mnemonic, i.op_str))\n\n```\nThis prints\n\n```\n0x1000: push    eax\n0x1001: push    ecx\n0x1002: push    edx\n0x1003: push    ebx\n0x1004: push    esp\n0x1005: push    ebp\n0x1006: push    esi\n0x1007: push    edi\n\n```\n",
