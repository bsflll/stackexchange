  "content": "I'm trying to reverse a highly obfuscated program written in java.  None of the deobfuscators seem to work so I have been poking at it in eclipse.  I can attach to a running process and have figured some of the code out but it appears the part im after happens in a synthetic function so I want to be able to step line by line through the byte code and see whats going on.  None of the tools I have found so far seem to have this ability.  I appreciate any suggestions.\n\nWhat I've tried\n1.) Eclipse with various plugins (can kind of decompile code but without line numbers its little help debugging)\n2.) Recaf(useful for static analysis but have not found a way to use it in a debug fashion)\n3.) Several deobfuscators with no luck\n\n",
