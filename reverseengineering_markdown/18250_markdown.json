It adds all the payload bytes modulo 0xFF and then adds 26.\n\nI wrote a script to test it:\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport binascii\n\ndef checksum(data):\n    payload = data[3:-1]\n    checksum = 26\n    for c in payload:\n        checksum += c\n    checksum &= 0xFF\n    return checksum\n\nwith open(\"input.txt\",\"r\") as f:\n    for line in f:\n        line = line.strip()\n        if line == \"\":\n            continue\n        line = line.replace(\",\",\"\")\n        line = line.replace(\"0x\",\"\")\n\n        data = binascii.unhexlify(line)\n\n        if checksum(data) == data[-1]:\n            print(\"pass\")\n        else:\n            print(\"fail\")\n\n```\nI copied your above samples into input.txt and they all passed.\n\nAs for how I found out, I googled about sync words (didn't know what that is), and 1 byte checksums and some other post mentioned simple addition. I also tested multiple CRC8 variants but none worked. I also found it telling that the checksum seems to reflect changes in the input, such as:\n\n```\n0xE1,0xC0,0x0A,0x4E,0x8A,0x60,0x38,0x34,0x94,0x84,0x27,0x13,0x10\n0xE1,0xC0,0x0A,0x4E,0x8A,0x70,0x38,0x34,0x94,0x84,0x27,0x13,0x20\n\n```\nThe 0x60 changed to 0x70 and so did the checksum increase by 0x10 which - I think - would not be as obvious for CRCs.\n\n",
