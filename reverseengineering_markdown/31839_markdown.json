  "content": "So, I was testing a Yara rule which goes like this:\n\n```\nrule macro_auto_run\n\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Document with macro that auto runs\"\n        \n    strings:\n        $s1 = \"AutoOpen\"\n        $s2 = \"Workbook_Open\"\n        \n    condition:\n        ($s1 or $s2)\n}\n\n```\nI created a Word file, then created a macro in the document with the name, AutoOpen, put some code in it and attempted to test it against this rule.\n\nIt did not trigger. Then I ran the utility strings on it. It couldn't find the word \"AutoOpen\". Used another hex editor like HxD, still nothing. Did a Unicode, Ascii search for the string as well. Nothing! I am wondering why.\n\nEdit: Figured out that I need to unzip the archive and then search within those files.\n\n",
