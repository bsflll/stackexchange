It is hard, but well worth the trouble. Try starting with NASM, or writing inline assembly with your visual studio programs. \n\nAlso: This question is a little too broad for this site. \n\n",

Everything is already set up for you for making a basic exploit, either local or remote. And it serves as a rather nice gdb extension.\n\nAlso, if all you really need is packing/manipulating binary data, python's struct library is a must. \n\nThere's also Pyhton Arsenal For RE list of libraries covering many more useful libraries. \n\n",

      "content": "I've been using pydbg for the last 2+ years to great success. Its used by various popular fuzzing suites such as Sulley, PaiMei, etc. \n\nAlso, the capstone disassembly framework is highly suggested, especially the op_access functionality as it helps with taint analysis. Keep in mind the application binary interface (ABI) of the platform you're developing exploits on. If its x86/x64, remember certain instructions will flag different unecessary registers as read/written to.\n\nAs an example, \n\n```\nrep movs* \n\n```\nIs used by various functions, especially on WindowsXP+. \n\nThe capstone disassembly framework will state that ecx, edi and esi are ALL read and written to, which means you'll have to write logic to deduce if certain instructions like the aforementioned ACTUALLY read/write to registers. Obviously, ESI and ECX aren't written to in that instruction. Usually compilers will specify the number of bytes to read in the previous insruction, e.g.\n\n```\nmov ecx, 0x##\n\n```\nHowever, for ~80% of instructions it will give accurate information (EFLAGS not withstanding).\n\nIt should take a few days or a week depending on free time to write logic to determine if a register is actually accessed. \n\nI'm only assuming the basic instruction set is what you need, not FPU, SIMD, SSE, etc. If you RE malware, packed or optimized binaries, you will need to add logic for the aforementioned and more instruction sets\n\n",
