  "content": "I'm kind of new to assembly and ghidra as a tool. I have a question about the meaning of this line\n\n```\nMov dword PTR [ESP] => local_70 , eax\n\n```\nI get we are moving eax into the left side but I'm not sure what the [ESP]=>local_70 chunk is as I haven't come across that before. I think the => confuses me the most.\n\nAny help is much appreciated!\n\n",
