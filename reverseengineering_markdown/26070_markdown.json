  "content": "I am debugging a kernel driver. When I set a breakpoint with WinDBG in one of its functions but it doesn't complete the function names while on IDA it shows the names (statically).\n\nHere is a picture of IDA (with the name of the last three functions) and on the right, WinDBG without the name:\n\n\nI read about similar issue Why doesn't WinDbg resolve the function names? and I tried the suggestion by running:\n\n```\n.symfix C:\\debug\\symbols\n.sympath+ C:\\debug\\mypdbs\n.reload /f\n\n```\nI re-opened the disassembly window and I still don't see the function names.\n\nEDIT (answer to questions):\n\n```\nDebugger client version: 1.0.2007.06001  \nDebugger engine version: 10.0.20153.1000  \n\n```\n```\nkd> lm m cfs\nBrowse full module list\nstart             end                 module name\nfffff800`2abd0000 fffff800`2abd0c00   cfs        (no symbols)    \n\n```\n```\nSRV*c:\\symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols\n\n```\nSo I think it is loaded although in section 3 it wrote \"no symbols\".\nI also run .reload /f but it didn't help.\n\n```\nkd> u fffff802`504a6460\nnt!RtlInitUnicodeString:\nfffff802`504a6460 48c70100000000  mov     qword ptr [rcx],0\nfffff802`504a6467 48895108        mov     qword ptr [rcx+8],rdx\nfffff802`504a646b 4885d2          test    rdx,rdx\nfffff802`504a646e 7501            jne     nt!RtlInitUnicodeString+0x11 (fffff802`504a6471)\nfffff802`504a6470 c3              ret\nfffff802`504a6471 48c7c0ffffffff  mov     rax,0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFh\nfffff802`504a6478 0f1f840000000000 nop     dword ptr [rax+rax]\nfffff802`504a6480 48ffc0          inc     rax\n\n\n```\nYou can see that it resolve the name nt!RtlInitUnicodeString but only once it hit the breakpoint, you can see that it didn't resolve the two next instructions:\n\n\n6.\n\n```\nkd> ln fffff802`504a6460\nBrowse module\nSet bu breakpoint\n\n(fffff802`504a6460)   nt!RtlInitUnicodeString   |  (fffff802`504a64b0)   nt!KeEnterCriticalRegion\nExact matches:\n    nt!RtlInitUnicodeString (void)\n\n```\nIn the environment varible I have it set:\n\n```\n_NT_SYMBOL_PATH\nSRV*c:\\symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols\n\n```\n",
