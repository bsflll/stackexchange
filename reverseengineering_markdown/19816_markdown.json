  "content": "As a first unpacking exercise, I decided to try to unpack the famous UPX (without using upx -d of course). I chose an executable I had somewhere, built from C++ code in debug mode. I packed it using the last version of upx upx algorithm.exe and tested it.\n\nI set a hardware breakpoint after PUSHAD and after I hit it, I dumped the process with OllydumpEx. Finally I used Scylla to rebuild the IAT.\n\nThere was no error during the whole process but my fixed dump terminate with a Segmentation Fault. What would you do to investigate what went wrong?\n\nThis picture shows the disassembly windows where I paused to dump, and the options used during the process.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI just checked in the process memory and the IAT VA and size found b Scylla seem to be correct.\n\n",

      "content": "You said that the base address changes so I assume your system and target executable have ASLR enabled. This sometimes causes problems when unpacking due to relocations not being fixed.\n\nEasiest solution is to disable ASLR and then unpack. If you want to disable ASLR on the packed executable, edit the IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_DYNAMIC_BASE flag of the DLL Characteristics field using a PE editor of your choice. Another option is to disable ASLR on the system which is not recommended.\n\n",
