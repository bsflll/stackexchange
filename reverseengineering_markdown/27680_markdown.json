      "text": "In all likelihood gcc -dumpspecs has the answer as to why it happens when you don't give the linker flag explicitly to the compiler driver. For example the packaged GCC on Ubuntu 20.04 appears to behave that way. So why not try -Wl,-z,norelro instead? Also: this isn't exactly reverse engineering related, or where do you see the connection? Better to ask this on StackOverflow or so.",

Pass following flag\n\n```\n-Wl,-z,norelro\n\n```\nDifference between full and partial relro: partial relro makes partial .got section (non .plt) section read-only and changes the alignment order sections making .got section appear before and data sections (.bss, '.data') and makes , while full relro makes complete .got section read-only (including .got.plt) and also reorders sections like in partial relro (incurring startup overhead).\n\n",
