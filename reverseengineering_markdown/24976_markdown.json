      "content": "This STR operation adds 8 bytes to the offset at X21, then stores the value of X0 there.\n\nYou are working with QWORD sized variables (8), so in C code it is something like:\n\n(uint64_t *)(offset_at_X21 + 1) = X0\n\nEdit:\n\nThe first instruction sets X0=address of off_1B2000 (const 0x1B2000). Later it is dereferenced [X0,#offset...]. This is *(0x1B2000+0x1B2000), which is odd. Could it be LDR X0,[X0]? IDA may give it the name \"#off_1B2000\" because it is clear that this is the value.\n\nX21 pointes to the variable \"v1\" on the stack, (set by ADD X21,SP,#0x260+v1).\n\nThe result of the code is something like this:\n\n[v1+8] = *(off_1B2000)\n\n",
