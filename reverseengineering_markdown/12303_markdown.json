  "content": "When you save a screenshot in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U on the SD card it writes to, it makes two files: a .JPG and a .BIN file. Both these files are in the format of HNI_XXXX.EXTENTION, where XXXX is the number of the screenshot. I believe that the .BIN file is (at least in part) a checksum to verify that the images are not edited (outside of the game), because modifying the .JPG file in any way will cause the game to refuse to recognize it. \n\nSince the .BIN file is always 32-bytes exactly, I've tried using some of the common 265-bit checksums like SHA-256, and GOST. But none have ever matched up what has been contained in the .BIN files. \n\nI've included three sets of images and their respective checksums in a convenient zip file, so please take a look.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas what checksum Super Smash Bros. might be using? If you need any more details I'd be more than happy to provide them.\n\n",
