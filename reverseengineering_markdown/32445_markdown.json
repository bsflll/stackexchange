  "content": "I'm new to IDC scripts and would like some help at trying to apply and offset to a binary I have in loaded in IDA. Sorry not sure if my terminology is correct but I have a reference in my file \"fp\" that is the memory offset and is shown like\n\n```\nld24    fp, #0x808000\n\n```\nall of the references in the file show something like,\n\n```\nlduh    R0, @(-0x2700, fp)\n\n```\nwhich make it difficult to link the memory addresses. If I press Ctrl-R I can correct these offsets in the file line by line but I would like a script that can do the whole file in one go if possible.\n\n\nthis gives me what I am looking for\n\n```\nlduh    R0, @((unk_805900 - unk_808000), fp)\n\n```\nAny help would be appreciated, thanks\n\n",
