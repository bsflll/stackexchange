  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/21226/how-do-i-import-function-signatures-to-ghidra",
  "content": "I'm working with an .exe which imports the old DirectX DLL DDRAW.DLL. The problem is, Ghidra doesn't know about it and shows all imported DDRAW functions as having no parameters. I know, I can edit functions to add the paramaters and define the missing datatypes, but I expect there's an automatic way to do it. Is there an option to simply load ddraw.h from the DirectX SDK and import all the function signatures and types?\n\n",

I could only get small headers to parse correctly.\n\nA good video about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u15-r5Erfnw\n\nMaybe you could ask that guy on Github to include the ddraw.h into his data type collection: https://github.com/0x6d696368/ghidra-data/tree/master/typeinfo\n\n",
