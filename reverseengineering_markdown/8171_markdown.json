      "content": "According to the SDK, the PDB loader is implemented as an IDA plugin (see the SDK, e.g: \\idasdk67\\plugins\\pdb).\n\nThe plugin name is \"pdb\", so you can call the plugin directly, like this:\n\n```\nidaapi.load_and_run_plugin(\"pdb\", call_code)\n\n```\nWhere call_code is an enum defined in \\idasdk67\\plugins\\pdb\\common.h,\n\n0, 1 and 2 are already defined and will ask for user input, but if you want to silently load a pdb for the actually loaded PE file, you can pass a value greater than 2, e.g.:\n\n```\nidaapi.load_and_run_plugin(\"pdb\", 3)\n\n```\nThat should do the trick (at least it worked for me :)\n\n```\nPython>idaapi.load_and_run_plugin(\"pdb\", 3)\nPDB: using DIA dll \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\VC\\msdia90.dll\"\nPDB: DIA interface version 9.0\nntkrpamp.pdb: not found, trying with the input file Z:\\Reverse\\Windows\\win8.1\\x86\\6.3.9600  \ntoskrnl.exe\nTrying loadDataForExe with ffffffff\nloadDataForExe: 0\nPDB: loaded 2055 types\nPDB: total 22027 symbols loaded for Z:\\Reverse\\Windows\\win8.1\\x86\\6.3.9600  \ntoskrnl.exe\nTrue\n\n```\n",

I looked in \\idasdk67\\plugins\\pdb\\ but coulnd't find anything useful :-/ Thanks again for your help :-)",
