  "content": "I want to know if there is already an MFC Decompiler?\nSo far, you have to decompile by hand - which is very tedious.\nI would like a tool like DeDe Decompiler. The C++ code itself is not important. It is important to decompile the project architecture and generate the appropriate header and cpp files.\n\nI really don't want to invent it myself. But, if there is no other choice - apparently - it will be necessary. Because already 3 projects are pending.\n\n",
