      "content": "Calling Conventions:\n\nYou may be referring to calling conventions and order of parameters being pushed. If so, here is an answer addressing as such. You can read more about calling conventions in general here.\n\nEndianness:\n\nYou may also be interested in reading about endianness from the NASM documentation:\n\nSource: https://www.nasm.us/doc/nasmdoc3.html\n\nMore research on your behalf to better understand this can be done by reading about the topic of endianness. It's confusing when you first run into it, but there are many charts like this one to help demonstrate it:\n\n\n\nImage source: https://agilescientific.com/blog/2017/3/31/little-endian-is-legal\n\nFinally, there's an excellent video from OpenSecurityTraining that does a great job of explaining endianness and order of parameters/arguments with calling conventions.
