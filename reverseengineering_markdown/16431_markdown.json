  "content": "I was curious about a system using NFC and I tried to find out what was the protocol. But after digging few days around, I have the card detected by my reader (acr122u) but that's all I get. I can't have any answer from the card.\n\n```\nnfc-list uses libnfc 1.7.1\nNFC device: ACS / ACR122U PICC Interface opened\n1 ISO14443B-2 ST SRx passive target(s) found:\nISO/IEC 14443-2B ST SRx (106 kbps) target:\n            UID: 9a  87  18  4e  XX  XX  XX  XX\n\n```\nHow can I get more informations on it ? Is it possible this card was only giving its UID ? \n\n",

It's really up to the card.\n\nThe two ways I can think of to identify the card's capabilities is either traced it back to the manufacturer (who bought it? What model/type of card was it?) or break it and find the chip and look at it under a microscope.\n\n",
