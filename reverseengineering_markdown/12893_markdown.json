  "content": "This might be a newbie question but it really takes too long to search for certain things in IDA, when I close the app and save the database all my searches are gone and that's just frustrating.\nI'm aware that I can copy and paste them all in text file but I prefer saving them in IDA itself.\n\nAny help will be much appreciated.\n\n",
