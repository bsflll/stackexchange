  "content": "I understand the basics of encryption and decryption, but I don't know where to go to talk to people and learn more. Are there any forums or resources to look at to learn more?\n\nFor example, I was given two Hex strings and told that the second was modified, but originally a ~90% match of the first:\n\n[3E 02 2D 06 7E 31 00 00 04 2A 7E 30 00 00 04 2A] \nand\n[5A E1 78 F3 72 2C 90 D3 07 4A 10 41 49 4B 0D C4 F7 5D 9E 32 7C 01 F5]\n\nI know the second one is encrypted because a simple statistical analysis shows a balanced distribution of values, but I don't know the process for trying to de-encrypt it.\n\n",
