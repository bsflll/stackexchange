  "content": "I have a Suse enterprise server 10 on VMWare. I want to remote debug an application in this VM using IDA pro, I already tried these:\n\nI think the problem is that linux_server has been compiled using newer versions of glibc, but that version of suse is using older versions.\nso I think the question is: How can I remote debug an application in old-linux machines? Is there exists an older version of debugger that runs is such scenarios?\n\n",
