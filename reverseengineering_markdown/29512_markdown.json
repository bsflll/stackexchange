To make use of the crowd knowledge on Stack Exchange, you need to add a lot of extra information we humans can make better use of than a computer. If legally and technically possible, provide a copy of the file, and a short explanation of the device it is intended to be used on.",

      "text": "The typical things for \"archive of some kind\" are words (32 bit or even 64 bits) that contain member lengths and possibly also file offsets. Depending on the archive type, there are also identifiers for the members like a name or ID numbers. Archives tend to have these member information records at the file begin, the end or in front of each member. If you are working on a challenge, I guess you job is to manually identify the archive structure",
