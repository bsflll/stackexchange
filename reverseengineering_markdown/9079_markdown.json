      "content": "Older compilers made space for function parameters on the stack by pushing them, and popping from the stack after the function call; newer compilers optimize this. For example, while a function gets executed, the stack changed like this:\n\n```\n start        calling       after         before scanf   after scanf \n              printf        printf                                   \n+-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+\n|return addr| |return addr| |return addr| |return addr| |return addr|\n+-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+\n|           | |           | |           | |           | |           |\n| local     | | local     | | local     | | local     | | local     |\n| variables | | variables | | variables | | variables | | variables |\n|           | |           | |           | |           | |           |\n|           | |           | |           | |           | |           |\n|           | |           | |           | |           | |           |\n|           | |           | |           | |           | |           |\n|           | |           | |           | |           | |           |\n|           | |           | |           | |           | |           |\n+-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+\n              | \"Enter..\" |               | password  |              \n              +-----------+               +-----------+              \n                                          | \"%s\"      |              \n                                          +-----------+              \n\n```\nYou see how sp (the bottom of the stack) changes with every function call.\nNewer versions of gcc change this; they make enough space on the stack (for local variables and all possible function parameters) from the beginning, and just move the parameters to addresses relative to the stack pointer:\n\n```\n start        calling       after         before scanf   after scanf \n              printf        printf                                   \n+-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+\n|return addr| |return addr| |return addr| |return addr| |return addr|\n+-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+\n|           | |           | |           | |           | |           |\n| local     | | local     | | local     | | local     | | local     |\n| variables | | variables | | variables | | variables | | variables |\n|           | |           | |           | |           | |           |\n|           | |           | |           | |           | |           |\n|           | |           | |           | |           | |           |\n|           | |           | |           | |           | |           |\n|           | |           | |           | |           | |           |\n|           | |           | |           | |           | |           |\n+-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+\n|           | |           | |           | | password  | |           |\n+-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+\n|           | | \"Enter..\" | |           | | \"%s\"      | |           |\n+-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+\n\n```\nNote how, from the beginning, the stack has the size it needs for the 4th step (before scanf), and how the \"Enter..\" string is moved directly to where the stack pointer is (so it's the first parameter on the stack), not to the space directly below local variables.\n\nSo to calculate the stack size from the source code, you need to know\n\nThis might change per compiler version as well. It seems that your compiler reserved 8 bytes for stack frame/canary; 64 (0x40) bytes for the password array, and another 16 bytes for function parameters, where 8 would have been sufficient (maybe for alignment reasons)?\n\nI wouldn't rely on any formula for the number of bytes needed; instead, check with the specific compiler i'm using, and prepare for this number to change whenever a different compiler gets used.\n\n",
