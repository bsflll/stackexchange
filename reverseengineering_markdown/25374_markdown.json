  "content": "i am trying to hook wndproc in an game, to do that i am injecting a dll into their memory, my problem is i don't wanna do a Global Hook to the wndproc, i want to get a pointer to his procedure to do thing more cleans and stealth. (I am still learning so i am right now a noob into assembly, if you want you can recommend me a good tutorial to learn assembly etc).\n\nPS: Sorry for my english.\n\nThis is what i mean for Global Hook:\n\n```\n//Global/Universal Hook example.\n#include <windows.h>\n\nstatic bool bSetup = false;\nWNDPROC oWndProc;\n\nLRESULT WndProc(const HWND hWnd, UINT msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)\n{\n    //Process messages\n    \n    return CallWindowProc(WindowProc, hWnd, msg, wParam, lParam);\n}\n\nvoid lpMain()//Our dll start here, we do our thing in this function.\n{\n    if (!bSetup)\n    {\n        WindowProc = (WNDPROC)SetWindowLongPtr(HWND, GWLP_WNDPROC, (LRESULT)WndProc);//our Global Hooked Procedure.\n    }\n}\n\nBOOL APIENTRY DllMain( HMODULE hModule, DWORD  ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved)\n{\n    switch (ul_reason_for_call)\n    {\n    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:\n        CreateThread(nullptr, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)lpMain, nullptr, 0, 0);//The trhead that call our function and maintain it alive.\n        break;\n    }\n    return TRUE;\n}\n\n```\nInstead of doing it by this way i want to hook it directly by the address/pointer of the target process also i want to avoid the CallWindowProc API call if it possible, i have been searching for the pointer with IDA Pro, x32dbg and Cheat engine but i haven't found it. How i can found a pointer to this? Thank you guys.\n\nI am injecting a dll to the process to trying to do this.\n\nGoal-Objective: The goal is hook the game procedure to use it instead of creating a global hook, also trying to avoid moost WinApi calls to be stealthy, cause anticheats can hook some API Functions and checks if they have been called or edited.\n\nExample of what i am trying to do (Detour hooking):\n\n```\n//This is that i want to do.\n#include <windows.h>\n#include \"detour.h\"//Microsoft detours header for hooking.\n#pragma comment(lib, \"detours.lib\");//Microsoft detours library.\n\nstatic bool bSetup = false;\nHWND GameHwnd = (HWND)((uintptr_t)GetModuleHandle(nullptr) + 0xA93158);\n\ntypedef LRESULT(__stdcall* wndProc) (HWND, UINT, WPARAM, lParam);//our prototype.\nwndProc oWindowProc = nullptr;//our function return.\n\n//offsets, pointers, addresses...\nuintptr_t ADDRESS_WNDPROC = (uintptr_t)GetModuleHandle(nullptr) + 0x283C3A;\n\nLRESULT HookedWndProc(const HWND hWnd, UINT msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)\n{\n    //Process messages\n    \n    return CallWindowProc(oWindowProc, hWnd, msg, wParam, lParam);\n}\n\nvoid lpMain()//Our dll start here, we do our thing in this function.\n{\n    if (!bSetup)//Hook Procedure and other stuff.\n    {\n        DetourTransactionBegin();\n        DetourUpdateThread(GetCurrentThread());\n        \n        DetourAttach(&(LPVOID&)ADDRESS_WNDPROC, &HookedWndProc);\n        \n        DetourTransactionCommit();\n        \n        oWindowProc = (WNDPROC)ADDRESS_WNDPROC;\n        \n        or\n        \n        //oWindowProc = (WNDPROC)SetWindowLongPtr(GameHwnd, GWLP_WNDPROC, (LRESULT)HookedWndProc);//our Global Hooked Procedure.\n        \n        bSetup = true;\n    }\n    \n    //do our things.\n}\n\nBOOL APIENTRY DllMain( HMODULE hModule, DWORD  ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved)\n{\n    switch (ul_reason_for_call)\n    {\n    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:\n        CreateThread(nullptr, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)lpMain, nullptr, 0, 0);//The trhead that call our function and maintain it alive.\n        break;\n    }\n    return TRUE;\n}\n\n```\n",

Sure, you're giving us a description of a particular path and asking for help, but it would be better if you gave us the context that comes with knowing the actual goal. In general SetWindowHookEx lets you do plenty and it also causes your DLL to be loaded into the target process (provided bitness matches and so on). The example you show won't work across process boundaries.",
