  "content": "i.e. on a page, I see that after i.e. 5 seconds of page load, there appears a message:\n\n```\nHello Akubatula, you are wonderful.\n\n```\nLets say, i want to find out, from where does the word wonderful comes from. It is not in source, I can't find it in  sources ( Inspect>Sources>CTRL+SHIFT+S)...\n\nHow can i find from which script/event it is loaded?\nI know a bit about breakpoints, but i was unable to find that moment/script, which triggers that event. Is that possible to breakpoint or search by that string?\n\n",
