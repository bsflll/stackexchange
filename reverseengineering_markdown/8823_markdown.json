  "content": "I decompiled an APK file,and that program have native codes in a .so file.\n\nI want to use that .so file in Linux in order to use inline functions.\nThese codes have functions to connect to a server and perform encryption/decryption on the data transfered.\n\nI decompiled that with IDA Pro too. Can I decompile and recompile ARM codes to a x64 CPU and run it in Linux ?\n\nOr, do I need a light simulator to run that ARM *.so file ?\n\nIDA Pro decompile the codes, I see the assembly functions but I'm not used to assembly, nor to reverse engineering. How to translates these functions to C or python functions ?\n\n",

This enables you to recompile C code to x86-64 architecture or anything else you need. And there is no such language as x64, I don't know who started using this, the only language which exists is x86-64/IA64 which is just the same thing.",

In particular Microsoft was using that term for x86-64 early on as they supported AMD and Intel CPUs. Wikipedia even mentions x64. Oh and sorry to break it to you, but x86-64 and IA-64 are not the same thing ... and \"IA64\" is even less of a thing. x(86-)64 is a 64-bit extension of IA-32. So while your advice with Ghidra may be valid in general, that wasn't available in 2015 to the public either.",

It will depend on the best option to choose.\n\nThe following options assume that you have analyzed the binary using a tool such as IDA, Hex-Rays or Hopper and that you could identify the functions that you want to reach.\n\nIf you need to emulate the calling conventions between a GLIB-based Linux system and a .so Android-targeted library, and that emulating the architecture is not a problem, for example because you have a x86 version of the library available in the APK:\n\nIf you need to emulate both the architecture and the Android ABIs:\n\nIf you need to emulate the architecture, the Android ABIs and you wish to have more control over the emulated binary at the expense of parsing the ELF/handling the memory layout with code yourself:\n\n",
