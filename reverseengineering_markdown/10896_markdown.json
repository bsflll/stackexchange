  "content": "I am trying to reverse engineer a packet protocol and I was abled to find a subroutine which is likely to be an encryption function. I do not know much about cryptography but it looked like a CBC encryption. Here's the pseudocode I got from IDA: http://pastebin.com/UGYpbthr and here is a part from the original subroutine: https://i.sstatic.net/EBlQa.png also here's a part from where the subroutine is called: https://i.sstatic.net/2S9Nc.png . Is it possible to translate this pseudocode to C code without further reverse engineering ? If so how should I do it ?\n\n",

W.S. is right in that the function doesn't access global variables; however, the three parameters (typed int by IDA) are in fact pointers, if you check their usage, so you need the data fields they point to anyway.",

If i were you, i'd run the original program until your function, note the data, step over the function, note the data again, then plug that into the blowfish source and check if it does the same stuff. You'll have to call mbedtls_blowfish_setkey first, and i'd guess might find this function in your original code as well if you look for it.",

You'll probably need to add some typedefs for basic types.\nPlease note that this code should be compiled as 32 bit code (or any other where sizeof int is equal to sizeof of pointer for your specific system) to avoid problems with pointer sizes. \n\n",
