  "content": "I am learning how to use IDC Scripting,or IDAPython in IDA for Reversing binary.One day i face this problem:\n\nYou are given an array of random integer(4-byte integer) lies within the memory .The random number only be calculated while debugging .\n\nThe task is : extract each of those 4-byte integer from that array and put them into a new array,print the new array on console.\n\nArcording to what i have learned,IDA Hex-view present only 1 Hex Number in memory for each address. \n\nFor Example : at address 00791A00 contains an integer 1134,00791A04 contains an iteger 4567.In Hex-view it will be like this\n\n```\n                     00791A00 : 34\n                     00791A01 : 11\n                     00791A02 : 00\n                     00791A03 : 00\n                     00791A04 : 67\n                     00791A05 : 45\n                     00791A06 : 00\n                     00791A07 : 00\n\n```\nAssuming the new array named \"arr\". So arr[0] = 0x1134,arr[1] = 0x4567. That's what i want!\nSo,i'm wondering how can i do that with IDAPython,or IDC?\nThe only thing i have known so far about IDC or IDAPython is writing a script to dump memory to a file.\n\nHere is the Link from where i learned to dump memory: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42744445/how-in-ida-can-save-memory-dump-with-command-or-script\n\nI would appreciate if someone could give me a hint or walk me through with basic ideas on how to solve this problem.\n\n",
