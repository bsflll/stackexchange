      "text": "I don't think that we will see such a tool soon because of two reasons: 1. Only the app developer her-/himself usually has an .aab file. You can't download it form anywhere, only generate if from an Android app you have the source code. 2. .aab files only make sense for uploading into Play Store. Therefore the use cases for modifying an .aab file are very limited. May be you should elaborate a bit more what you want to achieve and there is an easier way you have not noticed.",
