  "content": "I need some help in determining if an ELF file is signed or with a valid signature or not.\n\nI have used the readelf tool with -S option in order to view the section headers and more specifically, the sig section header. This is the result I got:\n\n```\n[30] .sha256_sig         PROGBITS         00000000000000000  00023276\n[31] .sig_key            PROGBITS         00000000000000000  00023676\n\n```\nFew questions:\n\n",

      "content": "The -S flag lists all section headers, not \"sig[nature] section header\". The S stands for \"sections\", not \"signature\".\n\nMoreover, these section names appear to be quite unrelated to linux itself, but are part of the linux AppImage application, a third party application framework that includes it's own signed update mechanism. The only references I could find to these section names are part of it's update mechanism as can be seen in this Pull Request.\n\n",
