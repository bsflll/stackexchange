      "content": "For conventional inline hooks (that just replace the first few bytes of the function), you can simply read the first few bytes of each function to check if it is hooked. Deeper inline hooks will be difficult to detect.\n\nApart from inline hooks, someone may also hook the SSDT. The SSDT is a table that sits between syscalls from WINAPI's and the kernelmode functions that implement them. The SSDT is indexed by syscall ID and maps each ID to the address of the kernelmode function. This mapping remains static for any given service pack for a Windows OS. So it is very easy to figure out what function each syscall ID corresponds to, and thus what function each entry in the SSDT should correspond to.\n\nTo detect SSDT hooks and restore original addresses, you could try any of the following:\n\nYou could load your program/driver once before the SSDT is hooked, and grab the original addresses. This would be fairly reliable, as long as you load your driver before the hook is in place.\n\nAlternatively, you could download the .pdb file from Microsoft's symbol store and get the original addresses from it using the DIA SDK or DbgHelp API's. This is very reliable as long as a connection is present and nothing is interfering with it. However, this would be quite slow for a .pdb as big as the one for ntoskrnl or win32k.\n\nThere are actually two SSDT's, a regular SSDT and a Shadow SSDT. If only the first SSDT is hooked, you could check the values with those in the Shadow SSDT. Or vice versa.\n\nYou can check if any entries in the SSDT point to addresses outside the kernel/win32k. This is a very reliable way of detecting the hooks, but it won't easily get you the original address.\n\nScanning for a byte signature is a somewhat reliable and stealthy way you could locate the original addresses.\n\nThere's also a similar question here\n\n",

To avoid the fake result in which the read API functions are also hooked, you should use some tricks to get the original read API function from memory.\n\nHope this help!\n\n",
