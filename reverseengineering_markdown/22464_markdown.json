  "content": "Some of 8051 chips use bank switching to extend accessible code memory.\nGood example is Silabs C8051F12x. Another example is here.\n\nCode area in range 0x0000..0x7ffff is common always accessible code bank.\nUpper side of code memory 0x8000..0xffff is mapped to banks in extended code memory which specified by some bank selector register.\n\nWhat is recipe to handle analysis of this kind of code overlaying?\n\n",
