  "content": "I am learning PE32+ (64 bit) files. I have added a new section to the PE32+ file and made the new section as the entry point. Some simple instructions are added in the new segment. Now I want to go to the old entry point after executing the new segment, then continue execution from there. I read the articles for PE32 that are using assembly language instructions. But I am not able get it working for 64 bit(tried to add .asm files). Please help me with any useful information. Is it possible to do it in C++?\n\n",
