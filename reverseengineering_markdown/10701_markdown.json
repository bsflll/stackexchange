  "content": "So, as you may know, many android bootloaders are based on the Little Kernel project on codeaurora, and as such one could say you have partial source to most android bootloaders, typically in the firmware packages you can find on the vendor sites, minus the proprietary bits most vendors add instead of the standard open source fastboot protocol.\n\nWith this in mind, what would be the best method to approach this disassembly?\n\nI am currently working against the output of objdump -D on the binary and comparing that to the same output on the compiled object files from the little kernel build. There are a number of 1:1 matches, but there are some portions that, while apparently analogous, are not quite correct. One would assume this to be due to changes made by the company, but I can't be sure on this matter.\n\n",
