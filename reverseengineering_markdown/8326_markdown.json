      "content": "You might want to look at this excellent explanation of the ARM boot process by Igor Skochinsky. Loading the boot loader at address 0, Architecture ARM, results in the first few lines\n\n```\nROM:00000000 dword_0         DCD 0x20002DE0\nROM:00000004                 DCD 0x20016AAD\nROM:00000008                 DCD 0x2000E241\nROM:0000000C                 DCD 0x2000E245\nROM:00000010                 DCD 0x2000E2B5\nROM:00000014                 DCD 0x2000E32D\nROM:00000018                 DCD 0x2000E3A5\nROM:0000001C                 DCD 0\nROM:00000020                 DCD 0\n\n```\nSo, 0x20002DE0 is the initial stack pointer, and 0x20016AAD is the entry point. \n\nThat entry point does not seem to be contained in the boot loader itself (which has 64 K + 256 bytes), but in the on-Chip ROM. From the answer:\n\nSo unless you can somehow dump the memory at 0x20016AAD, you won't be able to find out what the ROM does, and where within the ROM it jumps.\n\nFrom a brief glance at the code, i'd assume the entry point to be a 0xBA40, or maybe 0xBAC0 which calls 0xBA40, because this calls 0x0960. The first few instructions there (especially at 0x097a)\n\n```\nROM:00000960                 PUSH.W          {R4-R11,LR}\nROM:00000964                 SUB             SP, SP, #0x6C\nROM:00000966                 ADD             R0, SP, #0x90+var_88\nROM:00000968                 MOVS            R1, #0x34 ; '4'\nROM:0000096A                 BL              sub_1A58\nROM:0000096E                 BL              sub_8A8\nROM:00000972                 BL              sub_266\nROM:00000976                 BL              sub_1D8\nROM:0000097A                 ADR.W           R0, aStartBootloade ; \"  \n  \n  \nstart bootloader  \n\"\nROM:0000097E                 BL              sub_1E94\nROM:00000982                 MOVS            R1, #1\nROM:00000984                 LDR.W           R0, =0x40020000\nROM:00000988                 BL              sub_193E\n\n```\nseem to be an indication that the bootloader starts there, and sub_1E94 is a generic string output function (it gets called lots of times, every time with a string address in R0).\n\n",
