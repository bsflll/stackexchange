      "content": "I'll present the steps that I would perform in such a case. Note that they aren't necessarily the most efficient and reliable ones although they should work in many cases. I'm assuming that the binary you want to examine isn't packed and obfuscated.\n\nIn case all previous methods failed (most likely), it is time for dynamic analysis. Since you don't know where to set the breakpoints, you can set them at all the function calls in the program (possibly excluding library functions you aren't interested in). I wrote radare2 script performing exectly this task. \n\nAssume we want to find out how Google Chrome parses xml files. I would modify this script to log each distinct function call and then simply continue. I would then open Google Chrome in debugger (possibly radare2 but can be any other you can write scripts for) and just wait a couple of seconds with empty page to gather all the functions it calls when doing \"nothing special\". \n\nI would then rerun it, but this time with opening some xml file (for instance by drag and drop onto the empty page). Now, you can compare the files containing all the procedures called and see which extra ones are present in the second file. These (or at least some of them) should be responsible for parsing xml files.\n\n",
