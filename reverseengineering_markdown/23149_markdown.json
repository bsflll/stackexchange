  "content": "I have a variable called var_14h in disassemble code. I want to rename this variable. I try to rename the variable by using the following\n\n```\nafvn var_14h i\n\n```\nHowever, radare complains and returns an error: \n\n```\nCant find var by name\n\n```\nWhen i just execute afv the variable is listed: \n\n```\nvar int64_t var_14h @ rbp-0x14\n\n```\nI've tried to refer using rbp-0x14, [var_14h], however, nothing seems to work. What am i missing? \n\n",
