      "content": "It seems like .p files are AES encrypted, with an unknown key, and have been since 2008 from the date of these posts.\n\nHowever, as matlab itself can read those files, it needs to include the decryption algorithm and key, from where it can be reverse engineered. And it seems like someone has done this and produced an online .p code decryptor. They won't share the code, but you can use the online decryptor.\n\nSo, to answer your question: Yes, there is an online decriptor for it.\n\n",
