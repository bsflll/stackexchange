  "content": "I have a structure which looks like this:\n\n```\n RefString struct\n     RefCount dd ?\n     StrLen   dd ?\n     CString  db...\n RefString ends\n\n```\nWhen the code passes around a pointer, it doesn't point to the beginning of the struct (RefCount), instead it points to CString, which is allocated as a normal C-String with a zero terminating character, as well as having the strlen and a refcount. So when the code accesses the strlen or refcount it uses ptr-4 respectively ptr-8.\n\nActually that's quite a nice construct, because this way the string can be used as a delphistring, but also directly passed to some system functions without the need of converting back and forth. \n\nNow I wonder though, if it is possible in IDA to create a struct with the basepointer to the string and it knows that the other fields are with the negative offset.\n\n",

If you setup custom structure in \"Structures\" subview. Subsequently, You can manually set whatever variable you choose to be the type of that particular variable. Thereafter, IDA will replace references within disassembly view with appropriate offsets to the structure members.  \n\nIf IDA \"lands\" in what seems to be the middle of the structure.

Your solution works at least partway, because with this I can assign the member names, which helps. A drawback is still that a globabl structure pointer causes some problems, because it points not there, but as you said, it's a workaround.",
