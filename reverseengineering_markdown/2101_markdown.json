Kris Kasperski a.k.a. nzumi gave quiet a an answer to the above question in his blog. It outdated but I hope it works. I'd appreciate if guys from IDA, can comment about Kris's solutions and it being applicable say from v5 of IDA and on.\n\nKris's solution:\n\nhow to load two or more files into the same IDA-Pro database\n\nextract: \n\n```\nvoid idaapi run(int arg)\n{\nload_info_t *ld;\nwarning(“plugin \\”dual-load\\” is called!”);\n\n/* NOTE: KERNEL32.DLL and NTDLL.DLL has to be in the current directory!!! */\nld = build_loaders_list(“KERNEL32.DLL”);\nload_nonbinary_file(“KERNEL32.DLL”, “KERNEL32.DLL”, “.”, NEF_SEGS | NEF_RSCS | NEF_NAME | NEF_IMPS | NEF_CODE, ld);\n/* qfree(ld);\n\nld = build_loaders_list(“NTDLL.DLL”); */\nload_nonbinary_file(“NTDLL.DLL”, “NTDLL.DLL”, “.”, NEF_SEGS | NEF_RSCS | NEF_NAME | NEF_IMPS | NEF_CODE, ld);\nqfree(ld);\n}\n\n```\nI did not try it yet. \n\n",
