      "content": "This is right, and it was caused by using the wrong grep (the ~ character) in the article. This was due the fact that the output of dmi libc is different on different machines and also, the syntax of the dmi output was changed. The grep you showed (~&GLOBAL, exit:0) is indeed wrong.\n\nThe grep is there, for the first place, in order to filter functions that contain in them, the name of the function we are searching for (i.e puts, exit, system). This way, the reader could narrow down the results and keep only the relevant functions.\n\nI came up with a better, more elegant, solution for the grep:\n\n```\n[0x7f99e22006a0]> dmi libc puts~ puts$\n422 0x000809c0 0x7f99e1a809c0   WEAK   FUNC  512 puts\n\n[0x7f99e22006a0]> dmi libc exit~ exit$\n132 0x00043120 0x7f99e1a43120 GLOBAL   FUNC   26 exit\n\n[0x7f99e22006a0]> dmi libc system~ system$\n1403 0x0004f440 0x7f99e1a4f440   WEAK   FUNC   45 system\n\n```\nThis will ensure that the user would get the expected results, and them only.\nThis is now fixed in the article itself.\n\n",
