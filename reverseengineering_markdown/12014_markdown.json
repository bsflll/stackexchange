Unfortunately, IDA Pro, Immunity and OllyDbg are all not accessible to a blind person using a screenreader.\n\nAre there any good alternatives on both windows and Linux for these tools?\nI have used gdb on Linux a little and WinDbg on windows as well.\n\nI just need a recommendation on what is industry standard if the three biggies can't be used?\n\nThanks,\nDon\n\n",

I still use an old IDA Pro demo in a Mac Terminal - so 'plain characters only' - , and for me it's as good as any new-fangled Windows version. Plus, it has a delightful retro 90s MS-DOS look and feel.",

A text-based version of IDA might be exactly what I am looking for. Something that does a real good job of disassembling and/or decompiling would be helpful.all gui applications are inaccessible, in fact many of the gui programs are very accessible. Unfortunately, anything written using the QT or GTK+ development kits are for the most part inaccessible.",

I'm quite sure that everyone would be happy to help you/implement missing features on the irc channel!\n\n",

      "content": "A thought - Visual Studio has good accessibility features (according to their blog at least) and it can display assembly code for a compiled app. This is good if you want to learn what complied constructs look like in binary. Courses such as http://opensecuritytraining.info/IntroX86.html use Visual Studio for code analysis exclusively. I understand the videos for this course are not narrated well from a point of view of a blind person, but they are still useful even if you cannot see what is happening.\n\nAlso, Windbg is a very good debugger these days. You will be priceless if you master Windbg. Ollie is for wussies :) Immunity is essentially a few years' old version of Ollie with some plugins for exploit development.\n\n",

With their help, in recent versions of IDA (especially 6.95) we made big improvements for accessibility, especially on Windows and Linux (OS X is working somewhat but not as well). So I suggest you to try the demo version to see how it works with your screen reader. Feel free to contact us with any issues; we're always willing to make IDA even more accessible.\n\n",

Pyew is a malware-analysis framework for Python, but Bokken can be useful as an extra set of eyes in your reverse engineering toolchain for any purpose.\n\nAnother great alternative is EmilPRO, a front-end for objdump (from the GNU binutils package). EmilPRO's main claim is support for many architectures, primarily leveraging the GNU binutils support of popular file types such as ELF, PE, and Mach-O. It's name is a play on IDA Pro. It has support for Qt and GTK.\n\n",
