  "content": "I've discovered undname.exe today and tried it on several functions. I got some incorrect results and I'm wondering why. I see two main reasons that could do that:\n\nHere's an example of a wrong result: \n\n```\nUndecoration of :- \"?GetClassNameW@User@@QAE?AVFName@@H@Z\"\nis :- \"public: class FName __thiscall User::GetClassNameW(int)\"\n\n```\nAfter trying this signature and receiving a stack error, I looked at the disassembled code of GetClassNameW and realised the function signature actually was void(__thiscall* user_getClassNameW)(User*, FName*, int); \n\nI do not know the exact version of msvc used to compile the example and it seems that the only way to download undname.exe is to install visual studio, so I can't easily test this.\n\nAny idea where the problem could come from?\n\n",

      "content": "As @blabb says undname is correct so it's your other tool that is 'incorrect'.\nHowever, it's worth looking at this in more detail as it's probably not as incorrect as you think.\n\nTo understand this though you have to delve a little into ABIs and think how a C++ function call works in practice.\n\nFirstly, a C++ member function is in some sense like a C function with a 'hidden' this pointer passed as the first parameter.  (This is what __thiscall is saying behind the scenes.)\n\n```\n// this function\nvoid class::member();\n// is really\nvoid __thiscall class::member();\n\n// and works like\nvoid __stdcall class_member( Class* this );\n\n```\nSecondly, the caller of function returning a ('complicated') struct/class is responsible for allocating the memory for the struct/class and passing the function a pointer to this memory.  The function can then write the relevant details there.  Hence -\n\n```\n// this function\ncomplex_struct_return_type function();  \n\n// works like\nvoid function( complex_struct_return_type * );\n\n```\nPutting these together (and ignoring accessiility specifiers)-\n\n```\n// this function\nFName __thiscall User::GetClassNameW( int param );\n\n// works like\nvoid __stdcall User_GetClassNameW( User* this, FName* pointer_to_return_value, int param );\n\n```\nYou will see this is very similar is essence to your other tool's output.\nI'd just observe that -\n\nHow these parameters get passed (by msvc) depends on whether it's compiled for 32 or 64-bit .\n\n",
