  "content": "What is the meaning of this kind of jmp instruction in x86 assembly in IDA?\n\n\n\nDoes it mean that we should jump to the address [6CA2E9B0] + 8 or [6CA2E9B0+8]?\nWhen I follow that off_XXX, I get to the memory region that looks like this:\n\n\n\nIs this some kind of a jump table? loc_6C954360 is indeed pointed by the address 6CA2E9B0, does it mean that the instruction in question jumps to the address pointed by 6CA2E9B0+8? If that's the case, then I must've messed something up in the debugger as the computed address didn't seem to be the same as the one stored in memory.\n\nEDIT:\nI read about the FF /5 jump which I believe is present here:\n\n\nIt should load to EIP the far address stored in the memory location specified by the 4 bytes next to the FF 25. And it seems like it is how it works, as I managed to see that happening in the debugger. However, the address after FF 25 is slightly modified when the library is loaded into a process, are those addresses somehow adjusted once the process starts using the library?\nAlso what is the point of this kind of jumps, why are functions defined in this way?\n\n",
