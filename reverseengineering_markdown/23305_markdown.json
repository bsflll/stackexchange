  "content": "When I type gdb a.out and then run inside the gdb itself I get stuck on the empty line:\n\n```\njericho-laptop:exploit.education jericho$ gdb a.out \nGNU gdb (GDB) 9.1\n...\nReading symbols from a.out...\n(No debugging symbols found in a.out)\n(gdb) run\nStarting program: /Users/jericho/Desktop/exploit.education/a.out \n[New Thread 0x2703 of process 53514]\n[New Thread 0x2603 of process 53514]\n\n  <<< STUCK IN HERE >>>\n\n```\nIt obviously says 2 threads of a process 53514 were created. Though the program is not multi-threaded it is a simple tiny C crackme with only a main function.\n\nThe console gets stuck, I can type whatever I want but I can't get it to continue and I can't get it to quit. I have to forcibly close the terminal window.\n\nI don't know what to do. The GDB does the same for any other binary I try to run. I am using MacOS with gdb 9.1 which I codesigned.\n\n",

      "content": "If you've only opened the program in GDB and used run, then your program will start without stopping to let you debug it. GDB will typically only begin prompting you for input on an exception, signal, or breakpoint.\n\nWhat you most likely need to do is to set a breakpoint on main, or some other function of interest, and then use run. This will make gdb stop at the breakpoint and prompt you for what to do next.\n\nA handy alternative to b main; run is the start command. start will drop a breakpoint at main, or any other appropriate entry point in the binary, and immediately begin running the program.\n\nIn summary, the following should work:\n\n```\n$ gdb a.out\n...\n\n(gdb) b main\n...\n\n(gdb) run <args>\n\n```\nOr with start:\n\n```\n$ gdb a.out\n...\n\n(gdb) start <args>\n...\n\n```\nMore information and detail is available here:\n\n",

You can then retry run (or start) until it works.\n\n",
