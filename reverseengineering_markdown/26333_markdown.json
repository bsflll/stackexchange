  "content": "I've download recaf jar file and install JDK 8. When I execute it/start it, it all works fine with java -jar recaf-2.12.0-J8-jar-with-dependencies.jar. I open a class file also no problem. The issue is when I try to edit it is disabled saying:\n\n```\n// =============================================== //\n// Recompile disabled. Please run Recaf with a JDK //\n// =============================================== //\n\n// Decompiled with: CFR 0.150\n...\n\n```\nAny idea why and how to solve this issue? This is my first time using recaf as well so it might be a newbie question.\n\n",
