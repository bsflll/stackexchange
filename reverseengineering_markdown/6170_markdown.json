  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/6170/ida-api-query-number-of-parameters-for-cdecl-functions",
  "content": "I'm writing a script that, among other things, reads and does some processing with parameters to a function. Right now my solution to find the number of arguments for a given function at addr is:\n\n```\n(GetStrucSize(GetFrame(addr)) - GetFrameSize(addr))/4\n\n```\nThis is on x86. The issue is when I'm calling, for example, printf(), the difference between the two GetXXX() calls is 5 which obviously messes up the math.\n\nAt the moment I've worked around it by checking if the first parameters is a format string with format specifiers and then parsing it manually to get the real count, but that's not really extensible.\n\nIs there a way in the confines of the API to deal with this?\n\nEdit: I should have made this clearer in the question but this is specifically referring to the IDA API. I could write the code myself to calculate cleanup but in interest of keeping my code clean I'm trying to avoid a lot of code querying if it's stdcall and cdecl and then searching/parsing myself\n\n",

      "content": "For cdecl the caller needs to clean up the stack. So somewhere after the function call there HAS to be a stack operation that removes the parameters from the stack (remove as in adjust the stack pointer)\n\n```\nPUSH 0xABCDEF01\nCALL function\nADD ESP, 4 ; sizeof(DWORD) (the parameter)\n\n```\nIt does NOT need to be directly after the call. (I think VS08 sometimes puts the return value check before it)\nSo this is equally valid\n\n```\nPUSH 0xABCDEF01\nCALL function\nTEST EAX, EAX\nADD ESP, 4 ; sizeof(DWORD) (the parameter)\n; A conditional jump probably\n\n```\nas is this\n\n```\nPUSH 0xABCDEF01\nCALL function\nPOP EAX \n\n```\nBecause EAX holds a DWORD and thus removes sizeof(DWORD) == 4 bytes from the stack. (This obviously also holds true for all other general purpose extended registers).\n(It is POSSIBLE that e.g. for N parameters one could use N POP but I'm certain that no compiler does that and for every N > 2 it will lead to bigger code so it is unrealistic to happen in handwritten assembly too.)\n\nThere doesn't exists a maximum N of instructions that you could check after the call to determine whether that stack operation is the cleanup code. However I think that 5 will work for almost all cases (If you by chance do already know that this function is CDECL then check as many as you want)\n\nAlso for functions where the return value isn't important but is called before the return value of another function is inspected, one can save a variable like this:\n\n```\nCALL function1\nPUSH EAX ; Save EAX\nPUSH something\nCALL function2\nPOP EAX ; Remove the something parameter\nPOP EAX ; Restore the return value of function1\n\n```\nYou could try to also count the PUSH but that comes with it's own sort of intermediate instructions - this is really common:\n\n```\nPUSH something\nLEA EAX, something_else ; Get a pointer to something_else\nPUSH EAX \nPUSH more\nCALL function\n\n```\nSo you cannot stop working 'up' as soon as you hit an instruction that isn't a PUSH. \n\nIn conclusion there isn't a perfect solution but I think both can lead to a pretty reliable value; Which one you choose (or maybe both?) is up to you, IMO the first one (Searching for the stack cleanup) is easier to implement.\n\n",
