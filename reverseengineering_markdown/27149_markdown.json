  "content": "So I run radare2 from the command line with r2 - and attempt to display the help with the ? command. I read this line which says:\n\n ?[??][expr]             Help or evaluate math expression\n\nI am not sure how to read this. I assume the first ? is Help command. And the rest [??][expr] is evaluate math expression. However, something like this ?? 0xa does not return anything. So, my question is how to correctly interpret this output from the help.\n\n",
