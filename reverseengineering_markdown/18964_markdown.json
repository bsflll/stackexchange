  "content": "This is an extension of my previous question. Here is a sample of assembly in x64 Windows executable using COM virtual function with __fastcall convention.\n\n```\nmov     [rsp+32], rdx                       ; 5th param\nlea     r9, var                             ; 4th param\nxor     r8d, r8d                            ; 3rd param\nmov     rdx, r14                            ; 2nd param\nmov     rcx, r15                            ; 1st param\nmov     rax, [rax+24]                       ; 4th function pointer\ncall    cs:__guard_dispatch_icall_fptr      ; call dynamic dispatch\n\n```\nIn pseudocode, IDA shows only 4 parameters, 5th one is vanished.\nIDA shows like this: (ppv + 24)(a, b, c, d);\nBut the real function definition will be like this: (ppv + 24)(a, b, c, d, e);\n\n",
