  "content": "I am having trouble displaying simple text.\nI am trying to do it all in machine code with INT 10h, but:\n\nI considered doing it by writing directly to memory-mapped VGA memory, but that appeared harder than using interrupts from BIOS. And I'm not fully knowledgeable on this full scope of how that'd work.\n\nCan anyone help me sort this out here, please? I don't need help with x86 instructions per se, but with how I'd encode this all in binary properly, and where to find all interrupts' opcodes.\n\n",

As there have been 16-bit bootloaders, remember windows3.11 for example. Lastly, this should be on stack overflow. For RE-SE (this one) I'd recommend you try to reverse a 16-bit bootloader :)",

      "content": "Regarding (2), you don't load the entire string into the segment register, you take the selector for the memory region that holds the string, and place that into the segment register.  For 16-bit bootloader environment, it's probably going to be the same as CS, so you just push cs, pop ds (though usually cs=ds=es=ss already on startup, anyway).\n\nTo write to the video memory, just load 0xb800 into es, and then the brute-force way to write to the screen looks like:\n\n```\nmov es:[0], 'H'\nmov es:[2], 'e'\nmov es:[4], 'l'\nmov es:[6], 'l'\nmov es:[8], 'o'\n\n```\nAnd, so on. This is not the optimal way, of course.  Normally, you would use a loop and a string operation, or just use the BIOS calls.\n\n",
