  "content": "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/247623/item.dat\nThis is a file from a Java game, and I would like to know how to legible string data from it.\n\nI would prefer if only hints were given to me.\n\nI have looked into it with a Hex Editor and come to the conclusion that the file is either compressed or encrypted because of the lack of a pattern.\n\nIf it is encrypted, I have no idea how to proceed.\nIf it is compressed, I have found the following but have no idea how to proceed.\n\nAssume I have minimal knowledge of what I am doing, so several hints may be required.\nMore information can be given upon request.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

      "content": "Piece of cake: this is ZIP-compatible compressed compiled Java. Any familiar sequences of bytes near the header?\n\n```\nFA CE AF 0E 10 00 10 00 78 9C AC DD ..\n\n```\n.. those first few bytes look like Java's magic ID CA FE BA BE, but Googling that sequence doesn't yield any results, and it might be a red herring anyway. Next up: 10 00 10 00, which can be about anything (not a file length, but perhaps some internal flag or ID).\n\nNext: 78 9C. These are familiar, they may form a set of ZLIB compatible compression flags. A quick-and-dirty ZLIB unpacker gave me (1) a positive unpacking result (meaning this data is valid compressed data and could be uncompressed), and (2) an output file much larger than the input (1,388,603 bytes vs. the original 384,802).\n\nInspecting the decompressed data I found this at the start:\n\n```\n01 09 00 31 5B 4C 63 6F 6D 2E 74 68 72 65 65 72 69 6E 67\n73 2E 70 72 6F 6A 65 63 74 78 2E 69 74 65 6D 2E 63 6F 6E\n\n```\nor, in ASCII,\n\n```\n...1[Lcom.threering\ns.projectx.item.con\n\n```\n-- enough to conclude it has been decompressed successfully. From this point on, you should be able to use common Java-decrypting/decompiling techniques.\n\n",

      "content": "It can be difficult to differentiate well compressed data (e.g., LZMA) from well encrypted data (e.g., AES). I've done a bit of analysis in the past however, and found that a lot of compressed data can be distinguished from encrypted data based on entropy analysis, as you have obviously already done.\n\nHowever, I would take a simpler approach first. Look for common \"magic\" strings and/or headers in the file, such as those for gzip, zlib, and lzma. It may be that the game developers are using a standard compression, they've just added a custom header for their application.\n\n",
