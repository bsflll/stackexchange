      "content": "According to documentation the first one is base object destructor and the second one is deleting destructor. \n\n```\nConstructors and destructors are simply special cases of <unqualified-name>, where the final <unqualified-name> of a nested name is replaced by one of the following:\n\n\n  <ctor-dtor-name> ::= C1   # complete object constructor\n           ::= C2   # base object constructor\n           ::= C3   # complete object allocating constructor\n           ::= D0   # deleting destructor\n           ::= D1   # complete object destructor\n           ::= D2   # base object destructor\n\n```\nAccording to ARM IHI 0041D document the difference between these destructors is as follows:\n\n```\nThis ABI requires C1 and C2 constructors to return this (instead of being void functions) so that a C3 constructor\ncan tail call the C1 constructor and the C1 constructor can tail call C2.\nSimilarly, we require D2 and D1 to return this so that D0 need not save and restore this and D1 can tail call D2 (if\nthere are no virtual bases). D0 is still a void function.\n\n```\n",
