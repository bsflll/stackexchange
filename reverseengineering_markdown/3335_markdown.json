  "content": "Still on my way to understand how to prevent the usage of the -d (decompress) option of UPX (see this question), I try to identify the header file of UPX in ELF executable files.\n\nLooking at the code, all the sources seems to be in the files lx_elf.h and lx_elf.cpp (stands for Linux Elf). I tried to follow the code but I got lost in it...\n\nI also did take a look at the beginning of an UPX compressed executable file (amd64), visualized in 8-bytes per line mode for more clarity (and thanks to Corkami ELF-101):\n\n```\n00000000: 7f45 4c46 0201 0103  .ELF....\n00000008: 0000 0000 0000 0000  ........\n00000010: 0200 3e00 0100 0000  ..>.....\n00000018: 0831 4200 0000 0000  .1B.....

And indeed, when looking at the original ELF header of the executable (before applying upx) we find:\n\n```\n00000000: 7f45 4c46 0201 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000  .ELF............\n00000010: 0200 3e00 0100 0000 7028 4000 0000 0000  ..>.....p(@.....\n00000020: 4000 0000 0000 0000 e86d 0500 0000 0000  @........m......\n00000030: 0000 0000 4000 3800 0800 4000 1c00 1b00  ...@.....\n00000040: 0600 0000 0500 0000 4000 0000 0000 0000  ........@.......\n00000050: 4000 4000 0000 0000 4000 4000 0000 0000  @.@.....@.@.....\n00000060: c001 0000 0000 0000 c001 0000 0000 0000  ................\n00000070: 0800 0000 0000 0000 0300 0000 0400 0000  ................\n00000080: 0002 0000 0000 0000 0002 4000 0000 0000  ..........@.....\n\n```\nA few fields have been omitted in the compressed version but the header is mainly preserved. So, lets assume this is just a short version of the original ELF header.\n\nBut, what I would like to understand are the fields of the first header:\n\n```\n00000080: 487d 0500 0000 0000  H}......\n00000088: 487d 6500 0000 0000  H}e.....\n00000090: 487d 6500 0000 0000  H}e.....\n00000098: 0000 0000 0000 0000  ........\n000000a0: 0000 0000 0000 0000  ........    UPX HEADER (???)\n000000a8: 0000 2000 0000 0000  .. .....\n000000b0: a298 b634 5550 5821  ...4UPX!\n000000b8: f407 0d16 0000 0000  ........\n000000c0: 1676 0500 1676 0500  .v...v..\n000000c8: 0002 0000 bd00 0000  ........\n000000d0: 0200 0000 fbfb 21ff  ......!.\n\n```\nSo, my question is about discovering the location and the meaning of the fields of the UPX header. If somebody knows about UPX internals any hint would be appreciated.\n\n",

If you take a look to the source code you will see that it checks for the magic string UPX_MAGIC_LE32 in p_lx_interp.cpp. So, I simply changed all matches of the string (in binary chunks) \"UPX!\" to \"AAA!\". I copied /bin/ls (ELF64) to another folder and packed with UPX.

Anyway, remember that you're only preventing this tool to unpack UPX compressed files. UPX is a compressor that anyone with basic knowledge about packers can uncompress with little to no effort.\n\n",
