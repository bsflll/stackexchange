  "content": "I'm reversing a program that dynamically loads SetUnhandledExceptionFilter and uses it to set a function as an exception handler. It then calls int 2D - so that execution transfers to the function only when the program is not being debugged.\n\nI want to see how the function behaves dynamically - specifically because I'm having trouble understanding how it works with its EXCEPTION_POINTER* parameter - but I can't really do that because execution won't even transfer there while I'm debugging.\n\nHow can I make IDA execute int 2D so that I can see execution transfer to the exception handler function and see its behavior dynamically?\n\nI tried following the advice in this answer, but it didn't help: changing 0x2DCD to 0x2DFF had the exact same effect - the program crashed.\n\n",

      "content": "The KERNEL32.UnhandledExceptionFilter() is special, because it checks for the presence of a debugger, and refuses to call the process-defined UnhandledExceptionFilter() if one is present.  In order to reach the process-defined routine, you need to set a breakpoint on NTDLL.NtQueryInformationProcess(), and check for these parameters on the stack: -1, 7, a pointer, 4, 0.  When you see it, you can step over the function, change the return value to -1, and resume execution.  Then the filter function will be called.\n\n",
