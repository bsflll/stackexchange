  "content": "I am reversing a raw flash image (Micron MT29F16G08ABACA), and I am currently stuck trying to find the correct ECC algorithm.\n\nWhat I know thus far:\n\nMy guess would be a BCH ECC algorithm. But all BHC algorithms I could find result in an all-zero ECC code corresponding with an all-zero data input.\n\nI did find this relevant github project (github.com/cyberdong/bch_encoder_decoder), which appears to contain a leaked ECC algorithm for the same family of Micron Nand Flash devices.\nBut even this encoder is generating an all-zero ECC code for an all-zero data input.\n\nWhich ECC algorithm could this be?\nIs it possible to have a BCH encoder to generate a non-zero ECC code for an all-zero data input?\n\n",
