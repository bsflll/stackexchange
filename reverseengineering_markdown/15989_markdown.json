  "content": "If I'm looking at a binary compiled with VC++ in a hex editor and I want to identify the start of functions - I can look for the hex \"55 8B\" - which is a common function prolog.\n\nIs there something equivalent with .net CIL? I.e. is there a hex pattern I can look for to identify the start of functions raw?\n\nThe application here is to look for shared code between malware samples.\n\n",

      "content": "There is no real prolog in IL code because it does not need to manage the stack, save clobbered registers, or do any other standard bookkeeping necessary in the native code. \n\nHowever, the bytecode itself is preceded by the method header, and those have a limited number of possibilities. From the book .NET IL Assembler:\n\nSo if you take some .NET binaries, look up method RVAs in the metadata and go to that RVA in the binary, you can collect some patterns of headers and use them to find bytecode in the binary. (although I would suggest just using metadata in the first place - it lists locations of all legitimate methods in the binary).\n\n",

      "content": "I dont think .NET is as simple.. you can clearly see it in IDA Pro - there at least a few different one byte function prologues.\n\nWhy not use a decompiler library for dnSpy/de4dot - dnlib to decompile and then use code clone detection, for example Simian or implement some fuzzy matching (hashing?) algorithm.\n\n.NET generally decompiles nicely when its not packed or obfuscated. If it is however obfuscated or packed you will not have a great deal of success in matching the functions.\n\n",
