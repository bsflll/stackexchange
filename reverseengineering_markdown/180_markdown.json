LLVM allows something similar but barfs when including Windows.h.\n\nIs there a compiler that will allow me to get access to the AST right before link time, and produce a Windows executable?\n\n",

Now it appears to be dead, I get 404's for each of the links on the MS research page, so it seems to me that this project was discontinued.\n\nIf you're interested in using LLVM/CLANG on Windows you might want to have a look at this page, which offers an extension to use LLVM from within VS. I gave it a short try and cannot say much about it, but it should allow you to compile and build extensions for LLVM on Windows.\n\n",
