  "content": "This question is loosely related to this one. So I know of manual loading and how to achieve loading the PE headers using it.\n\nBut suppose I have already worked on an IDB for a while and realize that there are code references back to the PE headers, so I'd like to revise my initial decision (it's what I've always done so far ... sort of cargo-culting).\n\nAny way of doing this, short of exporting my work up until now into an .idc and starting over?\n\n",
