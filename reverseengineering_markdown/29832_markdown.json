  "content": "I have a exe file that packed with molebox and protected with obsidium.\n\n\n\nI try to unpack it with demoleition but it has some problem. when I want to open the unpacked file\nit says \"Component 'ImpulseAniLabel.ocx' or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid\".\nAfter that I try to open it with x32dbg and debug it.\nBut I couldn't change any assembly code. I mean that when I change an assembly code and patch the file, it will be the same of the first code. There is not any changing in the codes. It won't do any changing.\n\n",

So something has to have happened between question and answer for it to succeed now. Please add that to your answer and accept the answer, because that's what this site is about.",
