  "content": "I have assembly code like this:\n\n```\n   142cccc0c c7 43 18        MOV        dword ptr [RBX + 0x18],0x4000\n             00 40 00 00\n   142cccc13 e8 a8 79        CALL       FUN_141a845c0                                    undefined FUN_141a845c0()\n             db fe\n   142cccc18 8b f0           MOV        ESI,EAX\n\n```\nIt's a part of some function. I'd like to add my own function call after that and pass the return value (I guess it's stored in ESI).\n\nI saw this: adding instructions in IDA, but I'm wondering if there's any easier method?\n\n",
