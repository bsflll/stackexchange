  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/29961/is-it-possible-to-dump-firmware-of-a-device-via-usb-port",
  "content": "I have a device which can be connected via USB port. The vendor of this device provides a tool for upgrading firmware of this device via USB port.\nlsusb command says that this device has following VendorID and ProductID 0483:5748 STMicroelectronics Program Upgrade V1.0. So I assume that this device is STM based. My question is - if there is a tool for uploading firmware to device via USB, is there a way of downloading current firmware of this device via USB back to my PC? And if there is such way, how do I do that? I stumbled across some links on the Internet like this one https://medium.com/techmaker/reverse-engineering-stm32-firmware-578d53e79b3 it recommends to use openocd tool. But in my case openocd just gives me an error\n\n```\nOpen On-Chip Debugger 0.11.0-rc2\nLicensed under GNU GPL v2\nFor bug reports, read\n        http://openocd.org/doc/doxygen/bugs.html\nWARNING: interface/stlink-v2.cfg is deprecated, please switch to interface/stlink.cfg\nInfo : auto-selecting first available session transport \"hla_swd\".
