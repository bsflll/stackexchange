  "content": "I am investigating car navigation software which runs on QNX and want to replace the startup animation with my own. I have found the files in the firmware which have the extension .canim which likely stands for compressed animation.\n\nThe files are zlib compressed and after deflating the files start with HEX 41 4E 49 4D 31 20 20 20 20 03 00 00 E0 01 00 00(ANIM1). My question is what file format is this? (possible match: Amiga ANIM)\n\nI know that the screen resolution for the device is 800x480 so after DWORD 3&4 are resolution (20 03 00 00 -> 80 and E0 01 00 00 -> 480\n\nI've uploaded the files here, bin files are deflated versions of the .canim files.\n\nEDIT: some additional info: I found startup pictures in the same folder and they are zlib compressed and are simple RGB pairs with a padding 00 to align at DWORD, eg : 04 02 04 00 04 02 04 00 04 02 04 00 04 02 04 00\n\nEDIT2: This site has video's for each of the possible startup animations.\nAnd these are the startup pictures I have extracted:\n\n\nand\n\n\n\n",
