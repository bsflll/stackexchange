Given the description, if you don't need too fast speeds, I am inclined to recommend a hardware like the GreatFET which at first you could place in between your USB hub and the device (don't know which is which in your scenario; but I'd guess the arm is the device) to capture communication. Later you could then use that to test your findings rather easily.",
