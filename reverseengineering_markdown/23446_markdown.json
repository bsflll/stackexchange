      "content": "If this is C# (or any other .NET file) you need to use a tools such as .NET reflector to \"decompile\" it into .NET intermediate language.\n\nAnyhow...\n\nThe error you are seeing means that at the end of a function the stack pointer (typically the ESP register) does not point to the address expected by the function type, for example: it may have PUSHed something on the stack and did not POP it by the end of the function.\n\nThis warning does not stop analysis, but you should be aware of the situation when JMPing between addresses.\n\nTip:\n\nIn general settings you can choose the \"show stack pointer\" options and see the state of the stack.\n\n",
