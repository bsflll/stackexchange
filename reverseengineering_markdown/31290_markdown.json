  "content": "i'm trying to mod a game named : DDTank Mobile, which is on both Android & IOS.\nThis game runs on cocos2d engine, the thing is the lua files are encrypted.\nI read somewhere to look for 'sign' at the beginning of each lua files, but this is what i find\n\n\n\nThe sign seems to be ��+ in utf-8.\nIn hex it is : F8 8B 2B\n\nI found that you can use IDA to look into the Binaries of the SO File and Find the encryption key in a function called ApplicationDidFinishLaunching, so I tried not knowing what to do.\nHere's the pseudo-code from IDA: https://pastebin.com/T0RxB6ML\n\nIn this function, there is a call to StartConfig::enter and inside it there is this function used XXTeaEncrypt::setXXTeaKeyAndSign, here's the pseudo-code from IDA:\nhttps://pastebin.com/SjdvsKya\n\nLink to the APK : https://m.apkpure.com/ddtank-mobile/com.wan.ddten/\nSome Lua files + lib (SO) files : https://mega.nz/file/LJ0EXKiQ#aRLpaed4LXV0fSg9AK9-5-kZYYvOoHo49ytbDV6dMuI\n\n",

I also tried getting the oldest version of the game available on apkpure, to see changes, unfortunately they are obfuscated+encrypted. As for for the link you've sent, it might be useful in the future but sadly i cant find the xxxtea decryption key. Im new to this domain",

      "content": "Update on this :\n\nI managed to get through the obfuscated lua files by hooking the luaL_loadbuffer exported function from libengine.so using frida, and managed to dump the game code.\n\nAfter that i built a lua wrapper around the game, which would execute my lua code. Short after this, I realized that this game has plenty of stuff server side, so I couldnt do anything 'edgy' like changing my fightpower, diamonds, tickets, even if I was to send some hacky net message, server would check, i mean fair enough.\n\nI tried bypassing the payment request, that i saw while looking through lua files (PayCallBackModelEntity.lua)\n\nAnyways, I think i'm dropping this, can't do much, was a great opportunity for me to learn though :)\n\n",
