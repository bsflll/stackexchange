  "content": "Always wondered how it would be possible to see what data is being transmitted back and forth with an application that calls home.\n\nLet's say we emulate the server via host file redirect. Would it be possible to see what requests are being made by the application?\n\nAlso is it possible at all to intercept the response(and view data) from the real server before it reaches the application?\n\n",

      "content": "There are a couple of ways that come to mind. The first would be to use a network packet analyzer on the actual client running the application. Some well known packet analyzers are Wireshark, tcpdump, and even Microsoft Network Monitor.\n\nAnother alternative would be to intercept the traffic via man-in-the-middle (M. The easiest way to do this (if you control the client) is to turn your Linux based laptop into a wireless access point, and intercept the client's traffic, analyze it, and route it to the internet. This will require 2 network cards, at least one of them being a wireless card.\n\nHere's a tutorial to get you started on performing a mitm attack in this manner:\nhttp://www.backtrack-linux.org/forums/showthread.php?t=1939\n\nOr mitmproxy is another great tool to accomplish this (and they support SSL), and have lots of examples on their website.\n\n",

I'm posting it regardless because I believe it might be useful for others trying to perform the same thing but then using a Mac\n\nIf you're using a Mac, then it's really easy by the combination of a Remote Virtual Interface (rvi) and Wireshark. Note that this does not work if your application uses HTTP/SSL, in that case do what @MickGrove suggests and perform a MITM.  \n\nAssume you do have a mac, try this:\n\n",

Your best bet would be to find cross-references to Winsock's send and receive functions and determine how the client encrypts the data before sending it and decrypts it after receiving it.\n\n",
