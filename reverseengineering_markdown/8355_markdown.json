      "content": "This can be a little awkward from time to time.\n\nThere are several ways this can pan out. In approximate order of lazyness:\n\nThe problem here will be that you need the master CS and clock to be in a high-impedance state for this to work. Because the master knows it will be driving these signals, this isn't always the case. For power saving purposes though, a lot of masters will let these go high impedance.\n\nYou also rely on the master not responding in anyway to unprompted changes in MISO. If the master sees a change of MISO and responds, you will end up with garbage.\n\nSometimes this works when 1 fails. This relies on the circuit somehow isolating the power supply to the memory device from the master of the SPI bus. You end up powering the memory device and not the master. Bigger boards sometimes isolate the power supplies, but often you'll just end up in the same situation as 1.\n\nQuite a lot of routers using SPI memory for settings or firmware read the entire device sequentially at start-up, or if you issue a command to write settings to the device they will write it out. Alternatively, most devices will eventually read all of the memory addresses they actually need, and you can sniff these and reconstruct the memory.\n\nSometimes there is a very easy place to cut the power between the memory device and master. You probably want it to be repairable.\n\n",
