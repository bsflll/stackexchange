  "content": "I recently downloaded Ghidra (link) ver 9 on windows.\n\nThe decompiler feature is presumable found at \n\n```\n<GHIDRA_HOME>\\Ghidra\\Features\\Decompiler\n\n```\nThere is a lib folder containing the Java code. Then there is an os folder containing binaries for 3 different platforms (win, mac and linux) around 2.4 - 2.9 MB each per platform.\n\nMy questions\n\n",
