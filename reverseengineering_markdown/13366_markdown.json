My steps so far:\n\nThe problem is, I have only 44 bytes of space for my shellcode and this is not enough for my shellcode. Since my egghunter can't find the rest of my shellcode, I assume it's not written in the memory. The OS is Windows 7 x86 without SP1.\n\nIs there any way to expand the space for my shellcode or to exploit the application in another way? Thanks in advance.\n\nSynTraX\n\n",
