(Specifically WMP 12).\n\nThe file resides at C:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Media Player\\CurrentDatabase_[nnn].wmdb. It's a binary file, seemingly uncompressed.\n\nI'm willing to work on this, but don't want to waste my time if it's already been done!\n\nResearch:\n\nSpecifically, there are a few tools/scripts I've wanted to write that would need to directly manipulate this database.\n\n",

I am doing a forensic research on Windows Media Player for my Master's Thesis and I am having the same issue, I cannot understand the structure of the \"CurrentDatabase_xxx.wmdb\" file. If you have figured out about the structure and documented it. Can you please share it with me? It would be a great to me. Thanks in advance.",
