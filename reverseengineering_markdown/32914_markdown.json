  "content": "Some times IDA's decompiler translates more than variables into a single variable or an array of varibles, for example, I have 2 variables\n\n```\nA a; // size = 30h\nB b; // size = 60h\n\n```\nbut IDA gives\n\n```\nA arr[3];\n\n```\nhow can I split them out?\n\n",

Afterwards, IDA will automatically create new variables that will fill in the remaining stack space, you can also redefine their type if needed.\n\n",
