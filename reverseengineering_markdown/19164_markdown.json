  "content": "I want to solve this very basic crackme using angr:\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n    char buffer[64];\n    printf(\"Mot de passe:  \n\");\n    scanf(\"%64s\",buffer);\n    if (strcmp(buffer,\"super!\")==0)\n    {\n        printf(\"Bravo!  \n\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        printf(\"Perdu1!  \n\");\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\nIt works fine with this python script:\n\n```\nimport angr\nfrom angr.state_plugins import SimSystemPosix\n\np = angr.Project('./a.out', load_options={'auto_load_libs': False})\n\nsm = p.factory.simulation_manager()\nsm.explore(find= 0x400000+0x0000119f, avoid= 0x400000+ 0x000011ad)\n\nprint(sm.found[0].posix.dumps(0))\n\n```\nBut, if I change \"super!\" password in my crackme with a password that contains spaces, angr doesn't find any solutions.\n\nUsing fgets instead of scanf gets the same result; If the password contains a space, angr does not found any password.\n\nOf course, i have updated find and avoid addresses each time i recompile my c program.\n\n",

      "content": "That's because by doing so, you accidentally make the crackme unsolvable. Due to how scanf works with %s.\n\nAs per the C reference sheet, documentation and multiple sources (seriously, google is full of scanf documentation pages describing that):\n\nscanf will immediately stop reading characters into a string denoted with %s once a whitespace character (space included, obviously) is encountered. Even if you manually enter the correct password by hand into your newly created executable you'll get the error message instead of the success.\n\nAdditionally, gets behaves the same when it comes to whitespaces.\n\nBut you can solve the crackme by hand, it appears\n\nAlthough this appears not to be the behavior you experience in your program, for some unknown reason, this is still the behavior angr assumes when handling scanf and scanf-like library functions. It is perhaps not widely known that angr, to avoid path explosion at the first encounter of a string library function, does not \"natively\" handle those functions like any other encountered function. In favor of efficiency and speed, angr \"cheats\" around library functions, format string functions included.\n\nFor that purpose angr has its own scanf function implementation in python, and that implementation follows the standard. You can see that scanf delimiters are defined and used to delimit scanfs possible output. Issues with scanf are even documented in angr's gotchas page:\n\nOne way to avoid that is to modify the scanf implementation to something that does not consider whitespaces as delimiters. Another option is to disable that behavior by passing exclude_sim_procedures_list=['scanf'] as argument to your Project. You could also, as the gotcha's page suggest, implement something specific for your scenario.   \n\n",
