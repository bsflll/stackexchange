  "content": "IDA Pro's idaapi.BasicBlock objects returned by idaapi.FlowChart() can be of the following types (see gdl.hpp in the SDK sources):\n\n```\n// flow chart block types\nenum fc_block_type_t\n{\n  fcb_normal,    // normal block\n  fcb_indjump,   // block ends with indirect jump\n  fcb_ret,       // return block\n  fcb_cndret,    // conditional return block\n  fcb_noret,     // noreturn block\n  fcb_enoret,    // external noreturn block (does not belong to the function)\n  fcb_extern,    // external normal block\n  fcb_error,     // block passes execution past the function end\n};\n\n```\nI was able to find examples for all types except fcb_cndret. What does \n\nmean? Could somebody give an example?\n\n",
