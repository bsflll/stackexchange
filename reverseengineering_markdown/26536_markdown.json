  "content": "I have a question about JNE.\nI use ollydbg and ReverseMe tutorial.\n\nIn JNE condition, the zero flag is equal to 1. and it mean the arithmetic result is zero. Right?\n\nThe Z=1 meaning the condition is true and it want to jump to Error message???\nand If i change the zero flag to 0 (Z=0), it mean false? and ignore the Error message??\n\nJNE = Jump If not Equal. So whats that mean? if not equal to .. ? What does it compare to?\n\ni confused ...\n\n\n",

      "content": "JNE is an alias for JNZ because the CMP instruction will set ZF to 1 if the two values being compared are equal. So you can read it as “jump if not zero flag”, or “jump if ZF is not set”, or “jump if ZF is 0”.\n\nIn your specific case, the jump will be taken if eax is not equal to -1.\n\n",
