  "content": "I'm using dirtyJOE to edit a method of a class file.\n\nThe original class file had some encryption method calls and such.\nI've changed the byte-code of the method ldc (byte-code: 12 1E)\nto load true and return(byte-code: 12 1E)\n\napparently, Java's verifier is upset with my changes and it complains of verification error:\n\njava.lang.VerifyError: Expecting a stack map frame in method [methodName] at offset 2\nat..\nat..\n\nI was wondering if there is a way to fool the jvm to think that there is a stack map frame?\n\nthank you \n\n",

      "content": "If the original class was not using StackMapTables, then there should be no problem, assuming you modified the bytecode correctly. Even if it is using them, it is usually possible to just remove them and revert to the old behavior. Assuming that the class does not use invokedynamic, you can just change the version back to 49.0 and delete the StackMapTable attributes.\n\nUnfortunately, version 51.0 mandates usage of StackMapTable, which is a pain to create when manually editing bytecode. If your class actually is making use of 51.0 features (i.e. invokedynamic) then your only option is to create the appropriate stack frames. In a simple case like this, you could do it by hand, but in general you're best off using a tool to generate the stack frames automatically.\n\n",
