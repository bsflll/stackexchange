      "text": "@Axeryon The main problem of decompilers is that the generated assembler code can be very different depending on which compiler (and what compile options) was used to generate it. Writing a decompiler for one specific compiler with one specific set of options is difficult. However you have hundred of compilers that can generate e.g. x86 binary code with thousands of options that can be applied. You can see that writing a general decompiler that is generating compilable and correct code is more than a life-time job.",
