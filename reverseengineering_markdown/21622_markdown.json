  "content": "I stumbled upon this (reduced for readability) function. It does weird things that I have never encountered before. \n\n```\n// a2 is always 60.0\nvoid some_function(struct_123 *this, float a1, float a2)\n{\n  float v5; // ST10_4\n  float v6; // ST14_4\n\n  this->field_34 = a1;\n  v5 = a2 / (0.011 * 1000.0); // 60.0 / 11.0\n  v6 = v5 - (double)(signed int)v5;\n  this->field_38 = (SLODWORD(v6) >> 31) + (signed int)v5;\n}\n\n```\nI know a little bit about IEEE 754 decimals, so i think (SLODWORD(v6) >> 31) yields v6's sign bit. I suspect this is some kind of inlined floor/ceiling rounding operation, but I am anything but sure about this.\n\nEdit: I stumbled upon the actual non-inlined method. Here it is:\n\n```\nint __cdecl float_sub_466560(float a1)\n{\n  float v1; // ST04_4\n\n  v1 = (double)(signed int)a1 - a1;\n  return (signed int)a1 - (SLODWORD(v1) >> 31);\n}\n\n```\nEdit 2: it seems like the first function I gave adds 1 in the last line. That is part of the function, not the floating point operation. I removed it.\n\nEdit 3: as requested, here is the assembly for the second function.\nI can provide the assembly from the first function, however it is quite big, and I don't really want to extract the right portion of it if it's not necessary.\n\n```\nfloat_sub_466560 proc near\n\nvar_8           = dword ptr -8\nvar_4           = dword ptr -4\narg_0           = dword ptr  4\n\n                sub     esp, 8          ; stack frame\n                fld     [esp+8+arg_0]   ; Load Real\n                fist    [esp+8+var_8]   ; Store Integer\n                fisubr  [esp+8+var_8]   ; Subtract Integer Reversed\n                fstp    [esp+8+var_4]   ; Store Real and Pop\n                mov     eax, [esp+8+var_4]\n                mov     ecx, [esp+8+var_8]\n                sar     eax, 1Fh        ; Shift Arithmetic Right\n                sub     ecx, eax        ; Integer Subtraction\n                mov     eax, ecx        ; move result to correct return register\n                add     esp, 8          ; stack frame\n                retn                    ; Return Near from Procedure\nfloat_sub_466560 endp\n\n```\n",
