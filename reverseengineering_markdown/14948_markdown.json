I tried to use gdb to debug binwalk but it results in the error message \"/usr/bin/binwalk\": not in executable format: File format not recognized\". What other tool can be used to debug it? \n\n",

Since binwalk is written in Python and interpreted by the Python interpreter instead of being compiled in to an executable binary that conforms to one of the aforementioned formats, gdb cannot be used to dynamically analyze binwalk.\n\nIf your primary goal is extending the functionality of binwalk, then dynamically analyzing it may not be as productive as looking at \n\nas well as documentation on \n\nBut if \"debugging\" binwalk is the primary focus, then pdb or using a Python IDE will work.\n\n",
