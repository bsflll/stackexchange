  "content": "I have a strange error. I created for testing purposes a normal Console Application and run my own Tracer which is written with the help of Mono.Cecil on this application. I embedd a Stopwatch at the entry and exit of every method.\n\nAfter I embedd it (the IL doesn't have any errors or warnings in it, when I inspect it with ILSpy) and try to run the Console Application it throws:\n\nWhich is really strange, because Version = 4.2.2.0 doesn't even exists? Does anybody have a idea how this could be solved?\n\nSo when I try to give that Application any other Version of System.Runtime.Extensions this is thrown:\n\nI'm stuck and would be thankful for every help or idea to resolve this problem.\n\n",

I could solve it a little bit with Mono.Cecil, by loading System.Runtime.Extensions and change the Version to '4.2.2.0'. But I think it is not a good idea to do it this way.",
