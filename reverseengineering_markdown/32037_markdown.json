  "content": "Normally in CLI apps you can use Ctrl + c / Ctrl + d to terminate/exit, but they don't seem to do anything in r2 - at least not in debugger's v (visual) mode, which is how I use it. To exit, I press q, then type \"exit\", and have to press y twice to confirm quitting and killing the process, which is quite tedious.\n\nIs it possible to terminate a visual debugging session and exit r2 with a single key combination ?\n\n",
