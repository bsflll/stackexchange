  "content": "I'm using IDA 7 Freeware, not Pro. I've been using IDC to re-invent the wheel somewhat, but I'm learning a ton of stuff as I go along.\n\nI have a 16-bit MSDOS exe which I'm reversing. I stripped out the header and reloc table in my first attempt, so that all seg refs resolved correctly.\n\nNow I've found set_fixup() and friends, and also seen doRelocs() from the (old) SDK via Google. I'm a bit puzzled by it all.\n\nPlease help me understand IDA fixups!\n\nI'm trying to use this IDC code:\n\n//seg001:10 to_ea == 0x1610\n\n//0x01610: mov ax, 0x02d0e (next: mov ds,ax)\n\n//0x2d0e + 0x160 = 0x2e6e\n\nset_fixup(0x1611, FIXUP_SEG16, 0x2e6e0, 0x2e6e, 0, 0) //best guess at args\n\nThanks in advance!\n\ne: Partial answer from Ilfak Guilfanov (via email)\n\n~~~~\nJul 18 (1 day ago)\nto me \n\nThanks, we will fix this. Meanwhile pass 0 for fixupf:\n\nvoid set_fixup(long ea, long type, long fixupf, long targetsel, long targetoff, long displ);\n\n~~~~\n\nPerhaps I'll be able to figure the rest out, but still grateful for any further help!\n\n",
