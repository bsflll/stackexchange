  "content": "I am debugging a program that I compiled.\nThis program calls SetWindowTextW.\nWhen I am debugging it with IDA I can step into this function, but it doesn't recognize anything there:\n\n\nIf I will load user32.dll (where the function is exported), I will see all the symbols and functions named, everything.\n\nIs it possible to load the user32.dll to a process that I am debugging, so I will be able to see what functions it calls.\n\nYou can see the difference, in the left side is when I am debugging my program and access user32.dll and on the right side is when I debug it directly.\n\n\n\nSolved (thanks to Igor):\n\n\n",
