  "content": "So I'm currently trying to analyze a resource archive file of an old game.\n\nWhat I got so far\n\nSo far, so good. However, this is where it get's tricky. The first twelve bytes of each of those blocks are readable, they are always three uint32.\n\nAnd this is where I'm currently stuck, since the rest seems to be encrypted/ciphered data. I dumped the data from the 64 and 120 long blocks seperately, without those twelve \"header\" bytes. Each block is seperated by line break.\n\nNow there are obviously some repeated patterns here, so I'm thinking that it might be some XOR-ish cipher, though I haven't been able to figure out a key or even a structure.\n\nWhat I expect to find in this data\n\nAlso, I know that these (partial) strings should be in there somewhere in some way or another (got those from the executable):\n\n```\ndata\n../../../data/g\ng/img/inv_Lf._img\ng/img/inv_Rt._img\ng/img/inv_All._img\ng/img/mcUse._img\ng/img/mcTalk._img\ng/img/mcTake._img\ng/img/mcLook._img\ng/img/mcArrow._img\ng/img/fntOtherSpeakers._img\ng/img/fntBig._img\ng/img/fntWhite._img\ng/img/fntYellow._img\ng/img/fntGray._img\n\n```\nThat is all I have been able to figure out up to now. Any help in figuring this out would be much appreciated!\n\nThank you for your time!\n\nEDIT: Posted the binary in the comments\n\n",

With that being said, binwalk detects roughly 1900 zlib compressed data blocks, with some false positives detected throughout the file. In addition, not all of the compressed blocks may be detected; when I used wxHexEditor to search for byte 0x78DA, more than 3000 matches were found. Either that or binwalk augments its signature scan with additional information or heuristics that I am not aware of to reduce false positives.\n\n\n\nThe search results differ from the output of the signature scan.\n\n",
