  "content": "I am trying to debug a windows service, so I set IDA as the debugger of that service.\n\nBut since services are running in session 0, I can't interact with IDA. Also in the latest windows version (e.g. 22h2), it looks like they removed tools that make this job easier like UI0detect and it looks like they made this task impossible.\n\nIs there any way to work around this problem?\n\nFor example, maybe a command line argument that runs IDA in a different session?\n\nI suppose one solution could be to set IDA to run a remote debugging, not sure if that would work but I would consider it if nothing else works, since it looks like it's going to be a pain to set up.\n\n",
