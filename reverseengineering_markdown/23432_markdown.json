  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/23432/unable-to-intercept-traffic-of-an-android-app-even-after-patching-ssl-pinning",
  "content": "Recently, I was trying to test an app developed on Rhomobile, I setup a proxy with burp, and of course I have installed burp certificate on my device hence I can intercept other apps on my device but I am unable to see the traffic of the app in question on burp suite instead the app works fine and connects to the remote server without even appearing an error alert of the burp suite. in reversing the app I concluded that it is using https protocol to connect to the server. even typically apps targeting android api level 24 and above, a network_security_config.xml should be specified and in my reversing I created that file and set it its location on manifest file but nothing avail. then these questions pop into my mind I would be very pleased if you can clear it.  \n\n1. in general, what am I missing? or where else should I look at?\n\n2. specifically Is an app developed on rhomobile is proxy unaware app?\n\n3. if the issue is associated with certificate pinning, typically the alert tab of the burp suite would have shown it, why the app is working fine and connecting to the server while other apps leave an error in the alert tab of burp suite? if I conclude that it is a proxy unaware app, how can I finally intercept its traffic? \n\nany help would be appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\n",

The easiest was is to use a Linux PC with Wifi adapter and use the Wifi adapter to set-up a Wifi hotspot. Then you can e.g. use mitmproxy in transparent mode on that PC and redirect the traffic via iptables to mitmproxy or just sniff the data using Wireshark.",
