My goal here is learning the most possible generic method to jump onto routines triggered by non standard buttons (created by any kind of UI framework).\n\nIn order to ilustrate my concern I've created a dummy crackme - (in a range 0-10 I'd say level -1 :))\n\nFor this exercise to be really useful let's assume:\n\nI've created this little mcve to ilustrate better my real concern, on the real-world case I'm working on I'd like to read the routine triggered by a button from the beginning to end in order to decode the algorithm used.\n\nSo yeah, the question would be, what are the methods to deal with this particular problem?\n\n",

      "content": "The problem here is not to solve the crackme, but to find the handler of the \"Register\" button. I describe what could be done to find the button handler. There is probably no \"generic\" standard procedure working in all similar cases.\n\nHowever, although this is a special case, I assumed normal \"generic\" windows message behaviour. In that case I can expect somewhere a WM_LBUTTONX message, X being UP or DOWN, with values 0x201 or 0x202. Thus I searched statically for the value 200h in Ida, this being the start  of the \"Mouse group\" in the Windows WM_ messages set. \n\nThere are a number of locations found where a compare is made with 0x200. On these I set a breakpoint. Two of these are hit on mouseclicks, and one of them investigates explicitely 0x201 (WM_LBUTTONDOWN) and 0x202 (WM_LBUTTONUP):\n\n\n\nIf you step futher down the WM_LBUTTONUP path you come directly to the following location, with a call to f_someMsgHandler (as I called it):\n\n\n\nThis function is called on several occasions, but the one corresponding to the mouse event is easily found, e.g. by setting a selective breakpoint. In this function, the following location leads directly to the handler of WM_LBUTTONUP of the \"Register\" button, being located at address 0x4fead0 (that address unfortunately hidden in the tooltip):\n\n\n\nTo solve the crackme, it would possibly be easier to look for something like \"GetWindowText\".\n\nThis shows, that in contrast to the OP's remark, it is very well possible to follow the trace of the standard windows mouse messages in order to find the proper handler.\n\n",
