  "content": "When you open the stack window in IDA with Ctrl-K there is a comment at the top saying:\n\n; Two special fields \" r\" and \" s\" represent return address and saved registers.\n\nWhen I made some mistake and undefined these fields, then how can I recreate them? Defining data creates just a normal variable type. Or can those not be set, so I have to live with the data types?\n\n",

Note that this will reset any variable names you had already set, though.\n\n",
