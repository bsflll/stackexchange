      "content": "VT does allow searches based on filename, but it isn't always accurate as far as where the string is found in the filename/path. My workflow has turned into finding files based on the extention, writing goodware yara searches to find more examples of the filetype, and trying to tune to determine what the best signature with the most coverage is.\n\nI feel like there should be a better way though, so I'm not going to accept this answer in case someone has a better solution or a repository more suited to the task.\n\n",
