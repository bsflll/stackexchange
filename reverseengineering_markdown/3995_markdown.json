      "content": "The immediate value is not checked by the CPU but may be checked by the exception handler, e.g. to distinguish between breakpoints inserted by the debugger from those added by the programmer/compiler. For example, the ARM semihosting interface uses BKPT 0xAB on ARMv7-M and presumably won't work with other immediates.\n\n",
