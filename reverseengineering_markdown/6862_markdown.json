  "content": "How can someone with little programming knowledge except for some Ruby on Rails/Ruby begin on a path of Reverse Engineering as a hobbyist to help the exploitation process of modern-day gaming consoles like Xbox Ones and PS4s?\n\nI realize there is no simple \"do this, then that\" spoon-fed process of learning an extremely diverse subject matter like reversing but there are such vast amounts of tutorials that I have no idea which ones really pertain to my interest of specifically game console exploitation! I really want to help contribute to the long-term process of finding these vulnerabilities and get unsigned code running on these systems\n\n",

If you see my answer on the other question, I not only provided a link (to Amazon no less, which is likely to be valid for quite some time), but I also gave the full name of the book, which can be referenced indefinitely even if the link breaks. That said, thank you for your feedback, and feel free to down-vote my original answer if you feel strongly about it.",
