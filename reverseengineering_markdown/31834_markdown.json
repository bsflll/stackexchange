As in, the process is recreated in the exact same state as if \"loading a saved game\".\n\nContext is that of a game that crashes either while attempting to save/load a game or certain conditions are met (e.g. unit count > 5000). There are no debug logs.\n\n",

Your processor needs to support it.\n\nHowever, it's not possible to take a mere memory dump and \"revive\" a process based on that. The record & replay method involves a whole lot more than just the memory state. Also, memory dumps often are only an excerpt of the full memory space of a process.\n\n",

But consider memory layout alone, ASLR, randomly created base addresses for DLLs on Windows (and that's just the usermode view of the memory). On Windows, all \"Windows subsystem\" processes are registered with the subsystem at startup. Intel PT (the mentioned underlying CPU feature) probably doesn't need everything. But it needs a meaningful subset and the help of the OS/debugger to facilitate collection. Intel PT does allow that sort of revival. What I wrote was that a memory dump alone isn't sufficient. You need something like Intel PT.",
