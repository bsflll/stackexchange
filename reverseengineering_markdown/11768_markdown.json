  "content": "when I am using the radare2 debugger, it happens that I have sometimes to examine variables and memory. Consider the following instruction\n\n```\n0x08048498      8b4508         mov eax, dword [ebp+arg2]\n\n```\nAssuming that I know that what in eax pointer to array of characters with null termination at the end (I mean string). So, ebp+arg2 is pointer to that string.\n\nwhen I type ps @eax I get what I expect, a string. But, I can get the same result by accessing [ebp+arg_2]. I tried many things including ps and ps/ etc.\n\n",
