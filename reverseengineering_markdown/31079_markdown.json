  "content": "As a developer, reverse engineering has always fascinated me. It amazes me to see what some people can figure out just from a dump of assembly code, and I would like to become better at doing the same.\n\nThere are many websites that specialize in helping developers become better at writing code and solving problems through small challenges.
