      "content": "A call to malloc returns the address of the allocated memory in the eax register on x86, rax on x86_64, and r0 on ARM. Nothing is pushed on the stack. Check the line following the call to malloc & you'll understand !\nYou should check the calling conventions of your platform too. \n\nSuppose you have this in your code :\n\n```\n      int *p = malloc(sizeof(int) * 4);\n\n```\nIf you translate this line into assembly you'll get what follows : \n\n```\n      call   80483d0 <malloc@plt>\n      mov    %eax,0x18(%esp)\n\n```\nThe malloc call returns in eax the address of allocated memory block. In the C code, this address is assigned to p which is a local variable located on the stack. And that's what the following assembly does : mov %eax,0x18(%esp).    \n\n",

There is no way to determine the name of that local variable name from the objdump.\n\nPlease, next time, try to ask your question in a way that is better to understand - for example \"My function that calls malloc stores the result somewhere, what does that instruction do ?\" and post only the relevant code.\n\n",
