So, any PEs you found that have self extracting PE which doesn't reside in the RAT (Excluding talking about obfuscated PEs) will likely to reside in the .data section. I don't know of any tools to automate searching PEs within .data section. This maybe off topic as it's not automated but you could do it yourself by doing doing signature scan on PE or DOS header. Here's a website for signatures within the PE: marcoramilli.blogspot.co.uk/2010/12/windows-pe-header.html",
