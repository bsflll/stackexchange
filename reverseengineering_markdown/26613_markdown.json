  "content": "I am curious to know if anyone has done anything similar to what I am looking to achieve...\n\nCoding this isn't what I am struggling with. Finding what tools to use is. I am pretty experienced with Python, but am open to using any language to patch and create a new executable automatically. Has anyone automated a workflow like this before? I know this stack exchange should be more geared towards specific reverse engineering questions, but I figured this might be the best place to post my question. Thanks to all of those who reply in advance.\n\n",
