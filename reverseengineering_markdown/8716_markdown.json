  "content": "How do you swap debuggers in Windows?\n\nIn my case, I have a process A which creates a copy of itself:\n\n```\nCreateProcessA(\"XXX.exe\", NULL, 0x0023f560, 0x0023f560, TRUE,      \n               **DEBUG_ONLY_THIS_PROCESS**, NULL, NULL, 0x0023f5f8, 0x0023f550)\n\n```\nIt, then, debugs its child (Process B) using WaitForDebugEvent(50ms) to modify the control flow of B. After a highly active startup WaitForDebugEvent will time out(Return false) unless I click a button in B. \n\nQuestion: How do I get rid of the Debugger(Process A) and attach my own debugger to B ?\n\nI tried to call DebugActiveProcessStop by injection code into A (DLL Injection) as well as by debugging A and calling it from the thread that debugs B. (inline code injection) both ways I get ACCESS_DENIED!\n\nIf you try to attach a 2nd debugger you get Error 87 (ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER).\n\nEnvironment: Win 7 x64 \n\n",

Second process you have to done before starting of new thread then after you can attach your debugger to that child process.\nI've fetched same situation in all-in-one keylogger\n\n",
