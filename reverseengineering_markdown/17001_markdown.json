  "content": "I have a proprietary binary (firmware), and I'd like to check whether it contains opensource components. I'm thinking about extracting what it contains - probably binaries - and use strings, grep and a couple of automated github/bitbucket/etc. searches to identify potential GPL violations.\n\nI know this approach is very limited, that's why I'm looking for advices and/or existing tools that could be relevant?\n\n",
