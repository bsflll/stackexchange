  "content": "I wrote a small program in assembly which is supposed to print \"AAAA\". It works fine when I run it directly, but when I run it as a shellcode in a c program, it doesn't work. Please help.\n\nHere is the assembly code:\n\n\nWhen I compile and execute the following code:\n\n```\nchar shellcode[] = {0x31,0xc0,0xb0,0x04,0x31,0xdb,0xb3,0x01,0x68,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x41,0x89,0xe1,0x31,0xd2,0xb2,0x04,0xcd,0x80,0x31,0xc0,0xb0,0x01,0x31,0xdb,0xb3,0x01,0xcd,0x80};\nint main(){\n        (*(void(*)())shellcode)();\n        return 0;\n}\n\n```\nCompiled as:\n\n```\n$gcc -g -Wall -fno-stack-protector -z execstack code.c -o code\n\n```\nExecution:\n\n```\n$./code\n$\n\n```\n",

      "content": "You're showing x86 (32bit) shellcode, but are not compiling your program for that architecture, so gcc most likely creates an amd64 (64bit) executable instead. This can be fixed by adding the -m32 switch:\n\n```\ngcc -g -Wall -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -m32 code.c -o code\n\n```\nYou can verify this by running file on the resulting file:\n\n```\ncode: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), [â€¦]\n\n```\n",
