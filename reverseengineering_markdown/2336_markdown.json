  "content": "What is the best way to dump user space process by pid debugging the kernel with windbg? I'm able to attach to the process from user-space with windbg and generate crash by .dump, but how would I do it from the kernel for only a single process and not generate crash dump of the whole kernel?\n\n",

      "content": "Dumping a process in user mode (.dump /ma) will dump all of its virtual memory. This includes memory which is currently paged to disk. It will be paged in during the dump process.\n\nKernel debugging is close to debugging physical memory only. So even if you manage to dump all physical memory of the process, you only have the part which is called \"WorkingSet\". It would not be a complete dump, especially you couldn't use it for debugging .NET.\n\nSo, finally, even if it's possible somehow, you'll not get the same results.\n\n",
