  "content": "I have following intel processor 4th Generation Core Processor (Haswell U/Y).\nI want to check the value of PMBASE register in the processor. For that I have downloaded the processor datasheet, where I found that PMBASE is present at B:D:F 0:1:0. Here is the screenshot\n\n\nThe VID and DID of the device are mentioned below (from the same datasheet)\n\n\nBut, now when I am doing lspci from my linux machine, I am not seeing device 0:1:0. I have even checked with chipsec tool. Even there I am not seeing any device with device id 0x0c01. \nAny reason why such discrepancy is there?\n\n",
