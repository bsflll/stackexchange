  "content": "I have Erlang application's beam files which I want to decompile. \n\nApplication is Compiled and build with 'debug_info' options. here is snippet of emake file to which is used to build application :\n\n```\n{\"apps/my_app/src/*\",   [debug_info, nowarn_export_all, {outdir, \"apps/my_app/ebin\"},{pa, \"deps\"},{parse_transform, lager_transform}, {parse_transform, events_transform}]}.\n\n```\nI have tried function from beam_lib module but getting following Error :\n\n```\n1>{ok,{_,[{abstract_code,{_,AC}}]}} = beam_lib:chunks(abc,[abstract_code]).\n** exception error: no match of right hand side value {error,beam_lib,{not_a_beam_file,'abc.beam'}}\n\n```\nI have also tried solution mentioned in following post Decompile erlang .beam files compiled without debug_info\n but Its not working for me. I'm getting following error :\n\n```\n1> file:write_file(\"/tmp/my_module_disasm\", io_lib:fwrite(\"~p.  \n\", [beam_disasm:file(abc)])).\nok\n\n```\n/tmp/my_module_disasm file contains :\n\n```\n{error,beam_lib,{not_a_beam_file,'abc.beam'}}.\n\n```\nAnyone have Idea ?\n\n",
