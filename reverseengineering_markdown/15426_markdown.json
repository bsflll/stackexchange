  "content": "I'm running on MacOS Sierra (version 10.12.4). And I created two virtual machine on Virtualbox (version 5.1.22).\n\n1- Host Machine : Windows 10 Pro x64 (I installed Windows Driver kit 10)\n\n2- Target Machine: Windows 7 Pro x64\n\nNow I'm trying to use the first machine to debug the second one. And I configured the same host pipe for the two machines.\n\n\n\nBut when I trying to connect, they don't seem to know each other.\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\n",
