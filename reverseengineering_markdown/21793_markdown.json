  "content": "when I am looking for packet editor, I found open project on http://www.packeteditor.com/\nwhen I learn how it works, I see that the application is injecting a dll named WSPE.dat, when I load this WSPE.dat to ida pro, I found it was a dll that has been obfuscated.\nand it was something like this :\n\n\nwhat is that SteveW section? I also see a lot of this obfuscator on other dll, but protectionId scan result it wasn't being packed\nwith this note :\n\n```\nSection [0x0] 'SteveW  ' has a higher physical size than virtual size..\n\n```\nand also this :\n\n```\nWarning : Import Table is bad !!!\n\n```\nhere is the dll link :\nWSPE.dat\n\n",
