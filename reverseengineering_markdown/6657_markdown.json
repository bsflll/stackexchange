      "content": "The program ldd is wrong for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, ldd is not meant to be accurate for determining load addresses. Use the environment variable LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS. \n\nSecond, ldd will never be correct with ASLR enabled as Guntram showed.  You can disable this pretty trivially if you have sudo access.\n\n```\n$ LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1 /bin/bash | grep libc\n        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f44dae1b000)\n$ LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1 /bin/bash | grep libc\n        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f9b35341000)\n$ LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1 /bin/bash | grep libc\n        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fef18efd000)\n$ echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space\n0\n$ LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1 /bin/bash | grep libc\n        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007ffff75e7000)\n$ LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1 /bin/bash | grep libc\n        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007ffff75e7000)\n$ LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1 /bin/bash | grep libc\n        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007ffff75e7000)\n\n```\nYou can verify this by starting an instance of bash in the background and inspecting its maps file.\n\n```\n$ bash &\n[1] 30398\n[1]  + 30398 suspended (tty input)  bash                                                                             \n$ grep libc /proc/30398/maps | head -n1\n7ffff75e7000-7ffff77a2000 r-xp 00000000 08:01 525269                     /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so\n\n```\nThe address reported by info sharedlibrary is the address of the .text area.\n\nNote that in the particular libc that I have, the .text is at 0x1f4a0.\n\n```\n$ readelf --wide --section-headers /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so | grep text\n  [12] .text             PROGBITS        000000000001f4a0 01f4a0 145c23 00  AX  0   0 16\n\n```\nIn GDB, if we look at the load addresses of libc, we see that it is loaded at 0x7ffff7a14000.  This will change each time the program is run, if ASLR is enabled on the system.  If you run it under GDB, it will also disable ASLR.  Run the command set disable-randomization off before running the target and you will observe it change each run.\n\n```\ngdb-peda$ info proc mapping\n  ...\n  0x7ffff7a14000     0x7ffff7bcf000   0x1bb000        0x0 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so\n  0x7ffff7bcf000     0x7ffff7dcf000   0x200000   0x1bb000 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so\n  0x7ffff7dcf000     0x7ffff7dd3000     0x4000   0x1bb000 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so\n  0x7ffff7dd3000     0x7ffff7dd5000     0x2000   0x1bf000 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so\n  ...\n\n```\nYou can verify this by checking to see if it starts with the ELF header.\n\n```\ngdb-peda$ hexdump 0x00007ffff7a14000 4\n0x0000 0x00007ffff7a14000 │ 7f 45 4c 46                                      │ .ELF\n0x0004 0x00007ffff7a14004\n\n```\nIf we add the 0x1f4a0 offset from the .text area, we get 0x7ffff7a334a0.\n\n```\ngdb-peda$ printf \"%p  \n\",(0x00007ffff7a14000+0x1f4a0)\n0x7ffff7a334a0\n\n```\nNow if we look at info sharedlibrary, we see exactly this address.\n\n```\ngdb-peda$ info sharedlibrary libc\nFrom                To                  Syms Read   Shared Object Library\n0x00007ffff7a334a0  0x00007ffff7b790c3  Yes         /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6\n\n```\nIn GDB, you should use the info proc mapping command to get the base address of a loaded module.\n\nHowever, this is not available on FreeBSD, since GDB does not support the FreeBSD-specific APIs necessary to get module base addresses.  Instead, you must use the info proc mapping command and perform the translation yourself (by subtracting the address of the .text section).\n\n",

      "content": "First, ASLR will load the library at a (slightly) different address with each invocation, to help protect against malware. This is why the addresses between ldd and gdb are different, and why they may be even different each time you run gdb.\n\nIf i just grep for the libc executable segment on my system (64 bit, as i didn't have a 32 bit system handy):\n\n```\n$ grep 'r-xp.*libc-2.19' /proc/*/maps|head\n\n/proc/10987/maps:7fe455b72000-7fe455d2d000 r-xp 00000000 08:16 23461990                   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so\n/proc/11880/maps:7f029dc1f000-7f029ddda000 r-xp 00000000 08:16 23461990                   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so\n/proc/11884/maps:7f25a9c25000-7f25a9de0000 r-xp 00000000 08:16 23461990                   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so\n/proc/15715/maps:7ffc713da000-7ffc71595000 r-xp 00000000 08:16 23461990                   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so\n/proc/17705/maps:7fe9db80c000-7fe9db9c7000 r-xp 00000000 08:16 23461990                   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so\n/proc/18558/maps:7fc248544000-7fc2486ff000 r-xp 00000000 08:16 23461990                   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so\n/proc/20156/maps:7f0f8eb13000-7f0f8ecce000 r-xp 00000000 08:16 23461990                   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so\n/proc/2139/maps:7fba4c097000-7fba4c252000 r-xp 00000000 08:16 23461990                   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so\n/proc/2215/maps:7f934ed76000-7f934ef31000 r-xp 00000000 08:16 23461990                   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so\n/proc/2224/maps:7f064d98f000-7f064db4a000 r-xp 00000000 08:16 23461990                   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so\n\n```\nyou see every process maps the same library a bit differently.\n\nAlso, when the loader loads a library, it creates several memory segments for it. The segments from the ELF file get read into these shared memory segments, including some headers. This is why the code start address isn't identical to the segment start address.\n\nFor example, on my system :\n\n```\n(gdb) info sharedLibrary\nFrom                To                  Syms Read   Shared Object Library\n0x00007ffff7a334a0  0x00007ffff7b790c3  Yes         /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6\n\n```\nand\n\n```\ncat /proc/26271/maps \n7ffff7a14000-7ffff7bcf000 r-xp 00000000 08:16 23461990                   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so\n7ffff7bcf000-7ffff7dcf000 ---p 001bb000 08:16 23461990                   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so\n7ffff7dcf000-7ffff7dd3000 r--p 001bb000 08:16 23461990                   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so\n7ffff7dd3000-7ffff7dd5000 rw-p 001bf000 08:16 23461990                   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so\n\n```\nso you see the memory map for the code segment (the one that is executable, i.e. has the x bit set) ranges from 7ffff7a14000-7ffff7bcf000, but the region the actual code is loaded to is just the subset 7ffff7a334a0-7ffff7b790c3.\n\nYou can find a more thorough explanation here.\n\n",
