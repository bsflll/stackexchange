      "content": "You can take the instructions, assemble them into hex values, for example by using: Online disassembler.\n\nThen you get the byte representation:\n\\x55\\x48\\x89\\xE5\\x89\\x7D\\xFC\\x89\\x75\\xF8\\x8B\\x55\\xFC\\x8B\\x45\\xF8\\x01\\xD0\\x5D\\xC3\n\nWith this, you can patch bytes in the binary, and then use the normal decompile functionality in Ghidra/Ida on the patched area.\n\n",
