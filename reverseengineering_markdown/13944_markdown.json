  "content": "This should have been made easy using binwalk however I fail to understand what I did wrong with the following syntax:\n\n```\n$ wget --content-disposition https://github.com/devttys0/binwalk/archive/v2.1.1.zip\n$ wget --content-disposition https://github.com/devttys0/binwalk/archive/v2.0.1.zip\n$ cat binwalk-2.0.1.zip binwalk-2.1.1.zip > full\n$ binwalk -r -C output -e full\n\n```\nlead to the following:\n\n```\n$ ls output/_full.extracted\nbinwalk-2.1.1/\n\n```\nClearly it is missing the binwalk-2.0.1 expanded directory. Where did binwalk-2.0.1 go ?\n\nI need to use the -r flag (Delete carved files after extraction), because it generates enormous zip and fill my disk (see Carved files are often equal in size to the original file)\n\n",
