  "content": "Trying to reverse-engineer the Bumble API using Postman with interceptor enabled. From what it seems like, Bumble uses cookie-based sessions to authenticate each request. I performed a process of elimination with browser requests to determine the essential requests.\n\nRequest #1\n\n```\nhttps://bumble.com/mwebapi.phtml?SERVER_APP_STARTUP=\n\n```\nRequest #2 (Get's users)\n\n```\nhttps://bumble.com/mwebapi.phtml?SERVER_GET_ENCOUNTERS\n\n```\nMy problem now occurs when I try to replicate the 2nd URL in Postman.\nI receive the following response from the server:\n\n```\n{\n\"$gpb\": \"badoo.bma.BadooMessage\",\n\"message_type\": 1,\n\"version\": 1,\n\"message_id\": 2,\n\"object_type\": 74,\n\"body\": [\n    {\n        \"$gpb\": \"badoo.bma.MessageBody\",\n        \"server_error_message\": {\n            \"$gpb\": \"badoo.bma.ServerErrorMessage\",\n            \"error_code\": \"9\",\n            \"error_message\": \"Wrong request\",\n            \"error_id\": \"0030-3001-0093\",\n            \"error_eta\": 306,\n            \"type\": 9100\n        },\n        \"message_type\": 1\n    }\n],\n\"responses_count\": 1,\n\"is_background\": false,\n\"vhost\": \"\"\n}\n\n```\nI'm not sure what I'm doing wrong in Postman as I've validated each request header and cookie ensuring they match those in the browser.\n\n",
