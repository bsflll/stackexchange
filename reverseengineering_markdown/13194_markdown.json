  "content": "I had some fun using IDA Pro Dalvik Debugger in the past using AVD emulator. \nHowever I stumbled upon a APK that somehow does not run well inside AVD. APK runs fine on a real device so I am trying to use IDA Pro dalvik debugger to debug the APK on a real device. \n\nThe problem is, when using AVD all I had to setup was packagename and activity name in the Debugger Setup -> Set specific options and debugger worked well but trying on a real device keep fails with message like ADB error: listener 'tcp:239166' not found or IDA started the application but unable to connect .. message. \n\nI tried adb forward on a port Dalvik debugger is using but no progress :(\n\nCan anyone provide help? Thanks in advance.\n\n",
