No structure, nearlly a maximum of entropy, no periods nothing. I have no more information except:\n\nI tested so many things ... Does anyone of you has a clue on how to go forward? I am running out of ideas.\n\nEdit: The histogram which has been now deleted was not correct. Anyway I have no idea how to go on further. Trying to open it with truecrypt to be sure it is not a container didn't work. Do you have any more tips on how to find the files in this?\n\n",
