  "content": "In fastcall functions, the callee cleans the stack and returns the value in eax. This completes the function call.And actually we put first two arguments in ecx and edx, still caller cleans stack 8 bytes.\n\nI wonder why happens that way. We put the datas into registers not stack? Am i right?\n\nHow is it possible cleaning registers that way?\n\nExample Code:\n\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nint __fastcall TestFunction(int num1, int num2, int num3, int num4, int num5)\n{\n    int nSum = 0;\n    nSum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5;\n    return nSum;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    int nSum = 0;\n    nSum = TestFunction(10, 20, 30, 40, 50);\n    printf(\"Result: %d\", nSum);\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\n\n\n",
