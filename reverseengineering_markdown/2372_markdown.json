  "content": "I recently stumbled on a talk from Ruxcon 2012 explaining the reverse of a mass transit ticketing system. \n\nBasically, they focused on paper tickets reverse engineering with a skimmer and a lot of brain activity. This seems to be quite amusing and interesting. But, nowadays a big part of the ticketing system is also using NFC (Near Field Communication) or RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) especially for people who are subscribing for a month or more.\n\nI found a few websites (like this one or this one), trying to gather knowledge about how all this ticketing system works. But, nothing really global and fully furnished (from the paper ticket system up to the NFC/RFID system).\nI would like to know how to set up such a lab.\n\n",
