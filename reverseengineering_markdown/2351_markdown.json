  "content": "While disassembling a malware binary, I came across several arrays of shorts. The size of each array is 1024 members. I would like to export them to C style arrays, as:\n\n```\nshort array1[1024] = { 2, 5, 8, ... , 4};  /* This is just an example */\n\n```\nI could definitely do Copy/Paste and edit the whole thing by hand. However, it seems to be pretty tedious. I wonder, is there a better approach to achieve it? Could it be done with script/plugin? \n\n",
