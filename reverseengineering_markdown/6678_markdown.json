  "content": "I've been spending a good chunk of time looking at some 3rd party applications that were successful in \"reproducing\" (although I believe not necessarily by understanding the algorithm completely but simply extracting the core of the logic from the original binaries and replicating it into their own programs) the main logic for simulating an Apple TV server with full AirPlay mirroring support, to name a few:\n\nBy looking at their decompiled code and some other references on the web, most of the protocol aspect is already known/relatively easy to figure out and I did it already, so no sweat there, the key part I'm having a tough time understanding how these guys were able to pull it off is related to the FairPlay decryption portion (i.e.: when receiving and responding to the fp-setup challenges as well as decrypting the AES key sent in the last step of the challenge).\n\nThey all seem to have extracted the white-boxed/obfuscated functions out of Apple's original airtunesd/fairplayd daemon code and embedded it into their source, delegating the calls to seed/encrypt/decrypt to it.\n\nI noticed in some iOS devices this daemon also exist (most likely used to encrypt the feed when mirroring the screen via AirPlay to a compatible server) but was wondering how different this really is from the one shipped with the Apple TV and if my assumptions are actually correct (is that were most of these guys are taking this code from?).\n\nWas hoping either someone with previous experience or a little more knowledge on the topic could shed some light/pointers so I could find a way to at least do the same these guys were able to accomplish (which is not really deobfuscating the code but just extracting it to embed in their own programs).\n\nPS: For clarity, aside from confirmation I was looking for some pointers as to how one would be able to extract compilable code from a said binary, given my attempts at disassembling and decompiling via IDA Pro haven't provided me with much that I can reuse to compile new code that reproduces that piece of the puzzle.\n\n",

After investigating serveral existing commercial applications I have finally managed to get a way of decrypting fairplay protected streams.\nI have extended the shairplay code to demostrate this ability. Please look at https://github.com/foxsen/shairplay, parts of the README.md:\n\nUpdate by foxsen, 2015/4/20: Experimental support for fairplay protocol and airplay:\n\nBecause I have not enough time and interest to do all the other necessary coding to make a full open source solution that support mirroring, I hope people can help to continue the project or port my code into other projects like kodi. I am willing to help with related issues.\n\nThe dirty works are hidden in my server app. During a session with fairplay, we need to interact with the server for three times to get the job done. You can read the code above to learn how. When I get more time, I prepare the write something about this part of work. Basically it involves some reverse engineering and a lot of tricks to rebuild a relocatable object from part of a binary.\n\nPublic access to that app is open and free for personal visits now. If anybody want to use it in commercial environment, you can contact me.\n\nHappy hacking.\n\n",

When what left is only tedious repeat, I stopped and then write a series of scripts to draw out part of the binary, re-add symbol table and relocation entries, with some fixups it becomes a relocatable .o that can be linked to my server app. Roughly so.",

The device does not use the older AirPlay methods. e.g. there isn't just a single key that can decrypt across any device. You must have a server, we call it an \"AirPlay server\", that the device calls for a decryption key for that specific session. The rest of the work is done on the device (decryption). So the device asks the server, server responds with a key, device uses the key for decryption. Most of the actual work is done on the device.\n\n",
