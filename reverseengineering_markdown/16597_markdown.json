  "content": "I'd like to try and fix some open source GitHub project that uses the allApplications from LSApplicationWorkspace call from private API which list all installed application on the device. \n\nThe method works fine in the simulator, but on a device running iOS 11, it returns zero results.\n\nSo First, I've downloaded the IPSW file, and opened it I got the following list of files : \n\n```\n-rw-r--r--@  1 adam.k  staff    15139280 Oct  7 08:16 kernelcache.release.iphone9\n-rw-r--r--@  1 adam.k  staff  2462102996 Oct  7 11:25 058-59998-354.dmg\ndrwxrwxr-x@ 14 adam.k  staff         476 Oct  7 11:34 Firmware\n-rw-r--r--@  1 adam.k  staff    59088923 Oct  7 11:44 058-59982-359.dmg\n-rw-r--r--@  1 adam.k  staff    59801627 Oct  7 11:44 058-59988-357.dmg\n-rw-r--r--@  1 adam.k  staff        3282 Oct  7 11:49 Restore.plist\n-rw-r--r--@  1 adam.k  staff      257603 Oct  7 11:53 BuildManifest.plist\n\n```\nAccording to some resources from from the web, I understood that the relevant image here is the largest dmg file. after open it, I got the following mount /Volumes/Tigris15A432.D10D101OS\n\nwhen looking for the right framework in this image, I got :\nSystem/Library/Frameworks/MobileCoreServices.framework\n\nbut it seems that it doesn't contain any dylib/macho files and I couldn't find the symbol...\n\nHowever, In the Info.plist of that framework it says : \n    CFBundleExecutable\n    MobileCoreServices\n\nbut I couldn't find this MobileCoreServices file anywhere in the image ... any idea where should I find it ?\n\n",
