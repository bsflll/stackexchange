I've tried for a few month now to figure out how he managed to do things like this but their is no clear method on how Todo so. I figured the best place to ask would be here.\n\nQuestions\n\n```\n- How did Manfred do it?\n - What can I do to get started in this field of game hacking?\n - What was the method Manfred had used?\n - Is their any resources on this?\nAny help is appreciated. TL;DR - How did Manfred hack so many online games\n\n```\nThank you.\n\n",

I find that attempting something without the prerequisite knowledge can result in you being sidetracked reading/learning and/or giving up.\n\n",
