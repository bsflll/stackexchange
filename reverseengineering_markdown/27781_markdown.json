      "content": "The cleanest way to do this is to click on Options when importing a file:\n\n\n\nthen activate Load External Libraries\n\n\nand make sure that the paths where the libraries are located appear in the list you can change with Edit Paths \n\nThis will import all required libraries into Ghidra:\n\n\n\nand resolve the external symbols to the providing library:\n\n\n\nYou can now (auto) analyze the libraries as you would any other binary, and clicking on the \"thunked Function\"  will open the library in which the function is defined in, in a new tab.\n\nIf you want to do it afterwards, you can still manually import the libraries and then link them via the context menu action Set External Program in the Symbol Tree (for the specific library), then run the FixupELFExternalSymbolsScript.java GhidraScript\n\n",
