      "content": "One possible method is if there are string tables present, and pointer tables to those strings, is load the bin into IDA at zero and find the strings, then write a program to search the binary looking for int32 differences that matched the differences in the start of each string.\n\nI searched for byte/word/int's in big/little endian formats, and once you find the match, then you can calc the correct base from the difference from you search address and the resulting address/pointer table.\n\nHere's the C# code I used\n\n```\nstatic void SearchDumpsForIntDiff(string filename, params int[] dcode)\n{\n    var sw = new StreamWriter(File.Open(filename + \"status.txt\", FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.ReadWrite));\n\n    byte[] data = File.ReadAllBytes(filename);\n\n    if (data.Length == 0) return;\n\n    int dl = dcode.Length;\n    for(int loc = 0; loc < (data.Length - (dcode.Length*4)); loc++)     \n    {\n        for(int off = 0; off < (dcode.Length-1); off++)\n        {\n            int t1 = dcode[off];\n            int t2 = dcode[off + 1];\n            int d1 = (t2 - t1)/8;\n            int v1 = (int)ReadUint32(data, loc + ((off + 0) * 4));\n            int v2 = (int)ReadUint32(data, loc + ((off + 1) * 4));\n\n            int d2 = v2 - v1; \n\n            if( d1 != d2 )\n                break;\n\n            if( off == (dcode.Length-2))\n            {                            \n                sw.WriteLine(\"Match at {0:X8}\",  loc);\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Match at {0:X8}\",  loc);\n            }\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    sw.Close();\n    sw.Dispose();\n}\n\n```\nwhich I used like\n\n```\nSearchDumpsForIntDiff(@\"Nikon\\D7000Update\\b750103a.bin\", 0x79DF9A, 0x79DFB2, 0x79DFBA, 0x79DFC2);\n\n```\n",
