  "content": "Is there a way to specify the name of a function when creating it with idc.MakeFunction()?\n\nIf not, what is the best practice to rename a function?\nI found idc.GetFunctionName(ea) but no counterpart to set a name. A google research turned up some examples where people used idc.MakeNameEx(). Yet, the purpose of MakeNameExseems to be to rename addresses:\n\n```\ndef MakeNameEx(ea, name, flags): \"\"\" Rename an address\n\n@param ea: linear address\n@param name: new name of address. If name == \"\", then delete old name @param\nflags: combination of SN_... constants\n\n```\nAnd involves a whole bunch of flags such as:\n\n```\n[...]\nSN_NOCHECK    = idaapi.SN_NOCHECK    # Replace invalid chars with SubstChar\nSN_PUBLIC     = idaapi.SN_PUBLIC     # if set, make name public \nSN_NON_PUBLIC = idaapi.SN_NON_PUBLIC # if set, make name non-public \nSN_WEAK       = idaapi.SN_WEAK       # if set, make name weak \nSN_NON_WEAK   = idaapi.SN_NON_WEAK   # if set, make name non-weak\n[...]\n\n```\nWhat I need is a simple rename of a function keeping all its properties, flags etc...\n\n",
