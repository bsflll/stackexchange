      "content": "Starting from address 0x56 all your instructions seems to be off. And if you look closely it there is a pattern how much off they are from the original.\n\nFor example, at offset 0x58, there's supposed to be push edx so the byte should be 0x52, but you have push esp which is 0x54. Since the article mentions that this part is encrypted with a xor (with a single digit key), let's see how those values are off\n\n```\nIn [7]: 0x52 ^ 0x54\nOut[7]: 6\n\n```\nSo this is exactly the key mentioned in the article. If we compare the rest of those off instruction we will notice that they are off by the same value.\n\nConclusion - this part of code shown in Ghidra was not decrypted and should be preprocessed before analysis.\n\n",
