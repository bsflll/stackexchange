  "content": "I enjoy idling in programming related IRC channels so I can research any topic which catches my interest.  I have checked the channels for a few forums that I browse, but I can't seem to find an active community.  What are some active RCE related channels?  It can be about malware analysis / tools / general help / etc, anything.\n\nHopefully this is on topic.  I can't think of anywhere else to ask.\n\n",
