      "content": "Seems like radare has problems with passing arguments starting with dash (\"-\"). Please consider open an issue.\n\nAnyway, you can pass arguments to radare2 debugged program in several ways.\n\nThe simplest way is:\n\n```\nr2 -d program arg1 arg2 arg3\n\n```\nFor example:\n\n```\n$ r2 -d echo Hello, World!\nProcess with PID 4755 started...\n= attach 4755 4755\nbin.baddr 0x00400000\nUsing 0x400000\nasm.bits 64\n -- You haxor! Me jane?\n\n[0x7f9b1b000c30]> dc\nHello, World!\n\n```\nAnother way is using the ood command inside radare2 shell:\n\nExecute radare2 ./program, then type ood arg1 arg2 arg3. The ood command is used to \"reopen in debugger mode (with args)\".\n\n```\n$ r2 /bin/ls\n -- Use V! to enter into the visual panels mode (dwm style)\n\n[0x004049a0]> doo -la\nProcess with PID 4757 started...\nFile dbg:///bin/ls  -la reopened in read-write mode\n= attach 4757 4757\n4757\n\n[0x7f5f36600c30]> dc\ntotal 206\ndrwxrwxrwx 0 root root   512 Feb 13 04:25 .\ndrwxrwxrwx 0 root root   512 Jan 16 05:30 ..\n\n```\nYou can also call ood with dynamic parameters using backticks. For example we want debug our program using the content from a file on our system as an arguments:\n\n```\nood `!cat file.txt`\n\n```\nSay file.txt content is 'foo bar' so this equivalent to executing ood foo bar\n\nAnother way to pass arguments to radare2 debugged program is by using rarun2 profile files:\n\n```\n$ r2 -R profile.rr2 -d program\n$ cat profile.rr2\n#!/usr/bin/rarun2\narg1=foo\narg2=bar\n\n```\n",
