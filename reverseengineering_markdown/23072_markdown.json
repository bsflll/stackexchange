  "content": "I already asked this question on StackOverflow, but it is not getting attention; maybe here is a better place\n\nI am running the Android emulator that comes with the Android Studio software. I created an AVD based on Pixel 2. Opening the ADB shell I get:\n\n```\n$ getprop ro.product.manufacturer\nunknown\n\n```\nI would like to change the string returned as property ro.product.manufacturer, because I have an app the refuses to run on an \"unknown\" device. How can I do that?\n\nThe file config.ini for the AVD has a line\n\n```\nhw.device.manufacturer=Google\n\n```\nbut this does not seem to be the same thing.\n\n",
