  "content": "I'm currently using radare2 in order to construct a simple CFG, each block/node in that graph is composed of one or more assembly instructions, I wish to estimate the value of specific register or stack position as best as I can.\n\nFew examples:\n\nExample 1:\n\n```\nxor rax, rax\ninc rax\n; Given these instructions, solve(rax) => 1\n\n```\nExample 2:\n\n```\nmov rcx, 3\nmov rbx, rcx\nmov rax, rbx\n; Given the instructions above, solve(rax) => 3\n\n```\nExample 3:\n\n```\nmov rbx, rcx\nmov rax, rbx\n; Given the instructions above, solve(rax) => Unknown\n\n```\nExample 4:\n\n```\nmov rdx, 1\nshl rdx, 2\nadd rdx, 3\nmov [rsp], rdx\n; Given the instructions above, solve([rsp]) => 7\n\n```\nI'm looking for a simple Python example to start with, which either takes opcodes directly or and address and evaluates/solve for specific register/stack position.\n\nI've already looked into some symbolic execution examples, which looks like what I need, but I'm pretty new to this so a simple working example would really help.\n\n",

And hopefully this simple script will help others.\n\nReally good resources to start with:\n\n",
