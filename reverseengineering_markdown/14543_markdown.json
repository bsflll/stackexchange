  "content": "I'm trying to wire a Winbond W25Q128FV to my Rasberry Pi Model 1B so that I can dump the firmware. I'll be using an SOIC8 clip and probe cables.\n\nHere is what I'm thinking:\n\nFlash ----- rPi\n\nCS ----- CS0\n\nDO ----- MISO\n\nWP ----- ??\n\nGND ----- GND\n\nVCC ----- 3V3\n\nHOLD ----- ??\n\nCLK ----- SCLK\n\nDI ----- MOSI\n\nI've read that WP and HOLD/RESET should also be connected to 3V3, but there's only 2 3V3 pins on my pi?\n\n",
