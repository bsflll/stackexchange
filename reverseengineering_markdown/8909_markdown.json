  "content": "I was analyzing a sample and the function CreateRemoteThread is called with dwCreationFlag = 0, so the created thread starts immediately after creation.\nOllyDbg jumps to beginning of the new thread. I analyze the new thread and at the end of that, it calls RtlExitUserThread and the thread is terminated.\n\nTo visualize, you can consider the following:\n\n```\n  PUSH EAX                              ; dwCreationFlag = 0\n     .\n     .\n     .\n  CALL DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-28]           ; CreateRemoteThread\n     .\n  (lines which I would also like to analyze)\n\n```\nAs I described, the new thread starts and it ends with a call to RtlExitUserThread but I would like to analyze the lines after the call to RtlExitUserThread.\n\nHow can I go back to the main thread, because there was a lot of lines to analyze (after the call to CreateRemoteThread)?\n\n",
