  "content": "I have this Asm from a book that suppose to do a Boolean cast: rax := rax ? 1 : 0\n\n```\n1. neg      rax\n2. sbb      rax,rax\n3. neg      rax\n\n```\nBut as i understand this code and the instructions (below), this would work\nonly if the register will have 0 in it.\n\nbecause lets assume that (register have some positive number in it):\n\n```\nrax = 9    ;initial register\nrax = -9   ;after line 1\nrax = -17  ;after line 2\nrax = 17   ;after line 3\n\n```\nregister have 0 in it:\n\n```\nrax = 0    ;initial register\nrax = 0    ;after line 1\nrax = 0    ;after line 2\nrax = 0    ;after line 3\n\n```\nI think that the author meant to do add in line 2 instead of sbb am i correct?\n\n",
