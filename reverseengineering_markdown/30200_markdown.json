  "content": "My ROP-chain:\npayload = b'A'*80 + pop_rdi + addr_cat_flag + systemPlt\n\nAs far as I know it should work this way, since it is a 64-Bit machine. But the strangest thing is that when insted of calling system I call for example puts then the content at address addr_cat_flag, which in this case is cat flag, is printed to the console. This means that the parameter is hand over corectly.\nThe address of systemPlt should also be correct.\n\nDoes anybody know were the problem could be?\n\n",
