  "content": "I am looking to decompile the sprite data from an old DOS Game (Treasure Cove). If it helps any, I found that the game was written with the Borland C++ Programming Language.\n\nIt appears that the sprites are located in TLD files, though I am incapable of confirming or denying that. If my theory is correct, are there any programs capable of opening TLD files?\n\n\n\nWhat do you suggest I do with this information? It's in Borland C++, and I want to find a method of extracting it.\n\nThis file seems to contain Bitmap signatures. I looked for GIF signatures, and found nothing.\n\n",

I attempted to use Cheat Engine (There’s a snapshot feature that captures each visual object in separate layers). So far, I have no theory besides the TLD files.

For example GIF magic string is \"GIF87a\". This way you can confirm sprite format. After you confirm format you could look for the right tool to extract sprites.",

Diging through decompiled source might help you learn about the gfx (looking for obvious stuff like accessing VGA registers or VRAM segment)...
