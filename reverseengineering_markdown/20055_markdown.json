I'm wondering how to locate the static data structure that are passed as argument to the function call. \n\nI'm ussing x64dbg for the disassembly and have the posibility to use snowman also. \n\nThe specific \"struct\" is the one defined here (DCB used for serial ports configuration) \n\n",

If so, then consider setting a BP on SetCommState() and observe the data that's passed to it when it breaks (which will be made more meaningful if you identify the calling convention).
