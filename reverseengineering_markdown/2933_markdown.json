  "content": "How can i determine the serial protocol of a electric typewriter? some electric typewriters have a serial port in the back and it is a shape that is not commonly used today. I am planing on interfacing the typewriter with a Arduino and using it as a printer.\n\nHow do i determine things such as the baud rate, the pinout and the voltage. I already broke one typewriter trying to find out the protocol, I cannot get a owners manual for the typewriters, all of the other guides that i found involved modifying the circuit board and connecting the wires to the keys. I have not been able to find out how a a typewriter with a serial port works.\n\nHere is a picture of the serial port, what type is it?\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "As Jason Geffner said its a DIN 45326 connector. \nAs far as I know they're normally used in audio, but here is a pin out while used for serial.\n\nNext step would be using an Oscilloscope to determine the baud rate (and voltage). Often the oscilloscope software has some build in tools for automatically determining the baud rate. If not, you simple divide 1 by the period of the wave. E.g. find the 2 peaks with the shortest horizontal distance and measure that time to get the period.\n\nIf you don't have an oscilloscope you'll have to brute force it. I'd start by trying the most common ones which in my experience are:\n\nThe above are the most common these days, but I have no clue back in the old days what was common.\n\n",

The best approach is likely what @n3vermind said; trace the pins back to the interface IC and lookup the functionality of the pins in the data sheet. On the other hand I would probably do the lazy approach first and start probing with an oscilloscope. If I get nonsensical data I'd start confirming that I'm looking at the right pins.
