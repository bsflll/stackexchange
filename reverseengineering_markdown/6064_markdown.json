  "content": "I'm new to debugging with IDA Pro and I ran into the problem that my breakpoint is not hit while attempting to debug with gdbserver. The program is written by myself and it is simple to debug with gdb. Can someone please help me regarding debugging with IDA? Here are the steps I perform for debugging: \n\nI guess the SIGTRAP may already be a problem, however, I don't understand why I get it. What am I doing wrong?\n\nAnyway going further by ignoring the warning:\n\nWhile the output on the terminal running gdbserver prints\n\n```\nChild terminated with signal = 0x5 (SIGTRAP)\nreadchar: Got EOF\nRemote side has terminated connection.  GDBserver will reopen the connection.\nListening on port 1234\n\n```\nPlease let me know if you need more info.\n\nUPDATE: I got fed up with GDB server and am now using Intel PIN for debugging, which works like a charm with IDA Pro.\n\n",

      "content": "The SIGTRAP is generally raised by a debug break exception (int 3).\n\nWhen IDA receives it, it's asking you whether to pass it to the program (unhandled).  If you do, and you do not have a signal handler installed for SIGTRAP, the program will die with a SIGTRAP error, as you see.\n\nYou want IDA to discard the exception, and continue execution (if you want to continue) or suspend to investigate state in IDA.\n\n",
