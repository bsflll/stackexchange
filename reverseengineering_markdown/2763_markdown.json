OllyStepNSearch plugin is used for this case but it is not compatible with the above version of Olly.\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n",

If you want the Unicode value of the register must be written as the following conditions:\n\n```\nEAX == 75007500\n\n```\nThis condition is triggered if the value of EAX equal uu Unicode.\n\n",
