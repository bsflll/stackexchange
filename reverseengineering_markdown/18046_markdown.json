  "content": "Why do most hackers/modders use pointers instead of editing the static region of the game executable? For example I downloaded so many trainers and I can see most of them are using pointers. I prefer to set a break point on the value and track the caller function, this works 100% of the time where I only have to nop the instruction or alter it or at worst make my subroutine and code cave it.\n\nIs there a downside with my method that i'm not aware of?\n\n",

But depending on the time spent on researching any given game, you may find that pointers for something will persist across updates. You really don't know what the case will be until you dig in (or, as can be the case, you pick an approach and hope for the best, then deal with whatever you might have to if the cheat breaks later).",

To add to this, some programs also check the values in memory addresses for any modifications, so pointers won't necessarily work, either (this is very game-dependent, so you learn what you're up against as you dive in). Two games I hacked recently had some fun anti-cheat implementations that watched for value modifications in addresses, as well as modifications to game code (like Dark Souls 3, which cyclically scans code and restores any modified bytes). In those two games, one would insta-kill your character if you modified a value, and the other would close the game.",

A great way to learn and familiarize yourself with many of them is to spend time in communities like MPGH and UnknownCheats (Google them), and put what you learn into practice. Depending on what your targets tend to be, it can get expensive. Expect to be banned and then have to purchase the game again. As for your second question, yes, I got around them. They were fun challenges. Give them a try sometime: Caveblazers and UnEpic are the two games. Try modifying gold in each game... =)",
