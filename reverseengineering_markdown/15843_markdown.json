  "content": "I have a datasheet of the HCS08 micro-controller family from NXP. I have a Raspberry Pi and some time. I admit that this is my first time delving this deep into hardware RE, so be gentle with me.\n\nI got the damn thing to spit numbers out at me, so I know that the chip has a serial output at least. And, I have the chip mounted on a breakout board and I have a breadboard handy. Also, let's assume security bit is not set (fingers crossed!!!).\n\nI try to get out the firmware to a file.\n\nAny help would be appreciated, even a couple links and a tip or two for my specific case if you could!\n\n",
