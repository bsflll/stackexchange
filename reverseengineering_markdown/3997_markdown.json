  "content": "I loaded an MS-Windows executable in Ollydbg. But as soon as I hit run from the Debug menu a message shows up: \n\nAnd the program doesn't run, rather it breaks to Ollydbg. I am puzzled. What is really going on? I see an isdebugger call. Fixing it, also, it doesn't run the program. I suppose it's using some advanced anti debugging technique. Any suggestions?\n\nHere is the log from windbg:\n\n```\n(a9c.1fd4): Break instruction exception - code 80000003 (first chance)\n*** ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.
