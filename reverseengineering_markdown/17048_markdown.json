  "content": "I decompile a VC++ application in IDA 7, and I often find vftables referencing the same function multiple times, like the one I called \"Object__pure\" here, part of a \"heavy-base\" Object class inherited by almost every other class in the application:\n\n```\nseg002:008F4748     const Object::`vftable' dd offset Object__free ; DATA XREF: Object__ctor+12↑o Object__dtor+A↑o Object__copy+16↑o\nseg002:008F474C         dd offset Object__vsub_7D0990\nseg002:008F4750         dd offset Object__vsub_7D09A0\nseg002:008F4754         dd offset Object__pure\nseg002:008F4758         dd offset Object__pure\nseg002:008F475C         dd offset Object__pure\nseg002:008F4760         dd offset Object__pure\nseg002:008F4764         dd offset Object__vsub_47B660\n\n```\nChild classes in my executable inheriting from Object typically have their own custom functions instead of those \"pure\" (how I called them) ones in their vtable. \n\nNot really knowing what that could be, I gave it the name \"pure\", thinking about it like a virtual or pure virtual call. The function itself does nothing other than calling a completely empty Object__vsub_80CD50:\n\n```\nseg000:007E4580     Object__pure proc near ; CODE XREF: <lots!>\nseg000:007E4580\nseg000:007E4580     a1  = dword ptr -4\nseg000:007E4580     arg_0= dword ptr  8\nseg000:007E4580\nseg000:007E4580 000     push    ebp\nseg000:007E4581 004     mov     ebp, esp\nseg000:007E4583 004     push    ecx\nseg000:007E4584 008     mov     [ebp+a1], ecx\nseg000:007E4587 008     mov     eax, [ebp+arg_0]\nseg000:007E458A 008     push    eax\nseg000:007E458B 00C     mov     ecx, [ebp+a1] ; this\nseg000:007E458E 00C     call    Object__vsub_80CD50 ; Call Procedure\nseg000:007E4593 00C     mov     esp, ebp\nseg000:007E4595 004     pop     ebp\nseg000:007E4596 000     retn    4 ; Return Near from Procedure\nseg000:007E4596     Object__pure endp\n\n...\n\nseg000:0080CD50     Object__vsub_80CD50 proc near ; CODE XREF: <lots again!>\nseg000:0080CD50\nseg000:0080CD50     var_4= dword ptr -4\nseg000:0080CD50\nseg000:0080CD50 000     push    ebp\nseg000:0080CD51 004     mov     ebp, esp\nseg000:0080CD53 004     push    ecx\nseg000:0080CD54 008     mov     [ebp+var_4], ecx\nseg000:0080CD57 008     mov     esp, ebp\nseg000:0080CD59 004     pop     ebp\nseg000:0080CD5A 000     retn    4 ; Return Near from Procedure\nseg000:0080CD5A     Object__vsub_80CD50 endp\n\n```\nWhy is such a function referenced multiple times? Is it due to optimization, unifying functions that do nothing? Are those functions typically virtual / pure virtual?\n\n",

      "content": "As I guessed and was confirmed in the comments, this is apparently some compiler optimization reusing methods executing the same logic.\n\nThis got clear to me when I reversed the methods of one of the more specific objects, like the data stream reader / writer here:\n\n```\nseg002:008F4FC4     const DataStream::`vftable' dd offset DataStream__readByte ; DATA XREF: DataStream__ctor+12↑o\nseg002:008F4FC8         dd offset DataStream__readWord\nseg002:008F4FCC         dd offset DataStream__readDword\nseg002:008F4FD0         dd offset DataStream__readBytes\nseg002:008F4FD4         dd offset DataStream__canReadWrite\nseg002:008F4FD8         dd offset DataStream__writeByte\nseg002:008F4FDC         dd offset DataStream__writeWord\nseg002:008F4FE0         dd offset DataStream__writeDword\nseg002:008F4FE4         dd offset DataStream__writeBytes\nseg002:008F4FE8         dd offset DataStream__canReadWrite\n\n```\nYou can see that the methods canRead and canWrite were simply optimized into one method (which I named canReadWrite) as the logic for both is the same (hexrays output):\n\n```\nbool __thiscall DataStream::canReadWrite(DataStream *this, int lengthRequired)\n{\n    return this->members.pData <= this->members.pDataEnd\n        && this->members.pDataEnd - this->members.pData >= lengthRequired;\n}\n\n```\nIt may be the case that some other data stream class (like a read- or write-only one) will implement each method differently (returning simply false for said cases), but not in this class.\n\nThus, for an even more generic base class like Object above, a lot of methods do nothing specific in particular, and are optimized into one.\n\n",
