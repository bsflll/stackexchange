  "content": "I am trying to do windows kernel debugging with VirtualBox and WinDBG. But every time I hit a breakpoint the virtual machine CPU usage skyrockets and the CPU registers do not show up in WinDBG. Am I doing something wrong?\n\nWhat I have done:\n\nIn WinDBG the debug session is found, and I can hit breakpoints, I can step through code, I can see the disassembled code in the \"Disassembly window\", and I can view memory locations in the \"Memory window\". But nothing shows up in WinDBG \"Registers window\".\n\nThe Host OS is Windows 10 and for the Virtual Guest OS i tried both Windows XP and Windows 7 both have the same issue.\n\nI am really not sure where to look for answers to this issue, could anyone point me in the right direction ?\n\nFor anyone else having this issue or trying to learn kernel debugging i used parts from the following tutorials to get to where I am so far:\n\n",
