  "content": "I have some printed circuit boards of a device that is no longer manufactured. I need to repair these boards but there is no replacement for them. I can make other boards, buy the components, but I can not get the firmware, the microcontroller is a STC 89C58RD.\n\nI found a datasheet:\n\nhttp://www.stcmcu.com/datasheet/stc/STC-AD-PDF/STC89C58RD+-english.pdf\n\nAs I could see it can be programmed by serial  RS232 interface. I looked for a programmer but I just find this document in chinese(I'm not sure)  as following :\n\nhttps://www.stcmicro.com/pdf/STC-ISP-Programmer_V6.0_Manual.pdf\n\nI already read and study a bit about JTAG standard and the TAP controller state machine to do a similar job with a Motorola Microcontroller, but I would like to know if someone know this microcontroller STC 89C58RD or has a tip about how to perform this task. \n\n",

STC says that it's a \"feature\" of their microcontrollers, the bootloader protects the code.\n\nLinks related to this question for anyone who might be interested:\nhttps://github.com/grigorig/stcgal/issues/7\nhttps://embdev.net/topic/404939\nhttps://github.com/grigorig/stcgal/issues/18\n\n",
