  "content": "I'm writing an IDC script which accepts a structure and does some processing. Currently, I have to call it by typing structure names. What I want is to make it use the structure under cursor in \"Structures\" window so I can save a lot of typing. Is there any way to do this?\n\nTried ScreenEA(). It returns the address in \"Disassembly\" window instead of a structure id.\n\nIDAPython code is also acceptable.\n\n",

      "content": "May be bit of an odd question - but how do you run the script? Hotkeys don't work while the structure view is open, and if you run a script via Alt+F7 for example the cursor position changes.\n\nThat said, one solution that may be good enough:\n\n```\nimport ida_kernwin\n\nret = ida_kernwin.get_highlight(ida_kernwin.get_current_widget())\nif ret and ret[1]:\n    print \"Current highlight: %s\" % ret[0]\n\n```\nBasically, you need to click the structure name so it's highlighted (yellow), then the above code will print the struct name.\n\n",
