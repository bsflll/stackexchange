  "content": "I have a Linux kernel file and I need to tweak the contents of its corresponding initramfs. I did it in the past for standard distros where kernel and initramfs were separate. However, this specific kernel comes with an embedded initramfs which makes it all a lot more complicated. Worse still, all I have is a binary image, so recompiling is not possible. Binwalk describes the kernel structure as follows:\n\n```\nMicrosoft executable, portable (PE)\n\ngzip compressed data, maximum compression, from Unix, last modified: 1970-01-01 00:00:00 (null date)\n\nObject signature in DER format (PKCS header length: 4, sequence length: 1509\n\nCertificate in DER format (x509 v3), header length: 4, sequence length: 769\n\n```\nExtracting and modifying the embedded initramfs is pretty straightforward - the second section of the kernel (as per binwalk output above) is a gzipped vmlinux which I can extract either using extract-vmlinux or by manually dding the .gz archive out of the kernel image and then extracting it with gunzip. The last section of resulting vmlinux is a gzipped cpio archive with initramfs I intend to modify. Unfortunately, sticking it all back together (with a great care taken to keep the unmodified fragments of the original kernel image intact) renders the kernel unbootable. Here's a more detailed description of my approach:\n\nSide notes:\n\n```\nqemu-system-x86_64 -kernel <NEW KERNEL IMAGE FILE>\n\n```\nresults either in a freeze or an infinite boot loop with a \"Booting from ROM...\" message displayed in both cases.\n\nMy wild guess is that even a slight change in gzipped vmlinux data layout confuses the kernel decompression routine located earlier in the image. Is there a simple way to fix it by means of a raw binary edit? I don't have a detailed knowledge of Linux kernel internal structure (I do know about piggy.o and other object files a kernel image consists of, but a serious research is still ahead of me). I'm ready to learn, but I hope someone more experienced will at least point me in the right direction. My question boils down to: how to safely embed a (possibly modified) vmlinux back into its corresponding kernel image? Any help will be appreciated.\n\n",

The output of binwalk shows a certificate section. Binwalk does not always get things 100% right but maybe it is a signed kernel image (UKI). So there might be some verification involved and changing contents will render the kernel unbootable. In general I would recommend the kernel-newbies irc. Maybe there is already a tool/script in the kernel src for extracting/reassembling such images.",

The kernel is part of a full bootable image consisting of several partitions, some of which are encrypted, but that's irrelevant at the moment. Currently the boot process does not go beyond initramfs, but that's not a problem, either - I'm able to access init script in initramfs and have an idea how to modify it in order to proceed. The whole point is that I can't assemble the fragmented kernel back to a state where it's bootable.",

I don't have detailed info about the system as a whole, but it could be some custom version of Ubuntu (definitely not a regular one, as standard ones come with separate kernel and initramfs).",

So you might not know where your new kernel stops. If it is quiet by default it could just be due to the initramfs failing. Under which circumstances does boot freeze and when does it reboot? If the original kernel is working shouldn't it be possible to get more info on the kernel version from within initramfs?",
