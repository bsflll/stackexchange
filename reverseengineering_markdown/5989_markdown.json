What's the correct sequence of actions in IDA to accomplish this?\n\n",

      "content": "This will probably be much easier to do if you use a debugger to dynamically analyze the process than with static analysis.\n\nIf the application uses the plain windows API, you could try a software like spy++ to get the address of the dialog procedure, which is called whenever something interesting happens within the dialog Or, you could place a breakpoint on then DialogBox API functions (there are several of them, DialogBoxA for ascii strings, DialogBoxW for wide char strings, and some DialogBoxEx variants). Once you know the address, you can look up that in IDA.\n\nIf the application uses some window toolkit (like gtk, qt, swing if it's a java application, whatever), this might be a bit harder, because these toolkits will probably use only a small subset of the Windows API and do the event handling themselves. It might, however, still be successful if you place a breakpoint on GetWindowText and/or GetDlgItemText (again, in several A/W/Ex variants) to check when and where the application actually reads what you've entered.\n\nIf, for some reason, you absolutely can't use a debugger and have to use IDA only, you can still try to cross-reference the above functions and work your way from there. But, since you don't know which of the cross-references is used in the password checking code, this will probably be much harder/more time consuming.\n\nApart from this, some of the ideas in my answer to a similar question might help you.\n\n",

For example, in IDA Pro:\n\n\n\nIf it's a simple password crackme, you should be looking for code which iterates through each character of a string, i.e. the user input, and compares it to some hardcoded value. Alternatively, as others have elaborated, you could look for specific uses of the Win32 API and find cross-references.\n\n",
