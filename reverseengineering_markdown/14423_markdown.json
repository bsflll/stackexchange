  "content": "I am trying to use __kernel_vsyscall instead of syscall/int 80 on linux x64.\nI have read that it can be done on Intel chips (I have one), but i can't find how can one do it. I have x32 version:\n\n```\nint main() {\n    __asm__(\n    \"               movl $1, %eax    \n\"\n    \"               movl $42, %ebx   \n\"\n    \"               call *%gs:0x10   \n\"\n    );\n}\n\n```\nOne can compile & run it this way:\n\n% cc -m32 exit42.c -o x\n% ./x; echo $?\n42\n\nSo, how can i call vdso syscalls on x64 without syscall and int 80? \n\n",
