  "content": "I'm looking at a PE file that loads a bunch of strings and offsets into memory one after the other, and I was wondering whether there was any way to mark all of the dwords in a range of memory as offsets, and all references to chars in a range of memory as strings.\n\nI could do each manually, but it seems like the kind of thing that you should be able to reanalyze during debug or that you should be able to collectively reclassify.\n\n",

This would be the behaviour should you manually make them \"offsets\".\n\n",
