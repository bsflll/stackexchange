  "content": "```\n**The Ontario Driver's License follows the below format:**\n\n```\nLXxxx-FFFMY-YMMDD\n\nWhere:\n\nI still have not found where B,I,O,U,V, or X falls on this chart. If you know anyone whose middle name starts with one of these letters please ask them what the 9th digit of their license is, this will give you that specific value for the chart. Also, I will mention that if a license has no middle name, the 9th digit is always a 0.\n\nI guess at this point I am looking for some additional direction on how digits 3-8 are calculated using an actual formula instead of tracking all possible outcomes as I come across them.\n\nOn a side note if anyone needs some explanation on how to decode Quebec License #'s I have some additional information available.\n\n",

      "content": "Just let you know, anyone with same last name will have same first 4 numbers regardless of what their first name is.\n\nYou can see this with Chinese last names. Anyone with last name Chen, by the way, it will ALWAYS be C3344.\n\nExample:\n\nThe same goes for people with a last name like ZHEN.\nZ3344.\n\nNow to compare two very similar names:\n\nBut then for Last name CHAN, it is\nC3175\n\nCompare a similar name:\n\n*again, the last digit for both names is associated with birth date, and can be disregarded.\n\nfor the last names WANG, TANG &\nYANG it is the same.\n\n(^ Note the similarities between Wang, Xuan and Yang, Zhenfei. Last digit 8 can be disregarded )\n\nI have heard that first numbers are indeed last name but only maybe the first 2 (starting from your 2nd letter) and then the last 2 letters.)\n\nI've heard that the middle numbers are the first names but might exclude certain letters or all vowels of the alphabet, or have some letters may have two digits, and m vowels. And that a single number can represent multiple letters, of course.\n\nI've also heard it might get even more complex - with things like if a letter in the name is followed by a specific  letter, then both letters become a different number.\n\n```\n(*i read somewhere that new jersey uses the same system for coding licenses. You can find the actual new jersey license coding information online however idk if this is still how its done, I wouldn't bet on it.)*\n\n```\nAnyways, moving on. More examples.\n\nFor the last name\n\n2 letter last names will have many zeros. Double or triple Zeros seem to appear when there is a lack of letters for the code. L\n\nAlso, I'm sure u know the last digits are birthday but for females, you add +50 to the month number. If you're a girl born in January, which is 01, the code will put 51. (Because 01+50=51. Then  followed by ur day of birth at the end.\n\n",
