  "content": "-- Edit with latest update on the problem, it is not solved yet :( --\n\nWhile playing with an ARM embedded Linux system (Version 3.8.13), out of curiosity, I created a small \"debug\" kernel module.\n\nThis \"debug\" module branches a specific flow in another kernel module to a function in this \"debug\" module, which executes some logic and then resumes execution peacefully.\n\nTo avoid clutter of the stack area, the first executed logic is changing SP to point at an empty area inside the \"debug\" module code section.\n\nThe system crashes couple of seconds after executing mov sp, r2, and entering an infinite loop. (r2 holds the address to the empty area).\n\nNote that the crash happens before the \"debug\" module executes any stack-related opcode (or actually any other opcode, for that matter).\n\nFrom the last test, it's pretty clear that when a context-switch happens, some values are being saved on the stack. If it points to that free area, the system crashes\n\nIt seems that there isn't any problem with using stack operations on the free area, but yet when some context-switch happens, the system crashes.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Take a look at the memory access control section under the virtual memory system architecture chapter for the ARM architecture reference manual.\n\n",
