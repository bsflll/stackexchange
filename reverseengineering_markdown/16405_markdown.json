      "content": "It's difficult to say for sure since the tool is closed-source, but I suspect it means that the file contains extra data after the end of the document. For example, RTF usually begins with {\\rtf1, contains many embedded commands  (some using nested {} for parameters) and ends with a matching }. If there is extra data after the final }, it's not part of the document but could be part of the payload used by the exploit inside the main body. It is of course not a 100% indicator of a malicious file but just one of the possible hints that it should be checked more thoroughly.\n\nTo confirm, you can try running it on this sample RTF file from Wikipedia:\n\n```\n{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fswiss Helvetica;}\\f0\\pard\nThis is some {\\b bold} text.\\par\n}\n\n```\nAdd some extra data at the end and see if it triggers the warning.\n\n",
