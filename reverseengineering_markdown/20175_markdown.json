      "content": "I think this is the reason why there are some WinAPIs that also existing in kernelbase.dll. \n\n\"As an example of functionality that we moved to low-level binaries, kernelbase.dll gets functionality from kernel32.dll and advapi32.dll. This means that the existing binary now forwards calls down to the new binary rather than handling them directly; the forwarding can be static (the export table shows the redirection), or runtime (the dll has a stub routine that calls down to the new binary). This will impact low-level applications such as security and backup applications that are dependent upon internal APIs and offsets.\"\n\nReference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/Win7AppQual/new-low-level-binaries\n\nSee the example below. \n\nThis is the disassembly of OpenProcess in Kernel32.dll which redirects the OpenProcess to Kernelbase.dll\n\n\nDisassembly of OpenProcess in Kernelbase.dll that call the Native API NTOpenProcess\n\n\n\n",
