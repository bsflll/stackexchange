  "content": "I have an ARM IoT device with a web interface, and I have the binary of this device open in Ida Pro.\n\nI looking for vulnerabilities in the webserver binary that can be exploited to run commands or bypass authentication.\n\nThere is the manual way, looking for unsafe functions in the binary that are susceptible to buffer overflows, or looking in the webserver to find input that is passed to exec or other input that can download files from the system.\n\nI know this is the manual and slow way.\n\nIs there any tool or maybe Ida Pro plugin that helps to find a vulnerabilities in binaries/in web applications?\n\n",
