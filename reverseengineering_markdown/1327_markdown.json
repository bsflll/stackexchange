I'd like to add PDB support to Hopper using pdbparse, but I haven't been able to get it to use external libraries.\n\nAlternatively, I suppose one could just dump the debug symbol offsets to a text file and read that, but it seems like a clunkier solution (since you wouldn't be able to, e.g., auto-download symbols from the MS Symbol Server).\n\n",
