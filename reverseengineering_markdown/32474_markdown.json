  "content": "I asked exactly the same question here, but later I figure out this community and found out this helpful to ask it here as well.\n\nI would like to have a decompiled pseudo-code in Ghidra like:\n\n```\nFUN_4c4363e8(\"Hello world\");\n\n```\nThis is what usually I see in IDA , but in Ghidra, by default I get such a code:\n\n```\nFUN_4c4363e8((char*)(DAT_4c447798));\n\n```\nIs there a way to force the decompiler to convert the DAT_4c447798 memory address to \"Hello world\" null-terminated string?\n\nThanks.\n\n",
