  "content": "I would like to automate a process of enabling buttons with cond bp.\n\nFirst, I found that function user32.EnableWindow is called from mfc110u.dll.\n\nSo I went there and set cond bp on the second arg of the function. \n\nThis arg2==0 when you want the button to be disabled and arg2==1 when enabled.\n\nSo what I did ?\n\nBut for some reason this does not work. Maybe the command A is not implemented. I downloaded the two another plugins \"Command Line v1.10\" and \"Command Bar v3.20.110\" but unfortunately I do not know the identifiers for these plugings.\n\nSo any ideas ?\n\n",

      "content": "Thanx Jason for the tip. I tried it before but it did not work. Now I tried it again and hopefuly it seems working. In olly command line when I wrote A (EBP+8) DD 1 I saw it worked. The syntax for script is asm eip, \"mov eax, ecx\", so I tried to write asm (ebp+8), \"dd 1\", but did not work. So I tried asm ebp+8, \"dd 1\" and it seems working. I put conditional breakpoints manualy and constructed this nice dirty code:\n\nSTART:\nasm ebp+8, \"dd 1\"\nrun\njmp START\n\nit works nicely. Thanx for the tip again\"!\n\n",
