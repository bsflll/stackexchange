  "content": "I am trying to make some changes to the setup program that installs the game \"Emperor: Battle for Dune\". If you want to look at the EXE I am working on, you can download a copy of this setup program from the official Install Fix patch here: http://dune2k.com/Duniverse/Games/Emperor/Downloads/Patches (download the \"Install Fix:\" entry and it is Setup.exe).\n\nFor some reason, the developers decided to make the installer a fullscreen application and so I am trying to modify it to instead run in a window. It uses the DirectDraw API (not entirely sure what version but I think it is 7 or 8). Thus, I know that the function \"SetCooperativeLevel\" (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/ddraw/nf-ddraw-idirectdraw7-setcooperativelevel) is used to initialize the DDraw application in fullscreen or windowed mode. \n\nMy problem is that I tried to disassemble the EXE using both IDA Pro 7.0 and OllyDbg 2.01 but neither of them have been able to find any calls to that function. Can anyone tell me if there is anything I can do to help one of these programs find this call? Alternatively, is it possible for a DDraw program to go into fullscreen mode without the SetCooperativeLevel function?\n\nEdit: I attempted to use Defragger's suggestion below. Unfortunately, it didn't work. I modified the code he pointed out as per below to simply change the dimensions to 800x600 but it did not change anything. The window is still in fullscreen and doesn't appear different at all:\n\n```\n.text:004619BF                 mov     esi, ds:GetSystemMetrics\n.text:004619C5                 push    258h            ; yBottom\n.text:004619CA                 push    320h            ; xRight\n.text:004619CF                 push    0               ; yTop\n.text:004619D1                 push    0               ; xLeft\n.text:004619D3                 push    offset Rect     ; lprc\n.text:004619D8                 call    ds:SetRect\n\n```\nI found that I could only modify the \"yBottom\" and \"xRight\" parameters safely. If I modified \"yTop\" or \"xLeft\", the program crashed.\n\n",

Idapro counts four xrefs to\nSetRect. You could try to set a breakpoint directly at the top of SetRect to see who's calling it. If you would like to change the behavior of a function completely you can use something like https://frida.re i think something like this would work:\n\n```\nInterceptor.attach (Module.findExportByName(\"user32.dll\", \"SetRect\"), {\nonEnter: function (args) {\n    args[2]= args[2].shr(1);\n    args[3] = args[3].shr(1);\n},\nonLeave: function (retval) {});\n\n```\nSave this into some js file and spawn your process with this line after installing frida on your system: frida -f SETUP.EXE -l yourscript.js\nI hope that will work for you.\n\n",

To find offset of SetCooperativeLevel you need to identify the exact version of the IDirectDraw instance (iid parameter) and then find the structure. For instance, if this is IID_IDirectDraw7, look for github.com/apitrace/dxsdk/blob/master/Include/ddraw.h#L1273 SetCooperativeLevel is the 20th method, multiply it by 4 (size of a pointer) and the offset should be 0x50.",
