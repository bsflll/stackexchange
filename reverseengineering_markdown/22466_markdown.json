  "content": "I am trying to convert the following bytes into their corresponding dates.\n\nI am not 100% on format the dates is stored, this format is returned from the application that read them.\n\nBytes   Date value\n\n```\n25 47 = 04/19/2005\n32 47 = 05/02/2005\n30 47 = 04/30/2005\n31 47 = 05/01/2005\nD8 46 = 02/01/2005\n\n3D 48 = 01/24/2006\n3F 48 = 01/26/2006\n45 48 = 02/01/2006\n\n1E 53 = 09/09/2013\n15 53 = 08/31/2013\n4C 53 = 10/25/2013\n70 53 = 11/30/2013\n\n3E 58 = 04/13/2017\n4F 58 = 04/30/2017\n\n92 59 = 03/19/2018\n9E 59 = 03/31/2018\n\n```\nThe application was developed in the 1980s, so I am assuming that if there is an epoch, it is 1980 or before.\n\nThere is clearly a pattern that the byte values increase as the dates increases.\n\nI have tried subtracting the decimal value from the date as days - that did not work since the epoch was different for some dates.\n\nI have also tried to look at binary bits; 4 bits for month, 5 for day, and the rest for year. That did not work either.\n\nThis data came from a .dbm file created with DataEase 5.53 if that helps.\n\n",

(Thanks to Ian for the answer)\n\n```\n06/08/1955 => 0x0000 => 00 00\n07/08/1955 => 0x0001 => 01 00\n08/08/1955 => 0x0002 => 02 00\n...\n\n```\n",
