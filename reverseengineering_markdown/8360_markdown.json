  "content": "Simple as that. I have a massive Disassembly, that I want to check for I.P addresses. Since the text search in IDA doesn't seem to have a regex function, I'm not sure the best way to get this done. Perhaps a script? \n\nI also realize this may be complicated by the fact that some of the I.P adresses may not exist as strings. \n\n",
