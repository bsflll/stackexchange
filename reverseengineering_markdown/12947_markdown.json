  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/12947/arm-assembly-ldrh-instruction-to-c",
  "content": "I've been reversing an asm checksum code for the last days, and I've managed to understand how it completly works, except for one instruction; ldrh\n\nThe info I've been able to found says that it's basically a ldr instruction which loads a half word (2 bytes). But the problem is that the ldr() instruction has a lot of variants and there's no info about how this one would be wrote in pseudo C.\n\nSpecifically my instruction is:\nldrh  r3,[r12,r3]\nIf it were a normal ldr, the pseudo code will be\nr3 = r12[r3];\n(r12 is an addres to a memory place so I don't understand what it really does..Does it loads the value at r12+r3 into r3?\n\n",
