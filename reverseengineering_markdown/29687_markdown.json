  "content": "I've been implementing some Windows internals code and when I have tried to document this structure I have not been able to do so because of those two members. I can't find anything about them.\n\nThis is the definition of the structure I'm talking about:\n\n```\ntypedef struct _PEB_LDR_DATA {\n    DWORD      dwLength;\n    DWORD      dwInitialized;\n    LPVOID     lpSsHandle;\n    LIST_ENTRY InLoadOrderModuleList;\n    LIST_ENTRY InMemoryOrderModuleList;\n    LIST_ENTRY InInitializationOrderModuleList;\n    LPVOID     lpEntryInProgress;\n} PEB_LDR_DATA, *PPEB_LDR_DATA;\n\n```\nDoes anyone know its actual use or content?\n\n",

At least registration with csrss is one of the big items during Win32 UM process initialization.",
