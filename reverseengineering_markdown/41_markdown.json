  "content": "I recently found a plastic box with various dials and unknown sockets on it, in my Grandfather's attic.\n\nIt is around 12\"x8\"x4\".\n\nFrom the plastic, it appears to be of 1980's vintage. I asked around, and no one knows what it is.\n\nWhat safety precautions do I need to follow while opening it up?\n\n",

      "content": "The biggest danger from opening a piece of tech hardware (other than breaking it) is electrical shock.  Equipment, especially older stuff, but really anything was designed to be plugged into the house mains may contain large capacitors in their power circuitry.  These can store a surprising charge that would result in a major shock.  Most modern equipment implements bleeder resistors that render them safe within minutes to an hour at most.  Older equipment should be left unplugged for a day or three unless you know what you are about.\n\nIn particular older CRT monitors and TVs contain a flyback transformer circuit for the electron gun that runs thousands of volts and will hold a charge for a while (hours/days depending on the make and age).\n\n",
