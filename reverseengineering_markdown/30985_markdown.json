  "content": "I have a managed .NET executable that supplies the msil bytecode of a function as raw bytes. It constructs a DynamicMethod object, sets the bytecode with DynamicMethod.DynamicILInfo.SetCode() and invokes it with DynamicMetho.Invoke().\n\nWhat is the best way to decompile or step into this DynamicMethod thing? How do I reverse it?\n\nDnSyp doc has this to say:\n\nBut there has to be a way to deal with it.\n\nI am new to .NET debugging so there might be a simple solution I am missing.\n\n",

      "content": "You can debug DynamicMethod's using the EventPipe API. I've written a library that uses it to allow for code injection via DynamicMethod that can be debugged: https://github.com/damieng/DamienG.Library/blob/master/DamienG.Library/Diagnostics/EventPipe/DynamicMethodInjector.cs\n\nFirst, create a new DynamicMethodInjector object:\nvar injector = new DynamicMethodInjector(\"MyTypeName\", \"MyMethodName\");\n\nThen, add some IL to your DynamicMethod:\ninjector.AddMethodBody(ILGenerator il);\n\nYou can then invoke the DynamicMethod as normal, adding a breakpoint to the EventPipe.Start method to avoid hitting the breakpoint before the IL is injected:\n\n// Inject IL into the process\ninjector.Inject();\n\n// Invoke your DynamicMethod\nvar result = (int)m.Invoke(obj, new object[] { 1, 2 });\n\n\n",
