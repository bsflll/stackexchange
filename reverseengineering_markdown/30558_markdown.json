  "content": "I am working on a project which deals with the BIOS file of a well known manufacturer.\n\nI recovered the file from the disk partition which stores and uses the file in case BIOS is corrupted or its integrity check fails, therefore the file is named as BIOS_PRE.rcv by the system.\n\nThough the file has extension .rcv but it is actually a 32-bits portable executable, while exploring file headers in DIE(Detect it Easy), I found the Rich Signature contains a list of compilers.\n\nExcept MASM which is in the list, I hardly have any hint about Compiler: Universal Tuple Compiler(19.00.26213)[C++] and many more in the list. Or if I am getting it wrong - Microsoft has started renaming its compiler toolkit?\n\nScreenshots:\n\n\n\n\n\n",
