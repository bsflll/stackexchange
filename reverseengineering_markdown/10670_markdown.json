  "content": "I'm working on a Linux x86_64 ELF binary using IDA 6.6.\n\nWhen I run the Hex-Rays Decompiler on a function (by pressing F5) it always shows me the pseudocode for the _init_proc function, no matter what I run it on. It's stuck on that function and won't show me anything else in the pseudocode view. No errors are displayed or printed to the log.\n\nIf I produce the C file (Ctrl+F5) the full pseudocode is generated, so it's just an interface issue.\n\nThis is driving me mad. Things I've tried:\n\nHas anyone encountered this behaviour before? Any suggestions?\n\n",
