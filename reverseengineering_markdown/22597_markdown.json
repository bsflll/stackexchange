  "content": "I am decompiling a third party .NET dll which was obfuscated using codeveil\nmy aim is to get full source code,\n\nI tried decompiling using dnSpy, JustDecompile & Reflector\nhowever it just shows the public methods and properties inside the dll \nand no method body is shown\n\nsomething like this:\n\n```\n    public class TestManager\n    {\n        // Fields\n        private OleDbDatabase b;\n\n        // Methods\n        public TestManager();\n        public OperationResult AddRecord(XProfile record);\n        public OperationResult RevokeRecord(XProfile record);\n    }\n\n```\nit errors out when I try to export source code\n\nso how do I get the source code? is it possible?\nI guess at-least if I see the IL code then I can rewrite the functions\n\n",
