      "content": "As currently stated, there's no simple solution to such a general problem.\n\nStatic analysis is quite a complex subject and there are no generic solutions that are available out of the box.\n\nA few basic examples of why this may be difficult are these:\n\nA na√Øve static solution may be a more viable solution. For example, a solution that assumes the third argument to Func is a hardcoded immediate value and not a variable, will require only little static analysis and can be achieved, although IDA is not best-suited for such tasks (I'd recommend you take a look at angr instead)\n\nAlternatively, one might argue that debugging is a better solution, placing a break point on Func and parsing the arguments at call-time. This is again not IDA's forte but nowadays IDA's debugger is good enough to use for such a task.\n\n",
