Preferably open source.\n\n",

Someone usually has to reduce them to just what is needed for some specific purpose. Otherwise it's like the proverbial sipping water from a fire hydrant.\n\nI favor products that reverse structures (Classes and their attributes and methods) from the source code into some model and then let me draw upon that model to create useful diagrams, from a particular perspective and for a specific purpose.\n\nI’ve had good luck with:\n\nPersonally I haven’t had much luck with free/open source products.
