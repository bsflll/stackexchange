      "content": "I found out the reason myself and it was truly enlightening! To insert a breakpoint, gcc replaces the bytes at the beginning of the breakpoint location with INT 3 instruction (0xCC byte) and records the original byte replaced in its internal table. The input was writing a shellcode at the location I was trying to set a breakpoint on. Since the shellcode was interfereing with the breakpoint, it was overwriting the 0xCC bytes, thereby failing gcc to insert a software breakpoint.\n\n",
