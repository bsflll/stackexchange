You need to remove the breakpoint and then assign the trace.\n\nIf you set a function to be traced, and it doesn't print anything, put the cursor on the desired function, on the menu press Debugger -> Tracing -> Function tracing.  Try again.\n\nYou can view all the traces in the breakpoint window by pressing  Ctrl+Alt+B.\n\n",
