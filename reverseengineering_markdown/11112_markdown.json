  "content": "I am trying to reverse engineer the protocol of a chat written in java to implement my own client. The official client is a java applet embedded in the website so I thought it might use just https but I found using wireshark that it uses a generic protocol and an arbitrary port. My first approach was to use the java proxy settings and proxifier to force the traffic through fiddler in hope it might give me some more information about the protocols structure but with no success - fiddler did not even recognize the traffic but I guess thats because it was developed for http/s traffic only.\n\nSo my question is: How can I reverse engineer the protocol used? I thought that there has to be something similar to fiddler using a socket proxy or a network bridge (similar to what a lot of VPN clients use) but I could not find anything working under windows. Another approach would be to decompile the java binaries but I am not really interested in the code itself only in the protocol. Any suggestions how to proceed from here? \n\n",

      "content": "You don't really need another tool if you know how to use wireshark. Wireshark will let you extract the TCP part of a stream, which is exactly what you'll get using any kind of proxy or network bridge as well.\n\nFrom your description, i assume the protocol isn't just some kind of plain text, like your chat being encapsulated into SOAP in XML - it'd be easy to analyze this. The problem with binary data is that you can make some guesses, but if they don't fit, you can't really do much more than analyze the applet.\n\nWhat i'd do if i were you is:\n\nBy the way, it can't hurt to mention on which web site you found the chat (even if it's something embarassing like littlenudegirls.com, as you're not using your real name here); maybe someone else is reading this and has more detailed information to share about your particular web site, or maybe someone will google for that in the future and contact you to work on it together.\n\n",

I will try to decompile at least one client and hopefully get some answers. Will post here again as soon as I know more.",
