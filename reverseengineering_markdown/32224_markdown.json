  "content": "I am looking at the \"wordlist.txt\" file for Bookworm Deluxe (an old game by PopCap), and I have not been able to make sense of it. Most of the lines seem to be pieces of words, often with a single digit prefixing them. These numbers do not constantly represent a same letter combination, as 2rdvark would seem like 2 is \"aa\", but 2s is also in the list, and \"aas\" is not a word. Take note that the game has to have letter rarity information somewhere, but bonus words have their own separate file. Here is the file as a Gist.\n\n",
