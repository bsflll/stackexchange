  "content": "I bought an Hyosung NH1500 off Offer-up and it boots up and initializes some peripherals and then spits out and error of \"COM download is failed\". I've searched Google and 0 results came up, I've been searching and reading everything I can about ATMs and reverse engineering them but there's not much information. I was able to find the ATM's update file and in the update file is a file called boot.bin and when I throw it into IDA Pro and set processor to ARM Little-Endian ARMv4T because the processor is an S3C2410A and that's what the datasheet said but I cannot figure out the address to load the binary at to get any disassembled code that looks correct, but inside that file is the string \"COM download is failed\".\n\nSo what I am asking is, can anyone help me find the loading address of bios.bin in the update file located here.\n\n",

      "content": "The files in the update are not ARM but classic 16-bit x86 code. For example, loading bios.bin at F000:0000 and starting disassembly from F000:FFF0 (standard x86 entrypoint) produces nice code:\n\n```\ncseg:FFF0                _reset:                            \ncseg:FFF0                                                   \ncseg:FFF0 FA                             cli\ncseg:FFF1 BA A4 FF                       mov     dx, 0FFA4h\ncseg:FFF4 B8 02 80                       mov     ax, 8002h\ncseg:FFF7 EF                             out     dx, ax\ncseg:FFF8 EA 20 00 00 F0                 jmp     far ptr loc_F000_20\n\n```\nThe code is apparently hardware-specific and does not resemble much the classic BIOS of the generic PCs. \n\n",
