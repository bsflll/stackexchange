  "content": "I'm newbie on virtualized code obfuscation. I can break many features to avoid debugging/reversing and packer/protector (even Themida, without vm option), but I'm not good at virtualized code.\n\nThough I made own code virtualizing obfuscation tool, It's too hard to break other virtualized code framework.(e.g: Themida, VMProtect, Code Virtualizer)\n\nSo, I decided to break easy target to get an insight that makes me be good at virtual cpu framework. but I can't find any good target for newbie. Could you recommend easy target(crackme or protector) for newbie?\n\nIf possible, I want target of which virtualized-code was translated from x86 assembly code. \n\n",
