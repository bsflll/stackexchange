      "content": "The firmware itself most likely is not a binary. Also usually when you run file it will tell you something like: \nfile busybox \nbusybox: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS32 version 1. My guess is that you haven't actually extracted any binaries yet. My advice would be to use something like binwalk to extract specific files and binaries from the firmware. Running objdump on an entire firmware will probably give you an object dump of every single binary in your firmware and that could be a lot.\n\n",

If you could post what firmware version you are using, what hardware version your wrt54gl is, and if its not too lengthly, what steps you've taken to dump the firmware. I did go to the linksys page and download the Ver.4.30.18 (build 6) firmware and then I ran a simple binwalk against it and found a few things. I'm thinking maybe what is going on is that you got that flash memory from the device instead of the firmware",
