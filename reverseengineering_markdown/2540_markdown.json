  "content": "I'm trying to analyze an encrypted Mach-O binary (non-iPhone one), and I am observing the following strange behaviors:\n\nI've tried to execute this application in GDB - nothing works at all.\nSurprisingly, executing this app from terminal works plenty well.\n\nI'm afraid that my target has been packed/compressed/obfuscated in some way GDB/radare2 cannot cope with. Surprisingly, Hopper processes it pretty well.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't own a full version of the Hopper. Moreover, I would like to be able to debug this app in GDB. Is there any way to do this?\n\nHas anyone else run into something like this? If so, how should I proceed?\n\n",

      "content": "Actually, GDB rely on the GNU binutils to open and disassemble the binary. So, the management of the binary format is done through libbfd.so.\n\nUsually, MacOS X binutils comes with the Mach-O management, but it might be that you are using a buggy package. Or, you may also try to open a Mach-O on another system than MacOS X, and on other systems the Mach-O support is extremely rarely added to the default package. \n\nThe best way to get the Mach-O support (and all possible formats and architectures in GNU binutils) is to compile the package with the option --enable-targets=all.\n\nPersonally, I am using a Debian unstable. and I am used to recompile the whole package taken from sources. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n",

I've read that it's possible to do manually using GDB, dd and any suitable hex editor but I couldn't find any stepwise instructions.\n\nThis tool claims to be able to do the decryption:\nhttp://tumblr.alanquatermain.me/post/97884723/apple-binary-protection-tool\n\nbut it doesn't work for me.\n\nHas anyone else here ever dealt with such a binary?\nMany thanks in advance!\n\nHere some more descriptions of this protection schema:\n<Link>\n\nhttp://reverse.put.as/2009/06/30/how-to-dump-an-apple-protected-binary/\n\nUPDATE: I've finally managed to decrypt my target using this tool: http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/285375-apb-decrypt-for-mountain-lion-lion-and-snow-leopard-apple-protected-binary-decryptor/\n\nGDB shows a correct disassembly with \"disas 0xb800e5c4\" where 0xb800e5c4 indicates the entry point. While the decrypted binary works when launched from terminal, stepping and running inside of GDB still doesn't work though...\n\n",
