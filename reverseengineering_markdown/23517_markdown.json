  "content": "I have some experience with IDA and now I'm trying to use Radare2/Cutter the same way. I disassemble a DOS MZ file. I have the following:\n\n```\n;-- section.seg_000:\n12: entry0 ();\n0000:0000      push    ds          ; [00] -rwx section size 10784 named \nseg_000\n0000:0001      xor     ax, ax\n;-- di:\n0000:0003      push    ax\n0000:0004      mov     ah, 0x30    ; '0'\n0000:0006      int     0x21\n0000:0008      mov     byte cs:[0x11], al\n665: fcn.0000000c ();\n0000:000c      cmp     al, 2\n0000:000e      jae     0x12\n0000:0010      retf\n0000:0011      .byte 0x00          ; RELOC 16 \n0000:0012      mov     ax, 0x2a2   ; RELOC 16 \n\n```\nI want to label address 0x11 as DOSVersion and reference it by this name instead of the offset. In IDA (Turbo Assembler syntax), I can make it look like this:\n\n```\nproc    Main far\n    push    ds\n    xor     ax, ax\n    push    ax\n    mov     ah, DOS_FN_VERSION\n    int     DOS_INT\n    mov     [cs:DOSVersion], al\n    cmp     al, DOS_VERSION_2_0\n    jnb     short ProperDosVer\n    retf\nDOSVersion      db 0\nProperDosVer:\n    mov     ax, DSEG\n\n```\nHow can I achieve the same result with Radare2/Cutter?\n\n",

      "content": "In cutter you have an option under right mouse button click to set a label for a particular value.\n\n\n\nOr you can use Shift+N to activate that.\n\nFrom r2 you can get the same behavior by issuing a f name = addr command. \n\n```\n| f name 12 @ 33           set flag 'name' with length 12 at offset 33\n| f name = 33              alias for 'f name @ 33' or 'f name 1 33'\n\n```\nOne caveat,it has to start from label. to be inlined in your disassembly. If not it will show up as a comment (not sure if that can be controlled) \n\nSo in your case it would be f label.DosVersion = 0x11\n\n",
