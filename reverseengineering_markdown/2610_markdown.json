  "content": "When reversing shellcode, we see the PEB walk fairly often at various stages. I am curious however, if there is any pre-defined standard structure for this in IDA? If so, what is it called? After looking and googling around I haven't been able to find anything. I would also be very interested in definitions for PEB_LDR_DATA and RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS.\n\nI could create them myself and export them somehow (would have to figure out how). But before doing that I am really curious if there is just something I am missing amongst the standard structure definitions in IDA.\n\n",
