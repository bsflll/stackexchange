  "content": "Windows Notepad has a limit: 1024 symbols - max string length.\nDownload link: https://krakenfiles.com/view/uID2gzKW7K/file.html (189 KB)\nHow to find this value to increase or remove? Where is it located? Please help.\n\nIt is a question about reversing, not about other programs to use instead.\n\nUpdate:\nWith suggested in the answer, I found the check after which a forced line break is made (it is COMCTL32.dll+C6E44), increased the limit using code injection, but the text goes out of the field and the scrollbar doesn't work for it. Please help.\n\n",
