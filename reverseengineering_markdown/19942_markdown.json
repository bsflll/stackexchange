  "content": "Hello!\n\nI'm working on reversing one library (shared object) written for ARM architecture. It's obfuscated or packed with something pretty strong what makes debugging much harder and almost impossible on \"long distance\".\n\nThere is function which provides encryption with some strange algorithm (at least for me).\n\nWhat I've researched for now:\n\nFor now I know only first operations in data in algorithm:\n\nSome additional information:\n\nI have opportunity to launch encryption on any data and change all variables. Also I have opportunity to launch built-in decrypt function.\n\nMaybe someone know what it can be or can recommend me some additional steps to clarify name of this algorithm.\n\nP.S. Sorry for my bad English, hope I've described everything clear.\n\n",

Moverover, have you considered actually reverse engineering the algorithm? Creating code or pseudo code for the algorithm, etc. Additionally, have you tried collecting magic values from the library and seaching for them online?",

      "text": "Hello, @NirIzr . As I've mentioned, code is obfuscated by smth, and it's really hard to debug it. In sentence \"For now I know only first operations in data in algorithm\" I've meant that I've started \"tracing\" through code and for now I found next data transformations. I need to implement this algorithm (write external code which will do same encryption). About \"googling\" constants - it's the first what I've done (no results).",
