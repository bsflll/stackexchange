  "content": "I am familiar with debuggers and sorts. I was going through a program and noticed that IDA does make some mistakes on what it decides what on its pseudo code will be.\n\nIs there a list of common mistakes by IDA and do you think that it would be possible to get something to a compilable source?\n\nI thought I would test it out on some programs and one thing weird I noticed is that it will do:\n\n```\nv1 = thiscall();\n\n```\nWhere as in source I just have the thiscall();.\n\nI also noticed that it bloats a lot of things which is from the assembly itself.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\nIts looking like I might be able to providing if I knew the libraries and outline of the program well. Let me know what your thoughts and experiences from using IDA on this subject.\n\nEdit:\nI found a project that actually did this. All functions are byte for byte in 100% accuracy. So yes my past self, it is indeed possible.\nhttps://github.com/diasurgical/devilution\n\n",
