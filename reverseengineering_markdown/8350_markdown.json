  "content": "I was recently working with the Microsoft documentation about the PE and COFF specifications.\n\nChapter 5 shows several more or less \"soft\" indicators and characteristics to recognize what kind of stuff a section contains. However, the section characteristics flag is often the same for several different sections, and as I have read, the section name can be of arbitrary value, so it is not a big help too.\n\nActually, I can only definitely recognize code sections by looking if the IMAGE_SCN_MEM_EXECUTE flag is set, as other sections should not have this flag set.\n\nBut how could I, for example, recognize the resource directory? It only has IMAGE_SCN_CNT_INITIALIZED_DATA or IMAGE_SCN_MEM_READ set, and many other sections have the same flag.\n\nDo I have to evaluate with some made-up and typical section names (RSRC or .rsrc for this example)? It will mean that I may get tricked out by custom section names. Do I even have to try-and-error analyzation of section data to get a more definite result of what the section contains?\n\nOr is there a flag somewhere in the PE headers I skipped, helping me out in this case?\n\n",

I see that there are also data directories for import and export tables. That can help me further already, parsing the contents of those sections. If the result is still wrong, I just won't parse the section.",
