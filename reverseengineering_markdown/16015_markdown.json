  "content": "I am developing a game in GameMaker: Studio and have run into a minor problem. No matter what I do, the games output payload is generated, named, and referenced as data.win. I would like to name it something other than data.win and still be able to run it. I have been able to pinpoint the reference of the payload in the game's executable with OllyDbg, but am, of course, limited to modifying the value with only eight bytes. I know it is possible to insert bytes in OllyDbg, but I can't figure out how.\n\n\n\nI was able to change the extension successfully, but only that. I did this to ensure that modifying this value directly actually works.\n\nYes, I am completely aware that this has the potential to break the executable, but it is a risk I am willing to make. I have already used Binary edit both with, and without the Keep size box checked. I am still somewhat new to OllyDbg, so any help is grealy appreciated.\n\n",

      "content": "So you are trying to modify a string, increasing it's size? You actually can insert more than 8 bytes there if you uncheck \"Keep size\" box and continue typing bytes as usual (don't forget to insert 0 byte at the end of a string), but you will end up with corrupting following data (next string in your case)\n\nHere you have 2 solutions:\n\n",

Overwriting the neighboring string doesn't seem to be ideal. Is there perhaps a way to insert additional bytes that will shift the rest of the data over by as many bytes that are inserted? Your second option sounds promising, but I don't even know where to start on it.",

If your program knows that some specific variable is located at adress 1D400, you can't simply shift it, you will invalidate basically EVERYTHING. \"executable can no longer locate the payload\" - what does it mean? Can you explain in more details? Everything should be okay, just rewrite that next useless string. Or if you don't want to, you have an extremely complicated solution. If you are still interested in it, i can try to explain it, but you will still have to do the work by yourself",

If however, the payload is named to something other than \"data.win\", the executable brings up explorer.exe and asks the user to manually browse for the payload. Now, this method does work, but is obviously not as stream-lined. I have overwritten the next string, but by doing so the executable asks to browse again. I believed that shifting the data was necessary because I believe the data.win value needs to be in the location it is currently in, while retaining the bytes between the next string.",
