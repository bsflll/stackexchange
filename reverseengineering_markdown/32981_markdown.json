  "content": "In NSIS installers, there is a compiled bytecode blob representing the NSIS script located in the overlay of the executable. The overlay start with flags 0xdeadbeef then \"NullsoftInst\". The next two DWORDs are sizes in bytes. What is the offset of the NSIS script? How can I extract it using Python?\n\nI am aware of 7zip, but it returns the decompiled representation of the NSIS script. I want the compiled bytecode.\n\n",
