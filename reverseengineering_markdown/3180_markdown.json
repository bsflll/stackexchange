  "content": "I'm doing memory forensics with volatility and pefile on Windows XP SP2 memory dumps. \n\nI run windows in a VirtualBox VM and aquire the dumps with vboxmanage debugvm  dumpguestcore --filename dump.vmem \n\nI'm trying to build a tree of dll's imported by a process. Therefore I recursively walk the dll's starting at the process ImageBaseAddress. The problem that occurs is that for some dll's the dllBase is paged and so I can't read the import and delay import directory structures. \n\nI tried disabling the paging in Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Perfomance -> Advanced -> Virtual Memory -> No paging file. I also changed the registy entry HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Memory Management\\DisablePagingExecutive from 0 to 1, but the behaviour stays the same.\n\nAnother Problem is that even if the dllBase is not paged, sometimes reading the import or delay import directories with PEfile fails although the module / dll has the directory.\n\nAny help is most appreciated.\n\n",

      "content": "The paging file is generally for dirty pages, not for clean ones.  The clean ones can be read from the original file directly, so there's no need to store them in the page file (and if they haven't ever been read yet then they won't be in memory at all).\nFurther, delay-load DLLs won't be in memory if they've never been referenced, so anything related to them won't be available to you.  So just because you disable paging does not mean that everything will be entirely in memory, if physical memory constraints exist.  You could try increasing the size of the physical memory, and perhaps let the process run for longer.\n\n",
