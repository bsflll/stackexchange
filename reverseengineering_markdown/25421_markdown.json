  "content": "I want to fix a .plt segment in IDA Pro by replacing 12 bytes from start of every function in the .plt segment with the ones I specify.\n\nI want to just make each function return so I'm replacing opcodes to do this, but doing this by hand is a painful job. My fingers and palm hurt after I modified a single library, so I need a way to do that with IDA Python.\n\nIt's an ARM 32 shared library, I know it doesn't matter here but specified for goodness sake.\n\nThis is the hex I'm replacing in every function:\n\n00 00 a0 e1 00 00 a0 e3 1e ff 2f e1\n\nThis is what this hex is all about:\n\n```\n    movs r0, r0\n    movs r0, #0\n    bx lr\n\n```\n",
