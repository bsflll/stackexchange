  "content": "I have a Toyota ECU from 2005 with an NEC 76F0004GD micro controller on it, I have already read the full 512k dump from the chip using a K-Tag. However, when I tried to put it into IDA, there weren't any options for this architecture! I checked Ghidra as well, no luck. I don't have a problem adding a new processor to IDA using the SDK, but I can't seem to find ANY information about this chip online! \n\nAnyone have any clues?\n\nMany thanks,\n\nZephurah\n\n",

You need to find out what CPU core it’s using (e.g.  V850) and look for that. \n\nThere may be hundreds or thousands of different chips using the same instruction set, it would not make sense to list them all as separate processor entries. \n\nEDIT: I could find a datasheet for a NEC µPD76F0018 which says it uses a V850E Family core, so I suspect yours is a V850 too (E or non-E).\n\n",
