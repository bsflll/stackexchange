  "content": "Based on Detailed API call descriptions not available in x64dbg\n\nWhen I debug a known API call like for example WSARecv, in OllyDbg I can nicely see the parameters in the stack:\n\n\n\nI've installed both plugins: xAnalyzer & APIInfo\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I can't get x64dbg (in this case x32dbg) to show the parameters like Olly:\n\n\n\nI tried to right click in CPU window -> xAnalyzer -> Analyze module but didn't make any difference...\n\nRight now I'm using OllyDbg and x32dbg simoultaneusly only because of this... How can I see in x32dbg the parameters like I can see nicely in Olly?\n\n",
