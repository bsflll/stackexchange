  "content": "Whenever I save an executable in OllyDBG (Right-click, Copy to executable, All modifications then Save File), the saved executable asks for administrator privileges when I run it.\n\nI tried opening OllyDBG as a regular user and then saving the file, but no luck. I also tried manipulating the file's permissions, but no luck either.\n\nIs there a way to save a file so that regular users can run it?\n\n",

      "content": "UAC has certain heuristics that will cause a file to request elevation unless a manifest exists that states otherwise. Such heuristics include files that seem to be setup programs for some software. But there are more heuristics and other situations where elevation is assumed to be required.\n\nIf the executable has no manifest, you need to add one. Otherwise you may have to modify the existing one.\n\nYou can tell by loading it into a resource editor or resource viewer such as:\n\n... and so on. Check out the answers to this question: Freely available resource hacking applications ...\n\nUnfortunately this is somewhat of a science to get right.\n\n",

There was a much easier fix though: the filename of the binary was original_patched.exe, which tripped the UAC heuristics you mentioned. So all I had to do was rename the file. Interestingly, setting the manifest correctly trumped the UAC heuristics.",
