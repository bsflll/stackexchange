  "content": "I have a Ghidra project with an imported binary file (for x86 32 bit processor). I need to change a function in it.\nI`ve created a new function  code assembly. In listing it is 100 code lines - Modifying the code by replacing each original instruction via patch instruction (line by line) looks long and wired . I`ve tried to make a patch for all instructions - but looks that this option doesn`t exist! Also I thought about  exporting the current file (listing) and editing it (in text format)\nI am not sure how to do that?\ncan you advice\n\n",
