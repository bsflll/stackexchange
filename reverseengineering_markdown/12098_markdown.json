  "content": "I followed the tutorial IDA Help: Debugging code snippets with QEMU.\n\nIt always worked with ARM code, but now I have to reverse some MIPS and only nops are displayed like this:\n\n\n\nShould I adjust something on the memory map? As you can see, the code is rebased in the range of 0x8f0000000.\nOr is it something with the generated intermediate ELF file?\n\nI am using the Mipsel_Malta config, cmd line is\n\n\"D:\\attila\\qemu\\bin\\qemu-system-mipsel\" -S -gdb tcp::%p,ipv4 -cpu 4Km -kernel \"%e\".\n\n",
