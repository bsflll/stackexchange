  "content": "I got a trace of the execution from x64dbg and I need to analyze it. The problem is that the trace is quite large and there are quite big chunks of the code that repeat (I assume they are loops).\nI would like to have some kind of tool that would be able to produce a graph or perform simple analyze/decompile to group loops into separate blocks and to simplify the flow.  \n\nIs there a tool like this or all of this should be done manually?\n\n",
