  "content": "When an executable that has been stripped is opened in lldb, lldb doesn't know the names of any functions and breakpoints have to be set manually on hex addresses, which is very annoying.\n\nHowever, for Objective C executables, at least, it should be possible to reconstruct the addresses of functions from the Objective C runtime information in the object file: __DATA,__objc_classlist , __TEXT,__objc_methname , and so on.\n\nIs there a way to do this in lldb currently? Or is it just ignoring that information?\n\n",

Loading symbols from location in memory from the lldb-dev mailing list suggests that you may have to create your own .dSYM file instead of a .stabs file.\n\n",
