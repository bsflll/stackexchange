I assume most of the information on these is contained in metaeditor.exe, the platform's cross-version IDE and compiler.\n\nJust recently I've tried to analyze MetaEditor out of curiosity - the IDE and compiler are statically obfuscated and have anti-debugging measures employed.\n\nIf you like challenges though, probably the first step for you would be attaching the process to a debugger. Here's a little gist with my attempt that you can start with.\n\n",

However once modifying the call stacks seems like terminal.exe doesn't want to open metatrader5. The thing with analyzing metaeditor.exe is that metaeditor.exe is not responsible for loading the EA and making webrequests right? That was would be the responsibility of terminal.exe. I am also using x64dbg",
