  "content": "I am using ollydbg and whenever i attach ollydbg to running process (in this case it's game and it has xtrap) this game terminates all threads and nothing is shown in olly . And when i use OllyAdvanced and when i attach olly into this proces then olly is stopping execution at ntdll.dll.DbgUiRemoteBreakin. Is there any plugin/way to fix that ?\n\n",

What you're seeing is the result of how Windows works.\n\n",
