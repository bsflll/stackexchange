  "content": "I am currently researching my studentcard.\nMoney is stored on this card.\n\nBut the vending machine also checks a checksum on the card.\nI already did a lot of effort to find it but didn't succeed.\n\nThe information:\n\nStudentcard layout:\n\n\nSome transaction with the card. Only these values change on the card.\n\n(Unknown value(pink) is the checksum)\n\nI did some testing with changing the values and this what I concluded from it:\n\nThanks for any help!\nMeanwhile I will keep breaking my head :)\n\n",

But unless the vending machine was designed in the 1990s, it will have an online connection to a server that knows how much money should be on the card, and maybe use the card values as fallback when the online connection doesn't work. In that case, it'll update transactions to the server later. So, cheating won't work in most cases, and if/when it does, you'll be found out later.",

I already checked Reveng and tried something but due lack of knowledge in CRC it was hard to make anything useful.  I made a python scripts which tries to brute force the crc by doing XOR. Didn't succeed.  Now I am making a C program which will bruteforce many CRC16's with the values on the card. Any help for Reveng would be welcome ofcourse.",
