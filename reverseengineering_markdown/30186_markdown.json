  "content": "Note: Not sure if this kind of question belongs here but as long as this won't fit anywhere else this site is the closest.\n\nBack to the topic, I have a python file which I obfuscated it and anytime I want to turn this into executable using pyinstaller there's a 0x90 byte at the beginning of file which it can't be decoded using UTF-8. When I run the program it shows me this error:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"test.py\", line 500, in <module>\n  File \"test.py\", line 481, in djxvCOWAMQFNXLmkmwHopqHMWeJWqRRfaTYhtVQhEjhYQByjCUhjZmlyRVkSKqsEcxYRXketUHcQvObBfTQifGMfTOEsxpDzumWrevMKrXWYeXWOqinkNlbvZDoeaQMo\n  File \"test.py\", line 236, in CjpiLgqGSPHXaLfOKvPztQfChQlzklDoKWuieQOqmnPEnVxqRophKppuTPUSrlAdiWNiSOwcKqyDZoQSJsvmVPUVLFIQvRZbwSFHZQdLkwgXSoPoFJbjsZnrLKWkjKnZ\n  File \"codecs.py\", line 322, in decode\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x90 in position 2: invalid start byte\n\n```\nNot sure how do I deal with this, I have tried different naming of variable and still the same thing. Can someone help me a bit with this? Thanks in advance!\n\n",

For anyone curios the little pest was this character Ãˆ at byte 0x90.\n\n",
