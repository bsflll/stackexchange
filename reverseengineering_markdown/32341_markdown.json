  "content": "First: sorry about English, it's not my language. The translation was done by Google Translate.\nI'm trying to work on a .dll from a Unity game, I managed to decompile the entire game, open the .dll, but it is obfuscated and I can't unobfuscate it in any way. Do you know of any way I can deobfuscate the .dll? I can't go to the next step.\n\n",
