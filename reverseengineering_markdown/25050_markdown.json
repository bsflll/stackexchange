  "content": "I want to debug a process with gdb into Linux system, but the problem is that process pings /dev/watchdog so when I tried to debug it, it stop the process for longer than the watchdog interval so the system is rebooting.\n\nOne solution is to patch the binary so it will not use /dev/watchdog and than reboot the system so the \"new\" binary will run.\n\nBut sometime I can't do this solution because I don't want to reboot the system. And I don't control on system's startup script(that activate the watchdog)\n\nIs there another solution?\n\n",

If you are and if it is, what I'd be doing first of all would be to see which libc function is used to open /dev/watchdog. Suppose it's open for a second. In this case you could overwrite it and open your own \"whatever\" (return some magic number) and overwrite read/write as appropriate. The - by far - simplest solution would be to use LD_PRELOAD and provide your own mock versions of those functions. Depends...",

For example on a modern system you could use bubblewrap or similar to effectively deny your application to be debugged the ability to reboot, so even though /dev/watchdog would be an issue it won't inside a namespace or without the capability to reboot the system. Either way, if you don't control the startup script (of what ... /etc/rc?) what do you control?",
