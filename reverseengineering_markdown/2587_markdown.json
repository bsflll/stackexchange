If you can't use the paid versions of IDA, there are free alternatives.\n\nAs an example, using radare2 as an example, on the Debian MIPS binutils port:\n\n```\n$ file bin/objdump \nbin/objdump: ELF 32-bit MSB  executable, MIPS, MIPS-II version 1 (SYSV), \ndynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.26,\nBuildID[sha1]=d1d228509874377d7339cfd5b2f15db020e53b7b, stripped\n\n```\nFollowing this example, we get something like this:\n\n```\n[0x00403300]> \n[0x00403300]> ag > foo.dot\nfoo.dot created\n[0x00403300]> !dot -Tpdf -o foo.pdf foo.dot\n[0x00403300]> !open foo.pdf\n\n```\n\n\nNote that the PDF this churns out is enormous, so you might want to just use pdf instead of ag produce textual output rather than dot files.\n\n",
