      "content": "I think I got it. GetWindowLongPtr(hWnd, -1) returns a pointer to a nested struct that is a part of the WND struct (that contains main information about a window.) There's really no official name for it, but judging by this function name in comctrl32:\n\n\n\nI'd define it as such:\n\n```\nstruct WF{\n    WF_STATE state;\n    WF_STATE2 state2;\n    DWORD ExStyles;     //With additional bits\n    DWORD Styles;\n    HMODULE hModule;\n    USHORT reserved;\n    USHORT fnid;        // ?\n};\n\n```\nSo we can do:\n\n```\nWF* p_wf = (WF*)::GetWindowLongPtr(hWnd, -1);\n\n```\nWhere WF_STATE is a bitfield:\n\n```\nenum WF_STATE{\n    WNDS_HASMENU                 = 0x00000001,\n    WNDS_HASVERTICALSCROOLLBAR   = 0x00000002,\n    WNDS_HASHORIZONTALSCROLLBAR  = 0x00000004,\n    WNDS_HASCAPTION              = 0x00000008,\n    WNDS_SENDSIZEMOVEMSGS        = 0x00000010,\n    WNDS_MSGBOX                  = 0x00000020,\n    WNDS_ACTIVEFRAME             = 0x00000040,\n    WNDS_HASSPB                  = 0x00000080,\n    WNDS_NONCPAINT               = 0x00000100,\n    WNDS_SENDERASEBACKGROUND     = 0x00000200,\n    WNDS_ERASEBACKGROUND         = 0x00000400,\n    WNDS_SENDNCPAINT             = 0x00000800,\n    WNDS_INTERNALPAINT           = 0x00001000,\n    WNDS_UPDATEDIRTY             = 0x00002000,\n    WNDS_HIDDENPOPUP             = 0x00004000,\n    WNDS_FORCEMENUDRAW           = 0x00008000,\n    WNDS_DIALOGWINDOW            = 0x00010000,\n    WNDS_HASCREATESTRUCTNAME     = 0x00020000,\n    WNDS_SERVERSIDEWINDOWPROC    = 0x00040000,      //WndProc is in win32k.sys\n    WNDS_ANSIWINDOWPROC          = 0x00080000,\n    WNDS_BEINGACTIVATED          = 0x00100000,\n    WNDS_HASPALETTE              = 0x00200000,\n    WNDS_PAINTNOTPROCESSED       = 0x00400000,\n    WNDS_SYNCPAINTPENDING        = 0x00800000,\n    WNDS_RECEIVEDQUERYSUSPENDMSG = 0x01000000,\n    WNDS_RECEIVEDSUSPENDMSG      = 0x02000000,\n    WNDS_TOGGLETOPMOST           = 0x04000000,\n    WNDS_REDRAWIFHUNG            = 0x08000000,\n    WNDS_REDRAWFRAMEIFHUNG       = 0x10000000,\n    WNDS_ANSICREATOR             = 0x20000000,\n    WNDS_MAXIMIZESTOMONITOR      = 0x40000000,\n    WNDS_DESTROYED               = 0x80000000,\n};\n\n```\nand WF_STATE2 is another bitfield:\n\n```\nenum WF_STATE2{\n    WNDS2_WMPAINTSENT               = 0x00000001,\n    WNDS2_ENDPAINTINVALIDATE        = 0x00000002,\n    WNDS2_STARTPAINT                = 0x00000004,\n    WNDS2_OLDUI                     = 0x00000008,\n    WNDS2_HASCLIENTEDGE             = 0x00000010,\n    WNDS2_BOTTOMMOST                = 0x00000020,\n    WNDS2_FULLSCREEN                = 0x00000040,\n    WNDS2_INDESTROY                 = 0x00000080,\n    WNDS2_WIN31COMPAT               = 0x00000100,\n    WNDS2_WIN40COMPAT               = 0x00000200,\n    WNDS2_WIN50COMPAT               = 0x00000400,\n    WNDS2_MAXIMIZEDMONITORREGION    = 0x00000800,\n    WNDS2_CLOSEBUTTONDOWN           = 0x00001000,\n    WNDS2_MAXIMIZEBUTTONDOWN        = 0x00002000,\n    WNDS2_MINIMIZEBUTTONDOWN        = 0x00004000,\n    WNDS2_HELPBUTTONDOWN            = 0x00008000,\n    WNDS2_SCROLLBARLINEUPBTNDOWN    = 0x00010000,\n    WNDS2_SCROLLBARPAGEUPBTNDOWN    = 0x00020000,\n    WNDS2_SCROLLBARPAGEDOWNBTNDOWN  = 0x00040000,\n    WNDS2_SCROLLBARLINEDOWNBTNDOWN  = 0x00080000,\n    WNDS2_ANYSCROLLBUTTONDOWN       = 0x00100000,\n    WNDS2_SCROLLBARVERTICALTRACKING = 0x00200000,\n    WNDS2_FORCENCPAINT              = 0x00400000,\n    WNDS2_FORCEFULLNCPAINTCLIPRGN   = 0x00800000,\n    WNDS2_FULLSCREENMODE            = 0x01000000,\n    WNDS2_CAPTIONTEXTTRUNCATED      = 0x08000000,\n    WNDS2_NOMINMAXANIMATERECTS      = 0x10000000,\n    WNDS2_SMALLICONFROMWMQUERYDRAG  = 0x20000000,\n    WNDS2_SHELLHOOKREGISTERED       = 0x40000000,\n    WNDS2_WMCREATEMSGPROCESSED      = 0x80000000,\n};\n\n```\nThe Styles and ExStyles members seem to closely resemble documented window styles (and extended styles) but have their own undocumented bits as well.\n\nfnid might be this, but I could not verify it.\n\n",
