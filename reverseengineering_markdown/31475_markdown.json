  "content": "\n\n\nthen i patch .text section bytes using HxD . I set AddressOfEntryPoint in OptionalHeader to start of .text section where my shellcode is : \n\n\nSo now execution must be started from my shellcode bytes . but i ran PE file and got error :\n \nI opened PE file using OllyDbg and execution wasn't at position that i expected :\n\n\nAddressOfEntryPoint was 1000 . it's RVA so the execution must be started at 0x00401000 since the ImageBase is 0x00401000 (PE file is not dynamic base) but it isn't that and we got Access Violation .\n\ni use Windows XP . what is going on ? why does this happen ?\n\n",
