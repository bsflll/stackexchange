  "content": "colleagues.\n\nSimplest question. As many articles in the Net (example https://r2wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/rarun2/) and here on forum are describing, i have a rarun2 profile named \"r2_profile\" file as follows:\n\n```\n#!/usr/local/bin/rarun2\nstdin=./debruijn\nprogram=./vuln\n\n```\ndebruijn is a 100 chars long debruijn sequence.\nvuln is a ret2win file from here The most basic binexp challenge\n\nNext i run\n\n```\nr2 -d ./vuln -r r2_profile\n\n```\nr2 shell appears whith ./vuln  code stopped. I issue \"dc\" to continue and gets() waiting for my input instead of automatically eat contents of the files i have configured in profile. What i am doing wrong?\n\n",
