  "content": "I am trying to debug an app which I don't own which uses HTML5 and JS, which displays a video stream.  The issue is that the video stutters when viewed in high resolution.\n\nNote that the code is obfuscated, but has been prettyfied which helps a little.  So far using Chrome developer tools and by injecting listeners I have determined that the video is being displayed in a <canvas> element.  From my research, I have determined that displaying video content in <canvas> requires the use of <video>, where the data taken from the video element is manipulated and written on to the <canvas>.\n\nMy problem is that I want to get a reference to the <video> element, which apparently is not a part of the DOM.  The use of Chrome developer tools reveals no such element, nor does getElementsByTagName().  I find clues in the code which indicate a <video> element most likely exists, so my conclusion is that it is just used in memory as a tool and is not added to the DOM.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions as to how I can get a reference to this element?\n\n",
