  "content": "I have a reverse engineering set up on a Mac machine. This set up does some reverse engineering on iOS applications(.ipa files). I'm migrating the setup from Mac to a linux machine.\n\nCurrently on Mac, I'm using OTOOL on ipa binary files and using the following commands:\n\nNow, I've to do the same operation, i.e reverse engineer the iOS applications, but now on the linux machine. AFAIK, OTOOL is not available for linux machine. \n\nI'm not sure which tool can I use. I to figure out the alternate tool which can do same as OTOOL. Or, if not same, then what changes do i need to make to use the alternate tool. \n\n",

      "content": "I am in a similar position carrying out iOS related work on an Ubuntu host.\n\nThe suggestions to use objdump will not work unless it has been compiled specifically with support of Mach-O binaries which is not normally the case on Linux.\n\njtool2 has by far been found to be the best Linux based equivalent for me and the commands you have listed should be avaialble as is as those flags are listed under OTool Compatible Options.  Is it just that you do not want to have to pass the arch as an argument?\n\nA number of tools are available from llvm on Linux and their page does list an otool equivalent.  That doesn't seem to be installed on my OS although a number of other llvm tools are such as llvm-nm and llvm-objdump that both support Mach-O binaries.\n\nIf you prefer a visual representation you could try XMachOViewer or if you are happy to script something yourself specific to your particular needs you could look at the Python lief library.\n\nUpdate\n\nAdding two more options I've used since originally answering as this has recently received upvotes and still seems to be helpful. Both are currently maintained and available for Linux:\n\nipsw from Blacktop\n\nand\n\nktool from cynder\n\nUpdate, September 2024\n\njtool is no longer supported, let alone for Linux. ipsw is the most actively developed cross-platform option and with new functionality being added.\n\n",
