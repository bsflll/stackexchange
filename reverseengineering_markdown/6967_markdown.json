  "content": "I've been playing around with RE for a bit now and a friend sent over a crackme. I figured mise well try and crack it. \n\nThe first thing I did was to put the executable into Exeinfo PE and there was nothing special there. So next I loaded the DLL into there and it came up with PEcompact ver.1.41 - v1.84 and it said to unpack it.\n\nSo I found an unpacker called GUnPacker loaded it in there and it gave me Address : <0x0041E738> ---- Is OEP(FOEP) Possibly... Not sure what to do with this since I am fairly new to the whole DLL being packed.\n\nWhen you load the exe it gives me a ID #:00FF-7514-B10D and then it asks for a serial. I loaded the DLL into dllexp and there is a function named GetSerial. \n\nAlso I believe it is a VB6 exe.\n\nIs there any way to intercept that or something so that when I debug the program I can break when it is called and retrieve the serial?\n\n",

I would suggest to start with some theory :\n\nin addition try some easy ones from:\n\nand in parallel go over first tuts here:\n\nI think this will give you an answer for the question. Other then this, try to ask the above in amore specific way as we do not have the binary to really pin-point you what to do.\n\nHave fun.\n\n",
