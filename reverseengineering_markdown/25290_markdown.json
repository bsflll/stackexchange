  "content": "I'm trying to break execution when a string is loaded in memory.\n\nI can´t find the string by using the search for -> string references\n\nSo I press Alt + M and press Ctrl + B to search my string once is loaded, I can see it.\nI try to right click on the address and set a hardware breakpoint but the software closes as soon as that string is shown so it doesn't break on the next run.\n\nHow can I set a condition so if a string appears a break happens?\n\nI tried shift + F4 like with ollydbg and then I try to create an expression like this UNICODE[EAX] == \"myString\" but it says invalid expression...\n\nI also tried the same expression using traceInto, but it definitely is not matching for the string, because I can't see it int he dump and even if I compare with a huge string, it doesn't do anything at all.\n\nAny suggestions or ideas?\n\n",
