  "content": "I know this question may be an ambiguous one and so may not be straightforward, so I apologize for that. Nevertheless, I believe that anti-debugging is responsible for the constant crashing of the program whenever the breakpoint is hit but I am not sure.\n\nI have tried to use other debugging tools but still the same trouble I am getting. So I believe whatever is going on is specific to the way the program is working. So any ideas as to what is responsible for this and how do I go around it\n\n",
