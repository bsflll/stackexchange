  "content": "For the target processor TMS320C3x, IDA does not display all data in HEX-VIEW as ASCII,\nonly every 4th byte.\nThe minimum addressable data block for this target processor is a 32-bit word.\nIt seems that IDA takes the low byte from the word and prints it as ASCII, and does not use the remaining ones.\nHow can I fix IDA settings to resolve this issue? Maybe there is some plugin to fix this?\n\n\n\n\n\n",
