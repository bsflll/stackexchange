  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/30492/source-code-for-an-mp3-player",
  "content": "I know this title sounds a little dumb but if you would please bear with me for an explanation. I have a Valoin-made mp3 player I bought close to 3 years ago now. Via a series of interesting discoveries, I have become infatuated with this thing. It plays video (to a degree), the file manager has some oddly specific quirks, the 'home screen' looks eerily like every mp3 player 'home screen' I see on the market, and most importantly, whenever I use an SD card with the device, it offloads some weird files with a format I don't recognize. In another post I read a user mentions a similar situation. They seem to have a bunch of .LIB and .PL files added to the root of the SD card file system (FAT32?). Among these files were noticeably: M3U.LIB and EBOOK.LIB. USERPL1.PL, USERPL2.PL, and USERPL3.PL are files native only to my device, it would seem.\n\nI would like to believe that somewhere out there exists a way to interact with the data in these files and maybe understand the weird file-manager quirks. I mentioned that the 'home screen' looks awfully generic and I believe that's for a reason. I think that a company serving as a really niche software vendor might be the common denominator here. If there exists source code that powers these little gizmos, I want to find it. No short of possibly making some phone calls, or digital snooping. If I can't find the source code, I would settle for understanding these .LIB files. If you are curious and/or have the expertise please check out my github repo that contains the unmodified .LIB files from my mp3 player alongside some pertinent information.\n\n",
