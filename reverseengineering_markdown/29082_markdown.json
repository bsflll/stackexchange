  "content": "I tried Javascript scripting on WinDbg (TTD specifically); but even in simple example I get error\nUnable to get property 'Debugger' of undefined or null reference.\nLine was simply var ctl = host.namespace.Debugger.Utility.Control; but it does not work.\nDoes TTD have Debugger property? I cannot find any specific document about scripting for TTD; so I assume they have the same interface with regular session. How can we send commands to debugger from a script in TTD sessions?\n\n",
