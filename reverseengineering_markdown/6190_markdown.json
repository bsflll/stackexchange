  "content": "I'm working on a project which requires me to extract, edit, and reproduce part of a proprietary hash algorithm.. which is contained inside a dll.\n\nThe dll is used by an Unity game, and includes Unity between its references too.\n\nThis dll invokes some external functions contained in another dll (which I suppose has been written in c++, considering the DllImport etc present in the source code) with all the real hash logic and methods... and here comes the problem.\n\nI've not been able to find and locate that dll: no trace in the folder at all.\n\nSo I suppose that Unity (or whatever tool) managed somehow to embed it inside the dll code itself... but after further decompilation, disassemblation etc, the dll does not present any code to eventually extract it!\n\nThe fact is that ILSpy is able to show this external dll in the \"parent\" dll references, marking it as a \"module\", but I have no idea about how to proceed to extract it (if it's relly there!).\n\nI also tried to bypass the problem, including the entire dll into a C# project, and invoking its public functions at runtime (like the Unity game does)... but it seems that somehow, this idea is not working at all (read something about the fact that unity can run c# code, but I cannot init Unity via C#... or something like that).\n\nSo... After struggling for days, I decided to ask here to some experts.\n\nAnyone can help me?\n\n",

      "content": "Use Process Explorer or Process Hacker to find which modules are loaded in the address space of the process. When you find the required dll, check whether there exists a valid path for that module in disk. If there is one then you may simple copy over the dll for further analysis.\n Otherwise the dll may have been loaded from memory. In such case you have to dump that dll from memory.\n\nNext using a PE detection tool such as ExeInfo PE , Detect It Easy scan the dll. If it is a managed DLL (aka .net) check if a .net decompiler such as dotPeek or reflector can decompile it readily. If it is obfuscated, try using de4dot before decompiling.\n\nIf it is a native dll IDA Pro is your best option for analyzing the dll. \n\nThere are quite a few ways to package a dll inside an executable. \n\nSee this article on loading a dll from embedded resource for more info.\n\n",
