(the 4 bytes after \"data\")\nThe key changes every 512 bytes, so if they are set in advance you would need 625520 stored keys. This is of course very unlikely.\nI think only the first key is frozen, the others can be just the XOR of the first 2 bytes of each group of 512 bytes.\nTo verify it would require a greater number of data, at least 1Mb, or better the complete zipped file.\n\n",
