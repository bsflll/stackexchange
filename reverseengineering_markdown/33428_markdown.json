  "content": "I am Lazlo and beginner.\n\nI would need help.\nTry to identify an IC which is non marked.\nThis cirquit controls 8 DC motors (12v)\nThe mentioned two ic’s have 14 pins each.\nI assume, these 2 IC’s are identical and could control The BD 135 - BD 136’s (totally 8 pairs of transistors)\nI just started the tracking, and realized that the 8th pin of the IC connects to the Base pin of a BD136.\n\nAny idea?\n\nThanks in advance.\nLazlo\n\n",
