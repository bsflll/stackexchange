  "content": "I was looking for a way to get to the VEH handler (specified by the application being reversed) that gets called when an exception occurs. I have read this question and it explains some things nicely, but my situation is slightly different. The code I'm stepping/executing throws an exception:\n\n\n\nIn that situation, what can I do to get to the handler code and step it with Olly (other than statically analyzing the executable and looking for AddVectoredExceptionHandler and friends)?\n\n",

      "content": "If you're only using export table symbols (the default), then your best bet would likely to be to set a breakpoint on ntdll!KiUserExceptionDispatcher(). When it's called, you can trace into it to find the vector handler list. On the other hand, if you have ntdll.dll's public symbols PDB, then you can find the vector handler list directly by looking at _LdrpVectorHandlerList.\n\nHonestly though, it's probably easier to just set a logging breakpoint on AddVectoredExceptionHandler() and record each VEH entry as it's added.\n\n",
