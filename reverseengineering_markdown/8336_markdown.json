  "content": "There is a game that has been created with Unity which I'm trying to beat. It sends your high-score to a site and gets posted there.\n\nI've sniffed the outgoing traffic and the game sends your username, your score plus a MD5 hash.\n\nLooking to some on-line tutorials (and I'm guessing this too) the hash consists of something along the lines of:\n\n```\n MD5(user:USERNAME, score:SCORE, SALT)\n\n```\nAs you can guess, I know the username and the score, but I don't know the secret. I'm trying to find these strings in Ollydbg but I'm having some trouble finding it.\n\nI'm having trouble in being able to set a breakpoint, as the score is sent when you click submit and time of the game is still running.\n\nAny suggestions on how to find where the hashing occurs using Ollydbg? \nHow would you set the breakpoint if the game is still running?\n\n",

To find that you can use Jason Geffner's answer OR (which might be faster) write your own small unity script that uses this function and debug that to find the address. \n\n```\n// http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CreatingAndUsingScripts.html\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing System.Collections;\n\npublic class MainPlayer : MonoBehaviour {\n\n    // Use this for initialization\n    void Start () {\n        byte[] buf = {1, 2, 3};\n        ComputeMD5Hash(buf);\n    }\n\n    // Update is called once per frame\n    void Update () {\n\n    }\n}\n\n```\nWhen you now look at the CIL code the call to ComputeMD5Hash() should stand out clearly.\n\n",
