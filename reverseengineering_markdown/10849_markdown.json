  "content": "Recently IDA started to synchronize the hex dump with disassembly view. Even if I disable this through right click, it gets reseted every debug session. I also tried to save the desktop with the synchronization disabled, but it gets enabled again after session restart...\n\nHow can I stop IDA from synchronizing these views?\n\nI have no plugins that could cause this behavior.\n\n",
