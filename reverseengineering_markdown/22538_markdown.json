  "content": "When in visual mode (command v) in radare, in the disassembly panel, I can press ; to add a comment at the location I am current seeked to (which is the top instruction in the disassembly view). I usually step through the software and would like to add comments at the current instruction pointer (rip) location.\n\nIs there a key for that? Can I define one or redefine the ; key?\n\n",
