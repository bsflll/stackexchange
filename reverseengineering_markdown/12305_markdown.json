  "content": "I am trying to create a (32-bit) DLL to inject into a target process.\n\nMy DLL should call a function inside the original process. So far nothing special, however the target function is using the thiscall calling convention.\n\nI am trying to use my own fake class object. The method does nothing more then setting a few variables in this class object.\n\nMy attempt:\n\n```\nclass HashClass\n{\npublic:\n    byte data[1024];\n    LPVOID HashFunc(float, char, char);\n};\n\ntypedef LPVOID (HashClass::*HASHFUNC)(float, char, char);\n\nHASHFUNC *HashFunc = (HASHFUNC *) 0xD34DB33F;\n\nvoid CallHashFunction()\n{\n   HashClass *hashClass = new HashClass();\n   (hashClass->*HashFunc)(1.0f, 'a', 'b');  // Getting an error here\n}\n\n```\nWhat is the best and easiest method for this?\n\nErrors i am getting:\n\n```\nError   1   error C2297: '.*' : illegal, right operand has type 'HASHFUNC *'\n        2   IntelliSense: expression must have pointer-to-member type\n\n```\n",
