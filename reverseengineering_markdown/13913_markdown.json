  "content": "I have an OpenCL 2.0 program with various .bin files that I would like to reverse.  file shows:\n\n```\n$> file k.bin\nk.bin: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, *unknown arch 0x40c* version 1 (SYSV),\ncorrupted program header size, not stripped. \n\n```\nI believe these files to be OpenCL kernel files. Opening the file in vim shows many OpenCL references. At the end of the binary blob there are plaintext attributes like this:\n\n```\nuniqueid:1038\n;memory:uavprivate:0\n;memory:datareqd\n\n```\nWhat is the best current approach to disassemble these binaries?\n\n",
