  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/21943/change-pe-file-icon-without-re-signing-the-file-all-over-again",
  "content": "Is there any option to set new icon for a signed PE executable in windows without re-signing it again. This means that the icon image, although fully assimilated to the PE file, won't change the hash value as it's appears in the file signature part.\n\nperhaps there's a concept where one can sign only the specific sections in the files such as .text or .data and avoid other parts of the file ? \n\nthanks \n\n",

The icon is part of the resource section (.rsrc) which is covered by the signature so any modification will invalidate it and the binary needs to be re-signed. \n\nThere may be some parts of the executable you can change without invalidating the signature, but the resource section is not one of them.\n\n",
