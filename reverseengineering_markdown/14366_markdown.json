      "content": "It does not. There is no such thing as \"an instruction\". Jumps do not jump to instructions, they jump to addresses.\n\nIt does not. If you check what the code actually does, you will find this call will never be executed.\n\nHere is the relevant part of your code, prefixed with their original hex bytes.\n\n```\n400AC7:  66 b8 eb 05             mov    ax,0x5eb\n400ACB:  31 c0                   xor    eax,eax\n400ACD:  74 fa                   jz     0x400AC9\n400ACF:  e8 0f b6 45 b0          call   0xffffffffb045b61c\n400AD4:  3c 38                   cmp    al,0x38\n400AD6:  0f                      .byte 0xf\n400AD7:  85                      .byte 0x85\n400AD8:  bc                      .byte 0xbc\n\n```\nIf you assume the instruction at 400AC7 executes, it loads ax with some value but it gets immediately discarded by the next instruction, which clears it to 0. Because of that, the jump will always be taken!\n\nThe jump goes to 400AC9, and if we disassemble starting at that, we get some other code:\n\n```\n400AC9:  eb 05                   jmp    0x400AD0\n400ACB:  31 c0                   xor    eax,eax\n400ACD:  74 fa                   je     0x0\n400ACF:  e8 0f b6 45 b0          call   0xffffffffb045b61a\n400AD4:  3c 38                   cmp    al,0x38\n400AD6:  0f                      .byte 0xf\n\n```\nand it looks like you did not get any further, because there are still weird calls and undefined codes. However, look at the first instruction! It jumps again into the middle of something what appears to be an instruction at this point – but if you start disassembling there, you will see that everything from that address on is perfectly ordinary code.*\n\n* Since this is a \"crackme\" and you already failed the first of its tests, I will not spoil the rest of it.\n\n",
