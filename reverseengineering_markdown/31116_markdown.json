  "content": "I came across the following piece of 16-bit x86 code for multiplying a value by 40, using just shifts and additions:\n\n```\n; BX holds the value we want to multiply.\n; The result is stored in AX.\nMOV AX, BX\n\n; Multiply by 4 using two shifts\nSHL AX, 1\nSHL AX, 1\n\n; Add the original value, this gives us BX * 5\nADD AX, BX\n\n; Now multiply by 8 using three shifts for the final result\nSHL AX, 1\nSHL AX, 1\nSHL AX, 1\n\n```\nNow what I'd like to know is why this code uses multiple shifts in a row instead of just doing SHL 2 and SHL 3. It was almost certainly written by hand, so I assume there was some speed benefit or something. Does anyone have any insights?\n\nThe code was written in 1991 and was targeting 286 and 386 class machines.\n\n",
