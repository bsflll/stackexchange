  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/27564/why-rundll32-exe-could-be-loading-a-dll-multiple-times",
  "content": "Since I started reverse engineering I've found multiple DLLs that when being debugged(IDA + WindDBG) would be unloaded and reloaded continuously without any evident reason.\n\nMost of the time I use rundll32.exe to load and debug any DLL and I just get this behavior with a few binaries.\n\nThe current lib I am debugging is quite simple, most of the logic of the program is executed by a thread created at the DLL's entry point. Then, its single export(DllRegisterServer) has a loop which checks if a flag has been set to finally call ExitProcess.\n\nWhen I enter the main's logic thread I suspend any other thread and single step through it as always. As I go, randomly the DLL is unloaded, reloaded, and the dbg sets me again at DllEntryPoint, which makes the RE job quite annoying.\n\nWhat could be the reason for that behavior?\n\nEdit: Within x64dbg this does not happen. Same file, same command line.\n\n",

If willing to play with a real file, samples can be found at MalwareBazaar under the IcedID tag and are easily unpacked by following a few VirtualAlloc calls.(Regarding the packing thing, the file I am working with is an unpacked standalone version.)",
