Now, let's check the API headers:\n\n```\nWINBASEAPI\nDWORD\nWINAPI\nQueueUserAPC(\n    _In_ PAPCFUNC pfnAPC,\n    _In_ HANDLE hThread,\n    _In_ ULONG_PTR dwData\n    );\n\n```\nand PACPFUNC is:\n\n```\ntypedef\nVOID\n(NTAPI *PAPCFUNC)(\n    _In_ ULONG_PTR Parameter\n    );\n\n```\nWhere NTAPI is:\n\n```\n#define NTAPI __stdcall\n\n```\n__stdcall functions are responsible for cleaning up the stack from their incoming arguments, and since our function accepts one argument of type ULONG_PTR (a pointer, so 4 bytes), it must clean up the stack at return , i.e. use retn 4 instead of just retn which is enough for __cdecl functions.\n\n",
