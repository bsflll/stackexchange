  "content": "I am debugging a 32-bit ELF executable using remote GDB debugging option of IDA Pro. However, I am unable to view the contents of stack in the stack view. Also, the stack pointer value is: 0xFFFFD328\n\nIn the hex dump view, if I press G and enter the above address, it does not display. Similarly, in the stack view, I cannot scroll to this address or view it either.\n\nThe function prolog in the main function initializes the stack pointer as shown below:\n\n```\nlea     ecx, [esp+4]\nand     esp, 0FFFFFFF8h\npush    dword ptr [ecx-4]\npush    ebp\nmov     ebp, esp\npush    ecx\nsub     esp, 0Ch\n\n```\n",

You can press 'G', input 'esp' and press ENTER to jump to ESP. \n\n",

Upon entry to main, the stack pointer is 0xFFFFD95C, while the stack view only shows up through 0xFEFFFFFC. Attempting to \"sync with esp\" or jump to esp will fail. Is there a way to add more memory such that the contents of the stack can be viewed?",
