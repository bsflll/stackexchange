However this doesn't save the addresses.\n\nIs there a way to produce this data? \n\n",

IDA assigns some of those arbitrarily, i.e. it would be better to explain what your goal is and not so much ask about the specific next step you think you need. As for the offsets, standard tools like xxd can give you this ... e.g. xxd -g 1 <filename>",
