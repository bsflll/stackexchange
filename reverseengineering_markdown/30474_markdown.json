  "content": "I am trying to extract the sprites from Railroad Tycoon 2. Having successfully extracted the files contained in the data .paks it uses, I am now stuck at trying to extract files from the .imb files it seems to use to store the sprites. There are also .pal files, I presume these are connected somehow.\n\nI have uploaded a few of the .imb files here as an example: https://mega.nz/file/l3hxwADD#rcOwsQEUliZ3ypX95ZwW4BElLk5rPzrfr63QKXQ0dOA\n\nHopefully someone can help.\n\n",
