  "content": "I'm trying to decompile a binary in IDA Pro. Currently I am looking at a list of pointers to strings, which represent game data (\"Left turn\", \"Right turn\" etc). Frustratingly, it appears like nothing references the addresses storing this data, though I know they are used in the game.\n\nSo I am guessing the program is using some code to reference \"Left turn\" with pointer arithmetic, like print(BASE_STRING_PTR + offset). \n\nThis is difficult to detect though; I'm new to IDA and have been playing around with the buttons but haven't found anything short of trying \"Find references\" for each address above the address I want. I was hoping more experienced reverse engineers would have some advice?\n\nIf there is another tool that's good for this, awesome, though I'm on a Mac which limits me somewhat.\n\n",

      "content": "In this case, the best approach is to use a debugger (either IDA Pro's debugger or another debugger of your choosing).\n\nRun the program in a debugger and set a hardware-read breakpoint on the first byte of one of the strings. Then interact with the program in a way that causes that given string to be accessed by the program (for example, something that causes the string to be displayed on the screen). The hardware breakpoint should trigger, allowing you to look at the call-stack in the debugger to see what code in the program caused the given string to be accessed.\n\n",
