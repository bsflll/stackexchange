  "content": "I don't know if it is asked but, I couldn't find it anything despite this question. Is it because of disassembler's fault? Or if it is right, why compiler generates this code?\n\n```\n ; int __cdecl main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)\n main            proc near               ; CODE XREF: start-7Bp\n\n var_4           = dword ptr -4\n argc            = dword ptr  8\n argv            = dword ptr  0Ch\n envp            = dword ptr  10h\n\n                 push    ebp\n                 mov     ebp, esp\n                 push    ecx\n                 call    ds:GetCurrentProcessId\n                 mov     [ebp+var_4], eax ; <---\n                 mov     eax, [ebp+var_4] ; <---\n                 push    eax\n                 push    offset output\n                 call    printf\n                 add     esp, 8\n\n debugger_wait:                          ; CODE XREF: main+28j\n                 call    ds:IsDebuggerPresent\n                 test    eax, eax\n                 jnz     short debugger_present\n                 jmp     short debugger_wait\n ; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n debugger_present:                       ; CODE XREF: main+26j\n                 int     3               ; Trap to Debugger\n                 xor     eax, eax\n                 mov     esp, ebp\n                 pop     ebp\n                 retn\n main            endp\n\n```\nMarked lines with arrows (from IDA output) shows two MOV operations which semantically equals to nothing (or is it?). This is my source code:\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <Windows.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[])\n{\n    DWORD pid = GetCurrentProcessId();\n    printf(\"%d  \n\", pid);\n    while (!IsDebuggerPresent());\n    __asm int 0x3;\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\nCompiled with MSVC++ (19.00.24225.1):\n\n```\ncl.exe dnmProg.c\n\n```\nUPDATE: I tried other options, and both /O1 and /O2 doesn't have such structure, but /Ot has same instruction pair. When I compiled it with /Os there is:\n\n```\ncall    ds:GetCurrentProcessId\nmov     [ebp+var_4], eax ; <---\npush    [ebp+var_4]      ; <---\npush    offset printf_parameter\ncall    printf_\n\n```\nThanks.\n\n",
