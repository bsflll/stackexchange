  "content": "When I'm trying to compute the difference between two functions loaded into memory:\n\n```\nint _start(void)\n{\n    // code\n}\n\nint _end(void)\n{\n    // code\n}\n\nDWORD funcSize = (DWORD) _end - (DWORD) _start;\n\n```\nfuncSize is computed incorrectly. For example, if the offset of _start is 0x00291450 and the offset of _end is 0x002915a0 the difference between _end and _start is 0xffffff56. Why?\n\n",

(DWORD) _end - (DWORD) _start should give you a more reasonable number.\n\nJust for completeness sake: the computations with numbers you provided (may be checked in windows calculator or with python)\n\n```\n0x002915a0 - 0x00291450 = 0x150\n0x00291450 - 0x002915a0 = -0x150 (0xfffffeb0) \n\n```\nThe difference between numbers which ends with 0 can not end with non-zero like in number as you mentioned (0xffffff56), so there is something wrong with your calculation.\nUPD:\nJust in case if you are using C language, you probably should use &_start and &_end instead of _start and _end.\n\n",
