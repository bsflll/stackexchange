  "content": "I'm using winpmem to create a memory image.  I would like to create an interface that would allow a user to search for various patterns in the image.  I'm using C++ to open and read the file but I am not able to dump the contents to standard output.  I have tried to use various data types for the variable declaration that is streamed to standard output but I haven't been able to dump a text representation to the screen.  Here is my code:\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])\n\n{\n\ndouble x;\n\nint i = 0;\n\n```\nifstream test;\n\ntest.open(\"C:\\\\Temp\\\\mem.raw\");\n\nif (!test){\n\ncerr << \"Unable to open file datafile.txt\";\n\nexit(1);   // call system to stop\n\n```\n}\n\n```\nwhile (test >> x) {\n\ncout << i;\n\ncout << \":\";\n\ncout << x;\n\ncout << \",\";\n\ni++;\n\n```\n}\n\n```\ntest.close();\n\nreturn 0;\n\n```\n}\n\n",
