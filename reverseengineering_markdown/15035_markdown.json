  "content": "I have a file with the extension of \"TOC\" I assumed it meant Table of Contents, and the contents of said file represent that it indeed is one.\n\nIt's full of content such as this: \n\n```\n117dbdd0 15 cardcropHD400.jpg.zib\n345cbe0 15 cardcropHD401.jpg.zib\n144800a 50 D3D11\\characters\\m10658_number_104_masquerade\\m10658_number_104_masquerade.phyre\n121dffc 50 D3D11\\characters\\m3800_blue_eyes_white_dragon\\m3800_blue_eyes_white_dragon.phyre\n121602c 3e D3D11\\characters\\m3806_dark_magician\\m3806_dark_magician.phyre\n12d2eb7 4e D3D11\\characters\\m3815_red_eyes_black_dragon\\m3815_red_eyes_black_dragon.phyre\n1223774 48 D3D11\\characters\\m4766_dark_magician_girl\\m4766_dark_magician_girl.phyre\n114145a 4a D3D11\\characters\\m6653_elemental_hero_neos\\m6653_elemental_hero_neos.phyre\n1117979 62 D3D11\\characters\\m7344_arcana_force_ex_the_light_ruler\\m7344_arcana_force_ex_the_light_ruler.phyre\n1d2edd5 42 D3D11\\characters\\m7734_stardust_dragon\\m7734_stardust_dragon.phyre\n128872f 4c D3D11\\characters\\m7735_red_dragon_archfiend\\m7735_red_dragon_archfiend.phyre\n116a658 44 D3D11\\characters\\m9575_number_39_utopia\\m9575_number_39_utopia.phyre\n1488223 58 D3D11\\characters\\m9656_number_17_leviathan_dragon\\m9656_number_17_leviathan_dragon.phyre\n17c81f4 60 D3D11\\characters\\m9708_sephylon_the_ultimate_timelord\\m9708_sephylon_the_ultimate_timelord.phyre\n\n```\nNow, I figured the first line is a hex encoded size which checks out for the corresponding DAT size (Minus 6ish MB), the last column is obviously the file name. But, I don't know where to start on what the middle value is, it's a HEX encoding of something, but if you convert it and add them together it exceeds the left over buffer room.\n\nAnyone have any advice or how I could start looking into the EXE to see how it's handling the file? (I've tried running it through x64dbg but the munmbo jumbo of ASM means nothing to me)\n\n",
