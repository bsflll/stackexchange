  "content": "I have writen a new processor module for M-CORE CPU, now i want to generate FLIRT Signature Files for this cpu. \nthe probl√®me is that FLIRT tools like pelf.exe dose not recognize the CPU type.\n\nWhat can i do in this case ?\n\n```\n pelf lib/libz.a libz.pat\nFatal [lib/libz.a] (adler32.c.obj): Unknown processor type 39\n\n```\nUpdate \nI found a plugin called ida2pat that can generate . Pat file from ida.\nI can generate Sig file from .pat files But i can not use them . when i load a file in ida pro with my new CPU module and try to load the signiture the signiture is empty (I guess that ida is filtring signutures with cpu type ) \n\nHow to tell Sigmake about the CPU type . the sigmake tool has - p option that normally sets the cpu type but i am not able to use it correctly . ida has the same command line switch - p that can be used like this - pmipsel (cpu is mipsel ) . But in sigmake it gives \" ill processor id \" error. \ni tried using my cpu id defined in the cpu module but ida dose not show the sig file   \n\n",
