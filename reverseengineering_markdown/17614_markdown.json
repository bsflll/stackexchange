  "content": "I am very new to this whole business so please bear with me.  \n\nMy goal is to read JSON data from a game. Since I do not know what kind of information will/will not be useful, here are some of the details:  \n\nHere's an example of one of the said files called battle_pvp_cost.json.\nxxd battle_pvp_cost_2.json > temp.txt \n\n```\n00000000: 1400 0000 6261 7474 6c65 5f70 7670 5f63  ....battle_pvp_c\n00000010: 6f73 742e 6a73 6f6e 3701 0000 87ce ef3e  ost.json7......>\n00000020: 47d6 93a2 656e a265 6ea2 6a70 ceb4 8e44  G...en.en.jp...D\n00000030: ecda 0029 789c 8b56 3254 d251 3202 6263  ...)x..V2T.Q2.bc\n00000040: 2036 0162 5320 3603 6273 20b6 0062 4b20   6.bS 6.bs ..bK \n00000050: 3634 0011 864a b10c 00c6 3707 fdce aca5  64...J....7.....\n00000060: d333 29ce befb 0353 c3ce 70da a798 a0ce  .3)....S..p.....\n00000070: b982 0d5b 00ce 1ab8 1a85 8bce 83dc efb7  ...[............\n00000080: 82ce bf39 6750 01ce 1826 94fc 32ce 1ad5  ...9gP...&..2...\n00000090: be0d 82ce bf39 6750 02ce 1826 94fc 64ce  .....9gP...&..d.\n000000a0: 6dd2 8e9b 82ce bf39 6750 03ce 1826 94fc  m......9gP...&..\n000000b0: d100 c8ce f3b6 1b38 82ce bf39 6750 04ce  .......8...9gP..\n000000c0: 1826 94fc d101 2cce 84b1 2bae 82ce bf39  .&....,...+....9\n000000d0: 6750 05ce 1826 94fc d101 90ce 1db8 7a14  gP...&........z.\n000000e0: 82ce bf39 6750 06ce 1826 94fc d101 f4ce  ...9gP...&......\n000000f0: 6abf 4a82 82ce bf39 6750 07ce 1826 94fc  j.J....9gP...&..\n00000100: d102 58ce fa00 5713 82ce bf39 6750 08ce  ..X...W....9gP..\n00000110: 1826 94fc d102 bcce 8d07 6785 82ce bf39  .&........g....9\n00000120: 6750 09ce 1826 94fc d103 20ce a15d 25e1  gP...&.... ..]%.\n00000130: 82ce bf39 6750 0ace 1826 94fc d103 84ce  ...9gP...&......\n00000140: d65a 1577 82ce bf39 6750 0bce 1826 94fc  .Z.w...9gP...&..\n00000150: d103 e800 0000 0000                      ........\n\n```\nAll of them begins in the same way with a value in the first byte followed by 3 bytes of 0s and then the file name.\n\nIf anyone recognises what this is or can point me in the right direction, then I am all ears. Please let me know if there is any more information I can provide to help guide the process. I've tried to put in all the details I think are relevant, but I am new to file decryption and may miss some crucial hints.\n\nEdit \n\nFound Parser.Parse(json); in Json.cs and tried to mock it up on Unity but the result is incorrect.\n\nHere're the scripts + json files in a shared gdrive.  \n\nCall stacks from when the JSON was first referenced:  \n\n```\nbattle_pvp_costTableAccessor::constructor()\nTableAccessorCore::reset(filename=\"battle_pvp_cost.json\", rootKey=\"battle_pvp_cost\")\nTableAccessorCore::reset(filename=\"battle_pvp_cost.json\", rootKey=\"battle_pvp_cost\", isResources=false)\n// Branch 1\nTableAccessor::get2(name=\"battle_pvp_cost.json\")\nTableAccessor::load2(name=\"battle_pvp_cost.json\", isResources=false)\nTableResources::load2(name=\"battle_pvp_cost.json\", isResources=false)\nTableResources::loadTextAssetFormTableAssets(filename=\"battle_pvp_cost.json\")\nTextAsset::ContainsAndLoadU5S(\"battle_pvp_cost.json\")(?)\n\n// Branch 2\nHandle::getTable(key=\"battle_pvp_cost\")\nuint key2 = CRC32.Compute(str=\"battle_pvp_cost\")\nParameterTableProxy::ParameterTable_table(handle=this.Ptr(?), key=key2)\n\n```\n",
