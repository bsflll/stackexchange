      "content": "Just to clarify the answer of memo (which lacks of a good example).\n\nWhen speaking about the segment registers (cs, ds, es, ss), the semantic of the syntax cs:0xdeadbeef must be interpreted as the concatenation of the prefix stored in cs and the value appended to it. But, if we step back to see the big picture, it can be seen as: \n\nIn fact, since Intel 8086, the memory model of these CPU is segment based, meaning that each segment register store a prefix for the memory address that will allow to reach one block of memory for a specific usage.\n\nAs you can see on the picture below (courtesy to Wikipedia page about Intel x86 memory segmentation), the main memory is sliced into several memory segments and accessed through calls to several segment registers (not on the picture, but you can guess that these registers are initialized with the LDT).\n\n\n\nIn your case:\n\n```\nmov al, byte ptr ds:xxxxx\n\n```\nDoes probably means that you are moving a variable from the data segment to your al register. \n\nBut, this kind of code is not needed in normal mode as the ds registers is often set to zero (and have no effect when used like that). On the contrary, in protected mode, the ds segment register will be needed to point onto the right memory segment. And, that is probably a line which comes from an assembly code which is executed in protected mode (except if it has been obfuscated, then they break the rules all the time and we cannot tell anymore what was the intent without knowing what is the value of ds).\n\nI hope this was a bit more clear this way!\n\n",
