  "content": "This is a follow up question to the question I posted over here. According to the answer, I was able to get all the function prototypes from the binary. However, the problem I am having is most of the function signatures I am getting does not have parameters while the actual decompiled version of the same function (with the use of decompile script which is already provided by Ghidra) have parameters.\n\nFor example, I have a function signature as undefined HAL_TIMEx_OnePulseN_Stop_IT(void) that was given by the above linked answer, while in the decompiled file (taken from running the ghidra provided Decompile.java script) I have it's signature as undefined4 HAL_TIMEx_OnePulseN_Stop_IT(uint **param_1,uint param_2) which I believe to be more accurate as I cross-checked with the actual source of the binary. \n\nWhat would be the reason for such an inconsistency? Is there anyway that I could get the function parameters in the form of decompiled version? I was trying to use DecompInterface but I could not figure out the way to extract the prototypes as if they were in decompiled version. Sorry I am a beginner and just started to work with Ghidra. Thank you for your time. \n\n",

Once you enable it, you will have the function parameters correctly. It will take longer time to make the analysis once this option is enabled. \n\n",
