But, it will give you an idea (or sort of a prediction, give it a try!).\n\nYou can do:\n\n```\nrabin2 -I a.out | grep lang\n\n```\nIt will output:\n\n```\n$ rabin2 -I a.out | grep lang\nlang     c++\n\n```\nHere -I flag extracts binary information.\n\n",

      "content": "I don't know of any such tools. In fact, it's really not that easy to make one either since the executable doesn't directly identify which language was used to make it.\n\nRemember, the computer only understands machine code. To complicate matters, several languages could be used to create one executable.\n\nSo could it be done? Well, to some degree. It could work something like this:\n\nIt will not be a perfect solution, and for code that tries to obfuscate how it works, like malware, I suspect it will be difficult to automatically identify.\n\nIt would likely be quite difficult to differentiate between assembly languages/compilers (ie. x64 assembly in FASM vs x64 in NASM).\n\nSelf-contained executables for some (very) high level languages are typically more easily identifiable. If not the language itself, at least the platform (ie. .NET or JVM).\n\n",
