  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/10680/microsoft-sidewinder-strategic-commander-usb-device-any-open-source-drivers",
  "content": "I have an old USB gaming device called the Strategic Commander.  It was handy for strategy games like Age of Empires - allowing for easy left hand to control of scrolling, panning, zooming and using a variety of programmable hotkeys.  Today it's a useless/unsupported/forgotten item that sits in a drawer in my office.  I would like to use the device to help navigate in a 3D CAD environment like Blender or 3D Studio Max.  On Windows 7 & 8.\n\nIs there any existing research/work available in this area?\n\nIs there an open source driver framework?\n\nDoes anyone know Microsoft's official stance on 'hacking' this old hardware?\n\nHow should I get started?\n\nThanks!\n\n",
