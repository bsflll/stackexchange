      "content": "You did not give any details about your machine's processor. Does it support 64-bit architecture? Does it implement the x86-64 instruction set?\n\nThis is only a problem if your machine's Intel processor does not support 64-bit architecture and/or does not does not implement the same instruction set as AMD64 processors.\n\nHowever, AMD64 processors and most 64-bit Intel processors (other than Itanium-family processors, for example) implement the same instruction set: x86-64. \n\nIn other words, PE binaries compiled to target the x86-64 instruction set architecture will execute on Windows boxes regardless of whether they utilize an AMD64 processor or a 64-bit Intel processor.\n\nSee also:\n\n",
