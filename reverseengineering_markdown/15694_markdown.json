  "content": "Continuing from this question:\nFirmware analysis and file system extraction?\n\nI am trying to run the QNap firmware using QEmu. I have basically the same \nfirmware as is used in the question above.\n\nMy QEMU command is as follows:\n\n```\nsudo qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel bzImage -initrd initrd.boot -m 2048 -smp 8\n\n```\nThis works and I get the QNap login page.\n\nBut there is one thing that I cannot get to work (I tried lots of things...), that is: How to get networking up and running? There is only the local loopback interface when I use the ifconfig command. There should be a default NIC for qemu VM's, but I only see it on startup when simply running the qemu-system-x86_64 command.\nWhat can I do to get this VM running with networking configured, so I can perform some tests with it?\n\n",
