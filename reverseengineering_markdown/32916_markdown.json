  "content": "I have an .net assembly application written on c#\n\nIts target framework version is 4.5.2\n\nTrying to decompile with ILSpy, mostly all files looks like this:\n\n```\n    using MyApp.Controller;\n    using MyApp.Controller.SendQuest;\n    using PureMVC.Interfaces;\n    \n    public class AutoSendQuestCommand : BaseQuestCommand\n    {\n        private delegate void a(AutoSendQuestCommand P_0, INotification notification);\n    \n        private delegate void b(AutoSendQuestCommand P_0);\n    \n        private static bool Processing;\n    \n        protected override void InternalExecute(INotification notification)\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                ((a)global::<Module>.Invoke(334))(this, notification);\n            }\n            catch\n            {\n                throw;\n            }\n        }\n    \n        private void AutoSendQuestIntenal()\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                ((b)global::<Module>.Invoke(335))(this);\n            }\n            catch\n            {\n                throw;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n```\nAlso, there are class Module :\n\n```\n    using System;\n    using System.IO;\n    using System.Security.AccessControl;\n    using System.Security.Principal;\n    using System.Runtime.InteropServices;\n    using System.Threading;\n    \n    internal class <Module>\n    {\n        internal static i Invoke;\n    \n        static <Module>()\n        {\n            IntPtr iUnknownForObject = Marshal.GetIUnknownForObject(typeof(global::<Module>));\n            try\n            {\n                if (IntPtr.Size == 4)\n                {\n                    g(Environment.Version.Major, iUnknownForObject);\n                }\n                else if (IntPtr.Size == 8)\n                {\n                    h(Environment.Version.Major, iUnknownForObject);\n                }\n            }\n            finally\n            {\n                Marshal.Release(iUnknownForObject);\n            }\n        }\n    \n        [DllImport(\"kernel32.dll\", CharSet = CharSet.Auto, EntryPoint = \"GetModuleHandle\")]\n        private static extern IntPtr a(string P_0);\n    \n        [DllImport(\"kernel32.dll\", CharSet = CharSet.Auto, EntryPoint = \"LoadLibrary\")]\n        private static extern IntPtr b(string P_0);    \n        \n        private static IntPtr d()\n        {\n            string text = ((IntPtr.Size == 4) ? \"Protect544cd51a.dll\" : \"Protect2a3d628b.dll\");\n            IntPtr intPtr = a(text);            \n            return intPtr;\n        }\n    \n        [DllImport(\"kernel32.dll\", CharSet = CharSet.Ansi, EntryPoint = \"GetProcAddress\", ExactSpelling = true)]\n        private static extern IntPtr e(IntPtr P_0, string P_1);\n    \n        private static Delegate f(string P_0, Type P_1)\n        {\n            return Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer(e(d(), P_0), P_1);\n        }\n    \n        private static bool g(int P_0, IntPtr P_1)\n        {\n            return ((a)f(\"P0\", typeof(a)))(P_0, P_1);\n        }\n    \n        private static bool h(int P_0, IntPtr P_1)\n        {\n            return ((a)f(\"P0\", typeof(a)))(P_0, P_1);\n        }\n    }\n\n```\nAnd, finally in resources there are those dll files Protect544cd51a.dll and Protect2a3d628b.dll (their content not readable)\n\nI understand that each delegate calls some function like this\n\n```\n    ((a)global::<Module>.Invoke(334))(this, notification);\n\n```\nand then class Module check if system is 32bit or 64bit\n\nand then loads code from Protect544cd51a.dll (32bit) or from Protect2a3d628b.dll (64bit) by the number parameter (334 or 335)\n\nBut how can I see the native code, what obfuscator is this? where to dig ?\n\n",
