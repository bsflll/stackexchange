  "content": "I have some assembly code as a .txt file (i.e. a list of the instructions, stuff like this):\n\n```\n00000003  E8D001            call 0x1d6\n00000006  A08000            mov al,[0x80]\n00000009  0C00              or al,0x0\n0000000B  750B              jnz 0x18\n0000000D  90                nop\n\n```\nHow would I import this into ghidra? (i.e. copy the code into the code browser window). I originally started with a .COM file, but I couldn't successfully import into Ghidra. My end goal is to compile it up to C.\n\n",
