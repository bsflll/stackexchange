  "content": "I would like to know how WinDbg extracts all the user, group, privilege information about a process from a token when given the !token 0xaddress command so I can implement it in my driver code.\n\nExample output of !token 0xaddress command\n\n\nAccording to this site token has the EX_FAST_REF structure which has a definition like this:\n\n```\ntypedef struct EX_FAST_REF {\n       union {\n              PVOID Object;\n              ULONG RefCnt : 3;\n              ULONG Value;\n         };\n }EX_FAST_REF, *PEX_FAST_REF\n\n```\nObject field points to the address of the token, the Value field holds the fist 4 bytes from the token address. I could not find the info I need from these fields but when I investigate the token address a little bit I am beginning to see strings like uid. What is the type of structure windbg uses to get all of this information? (Both debugger and debuggee have 32 bit architecture).\n\n\n\n",
