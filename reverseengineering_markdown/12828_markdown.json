  "content": "So I'm trying to request data from a server and I've been able to connect the server and send commands to request data. I'm not sure of the command format itself i just used what i captured in wireshark and the server response with the same data that was also captured in wireshark. The problem is I cannot discern any format from the data. All received data seems to have a similar header like\nb1cb74000c0130000100eb0f or b1cb74000c0130000200b50f. I thought it was a compression header but no decompression or inflate functions work. The data is stock data and in this case is tick data. It should contain min,hour,price,volume and buy/sell. I'll include one full received data below. Any ideas on if it is in fact compressed or another way i could approach it is appreciated.\n\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\n\n",

For standard encodings, feeding google the hex codes of the first few bytes typcially gives you some results, and so does the linux file command, but this is not the case here. Try googling for 1f 8b or 42 5a to find gzip resp. bzip2 quickly.\n\nUnless you disassemble the executable file that processes this data, and checks how it reads the data (and possibly decrypts or converts it before actually reading it), it's quite probable you won't be able to find out anything.\n\n",
