  "content": "I'm wondering if x64dbg can show Chinese letters in String references? Because I try to reverse 3 Chinese programs from complete different coders and I never found any Chinese strings. But in the software there is obvious many Chinese texts.\n\nCan someone tell me if x64Dbg can show Chinese strings and how to fix it?\n\n",
