  "content": "hello, I disassembled the request sent to the game server, I need to change the symbol, but I donâ€™t know its memory address. Help me understand the ADRP and LDR instructions, I need to understand what address will be assigned to the register \"x1\".\n\nmy disassembly experience is very small, i will be happy for any help.\n\nwill this user's question help me? getting function address by reading ADRP and ADD instruction values\n\n",

The address that turned out went beyond the boundaries of the program (I disassembled the unity engine) I was told to look in the debugger for what the address is, but the debugger does not work.",

      "text": "Given that the architecture is arm64 (you didn't say it). From this post, ADRP will set the x8 value to pc + 0x2d71000, then zero out the lower 12 bit. Then nop will do nothing (wonder if it's a hole for debugging?) Then ldr x1, [x8, 0x250] will load the value in the memory address x8 + 0x250. If your program has correct address (the address in the left size of the picture, provide that you don't have some kind of randomized address), then the value in address 0x4151250 in memory will be loaded to x1 register. Please correct me if I'm wrong.",
