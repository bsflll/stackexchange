  "content": "Sometimes by reversing I find several functions within the same binary file which look suspiciously similar. Is there a plugin/script to quickly compare them and see their differences?\n\nP.S. I'm aware of the myriad of tools for doing binary diffing between two different binaries, for example for doing patch diffing . This is not what I am looking for.\n\n",
