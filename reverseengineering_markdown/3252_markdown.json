  "content": "Upon checking out a binary file, and according to convincing evidence, .bin file extensions are supposed to denote a file type which stores its data as 0s and 1s, or 31/32 in ASCII hex(ASCII character codes for 1 and 0). Upon entering a file I noticed that it doesn't just store 0s and 1s:\n\n\n\nThe first sixteen bytes fall within a possible 8-bit value (range: 0-256), which makes sense since each value is a byte. But my questioning is, since it's called \"bin\", why does it store values like every other file? What is the difference? The values are not 1s and 0s, but values falling anywhere between 0-256 per byte. That doesn't add up to me.\n\nWhy is it called a binary file when it stores byte-ranged values the same as any other file would? How is a bin different than a jpeg? \n\n",

File extensions (such as .bin) are primarily intended to indicate to the user the type of content in the file. I don't know what file you're looking at, but someone chose to name it .bin. The extension itself doesn't change the content of the file, and doesn't always reflect the actual content of a file. For example, you could rename a .jpg file to .bin and your graphics editor would still be able to open the file just fine as a JPEG file.",

A .bin file is not encoded in ASCII format for Notepad to parse and display, but its format could well be understood by Intel Celeron, so the difference is merely formatting/encoding schemes.

My confusion was actually the encoding differences I believe, because all files are encoded at the lowest level in binary, so I didn't understand quite the difference from a bin to a, say, jpeg using that same manner of logic.
