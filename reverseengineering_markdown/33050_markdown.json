  "content": "I have considered buying these games but i've seen reviews about the monotony of them after a few games.\n\nIs there any info about the technical details of these games like the microcontroller or hardware used, so i can consider dumping the firmware and modify it to change the rules for custom games.\n\nAny hint where to find more info would be appreciated as well.\n\nRegards.\n\n",
