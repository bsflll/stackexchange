  "content": "I am trying to reverse engineer a heavily obfuscated web application, and I would like to modify the JS to add logging. So far, I've set up mitmproxy, but I can't figure out what the best way to edit the JS files is. Ideally this would be done in a way where I can save the edits and have them automatically apply when I refresh the page.\n\n",
