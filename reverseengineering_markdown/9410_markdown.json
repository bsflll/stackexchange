  "content": "I know that red addresses means, that code do not recognize as a function in IDA, because that code never get called.\nBut I have found a piece of code that is marked red, but when debugging, I saw that this code gets called. But I still can't get that graph view of that piece of code and it still marked red.\nCan someone please explain what's happening here..?\n\n",

However, if the source code was C++ or another language with classes, the function might never be called directly, only indirectly through the vtable (table of method start addresses) of the class. In this case, you'll have to mark the procedure manually.\n\n",
