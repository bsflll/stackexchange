  "content": "What can I do to reverse engineer a DOS .COM file? As far as debugging goes, I've looked DEBUG and DEBUGX from the creators of FreeDOS, as well as the default DEBUG command that comes with Windows. Sure, I can probably work with them and eventually figure out what I'm doing, but I feel like the process would end up being longer than necessary. Is there a better tool I can use?\n\nIf there are no \"better\" tools than DEBUG or DEBUGX, then what can I use to work with output from these two tools? My main goal is to create something that mimics the .COM program, but in a more manageable format (as far as code goes).\n\n",

It also makes use of DOSBox. But if you have a proper IDA Pro license it is - I think - slightly more convenient.\n\n",
