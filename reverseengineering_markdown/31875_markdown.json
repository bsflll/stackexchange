  "content": "While reverse engineering an Android process, I wanted to explore the openat function. I noticed that there is a symbol \"openat\" and another symbol \"__openat\". What is the difference between these two?\n\nFurthermore, if I use info function openat, I can see more openat related symbols. Can someone also explain what are the differences between these?\n\n```\n__dl___openat_2\n__dl___openat\n__openat_2@plt\nopenat\nopenat64\n__openat_2\n__openat\n__openat_2@plt\n__openat_2@plt\nopenattr\n__openat_2@plt\nsun.nio.fs.UnixNativeDispatcher.openatSupported\nopenat@plt\nJava_sun_nio_fs_UnixNativeDispatcher_openat0\n__openat_2@plt\n\n```\nUPDATE\n\nSuppose I want to get a function pointer to openat, I can do this inside Android Studio\n\n```\n    int (*getptr)(int, const char*, int, ...);\n    getptr = openat;\n\n```\nHowever, I cannot do it for __openat since this function does not seem to exist.\n\nAt least this is one difference between the two that I know.\n\n",
