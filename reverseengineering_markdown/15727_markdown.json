  "content": "I know that both pdf @ func and pdr @ func disassemble the function, the first using linear and the second recursive traversal disassembly. VV @ func shows the disassembled function in visual mode, but it seems it uses linear sweep. Can I use recursive traversal and see the output in visual mode?\n\n",
