  "content": "I wrote a Pintool that intercepts system calls based on their system call number. I'm currently on a windows 7 machine and I'm using the system calls listed here as a reference.\nI'm tracing a hello world style executable that does the following :-\n\n```\nint (*dyncode)(int);\ndyncode = (int(*)*int)) VirtualAlloc(NULL, 4096, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);\n\n```\nI went through the system calls being invoked and it doesn't seem to me that the NTProtectVirtualMemory system call is being invoked. It would be helpful to know which system calls are invoked when the VirtualAlloc function is called. From the results I see so far, no system calls show up for VirtualAlloc even though I can see them appear for calls to VirtualFree.\n\nWhat I'm trying to do is intercept all system calls that allocate regions with executable privileges.\n\n[EDIT]\n\nA bit more of context. The reason I'm trying to intercept system calls is because I had initially written the pintool for linux and I had resorted to hooking system calls as opposed to libc calls(as I did not want to miss direct mprotect system calls). However, it seems this approach wouldn't work for Windows so I've resorted to using IMG_Instrument PIN functions to look for and instrument VirtualAlloc.\n\n",

      "text": "Just as a note: syscall IDs are different across systems in userland (maybe not at kernel level), so that table won't help you much. If you want to catch the calls for VirtualAlloc for a specific process, inject your DLL inside, hook VirtualAlloc ( which looks like this ; you can use GetProcAddress(kernel32_handle, \"VirtualAlloc\") for the offset at runtime ) and intercept. If you want to do it system-wide, you can do it using a driver... or injecting your DLL into every process. Do tell me if you need help doing it for a single process.",

      "text": "yes, they vary even between different service packs. I don't know what's your system, but mine's Windows 7 x64 Ultimate SP1, and the syscall ID for ZwResumeThread is 0x4F (ntdll.dll, x64). It is probably different on your system. While it is possible for the IDs to be the same, you shouldn't rely on that if you want portability. I'm not sure about ring0, though.",
