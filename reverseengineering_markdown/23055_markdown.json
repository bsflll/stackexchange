Service acts differently when different parameters are passed.\nI need help to figure out what this parameter contains.\nHere are two examples:\n\n7b0fc4f83d3fc320ef3865a1b472caeba3f0b60e09f257c61f34af77a7ff57adTB5QO8kXU18KUIgZGXblGYAOC7qbRzizHLGpGdUPbywggHncAkwJVe4M/0w7Dy9svucGrEgYbud0OY5iCFlTalho9j9SWzGMXlWjqU0wrFApBh+/Rqy8v93q1gBlpwLsuj7WBppuWItBmhoOyxkyKLv8Vm6AVVeXxndd4kklq+E= - allows uploading any file\n\n8849c262187451b5f558f4c2f150ec67efaafc192f51b1b8983754090e0c767bb+5SL0SVpqqHUB7zPYvNzEMSanK9r2uL7xUe/TK+9rofXD6gqQpsIKB2P7aECihmfEwEdQaLG6Kz3W5B1wiwxZRbdutdBbRYClAAoZ/bhaTdm2VnPBVZKuisi3cVVM91p2/pjb/qSPor7/026fq9PitSBizAtSbf858/BcTu7sw=H2pFMj+uoRaSnqqPdNbdrZzh3AF9H0uhagE9V7R6V8Ed67HFvGYS/Cg9DReGtlj1n1HtjpV14qqfYt5l/tVesG2B/Xh84tkr14t/RgTUA7cXwn3bWEWUcjxCFWlmAs2RXLs6g1Up3e/g4rolmGO8JAbFwRXWhFQQvZMx1+D5tjM=Tie6y7lK/q6Vlw9ssVYUYDP5Il5dYZxGPtkJSkaOPNGjkin81azLZFdtU7K6wUBcHYOoZzhthYdFMIK8K30UMGPMQI9/d4AKJsATT1PXaw/A1bjkMnapCdJl4IWGNs55IgHEs6mMPENlBuVodjQXJNodIkXOFa+I+q+MlGu0Rls= - allows uploading only images\n\nMy guess is that this is a serialized object that contains upload configuration. Are there any ideas how to understand and maybe deserialize these strings?\n\n",
