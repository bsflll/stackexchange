  "content": "I'm taking a reverse engineering course and the class has just been given a big project where we have to analyze a packed malware binary. I am using a Windows 10 VM. I am a little confused on where to begin. The professor has mentioned that the best place to start is by taking a snapshot of your initial system setup, running the malware, and then \"figuring out what has changed\".\n\nMy strategy is as follows:\n\nThis is where I get a little iffy. I am not sure what \"checking for changes on the system\" entails. Does this mean I need to take a memory dump of the OS state after the malware has run? What should I be looking for within the memory dump? Is there some tool that identifies meaningful changes between my starting state and the state after the malware runs? Do I need to audit the registry keys to see what has been changed? If I know the malware uses the network, should I be running Wireshark? \n\nUltimately, I am not sure what the most efficient approach is. It is a pretty powerful piece of malware with a lot of functionality and I want to make sure I collect all necessary information upfront so I don't waste time later in the project.\n\nThank you\n\n",

The web is awash with “how to get started with malware analysis”-type material. I’m sure your professor has provided you with a lot of material as well.",

      "content": "I find it really disturbing that in an official university class there are no proper safety guidelines and procedures for students before dealing with actual malware. This is super risky and should be dealt with accordingly. However, here are a few steps to make your task safer and easier:\n\nYou can follow the full procedure here by Lenny Zelster. In short, it has the following steps:\n\nOnce your lab is set, let's examine our tasks, from your words:\n\nSince we are dealing with a Windows based system, we need to ask ourselves what possible system changes can be done by malware and for what purpose. For example, malware is usually looking to achieve some kind of persistency. This is usually done by the following methods:\n\nA much more comprehensive list is available by MITRE ATT&CK here.\n\nIn addition, malware usually has some sort of intention, for example stealing cookies, hooking to a web browsers or maybe just wait for a secondary payload or update. If we ignore \"Fileless\" or \"Memory Injections\" attacks for the simplicity of this short guide, malware has to leave some file traces on the system. We need to look for files (executable or not) written to the file system. \n\nIn order to monitor the system changes mentioned above, we can use Sysinternal tools initially developed by Mark Russinovich and now owned by Microsoft. \n\nTip: it's recommended to read Mark's Windows Internals book for anyone starting with malware analysis.\n\nBeing more specific, the tools of the Sysinternals suite you should learn how to use are:\n\nThe guide above should get you to a good starting point for your project.\n\nYou can skip all this stages and use one of the publicly available malware detonation sandboxes. However,  in order to become a reverse engineer or malware analyst you should only use these tools once you have learned the basics and understand what you are actually doing. \n\n",

You take a snapshot before running a process, a second one after, and then to compare them.  If you select \"Scan dir\" and enter \"C:\\\" in the box, it will also tell you file changes.  These are snapshots at the time the buttons are pressed, so may miss files that are dropped and deleted.  Use Process Monitor or Sysmon for that info and more.",
