  "content": "I'm trying to reverse engineering my router firmware after reading an interesting article about an hidden backdoor inside router firmwares from a popular company.\n\nData has been extracted (using raspberry pi b+ spi) directly from flash because there isn't a downloadable firmware around.\n\npartial serial output\nStart to decompress!\nBooting\nPress 'ESC' to enter BOOT console...\nExt. phy is not found. \nBoot from NOR/SPI flash\n(c)Copyright Realtek, Inc. 2012\nProject RTL8676S LOADER (LZMA)\nVersion 00.01.02a-rc (Nov 13 2014 17:15:26)\n\n\nbinwalk output\nLZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: 70744 bytes\n(lots of lines like this one)\n\nfindings\n0x8000 to 0xE777: bootloader?\n0x10000: rootfs start\n  first 0x13 byte: unknown data (header ?)\n  build date\n  string \"router.img\"\n  firmware data\n\nI think firmware is encrypted. I can't extract bootloader, kernel and rootfs for static analysis. Is it possible to emulate using qemu?\nFw link: flashimage pass: fi00\n\nThanks in advance\n\n",

There is a subroutine at 0x80001d70 offset which prints out the initial \"Start to decompress!\" message at PC 0x80001e38. Hopefully that should get you started.\n\n",
