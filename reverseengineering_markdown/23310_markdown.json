  "content": "I have a collection of different binaries I want to review for code similarity and classification, but I would rather not have to open each of them in IDA and manually review the code in 15 different samples.\n\nWhat tools or techniques can I use to automatically classify and determine code similarity/reuse between samples? My first thought is to use ssdeep, but I was wondering if there were any other open source tools or frameworks that could do the same.\n\nI would also like to request that a classification tag be added in case there are other people who want to ask questions about classifying files into different groups based on different binary features.\n\n",

Do you just want to compare different versions of normal binaries or are they randomly re-ordered, obfuscated or may be even protected with encrypted parts that decrypt at run-time?",

It is not an easy task, and I don't know what similarity you are looking for, but I can list mostly used static features for binary classification, at least for malicious/unknown software.\n\nWe are not at a point where we can fully use these binary features and machine learning models in commercial products. It may help you if you can tolerate some false-positive classification. GitHub has lots of malware classification examples you can work on.\n\n",
