      "content": "You can read from and write to a process's data segment from shellcode (assuming proper page protections).\n\nHowever, you typically want to supply the data your shellcode is going to use (for example, the data string \"http://172.19.3.204/stager.exe\"), and not rely what's currently in the exploited process's data segment (for example, the data string \"Internet Explorer 4.0\").\n\nAs such, you'll need to either inject your shellcode's data into the exploited process's data segment, or as is the more common case, inject your shellcode and data together in a single blob and have your shellcode reference your data at an offset relative to your shellcode.\n\n",
