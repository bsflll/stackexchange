  "content": "What i'm trying to achieve is to use a conditional breakpoint, that never actually breaks but logs in x64dbg's console the value of r9 only when it changes, to prevent console cluttering.\nBut i do not understand how to set the expression for the log condition. On a higher level the pseudo code of what i want to achieve could be:\n\n```\nstatic last_r9 = 0;\nif(r9 != last_r9){\nLog();\nlast_r9 = r9;\n}\n\n```\nIs is even possible to achieve something like that?\n\nHere's an screenshot just for reference:\n\n\n\n",
