  "content": "While disassembling a mips binary, IDA Pro attempts to disassemble into mips 16 mode, even though It's mips 32 ISA.\nBelow is that code snippet.\n\n```\n.text:XXXXXXXX       .set nomips16 # <= ??\n.text:XXXXXXXX 3C    .byte 0x3C        \n.text:XXXXXXXX 02    .byte    2\n.text:XXXXXXXX       .set mips16   # <= ??\n.text:XXXXXXXX 80    .byte 0x80\n.text:XXXXXXXX 87    .byte 0x87\n.text:XXXXXXXX 8C    .byte 0x8C\n.text:XXXXXXXX 42    .byte 0x42 \n...\n\n```\nIDA arbitrarily set this as mips16, and repeatedly disassemble here as mips16.\nWhich makes me crazy.\n\nQuestion:\nHow to forcefully disassemble here as mips 32 ISA?\n(Manually? or Automatically using IDA Plugins?)\n\n",
