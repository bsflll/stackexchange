  "content": "I'm working with an SDK for developing apps that's distributed as an AAR, and has been obfuscated with ProGuard.  I'm just trying to reverse a few things it does.  The classes, methods and variables have been obfuscated, I'm pretty sure with ProGuard.  I've been looking for a toolchain that would give me a better workflow than my current one but can't find what I need.\n\nHere's what I'm doing now:\n\nHere's what I'd like to do:\n\nI would think some kind of baksmali / smali parser / smali assembler process should achieve this but I can't find anything out there yet that does it.  Virtuous Ten might be able to do it, but it craps out in unclear ways trying to generate smali on my SDK jar.  I get zero smali or java when I run it on my jar.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n",

As for realism, that's not really a concern since I know the target app uses the sdk for the things I'm interested in (encryption/decryption/protocol handling), so I just need to reverse the sdk functions of interst by hook or by crook to understand how they are being carried out.",

Symbols rule all :)",

You could save the decompiled code as a Gradle project, which you could then open it in Android Studio and do the refactoring.\n\nAlternatively, note that *.aar is basically a *.jar and Android resources bundled together. You cannot use baksmali, the *.jar still contains JVM bytecode and not converted to dex! You just need to:\n\nBoth of these methods only support static analysis, you cannot debug an app using the decompiled result. Unless the decompiled result can actually be compiled, which you could link your sample code with them instead of the library.\n\nAlso, these won't help if the real code are compiled with NDK (check if there are any *.so files when you unzip the *.aar).\n\n",

The Android Studio renaming doesn't work, I think because of  the number of errors in the decompiled java.  As I recall, I did try bringing in decompiled java from jd-gui, and CFR, and I had the same problem.",

Mostly because I made it for similar reasons.\n\nIts a GUI that decompiles code with CFR but links class and member names to the decompiled text. To rename them you simply click the name or member, type in a new name and hit enter. You can export your changes as a text file or as a updated jar file.\n\n",
