  "content": "I can't seem to figure out if I can and how you load multiple idb files with notes into a debugging session?\n\nIs there a method or plugin that allows me to load these idb's? What I am doing now is start the program make a memory snapshot and make notes that way. When I start the new debuggin session I rebase the dlls. \n\nThis does really not work well ;)\n\nnote, I currently only have IDA Basic.\n\n",
