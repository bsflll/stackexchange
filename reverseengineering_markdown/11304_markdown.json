  "content": "I've been testing DynamoRio and minblox to do coverage analysis, and I've got a question, when I run a the bbcount sample on ping.exe (not passing parameters) several times, I get different count of basic blocks and I'm not changing anything.\n\nThe same happens with bbcoverage/minblox, I get different traces, for example with 100 runs, I get only 44 traces that are exactly the same, the others are quite different (extra/missing blocks). \n\nI also tried with this trivial program:\n\n```\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\nThe bbcount still produces different outputs, it may change less but it still does:\n\n```\nInstrumentation results:\n     14075 basic block executions\n       528 basic blocks needed flag saving\n      1109 basic blocks did not\n\nInstrumentation results:\n     14075 basic block executions\n       529 basic blocks needed flag saving\n      1108 basic blocks did not\n\nInstrumentation results:\n     14159 basic block executions\n       529 basic blocks needed flag saving\n      1108 basic blocks did not\n\n```\nIs this behavior expected? I'm testing on Windows with ASLR disabled (using EMET).\n\n",

      "content": "This behaviour is expected.\n\nFor ping, the execution trace largely depends on the network at any given run. If one ping succeeds in 0.1 ms there is no guarantee that the next will also succeed within the same time. \n\nPing uses non-blocking IO to receive datagrams over the network. This means it will make repeated tries before bailing out. Correspondingly, you would get different execution traces for those runs.\n\nFor reference, here is the relevant source snippet of ping taken from ReactOS.\n\n```\n/* Expect to receive ICMP echo reply */\nFD_ZERO(&Fds);\nFD_SET(IcmpSock, &Fds);\nTimeval.tv_sec  = Timeout / 1000;\nTimeval.tv_usec = Timeout % 1000;\n\ndo {\n    Status = select(0, &Fds, NULL, NULL, &Timeval);\n    if ((Status != SOCKET_ERROR) && (Status != 0))\n    {\n        Length = sizeof(From);\n        Status = recvfrom(IcmpSock, Buffer, Size, 0, &From, &Length);\n\n#ifndef NDEBUG\n        printf(\"Received packet  \n\");\n        DisplayBuffer(Buffer, Status);\n        printf(\"  \n\");\n#endif /* !NDEBUG */\n    }\n    else\n        LostCount++;\n    if (Status == SOCKET_ERROR)\n    {\n        if (WSAGetLastError() != WSAETIMEDOUT)\n        {\n            FormatOutput(IDS_COULD_NOT_RECV, WSAGetLastError());\n            GlobalFree(Buffer);\n            return FALSE;\n        }\n        Status = 0;\n    }\n\n    if (Status == 0)\n    {\n        FormatOutput(IDS_REQUEST_TIMEOUT);\n        GlobalFree(Buffer);\n        return TRUE;\n    }\n\n} while (!DecodeResponse(Buffer, Status, (PSOCKADDR_IN)&From));\n\n```\n",

I verified myself that even for completely deterministic non trivial programs (i.e., \"ls\"), the number of executed basic blocks varies from execution to execution, with the very same inputs. Indeed, in a fuzzer I wrote using code coverage data, to get a measure of executed basic blocks I get the average between 10 runs instead of only one execution because I know I cannot trust the results of just one execution.",
