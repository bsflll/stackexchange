We need all the information we can get in order to help. Voting to close for now. Please edit your question to add those details and then vote to reopen. Thanks.",

      "content": "The first line of your file contains device information - it seems you are reading HT DataLogger's data. From the quick glance, I conclude, this device measures temperature.\n\nSubsequent data looks like an array of floats - one can deduce it from 41's and 42's in each 4-byte block (\"reasonable\" float numbers usually start with them when written in hex).\n\nTo read the data, just take any 4-byte, block starting with an address divisible by 4 and use this site. However, as you may notice, the order of bytes in each 4-byte block has to be different than just \"left to right\", that is, so-called big endian.\n\nKnowing that each number has to start with either 41 or 42 (otherwise resulting numbers would be too high or too low to reflect the temperature), you can conclude that, in  fact, number ABCD really means BADC, so it's little endian encoding with respect to each 2 bytes.\n\nFor example, if you want to decode 01 41 33 33, you want to convert the number 41 01 33 33 to decimal format (that is ~8.075 Celcius degrees).\n\nModifying data is rather straightforward - hex editors provide very easy way to do it; just highlight relevant bytes and start typing.\n\nEdit: it is also possible (and more likely) that the numbers are stored in little endian encoding, assuming that the first one begins at address 0012h. In such a case, 0x421 (21 04 00 00) is probably the size of the float array.\n\n",
