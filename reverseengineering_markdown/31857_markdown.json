  "content": "When reverse engineering obfuscated javascript, it may be protected by anti-tamper mechanisms.\nI have a script which will work when run untouched, but cause a fatal javascript error when run in node after having been beautified.\n\nHow can one log the javascript control flow (e.g. when running it via node) to later compare it with a reference to detect where the anti-reverse-engineering mechanisms (anti-debug/anti-tamper) come into effect?\n\n",
