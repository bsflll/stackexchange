  "content": "Among other approaches, there are ways to \"prettify\" obfuscated javascript. But most of such approaches are geared towards someone trying to understand code that's not their own (e.g. from a website, or something they took over, etc.). \n\nBut suppose I am the owner/author of a script which is obfuscated in production and I notice an error in production. It is still not straightforward (even if I wrote the code) to map a function/variable from the obfuscated js to the regular version. \n\nIs there a clean way I can have a map of corresponding variables/functions in the regular and obfuscated versions? \n\n",
