  "content": "I have some difficult to find CPU from a board.\nFirst I though that CPU/SOC was this one :\n\n\n\nAll I know (about CPU) is that's an ARM core little-endian (because I begin reverse firmware in IDA) but I lack of information on it. The hardware is a 8 years old GPS with 800x480 tft.\n\nAccording to Igor link document from Samsung,  codification of K4X2G303PC - XGC6 means :\n\nK : Memory\n\n4 : DRAM\n\nX : Mobile DDR SDRAM\n\n2G : 2G, 8K/64ms (Density,Refresh)\n\n30 : x32 (2CS, 2CKE) (Organization)\n\n3 : 4Bank \n\nP : LVTTL, 1.8V, 1.8V (Interface, VDD, VDDQ)\n\nX : POP (Lead-Free, DDP, Halogen-Free)\n\nG : Extended, Low, PASR & TCSR (Temp, Power)\n\nC6 : 6ns@CL3 (Speed)\n\nHere is the whole board (warning EMMC is unsolded)\n\n\n\nHere same hard, but component is another reference from Micron Technology (picture is 180° rotated)\n\n\n\nAnd the backside\n\n\n\nX16V554IL is quad UART (https://www.exar.com/content/document.ashx?id=505) I checked GND pinout it is corresponding\n\nSo if Samsung K4x2G303PC is not SOC/CPU where is SOC/CPU ?\n\nWhy is there a Crystal near K4x2G303PC  ? (The other Crytal is for XR16V)\nCan Latticle CPLD LC4064 have an arm software core ?\n\nREgards ;)\n\n",

If I am correct, the hex base address for the firmware running on that specific device ( a specific GPS device with a nice sunlight visible screen) is 0x80200000 , and indeed it is a little indian 32 bits arm code. There is a primary boot code also loaded at 0x80100000, and from the web surfing I made, that is to initialize among others the RAM. The entry point is not 100% easy to locate in the firmware bin file, and I am at that stage. I will now start to lo",

The actual processor is hidden under the RAM chip.\n\n\n\nLook at Raspberry Pi Zero — you won't find SoC there either! The chip there has Elpida label, which is a RAM manufacturer, and the SoC itself is under there.\n\n",
