  "content": "Is it possible to change the value of a local var within Radare2? I'm practicing with ESIL feature and now I want to set the value of local variable userInput:\n\n```\n[0x080484e6]> afvd\nvar userInput = 0x00177ffc  0x00000000  .... eflags\nvar var1 = 0x00177ff8  0x00000246  F...\nvar var2 = 0x00177ff4  0x00052b24  $+.. \n\n```\nI wasn't able to catch this information from the documentation. Eventually, is it possible do the same thing while debugging the binary (-d)? \n\n",

Thus, you can modify their value (with some restrictions of course) to meet your needs.\n\nFor example, let's see the result of afvd in some random function of a binary:\n\n```\n[0x00400637]> afvd\nvar local_10h = 0x7ffffa0c1870  0x00007ffffa0c1960   `....... r13 stack R W 0x1 -->  rdi\n\n```\nWe have only one variable, local_10h which is located at rbp - 0x10:\n\n```\n[0x00400637]> afvd local_10h\npxr $w @rbp-0x10\n\n```\nNow, let's modify rbp-0x10 to be \"ABCD\":\n\n```\n[0x00400637]> wx 41424344 @ rbp-0x10\n[0x00400637]> afvd\nvar local_10h = 0x7ffffa0c1870  0x00007fff44434241   `ABCD... r13 stack R W 0x1 -->  rdi\n\n```\nSo this is a way to manipulate a value of a variable.\n\nradare2 is an Open-Source project with great community and developers, feel free to open an issue, or even better, propose a pull-request so we all can benefit from this feature.\n\n",
