As shown in the image everything seems fine  \n\nHowever when I run the original program it segfaults rather than exiting via the exit(9), I can't figure out why.

It will output following problems:\n\n```\nreadelf: Error: Reading 1856 bytes extends past end of file for section headers\nreadelf: Error: Section headers are not available!\nreadelf: Warning: note with invalid namesz and/or descsz found at offset 0xc\nreadelf: Warning:  type: 0x600ff0, namesize: 0x00000000, descsize: 0x00150003, alignment: 4\n\n```\nIt means that your section headers address was increased by PAGE_SIZE too. Indeed, after modification it equals:\n\n```\nStart of section headers:          10544 (bytes into file)\n\n```\nAnd before:\n\n```\nStart of section headers:          6448 (bytes into file)\n\n```\nSo you don't want to add PAGE_SIZE to ehdr->e_shoff, since otherwise the start of section headers now points to some random data.\n\nRegarding phdr[i].p_offset's, I don't think you have to change them at all, since they are just segment offsets.\n\nNote: GCC by default compiles to position independent executable, so it will have e_type equal 3 (ET_DYN instead of ET_EXEC), but will still be an ELF executable.\n\n",
