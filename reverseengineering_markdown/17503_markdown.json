  "content": "In C a static function is scoped to a source file so you can have multiple static functions with the same name as long as they are in different files.\n\nDoes IDA have a way to express this or do I have to add a prefix to names myself? I know I can mark functions as being static and associate a sourcefile with a range (using add_sourcefile) but this doesn't seem to resolve naming conflicts.\n\n",
