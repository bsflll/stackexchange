The result of the first line is used in this loop.\n\n```\ndo\n  {\n    v6[(signed int)v17 * (signed __int64)v11 % (unsigned __int64)v14] = *(_BYTE *)(v13 + v16) ^ v15[v17];\n    ++v17;\n    v16 = (v16 + 1) % v10;\n  }\n  while ( v17 < v14 );\n\n```\n3: function getEncyptedFileData return result of this line:\n\n```\nv19 = (*(int (__cdecl **)(cocos2d::CCFileUtils *, _BYTE *))(*(_DWORD *)v21 + 24))(v21, v6);\n\n```\n",

Now you need to find the xxtea encryption key in this method. You can either dig a little bit more from CCFileUtils or AppDelegate(As this article: https://boards.libre.io/threads/decrypt-xxtea-block-cipher-in-lua-file-from-cocos2d-lua-games.297552/)\n\nAnother way (my favorite way), is to use frida and hook to the method, print out this (arg[0]) using this guide: https://boards.libre.io/threads/decrypting-lua-files.238916/\n\n",
