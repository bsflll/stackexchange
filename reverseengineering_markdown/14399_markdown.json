  "content": "\n\nThere is a large continuous, memory region as shown above in IDA disassembly which has got the same address for every possible address. Is the disassembly incorrect? How do I interpret one single row?\n\nDCB \"0000000000000000 l    df *ABS*\",9,\"0000000000000000 gic.c\",0xA\n\nThe row above doesn't seem to be continuous data even. How are the columns  (space/tab and comma separated) significant? I can locate the following column values:\n\n",

Look at the dcb and double quotes; unprintable characters are included outside the double quotes, in hex.\n\nPresumably there is a zero-terminator at the very end, which is how IDA Pro identified it as a string: all it contains are printable characters, plus the characters Tab and LF.\n\nIt's broken up at the linefeeds so it is slightly better readable, but that's for display only. If you press the * \"Define array\" key somewhere inside this, you will see it's indeed a single long array of bytes.\n\nThe starting address is only repeated for your convenience. \"The\" address of a larger structure is in general the address of its first byte.\n\n",
