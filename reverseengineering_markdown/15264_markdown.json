  "content": "Currently I am stuck finding the base address for IDA to disassemble the boot image correctly.\n\nThe img file is coming from /dev/block/mmcblk0boot0 (mcc_utils is executing: cat bootarea.img > dev/block/mmcblk0boot0 to restore this image). And looking at the string output it shows that it prolly is U-boot U-Boot 2011.12 (Nov 04 2016 - 12:13:11) and the platform is running android 4.4.\n\n\n\nThe image starts with 0x19034 and then zero's until 0x200 which seem to contain some sort of checksum.Then at 0x600 certain address appear all starting with 0xE004xxxx.\n\nAt 0x660 the first opcodes seem to placed and just before that 0xBACODE is shown 3 times.\n\nI have tried to drop the image file until 0x600 and several different base addresses. But I don't seem to be able to get all offset correctly in IDA. There are a lot of strings at the bottom which could be matched.\n\nThe image file can be downloaded here.\n\nHopefully someone can help me finding the correct offset and base address.\n\n",
