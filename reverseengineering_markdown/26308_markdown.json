  "content": "I'm currently programming a x64 kernel and need to set the Apic mode to symmetric I/O Mode. The Multiprocessor Specification from Intel at Page 31 says that to enable this mode you have to write 01H to the IMCR memory register. The problem is that this memory register (has to be accessed over outb/inb)  is absolutely nowhere documented.\nCan someone point me to the official spec where it's written down?\n\n",
