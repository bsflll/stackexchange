  "content": "For the past few years I've been using an ida color scheme which I created, that was very easy on my eyes with the previous versions of IDA Pro (<7.0). However, after start using version 7.5 I cannot see any option to import colors from .clr files or export the current ones.\n\nIDA Pro 7.0:\n\n\n\nIDA Pro 7.5:\n\n\n\nIt seems to be a lot of font options are missing from the new version as well.\n\nIDA Pro 7.0 Fonts:\n\n\n\nIDA Pro 7.5 Fonts:\n\n\n\nI don't have a lot of experience with IDA gui. I'd appreciate any help.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI fixed the font problem by installing the desired font. However I still cannot figure out how to import .clr files\n\n",

      "content": "IDA Pro dropped support for the .clr theme format in favour of CSS themes upon the release of the 7.3 update. In order to port older .clr themes to the current format you can use a Python script that Hex-Rays provide here.\n\ne.g.\nport_clr72_to_css.py -i {theme}.clr > {theme}.css\nto produce a CSS formatted theme which can be placed in the relevant directory of your IDA 7.5 install: $IDA_INSTALL/themes/{theme}/{theme}.css.\n\nFurther documentation on the new themes can be found on Hex-Rays site.\n\n",
