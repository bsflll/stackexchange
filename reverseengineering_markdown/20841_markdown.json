  "content": "I would like to decompile a 32-bit Linux executable to C, modify some parts of it, and then compile it back. I do not care if the C code is not pretty and really hard to maintain. The only thing I care is to be able to compile it back to a 32-bit executable.\n\nThe program was written in C++ around 2006, but the source code was lost since then. It is not a small program, and it uses some dynamically linked libraries as well.\n\nI tried Boomerang and Avast RetDec. None of them is able to provide a compilable result, but the one RetDec provides, is sometimes surprisingly readable. Unfortunately, I can not use this output to rewrite the project, because the code is really long. That is why I am looking for a way to produce compilable C code in the first place.\n\n",
