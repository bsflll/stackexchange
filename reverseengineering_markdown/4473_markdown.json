  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/4473/ida-doesnt-understand-0-0f-0x80000000",
  "content": "I'm relatively new to IDA. Recently I was disassembling an ARM binary that contains some signal processing routines. One of the data tables used by the routine is an array of floats, and one of those floats is -0.0 (encoded as 0x80000000). When I try to get IDA to convert this into a float, it refuses and just yields \"DB 0,0,0,0x80\". \n\nThe problem is that this single \"invalid\" entry is making it impossible for me to convert the region into an array. Instead I have to split the array into two halves, which is awkward. \n\nIs this a known issue? Can I force an array to be created even if some of the elements are invalid?\n\n",

Given the value is -0, Guntram's suggest of just turning it to zero makes the most sense to manage the \"issue\"\n\nTested with Version 6.6.140605 (32-bit)\n\n",
