  "content": "I think that this is a basic need of every reverser so this question may have been asked in other places but really, I'm unable to find an answer. Maybe I'm asking the wrong question.\n\nSo, supposing I have a DLL that change base VA among different execution because of ASLR, in windows I can set DLLCharacteristic to make sure is loaded every time at the same address (losing eventually the signature). But what for generic code?\n\nSuppose that a program allocate a buffer, copy some data, decrypt it then run it. In IDA, of course I can take a snapshot of memory, analyze it, put label and so on, but if I run the program the second time chances are the address are changed, so I can't benefit of my previous analysis.\n\nIs there a way map an arbiratry address with a previous analyzed section in the database?\n\n",
