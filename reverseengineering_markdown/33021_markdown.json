  "content": "The icon is already displayed in Tray. So maybe to block appearing the window only for launch. Or some nicer approach like switching launch parameters in exe (not available in the program settings).\n\nPlease help.\n\nI am interested in reverse engineering, maybe in system ways in Windows (it looks like no working ways, that is why I ask about reverse), but not in programs to do this.\n\n",

I am sorry but I can not provide a tutorial here, building something like this requires multiple hours. Therefore I would recommend to you to start from the other side, create a small C/C++ program that opens a window including task bar item. Then open it in Ghidra /or what else you use for reversing) and search for the relevant calls and learn to modify it.",
