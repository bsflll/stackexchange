  "content": "In PIN's documentation it says this about PIN_SafeCopy:\n\nI'm trying to get the stack base of the current thread. Normally I would get it like this (if going directly through FS): mov eax, FS:[0x04]. Since I'm getting the old stack, and not the \"new\" one maintained by PIN (if I compare the REG_ESP from PIN with the current ESP they show different stacks) I tried to first get the linear address of the TEB with mov eax, FS:[0x18] and then use PIN_SafeCopy to read from this address + 0x04. However I only get 0x00000000. Any idea how I can do this? Also I suppose this makes it risky to use the Win API if it reads from such stale sources of data?\n\n",
