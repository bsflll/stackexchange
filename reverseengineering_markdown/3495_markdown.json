  "content": "I have a file composed entirely of data structures; I've been trying to find a tool that will enable me to open this file, and declare (perhaps) a type and offset such that i may work with the presumed primitive data type individually.\n\ne.g. I declare the 4 bytes located at offset 0x04 to be a 32-bit unsigned integer, and would like to inspect the value at this location (read as big-endian perhaps) and then work with this integer individually (perhaps see what it looks like encoded as a 4-byte ascii string and attempt to read it, etc.)\n\nI have a 4096 byte file containing C-structs with member elements as integers ranging from 16-64 bits in length; the following is an example:\n\n```\nstruct my_struct {\nuint_32 magic\n} // sizeof(my_struct) == 0x04\n\n```\nIn this case, magic = 'ball', and so when the file is opened in a text editor it reads as 'llab...', and obviously can also be represented as a 32-bit integer\n\nIs there a tool that enables static analysis of flat data structure files?\n\nI've considered writing a command line tool in Python to do this, but if something already exists I'd prefer to save time, and perhaps learn more about this topic by using a tool designed by someone more experienced. If it seems to you that I am going about this incorrectly (this is my first serious exploration into this kind of reversing) please guide my understanding, thanks.\n\nGoogled 'reverse engineering tools' and browsed the links\n\nChecked wikipedia's reverse engineering pages\n\nTried some first principles reasoning\n\nChecked pypi\n\nThere are three completely valid and correct answers, but I've marked the most detailed and least expensive of them as correct, because it is the most accessible to members of the community reviewing this question.\n\n",

If that's not enough, it has scripting capabilities in Python and Lua.\n\nThe values can then be edited nicely (e.g. in decimal instead of hex). The hex area can be highlighted.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nAt the time of writing it seems to have issues with more than one open grammar + one open file. When opening a second file for the same grammar, it crashed. Save early and save often.\n\nScreenshot of a partially analyzed file:\n\n\n\n",
