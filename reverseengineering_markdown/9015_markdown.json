  "content": "Did anyone take infosec institute's reverse engineering course? I'd like to know if it's worth my money, I didn't find feedback about the course on the web. Thank you.\n\nFor the people downvoting my post...why is that? Because of the tags? Using a tag is mandatory and I couldn't post with more appropriate tags like \"institute\" or \"company\" or something like that. The question is pertinent because it's about an institute that teaches reverse engineering. So I really don't get why the downvotes...don't you want to know how good a R$2000 reverse engineering course is before taking it??\n\n",
