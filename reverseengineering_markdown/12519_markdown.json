  "content": "I was wondering if there's a way to insert native win32 controls(button, static, etc.) into a MFC application during runtime. I was abled to embed my dll but everytime I create a new control via CreateWindowEx it is being shown as a white box for a split second and removed instantly. Here's how I'm creating the window:\n\n```\nHWND newButton = CreateWindowEx(NULL, \"BUTTON\", \"New button\", WS_VISIBLE | WS_CHILD, 100, 100, 150, 200, mainWnd, NULL, 0, 0);\n\n```\n",
