  "content": "I'm using NEPacketFilterProvider, which intercept all outgoing/incoming packets from all interfaces and protocols. on packet event I get callback to PacketHandler which has the following signature :\n\n```\npublic typealias NEFilterPacketHandler = (NEFilterPacketContext, nw_interface_t, NETrafficDirection, UnsafeRawPointer, Int) -> NEFilterPacketProvider.Verdict\n\n```\nI'm particularly interested in the NEFilterPacketContext object which is currently opaque and has no documentation. I was wondering if this object can provide me insights about the packet's source app (either PID or procname)\n\nIs it possible to extract this info from the object NEFilterPacketContext ?\n\nThanks\n\n",
