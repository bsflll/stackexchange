  "content": "I'm reverse engineering an application which commonly adds 4.294967296e9 to a double if the number is negative. Part of the disassembly:\n\n```\nmov     eax, label_to_memory\nfild    label_to_memory\ntest    eax, eax\njge     short some_label\nfadd    ds:some_double_value\nsome_label:\n\n```\nIf I'm correct, it takes the jump if the highest bit isn't set, i.e. its a positive number. some_double_value points to the constant 4.294967296e9.\n\nTo understand what the piece of code is doing I need to know why it adds this specific number, the only piece of Information I found was a line of code in http://web.mit.edu/~mkgray/afs/bar/afs/net/project/attic/quipu/isode-8.0/others/ntp/ntpsubs.c which says \n\n```\n#ifdef  VAX_COMPILER_FLT_BUG\n    if (b < 0.0) b += 4.294967296e9;\n#endif\n\n```\nSo, what is the significance of that number?\n\nAdditional Info: The number can not be negative, so this can actually never happen.\n\n",

      "content": "I actually found the answer while writing this question!\n\nThis number is exactly UINT_MAX + 1, stored as a double. So it seems this code converts a unsigned integer to a double. The fild instruction loads the 32 bit value as signed value, after adding the max possible unsigned value + 1, the double contains the same value as the unsigned integer.\n\nSo the compiler produced this probably automatically from something like this:\n\n```\nunsigned int num; // some arbitrary 32 bit unsigned number\ndouble d = num;\n\n```\nSince it took me some time to figure it out, I thought it may help someone else find the solution faster than me.\n\n",
