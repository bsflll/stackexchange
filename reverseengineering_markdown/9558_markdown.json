This seems like your binary has been compiled with optimization on (which could put some variables into registers, without gdb knowing, and relying on the (wrong) stack value). Try to compile/link php with -O0 and -g. Also, unless you cut some parts of the backtrace, your stack is probably broken, as execute_ex seems to have been called out of thin air. This broken stack may be the reason for all sorts of unexpected behaviour.",

      "text": "Well, some things seem a bit fishy to me: the instructions tell you to move the frame to the last execute call, while you only have execute_ex; if executor_globals is indeed a global variable, the stack frame shouldn't matter, but if it's local, you shouldn't find it in the zif_sleep frame. I wonder how up-to-date the site is you linked to. But as the value of executor_globals is wrong, and your PHP site says \"Important! To get a backtrace with correct information you must have PHP configured with --enable-debug! \", I think you need to recompile.",
