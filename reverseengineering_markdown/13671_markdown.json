  "content": "I have an (ARM) object file that I want to inspect. There are some instructions that load addresses pointing to another area in the object file. I would like to see the contents of the area, but objdump -Ds shows ... and skips the whole section. For example:\n\n```\n000230cc <heap_size_129>:\n   230cc:       00000000        andeq   r0, r0, r0\n\n000230d0 <small_integers>:\n        ...\n\n000231d8 <heap_size_33>:\n   231d8:       00000000        andeq   r0, r0, r0\n\n```\nHere, I need the contents of small_integers. Does ... mean it is full of andeq r0,r0,r0 (i.e., null)?\n\nI cannot find other flags beside -Ds in the objdump manpage that may help here.\n\n",
