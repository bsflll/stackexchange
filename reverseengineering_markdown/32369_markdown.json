  "content": "I'm dealing with a reverse engineering challenge involving a binary application that was statically compiled with a legacy library. While the legacy library is not vulnerable, it lacks certain features that would significantly improve the functionality of the binary. Importantly, I have access to the open-source code of this library.\n\nMy goal is to enhance the binary by incorporating these missing features from the new version of the library. Specifically, I want to:\n\nIs this feasible, and if so, what are the general steps or techniques involved in achieving this task? Have you ever heard about something like that?\n\nAny advice or insights would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

Naturally, you will need to find first where the library is inside the binary. You can diff with Diaphora a version of your open source library against your target and import the symbols you need.\n\nHope it helps.\n\n",
