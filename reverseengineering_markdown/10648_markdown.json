Been trying step such as in http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2050393&nocache=1 but can't get android_server to launch.\n\n",

      "content": "You cannot debug native code with those emulators as they aren't arm based. The emulator from google will however work. \n\nFor example BlueStacks uses a proprietary technology called LayerCake which allows apps to run at near native speeds. This is possible since LayerCake \"converts\" ARM to x86 and this is the reason for its speed.\n\n",
