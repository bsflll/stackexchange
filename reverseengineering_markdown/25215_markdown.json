      "content": "Yes, you can do that. Once you set the hardware breakpoint you can go to Breakpoints tab, right click the breakpoint on which you want to set condition, and select Edit. Now you can set the break condition.\n\nLet's say your value is written to the memory in such way mov dword ptr ds:[edx],eax, so you can set the Break condition to EAX==2F, and then the program will be interrupted only when the value to write is equal to 2F.\n\n",
