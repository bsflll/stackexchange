  "content": "This question includes a good list of sources where an individual might collect malware samples for analysis.\n\nI'd like to get a large number of public, non-malicious programs for the purpose of comparing various attributes to malware samples. \n\nI have explored the following options:\n\nI suppose what would be ideal for my situation is a sort of program dump, but I'm not aware of any that exist.\n\nAs someone unaffiliated with any organisation, is there an effective way of getting a large number of public normal programs for the purpose of comparing their features to a set of malicious programs?\n\n",
