      "content": "The way IDA displays variables at the top of a function definition is by their offset from the stack base (ebp, rbp) at the function's beginning. \n\nUnless there's something strange going on, negative offsets mean the function itself allocated stack space for local variables (or, depending on compiler and calling convention for argument passing as well). \n\nWhen stack space is allocated by subtracting the stack pointer (esp, rsp), whether the stack base register is used or not, the base stack does not change. Therefore, memory below the stack base register becomes available. When the stack base register is unused, IDA will still display the stack offset relative to the stack base, by explicitly splitting the stack base offset (from the current stack position) and the variable offset from the stack base.\n\nFor example, take a look at the following function prelog:\n\n```\nvar_448= qword ptr -448h\nvar_438= word ptr -438h\nvar_436= byte ptr -436h\nvar_434= byte ptr -434h\nvar_38= qword ptr -38h\nvar_28= qword ptr -28h\narg_0= qword ptr  8\narg_10= qword ptr  18h\n\nmov     r11, rsp\npush    rbp\npush    rsi\npush    r14\npush    r15\nsub     rsp, 448h\nmov     rax, cs:__security_cookie\nxor     rax, rsp\nmov     [rsp+468h+var_38], rax\n\n```\nYou can see var_38 is at offset -38 from the stack base, but because rsp is used to access var_38, IDA displays the 468h+var_38 instead of the immediate offset used. That's done to show the variable being accessed regardless of the current stack position.\n\nThe adding rsp and 468h gives us the stack base as a computation using the current stack pointer and the stack delta from the function's start. That's how the compiler avoids using the stack base register, by computing it from the stack register and delta. \n\n",
