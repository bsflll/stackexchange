I am not asking for full answer, just a kick in the right direction (the first 2 or 3 recipe(s)).\n\nThe solved challenge message comes in the form of:\n\n```\nCongratulations, you have completed CyberChef challenge #21!\n\nThe code for this challenge is UUID.\n\nThe next challenge can be found at https://pastebin.com/LINKCODE\n\n```\n",
