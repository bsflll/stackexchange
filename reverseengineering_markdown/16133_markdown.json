  "content": "I'm trying to make some changes to .Net dll (note: dll is mixed mode module) used by an exe, ProtectionID detected nothing, so I happily jumped into dnSpy and made changes. \n\nI ran executable with dnSpy debugger and everything was working as expected. However when I saved module and tried to run executable, it worked as if no changes were made. \n\nI double checked, but module saved correctly, and x64dbg shows that it is loaded on runtime. So how is this possible?\n\n",
