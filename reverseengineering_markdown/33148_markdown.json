  "content": "I have a proprietary ELF binary that I am trying to run. It is dynamically linked, but only against the normal libc stuff:\n\n```\n$ file binary\nbinary: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=e02a29757b79db68a7bd41a731c6eb7d3e2a0382, with debug_info, not stripped\n$ ldd binary\n    linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007f5556bc1000)\n    libpthread.so.0 => /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f5556b7f000)\n    libm.so.6 => /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007f5556a9e000)\n    libdl.so.2 => /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f5556a99000)\n    librt.so.1 => /lib64/librt.so.1 (0x00007f5556a94000)\n    libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f55568b2000)\n    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f5556bc3000)\n\n```\nThe part I care about is the SDL2 library, which has been statically linked in:\n\n```\n$ nm binary | grep SDL\n...\n0000000000482610 T SDL_VideoInit\n0000000000478110 t SDL_VideoInit_DEFAULT\n00000000004b61a0 T SDL_VideoInit_REAL\n0000000000482620 T SDL_VideoQuit\n000000000047d400 t SDL_VideoQuit_DEFAULT\n00000000004b5f80 T SDL_VideoQuit_REAL\n0000000000480de0 T SDL_WaitEvent\n0000000000480df0 T SDL_WaitEventTimeout\n000000000047bab0 t SDL_WaitEventTimeout_DEFAULT\n00000000004845e0 T SDL_WaitEventTimeout_REAL\n000000000047bae0 t SDL_WaitEvent_DEFAULT\n00000000004842f0 T SDL_WaitEvent_REAL\n00000000004824d0 T SDL_WaitThread\n00000000004782a0 t SDL_WaitThread_DEFAULT\n00000000004a6760 T SDL_WaitThread_REAL\n...\n\n```\n(SDL is LGPL, so AFAIK it should not be statically linked, but it has been.) Actually SDL2 is no longer LGPL.\n\nIn order to get this to run on my system I want to replace the SDL library that was statically linked. The binary is not stripped, and the debug symbols are clearly in place, so I have some hope that this is possible.\n\nIs there some tool that I can use to remove these symbols and replace them with a dynamic reference to an SDL .so file?\n\nI know that there is no guarantee of success (for instance some functions may have been inlined), but is there a reasonable way to try?\n\nbonus question: Why are the symbols duplicated with _REAL and _DEFUALT suffixes? I thought those were for versioning with .so files. What would they be doing when statically linked?\n\n",

What I would do myself is the following:\n\nWhile I am sure you can get it to work, consider it's not guaranteed it will without a hard to measure amount of work. Not only because some functions might be in-lined, but because you might also have the problem of global variables being used outside of the SDL_XXX() functions.\n\nIn the case of some functions being in-lined, you would need to patch these calls to forward to your new functions (finding which registers or memory positions contain whatever is required for the appropriate call), or cross your fingers and hope the function versions are still compatible (my experience says that in so many cases they are).\n\nHope it helps.\n\n",
