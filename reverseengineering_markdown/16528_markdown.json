  "content": "I'm trying to bypass the license validation process of a very old program called COSIMIR. It uses a USB dongle (which we have) however I don't have access to it, because it belongs to my university. \n\nAnd there is a student version of COSIMIR, the problem is that it isn't compatible with anything we do in the other one, so I copied every file of the Industrial version into my lap and got the installation fixed with olly (because many things where missing). I had to do this because the person who installed this software (and therefore the one with the installer) doesn't work there anymore.\n\nAfter fixing it up, and being able to execute it from start to end I finally got into the activation failure screen, the problem is, I don't know where to start. I mean, which .dll is used to initialize the dongle? My plan was to avoid its init, and see if I can jump my way though without creating an exception, is my first crack with a dongle, so I don't know if it's the right way to go. Also this is the screen I get popped into:\n\n\n\nHowever, after seeing it, I started wondering if it would be easier to try to bypass one of the other 2 methods, by the way I'm like 80% sure it just uses the dongle for the license.\nAlso, I'm almost sure it uses a Marx Dongle, since the one we have attached in the back of the computer we have licensed looks exactly like this one:\n\n\n\nHowever the one the installation guide of COSIMIR indicates, looks completely different.\nAlso, even though I cannot detach that dongle (because it is secured to the PC mainly because somehow the PC will stop working is we disconnect it, I still can do some fast debugging commands in there lie a run trace or stuff like that.\n\nTo keep things short, my main question is: Which library should I put my breakpoint on if I want to avoid the USB access? my main suspects are:\n\nand my secondary suspects are\n\nAlso, I'm going to try to reach the Company by mail as Nordwald suggests, but even if I get a positive response, I would enjoy the help, for learning purposes.\n\n",

      "content": "Reverse Engineering has always been about finding the right place to start. There are two common options here:\n\nPrevent activation checks\n\nFor activation purposes, its most likely the best way to search for references to a string related to activation. In this particular case, I would use a decent decompiler like BinaryNinja, IDA or radare2 to find references to\n\nThis will most likely lead you to the place this window is initialized. Go back from there looking at the conditions checked before invoking the window creation.\n\nMake activation succeed, when it fails\n\nThis one is a little bit more tricky, because most likely you will have to patch at serveral places. Try to run any kind of activation, wait until you get an error message (e.g. 'no activation dongle attacked'), find references to this string and start going backwards from there. Most likely you will find a check if the USB dongle is attached. Patch it and continue from there. Could be pretty tedious.\n\nalso:\n\nYou can always try to contact the company:\n\nKind regards\n\n",
