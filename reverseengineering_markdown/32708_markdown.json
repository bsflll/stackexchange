This particular example is with API Monitor, but I'm almost positive I've seen it through hexdumps of Windows or DOS executables.\n\n\n\n\nMy first thought might be Unicode or some other sort of wide character standard. But Unicode formats (especially Uni16) are variable width.\n\n",

Unicode is supposed to be a universal character set with encodings and previously Windows used UCS-2 (each code point encoded by exactly one 16-bit code unit) and now uses UTF-16 (usually Little Endian, due to supported machines) since XP. UTF-16 has limitations and IIRC is not capable of expressing every possible code point Unicode has to offer these days. As pointed out UTF-16 knows surrogates and is thus indeed variable-length for each code point. However, because the string only contains ASCII each code point is 16-bit only.",

      "text": "Welcome to RE.SE, Katastic Voyage: despite some lacking details, Robert is right. This is UTF-16 if encountered on Windows XP or newer or UCS-2 on older Windows versions. The main issue with the comment is that wchar_t (= 16-bit type when targeting Windows, 32-bit on every other target platform I know) is merely the code unit. Code units are the machine-level \"cells\" into which the code points for Unicode-defined characters are encoded. In UTF-8 the code unit is usually char, in UTF-16 (on Windows) wchar_t on other systems UTF-32 wchar_t. Due to this, ...",

These are then called surrogates. Reserved code points exist to \"announce\" these surrogates within a Unicode-encoded (whichever encoding!) string.

Yes, it has limitations compared to UTF-8 and UTF-32, but it is very much a Unicode encoding. UTF-16 has been used by Windows since XP (AFAIK) and previously UCS-2 was used, which can be considered sort of a predecessor to UTF-16. UCS-2 only ever considered the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) and thus limited itself to the notion of 1 wchar_t (16 bit) == 1 code point. Where the \\0 is depends on Endianess.",

My main point was, however, that wchar_t is just the code unit and UTF-16 (since XP) does provide means to encode code points beyond a value range of 0..65535 through surrogates. So on modern Windows \"characters\" (code points) beyond the value 65535 are possible by encoding them via surrogate mechanism.",
