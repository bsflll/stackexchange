      "content": "Have you noted the term battlezone2.exe +  before the address? That denotes the (usually random) base address of the executable.\n\nIn IDA this base address is a fixed value e.g. 0x400000. Scroll to the beginning of the IDA View and check the Imagebase value (hexadecimal). This value you have to add to every address shown in the Cheat engine.\n\nIf debugging a process directly with IDA the database is automatically relocated to the correct address so you don't have to do the math yourself.\n\nNote: If I interpret the screen shots correctly 0x119EDD (0x519EDD) is the target address of the conditional jump command. Jump commands are used inside a sub, hence you don't leave the current sub and won't find this address in the sub list\n\n",
