  "content": "I have added support for type info handling in my IDA processor, and now in the use_regarg_type3 event, I am mapping a parameter that I know is an enum. But, I am unsure how to set an imm operand to be enum, as you would if you pressed m key and selected the type manually.\n\nSo, my question is what function do I call to set the op to be an enum, and how do I get any needed arguments for said function from the tinfo_t I have.\n\nThere is an op_enum function, but it wants enum_t and from the tinfo_t via type.get_enum_base_type() I get type_t.\n\nI have it working using\n\n```\nqstring tname;\ntype.get_type_name(&tname);\nenum_t enumt = get_enum(tname.c_str());\nop_enum(cmd.ea, x.n, enumt, 0);\n\n```\nBut, it feels wrong to have to go via a string, and a little fragile. So, now the questions is: is there a better/safer way to achieve this ?\n\n",
