  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/24668/getting-the-functions-original-file-name-within-ghidra",
  "content": "I am trying to extract the original file name of some functions through Ghidra. In particular I have enabled the debug symbols so that it does contains the function names in the disassembly listing and want to get the actual file names (header file or source file) of function. For example let's say we have a function named HAL_UART_Transmit. I want to identify the exact file name or the location (path) that this function belongs in the source. Can I do this from the Ghidra IDE itself, or I there a way to get this from a script? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\n",
