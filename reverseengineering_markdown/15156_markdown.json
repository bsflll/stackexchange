      "content": "What may be confusing you is the fact that memory on x86 processors uses little-endian layout. The four bytes 31 32 31 32, when interpreted as a 4-byte integer (dword), become 0x32313231. If we perform xor operation  on it:\n\n```\n0x32313231^0x1234567=0x33127756\n\n```\nAnd putting  0x33127756 back into little-endian memory order we get:\n\n```\n56 77 12 33\n\n```\n",

      "content": "The command you refer to is a good example for CISC architectures:\n\n```\nXOR DWORD PTR DS:[ECX+EAX],1234567\n\n```\nThis first add the values of ECX and EAX, then interprets the sum as a memory address and xors the value at that location with 1234567\n\nAlso, please note that the EAX register is always 4-byte sized. For less bytes, you may use ax, al or ah and for higher (8-byte) values you may use RAX (on 64 bit systems). Please note these names are referring to sections of the same register.\n\n",
