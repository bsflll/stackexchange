  "content": "I'm new to programming and recently studying an ancient DOS assembly program written for 80186 and assembled with MASM. There are some .obj files that I want to open and take a look. I tried obj2asm.exe and IDA 5.0 (freeware version), but both programs could not deliver accurate results. As far as I know those .obj files are just lists of data indexes in format similar to below:\n\nIG  SEGMENT PUBLIC  'ROM'\nPUBLIC  INDEX1\n\nINDEX1      DB  000H,000H   ; A\nDB  021H,000H   ; B\nDB  06FH,020H   ; C\n......\n......\n\nThere are no assembly instruction in the .obj files.\nWhat should I do in order to accurately diassemble those .obj files? This DOS program is very important to my study and I'm desperate to get the correct files. Could anyone please give me some advice? Your kind assistance is very much appreciated! Thank you in advance!\n\n",
