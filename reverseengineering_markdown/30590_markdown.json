  "content": "I'm currently debugging a .net application by using dnSpy. There is a function where I have call like this\n\n```\n<Module>.X.Y.Z.Initialize(ptr, ptr2, flag);\n\n```\nThe function belongs to a DLL and appearently is a C(++) function call as I could find this by going to the module:\n\n```\n[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.Unmanaged | MethodImplOptions.PreserveSig)]\ninternal unsafe static extern void Initialize(byte*, byte*, [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.U1)] bool);\n\n```\nSo my question is how can I analyze this function (Initialize)? Logically dnSpy is skipping it and IDAPro doesn't help me further since the DLL itself is a .net so I can't start a debugging session within IDA.\n\nI've tried to create a Debug Time Travel Trace with WinDBG but it throws me an error when I'm ending the session and can't open the trace anymore.\n\nAre there any suggestions how I can figure out or debug this function Initialize is doing?\n\n",
