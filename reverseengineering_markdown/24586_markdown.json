  "content": "I'm new to reverse engineering.\n\nI only want to add an app to my sat receiver.\n\nTo start I tried to extract my firmware with ./extract-firmware, it's ok, and I have 1 ecos RTOS, and two cramfs in fmk/\n\nBUT when I rebuild without any change, I have a message\n\n```\nBuilding new cramfs file system... (this may take several minutes!)\nDirectory data: 464 bytes\nEverything: 1392 kilobytes\nSuper block: 76 bytes\nCRC: b79c2a52\nRemaining free bytes in firmware image: 856064\nProcessing 0 header(s) from /home/thehou/firmware-mod-kit/fmk/new-firmware.bin...\nCRC update failed.\n\nFirmware header not supported; firmware checksums may be incorrect.\nNew firmware image has been saved to: /home/thehou/firmware-mod-kit/fmk/new-firmware.bin`\n\n```\nSo before I continue to add an app into my sat receiver, I want to know how can I rebuild my extracted firmware.\n\nPerhaps must I extract with binwalk, but I don't know how to rebuild!\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nReference : this is the receiver firmware\n\n",
