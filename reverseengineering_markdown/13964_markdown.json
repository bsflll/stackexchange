I'm honestly not sure if it's in the demo version of IDA. The difference between those two loops is whether the chunk is evaluated first, so if you can isolate the while code you can just see whether it checks a condition before or after executing the body (probably. Optimizations can do very dirty stuff).",

We get the extra Jump Not Equal instruction because we need to check if the condition of the while expression has been met after the statements in the do block have been executed.\n\nThis was a helpful resource on Stack Overflow: while(true) / while(1) vs. for(;;)\n\nAs Igor Skochinsky mentions in the comments, compiling each program with optimizations (-O3) will give you the exact same assembly.  While this exercise was done on tiny programs with no optimizations, in reality, both loops accomplish the same thing and (depending on the compiler) would probably generate the same assembly.  In reality, it is very difficult (if not impossible) to differentiate between a loop which uses while(1) and do { } while(1), because they both do the same thing.\n\n",
