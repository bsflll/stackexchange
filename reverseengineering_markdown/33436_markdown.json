  "content": "A while ago I created a Discord nuker tool using Python. Later, I converted it into an EXE file (for personal use only), and unfortunately I lost the original .py source files.\n\nNow I need to recover the internal logic/scripts inside the EXE ‚Äî even partial recovery would help.\n\nIt was likely packed or obfuscated, and may not have been built with PyInstaller (I can't unpack it using pyinstxtractor).\n\nI'm the original author of this tool, and I can confirm that the EXE was generated from a Python script.\n\nCan anyone suggest a method or tool that could help me unpack or reverse engineer it?\n\nThank you very much üôè\n\n",
