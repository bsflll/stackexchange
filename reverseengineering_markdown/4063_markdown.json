  "content": "I wrote an idaplugin with idapython, but it has some function that only works after IDA is done parsing the input file and displays the disassembly window. So, is there a way to automatically run a plugin after IDA has finished parsing? \n\nP/S: I tried using IDBHooks but everytime I hook in IDA crashes, therefore I want to find another way without hooks.\n\n",

It will wait/pause until IDA is completed with its analysis. Once the analysis is completed it will return control/execution back to the script. You might need to call it at the beginning of your function rather than beginning of the script.",
