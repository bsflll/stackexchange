  "content": "I'm trying to analyze a GCC static library which is a part of a commercial software.\n\nFirst, I used IDA Pro to analyze entire Lib file, but it could find only object files and was unable to disassemble objects.\n\nSo, I extracted all of the inside objects by ar -x. Next, I used binwalk, It shows multiple Zlib Compressed regions next to the 64-bytes header (EFI x64). Is this ordinary in static libraries (existence of several zlib region)? Is it a protection method?\n\nAnyway, I used zlib-flate -uncompress to extract sections in one of the objects after separating its zlib regions (by dd), and used IDA Pro to disassemble the output. Although, some of the sections contain some valid strings (Unix Path), IDA Pro shows invalid codes.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",

I tried readelf -e file.obj. it shows each Zlib-Compressed region is an elf section which has been determined in the sections header (Because offsets of sections are equal to offsets of binwalk zlib regions). Their name is like a function's name. A weird point is that all main sections (e.g. .text, .data,...) are zero-sized.",
