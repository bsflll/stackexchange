Overall the range of utilities to manipulate PE executables is quite limited in comparison to more universal and open executable like ELF. I would be more interested in the disassembled assembly since even remotely acceptable C code will not be possible since allot of \"user\" executables have obfuscated symbols. I haven't used a windows environment in ages, but when I did for disassembly functions I used the Boomerang decompiler which is open source and free http://boomerang.sourceforge.net/\n\n",
