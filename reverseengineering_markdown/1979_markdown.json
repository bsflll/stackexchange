      "content": "This is doable in WinDbg, but the syntax isn't the greatest. The other answers are probably better if you're just looking to get a result quickly. That said, here's how you'd do it.\n\nRegOpenKeyExW is an stdcall function, and it looks like you're on a 32-bit version of Windows, so when you enter the function the first argument will be at ESP+4, the second at ESP+8, etc. The signature for it is:\n\n```\nLONG WINAPI RegOpenKeyEx(\n  _In_        HKEY hKey,\n  _In_opt_    LPCTSTR lpSubKey,\n  _Reserved_  DWORD ulOptions,\n  _In_        REGSAM samDesired,\n  _Out_       PHKEY phkResult\n);\n\n```\nSo at ESP+8 you'll find a pointer to a null-terminated Unicode string (lpSubKey). You can test this out by setting an unconditional breakpoint on RegOpenKeyExW and then using du poi(esp+8) to print the string.\n\nTo do the next piece – stopping when the value of lpSubKey is equal to some pattern, you can check out MSDN's documentation, which contains an example of doing exactly that. I don't have access to a Windows machine at the moment, but the following should do what you want (adapted from the MSDN example):\n\n```\nbp advapi32!RegOpenKeyExW \"$$<c:\\\\commands.txt\"\n\n```\nAnd then create c:\\commands.txt with the following contents:\n\n```\n.if (poi(esp+8) != 0) { as /mu ${/v:SubKey} poi(esp+8) } .else { ad /q ${/v:SubKey} }\n.if ($spat(@\"${SubKey}\", \"Foo*\") == 0)  { gc } .else { .echo SubKey }\n\n```\nYou can replace \"Foo*\" in the above with any valid string wildcard.\n\nBreaking this down, the first .if sets up an alias named SubKey equal to the contents of the unicode string at esp+8. The second line matches that string against the pattern \"Foo*\"; if it doesn't match, then gc is used to continue execution without stopping. If it does match, .echo SubKey prints out the string, and then breaks.\n\n",

I have adjusted it so it'll hook the Unicode version of the function you are interested in hooking.\n\nHowever, the answer may not be spot on, since you can achieve breaking conditionally, but you'll have to add the interactive debugger part to the script.

You could also modify the above to hook only upon entry RegOpenKeyExW instead of upon exit or to do both. Depends on what you want to achieve.\n\nI have used this method to decode buffers (SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT and SCSI_PASS_THROUGH) sent via DeviceIoControl, so the above is by far not the most complex thing you can do.\n\nOn another note, I have also hooked stuff like opening files (or registry keys) and kept lists of the returned handles along with the string form of what they are. This way I could implement quite complex human-readable logging scenarios.\n\nThe reason stuff like the nested dictionary exists is so that it can be easily extended to hook whatever function from whatever DLL I please. Of course it could be hardcoded as well, but I have had scenarios where I was hooking dozens of functions.\n\n",
