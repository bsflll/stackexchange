I only opened the x86-64 counterpart to perform some changes.\n\nWhen I tried to export it, it exported a .bin file that I can't replace with the original Mach-O universal binary. How do I go about exporting the patched x86-64 as one universal binary in Ghidra?\n\nOriginal Binary:\n\n\n\nExported x86-64 Binary:\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "This seems like you are effectively running into the same issue as this question: How to export a working elf binary from Ghidra?\n\nGhidra doesn't export working ELF/PE/Mach-O files when you export something. You have to use an existing proper exporter to get a patched binary. I am not aware of one for Mach-O, especially not Mach-O with multiple architectures, but it might still be possible to write a minimal one for your use case.\n\n",
