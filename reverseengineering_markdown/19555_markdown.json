The startup code that runs before _main() performs the command-line resolution, assigning parameters into the __wargv array, and storing the count in __argc.  The relative addresses are fixed for the file, but the absolute addresses will vary if Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) is in effect.\n\n",
