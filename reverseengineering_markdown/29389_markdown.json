      "content": "Fixed with using EasyHook instead of Detours. I.e. replaced this piece of code:\n\n```\nwriteProtectedMemory(hook.first, hook.second);\nauto result = DetourAttach(hook.first, hook.second);\n\n```\nwith this:\n\n```\nHOOK_TRACE_INFO hHook = { NULL }; // keep track of our hook\nNTSTATUS result = LhInstallHook(\n    hook.first,\n    hook.second,\n    NULL,\n    &hHook);\n\nULONG ACLEntries[1] = { 0 };\nLhSetInclusiveACL(ACLEntries, 1, &hHook);\n\n```\nWhere hook.first = 0x00007ff69f119ea0 {Gladius.exe!gladius::Game::main(int,char * *,char * *)} {0x8b4820ec83485340}    void * *\n\nAnd hook.second = 0x00007ff818f51ef5 {swresample-3.dll!hooks::gamemainHooked(struct gladius::Game *,int,char * *,char * *)}    void *\n\nNow the app correctly jumps to the Hooked function.\n\nP.S. Don't know what is the deal with DetoursAttach() for x64. I have compiled it specifically for that environment.\n\nMay be it doesn't know of how to pass the hook between the threads... Will check that option later.\n\n",
