  "content": "Please bear in mind I am very new to all this - however I have searched and could not easily find an answer to my issue.\n\nI have an elf (actually an Android aboot image based upon LK) that I loaded into IDA Pro. I see Strings, and I wish to find out where these strings are referenced in code.\n\n\n\nI have tried to find cross-references to these strings in the code but there aren't any.\n\nAm I totally naive and missed out something totally obvious to the initiated? Could the strings be referenced by some obtuse run-time calculation of address (to obfuscate references) rather than just straightforward absolute/relative reference (which IDA mostly could work out?)\n\nMany thanks.\n\n",

Here is an example of how strerror() looks up strings:\n\n\n\nShould be pretty straightforward to see that errid is just used to calculate the pointer for a corresponding string in the errmsg table by the strerror() function.  This could be why you are not seeing xrefs for those strings.  Without more information, that's my best guess.  I would try to find the beginning of that list of strings and look for an xref there.\n\n",
