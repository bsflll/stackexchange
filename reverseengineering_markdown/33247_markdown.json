  "content": "Now, obviously I can't just go to 0x00000000046195d3 in the disassembled binary because it wont be a correct offset. Is there any way I can use information from minidump to adjust offset so it matches in IDA too?\n\nP.S. I dont have not dont want to use windbg or x64dbg - every single google result leads to these\n\n",
