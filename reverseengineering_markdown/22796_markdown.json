  "content": "I'm new to reverse enginnering and currently following Lena's tutorials. I wanted to put my new skills to use and wanted to reverse a simple game: https://github.com/Zolomon/labyrinth. \n\nI think I'm stuck somewhere in ntdll. How do I get out of that? It's after the game as been instantiated then everything stops working.\n\nI was hoping I would be stuck in the game loop and from there I was hoping to capture in-game movements. \n\nBelow is a picture where I've put breakpoints right before the game window is created. \n\n\n\n",
