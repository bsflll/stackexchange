  "content": "Programs such as Detect It Easy or IDA can show functions and libraries (DLLs) imported by a binary in the case of C/C++ binaries. I have a collection of .NET malware that I'm analyzing and would like to see the imported functions and DLLs for these binaries. I've noticed that _CorExeMain is the only thing that I can see in the imports section with tools such as IDA for such binaries. I'm aware that I can decompile the .NET binary in a tool like dnSpy and manually read the function calls but I would like an automated and fast of doing this such as the imports section in IDA.\n\nIs there a way to see functions imported from dynamic libraries for .NET binaries?\n\n",
