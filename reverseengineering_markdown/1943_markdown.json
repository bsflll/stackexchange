I just wonder what are the techniques applicable and which can be found in the real world to obfuscate Python program (similar questions can be found on stackoverflow here and here).\n\nmikeazo mentioned the fact that his program was provided with a custom Python interpreter, but what are the other techniques and how efficient are they ?\n\n",

The lack of tools means you need to write your own obfuscator, but that's not too difficult. \n\nBasically, think of anything you would do to reverse engineer a program and transform it to make that harder.\n\nThe main challenges to obfuscation are that it requires understanding of the program and usually hurts performance. The more extreme obfuscations are only applicable in cases where performance doesn't matter and withstanding intense scrutiny is important (i.e. malware).\n\n",

But, beware, it will likely take you a considerable amount of time to complete this type of project.  \n\nIt'll require you to map out how you're going to enclosed the \"passwords/passkeys\" within the obfuscated code in such a way that no one, except you, can get to it.  It'll be preferable if even you cant get to it. \n\nThen, you need to add in some logic that will cause the script to protect itself from inquisitive users who may try to pry it apart.  And equally as important, whatever method you come up with must not add significantly to the execution time of the script.  \n\nThis may sound impossible, but i think its doable.  You just have to be motivated and have enough time on your hands. \n\nOr, if you want a shortcut, you can try pasting a sample unix based python script to this site, and see if you can break their code and unveil your \"hidden\" code.\n\n",
