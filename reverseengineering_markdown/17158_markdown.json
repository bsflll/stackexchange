  "content": "I'm digging into a BLE product based on a CC2541 MCU (similar to the Texas Instruments SensorTag). So for experimenting we can use an official firmware: http://processors.wiki.ti.com/images/1/10/SensorTagFW_1_5.zip\n\nbinwalk does not give any results.\nstrings give some valid information, so the file is ok.\n\nReading the datasheet for CC2541 tells it is a 8051 controller. (?)\n\nSo i tried:\n\n```\nroot@kali:~/bm2# radare2 -a 8051 firmware.bin \nCannot set bits 32 to '8051'\nCannot set bits 32 to '8051'\n -- Use 'e' and 't' in Visual mode to edit configuration and track flags.\n[0x00000000]> aaaa\n[*** invalid %N$ use detected ***th sym. and entry0 (aa)\nAborted\n\n```\nI know there is an open bug about %N$:\nhttps://github.com/radare/radare2/issues/3944 \n\nDo i do it all wrong, or can somebody point me in the right direction? A bit unsure about the MCU settings and bitsize though.\n\n",
