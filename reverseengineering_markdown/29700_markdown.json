  "content": "Introduction to problem: I have a binary executable with an unknown network packet protocol. I want to reverse engineer this packet protocol. My current way of doing it is to send some data and step through the instructions in disassembly to try to figure out what the application is doing with this data, and gradually construct the correct protocol. This solution is extremely inefficient. So I want to automate at least a part of this process.\n\nAssuming that my network receive function is:\nint recv(SOCKET s, char * buf, int len, int flags);\n\nWhat I want to do is to automate instruction tracking for all instructions reading the chunk of memory pointed by char * buf\n\n```\nmov eax, [globalRecvBufferPointer]\nmov dl, [eax]\ncmp dl, 20h\njz somewhere\n\n```\nIn the example above, I want my automated tool to detect mov dl, [eax] and cmp dl, 20h instructions.\nAdding a hardware r/w breakpoint to char * buf lets me detect mov dl, [eax] but not the other.\nAnother problem I can think of at this stage is when memory pointed by char * buf is copied to stack or other memory locations.\n\nAre there ready-made tools for this kind of operation? If not, are there tools where I can implement this idea?\n\n",

Major issue will be handling system calls.  You'll have to set breaks to drop out of unicorn, actually run the call, then poke the results back into the emulated state.  Unicorn has built-in memory access hooks.  As an alternative, I posted complete code to remote-control GDB here (warning, slow!)",
