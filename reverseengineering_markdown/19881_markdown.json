  "content": "How do I save a radare2 session after I did \"aa\"? \n\nI know there is a command for saving a project, but this isn't working out for some reason (Ps PROJECTNAME). So I am looking for a way to save my analysis progress and if possible retain renamed variables.\n\nIt currently doesn't work because if I open it again another time it won't load the renamed variables and I can't do stuff like \"ood\" which is the way to reopen the binary as far as I'm concerned. But there are no errors.\n\nAfter invoking radare2 with r2 -d calc I run aa and then Ps calc_project. After that I close the terminal and open up a new one. Then I start with r2 -d calc again and follow it with Po calc_project. Now, there are many errors which appear to be the same over and over again:\n\n```\nfcn_recurse failed\nCannot add basic block\", that message 50 times or more.\n\n```\nVersion information:\n\n```\nradare2 version: \nradare2 3.1.0-git 20049 @ linux-x86-64 git.3.0.1-214-g5759f21\ncommit: 5759f217c941478ef265bf9a6ba5e23cd646661a\n\n```\n",
