If you know the compiler generating the machine code you are looking at intimately, you may possibly use pattern recognition to figure out which part of the compiler generated each instruction and get more information that way.  In some cases that may be enough.",

That is, the input to the decompiler is object code - not assembly language, which is represented in ASCII - and the output is a high-level language approximation.\n\nNote that assembly language is a human-readable mnemonic representation of object code operation codes (opcodes) and operands.\n\nSince decompilation is a major technical challenge, no Linux utilities have been developed to accomplish decompilation.\n\n",
