  "content": "I've done this in one VM but I can't seem to replicate it in another. I'm using IDA to analyze a 32-bit Windows PE file. I then want to step thru it with a WinDbg debugger from within IDA. \n\nSo when I begin debugging it:\n\n\n\nAnd break on a breakpoint, I want to load symbols, say for cmtcmt32.dll:\n\n\n\nBut instead of loading them it gives me this \"Choose PDB file\" window:\n\n\n\nHow do I set it up to load it from the Microsoft public symbol server?\n\nPS. I tried running the following commands:\n\n```\n.sympath srv*c:symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols\n.reload /f\n\n```\nBut it doesn't do anything. It just shows a bunch of errors:\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It also looks like you are using the 64-bit version of windbg against a 32-bit dump or process, use the 32-bit version of windbg instead (though this is likely unrelated to symbol resolution issues).",
