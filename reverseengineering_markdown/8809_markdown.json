  "content": "i am analyzing a piece of malware in which first the address to \"KiUserExceptionDispatcher\" is obtained(using the Export Name Table, going to Export Ordinal Table and then finally to Export Address Table). Once the address(7773A408) is received, the malware overwrites the first 6 bytes with the following lines :\n\n```\n      (here is the finding part)\n                ...\n   mov BYTE PTR DS:[EDX], 68             -> EDX contains ntdll.KiUserExceptionDispatcher\n   mov DWORD PTR DS:[EDX+1], malware.004035C2\n   mov BYTE PTR DS:[EDX+5], 0C3\n   ....\n\n```\nSo, the hex window at 7773A408 (address of KiUserExceptionDispatcher) changes in the following way:\n\n```\n  7773A408   FC 8B 4C 24 | 04 8B .... (and so on)    <- original\n\n  7773A408   68 C2 35 40 | 00 C3 .....(and so on)    <- after overwriting\n\n```\nSo, what happens then is that the malware reaches a \"UD2\" instruction. I looked it up: it raises an invalid opcode exception. \nThen the malware jumps to \n\n```\n 7773A40D   RETN    \n\n```\nwhich then leads me to:\n\n```\n004035C2  DB 8B     <- clear, because 004035C2 starts at 7773A40D (hex window)\n\n```\nand then finally to another place where a whole new function begins.\nSo, my question would be: Is it right to assume that the malware tries to change exception handler by overwriting it with 004035C2 to redirect the excetion flow? Why is the exception handler of UD2 the first 6 bytes of KiUserExceptionDispatcher? \n\nbest regards,\n\n",

      "content": "The malware overwrites the usermode exception dispatcher (KiUserExceptionDispatcher()) with the following:\n\n```\nPUSH malware.004035C2\nRETN\n\n```\nThe code above is equivalent to JMP malware.004035C2.\n\nNow whenever any usermode exception occurs in the process, the function at malware.004035C2 will be executed instead of (or at least before) the registered SEH functions.\n\nThe malware likely uses this \"trick\" in combination with the UD2 instruction in order to confuse disassemblers, since most disassemblers won't automatically figure out that the UD2 instruction now effectively jumps to malware.004035C2. This type of obfuscation trick is often used to make automated static analysis of code-flow more difficult.\n\n",
