  "content": "I've learned extensively about PE and PE64 format a while back. I am now digging deeper into ELF format. However, I've not found as many thorough resources for ELF as I did for PE, such as ARTeam's PE format compendium and other blogs. I am looking for a comparison of how dependency/symbol resolution, version symbols, and relocations are done in ELF vs. Portable Executable.\n\n",
