  "content": "Looking at a large x86 binary, I'm seeing lots of instances where strings are assembled on the stack as quadwords like so:\n\n\n\nIf I try to set the type of puStack40 to char[38], I get the following output that's still not very helpful:\n\n\n\nI am guessing that this is because each quadword is moved in a separate instruction:\n\n\n\nI assume there isn't, but does anyone know of a way that I can get puStack40 to be displayed as a string in the decompiler window?\n\n(As a side note: why is this approach taken? My only guess would be to decrease the number of memory accesses. I don't think this is obfuscation since it's a large, commercial application)\n\n",
