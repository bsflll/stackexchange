  "content": "Any suggestions how can I track visual changes performed through an win32 process? I have almost no knowledge how they are done. I'm currently debugging an application which uses it's own custom FONT files to drawn letters, however I can only trace the drawing at a very high-level and can't connect it with DirectX API for example. I'm also curios if it is possible to use the VS new Graphics Debugger to attach into a running process.\n\nAny clues about how to achieve this? I have no source code of the target application and I'm using IDA Pro + API Monitor.\n\nI'm especially interested in drawing letters.\n\n",
