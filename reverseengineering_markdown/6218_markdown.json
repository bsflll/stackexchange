So if you really really want an example in C, it would look something like\n\n```\nSTARTUPINFO p;\np=(STARTUPINFO *) ((char *) esp+0x14);   // this assumes the structure starts \n                                         // at offset 0x14 from esp\nif (p->wShowWindow & 1) {                // access the wShowWindow component at offset\n                                         // 0x30 in the structure, which is 0x44 from esp\n    ....\n}\n\n```\nNote i didn't include the SomeCode, as the \"jump there\" might just mean \"skip some instructions\", and your unconditional jump seems to be wrong anyways.\n\nPlease, when posting a question next time, be a bit more precise in what you ask and what you copy/paste.\n\n",
