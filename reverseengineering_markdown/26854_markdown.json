  "content": "While going through the app analysis i found that when i use logcat it shows me encrypted data ..now the app is obfuscated ... When i use burp suite with my android emulator it was making a POST request to a method of an api in form of JSON Array (Encrypted)...is there any way that i can decrypt this text or find decryption key?\n\nAlso i have found that after deobfuscating i found a method named as void decode() but it doesnt reveal any information..so is there is anyway to use this method explicitly?\n\n",
