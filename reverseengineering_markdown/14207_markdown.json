Flags can be grouped into ‘flag spaces’. \n\nAs suggested, \"fs\" command displays:\n\n```\n[0x180005218]> fs\n0  247 * strings\n1    5 * symbols\n2    8 * sections\n3    0 * segments\n4   79 * relocs\n5   79 * imports\n6    2 * resources\n7  104 * functions\n\n```\nMore information about flags and flagspaces here:\nRadare2, basic commands, flags\n\n",
