      "content": "The dashed line is added by IDA to denote code flow boundaries. For example, you can see another one after the unconditional jmp, and there should be one after each retn instruction. In graph view they correspond to the end of function graph nodes.\n\nThe most probable cause for the one after call is that the called function has been detected as non-returning.\n\nYou can go inside the call and see if \"Attributes: noreturn\" is printed in the function header. If the function does, in fact, return, you can clear the flag by editing the function properties (Alt-P).\n\n",
