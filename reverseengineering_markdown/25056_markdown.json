      "content": "Kevin,\n\nAs I answered on your last question:\n\nopen ghidra gui, analyse the binary, click on file -> export program -> and export as a C/C++ file.\n\nIn this file, ghidra constructs possible typedefs for you.\n\nFor e.g. typedef unsigned char    undefined1;\n\nSo, you'll know the possible type of this object. In your particular case, it constructs (assuming a stripped binary):\n\ntypedef unsigned long    undefined8;\n\nBut, note that these types are just estimates and could be different than the original source code (in case of user defined functions).\n\n",
