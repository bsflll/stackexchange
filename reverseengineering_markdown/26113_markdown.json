The _off name might have its origin in the segmented addressing introduced by Intel many years ago in their 16-bit times (segment:offset), today being rather obsolete because of the flat memory model also being used in the Intel world. BTW, just discovered that your question is a duplicate of this one stackoverflow.com/questions/50908226/â€¦, offering a more detailed explanation.",
