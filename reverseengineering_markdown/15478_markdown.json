  "content": "I'm new with reverse engineering and especially with Ollydbg, I have little experience with IDA and currently trying to get used to Olly. My questions are: 1.Is there any window which would show function list like in IDA? To be more spesific here is what I'm talking about. How to bring such window in Olly?\n2. During investigation if I jump into some function(static analysis) how to get back? I mean is there anything that has same functionality as \nthese keys do?\nSorry if questions sound silly I'm new with this stuff. thanks :)\n\n",
