  "content": "I'm trying to emulate a TP-Link WR740N in Qemu (MIPS). I have extracted the rootfs.img from the firmware, and downloaded vmlinux-2.6.32-5-4kc-malta from here: http://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/mips/.\n\nThen, I started Qemu with these parameters:\n\n```\nqemu-system-mips -M malta -kernel 'vmlinux-2.6.32-5-4kc-malta' -hda 'rootfs.img' -append \"root=/dev/sda1 console=tty0\" -nographic\n\n```\nAnd it got stuck on:\n\n```\n[0.000000] console [tty0] enabled, bootconsole disabled\n\n```\nI've also tried to run it like this:\n\n```\nsudo qemu-system-mips -M malta -initrd 'rootfs.img' -kernel 'vmlinux-2.6.32-5-4kc-malta' -nographic -append \"console=ttyS0,115200 root=/dev/sda rootfstype=jffs2 init=/sbin/init\" -hda 'hda.img' \n\n```\nand I get this error:\n\n```\n[    0.796000]  sda: unknown partition table\n[    0.808000] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI disk\n[    0.812000] RAMDISK: squashfs filesystem found at block 0\n[    0.812000] RAMDISK: Loading 2556KiB [1 disk] into ram disk... done.\n[    0.928000] VFS: Cannot open root device \"sda\" or unknown-block(8,0)\n[    0.928000] Please append a correct \"root=\" boot option; here are the available partitions:\n[    0.928000] 0800           65536 sda driver: sd\n[    0.932000] Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(8,0)\n\n```\nNew try after answer from 6EQUJ5 [I still get the same error though (the second one)]:\n\nThis is what I'm trying:\n\n```\nsudo qemu-system-mips -M malta -kernel 'vmlinux-2.6.32-5-4kc-malta' -nographic -append \"init=/bin/sh\" -hda 'myFileSystem.img'\n\n```\nAnd this is a link to download the filesystem I've created:\n\n```\nhttp://speedy.sh/vBUEQ/myFileSystem.img\n\n```\nRunning \"file\" on my filesystem:\n\n```\nLinux rev 1.0 ext2 filesystem data (mounted or unclean), UUID=dac7072e-2c8b-408f-a080-57ea60cfd9ea\n\n```\nThose are the commands I've used to create it and move the files into it:\n\n```\ndd if=/dev/zero of=~/myFileSystem.img bs=1024 count=65536\nmke2fs myFileSystem.img\nmkdir /mnt/virtual\nmount -o loop ~/myFileSystem.img /mnt/virtual\n\n```\n",

If you make hda.img an ext2 filesystem and copy an init into it and leave off the -initrd argument you may get a little further booting, although you wont be emulating the WR740N at all by then...",

I've changed the \"init=/bin/sh\" to \"init=/sbin/init\" and then typed: user - root  | password - 5up , to get a shell (maybe will help others). I've tried to connect it to the net (with \"tap\") but when I type udhcpc -i br-lan I get the following error:  error, SIOCGIFINDEX failed!: No such device. I guess that it doesn't recognize my card, but i don't know how to solve it. At the end, what i want to do is debug the webserver (httpd) with IDA. Maybe it would be better to run Debian MIPS in qemu and then upload the router's files? thank you in advance.",
