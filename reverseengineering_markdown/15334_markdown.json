  "content": "An SWF file was recently detected by Windows Defender as SWF/Meadgive. I uploaded a sample to VT and only Microsoft flagged it as malicious. As of today's signatures I am not seeing any further detection's and I am hoping this is simply a false positive.\n\nI'm using this as an opportunity to learn more about malware analysis and incident response. To take a deeper dive I opened the file with the JPEXS decompiler, but have no idea on where to go from here. Looking for guidance on how to better understand and analyze this for myself.\n\nAlso, are there any online tools/sandboxes that accept swf files that would provide any value?\n\n",
