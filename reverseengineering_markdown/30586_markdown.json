  "content": "I am trying to disassemble a binary using Capstone. I noticed that there are some instructions that cannot be disassembled, e.g. the vshufi32x4 instruction:\n\n```\nfrom capstone import *\nfrom capstone.x86 import *\n\nmd = Cs(CS_ARCH_X86, CS_MODE_64)\nmd.detail = True\n\n#instruction_bytes = b'b\\x11\\r(\\xfe\\xf6'\n# The above instruction_bytes work as expected, the below print shows\n# 0x6: vpaddd ymm14 , ymm14, ymm30               62110d28fef6\n\ninstruction_bytes = b'b\\xf3}(C\\xe4\\x03'\n# Capstone has problem with the above instruction_bytes.\n# IDA Pro shows the instruction vshufi32x4 ymm4, ymm0, ymm4, 3\n\nprint(instruction_bytes.hex())  # '62f37d2843e403'\nfor c_i in md.disasm(instruction_bytes, len(instruction_bytes)):\n    print(hex(c_i.address) + \":\", c_i.mnemonic, c_i.op_str, \"\\t\\t\\t\\t\", c_i.bytes.hex())\n\n```\nOther examples which cannot be disassembled by Capstone are vpunpcklqdq and vprold\n\nWhat is so special about these instructions? How can I make Capstone disassemble them?\n\n",
