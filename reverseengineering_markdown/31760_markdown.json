      "content": "I think you are mistaking analysis of a binary file with the file itself.\n\nSections can have permissions once in memory (because it will be mapped to physical pages that can have specific RWX permissions), but as long as your file is a file on disk, you should be able to edit its content the same way you edit a text file : get a file descriptor by opening the file with your OS API, read/writing it, close the file descriptor.\n\nAs stated by previous answer from mimak, IDA got its own database, and editing anything within IDA will only update the database, unless you explicitly ask IDA to write changes to the file (which you can do with File->Patches->apply patches to input file) ; in which case IDA will probably open your file on disk, read/write it, and close it.\n\n",
