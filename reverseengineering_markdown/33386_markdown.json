  "content": "I'm reverse engineering x86_64 native code library that's loaded by an application.\nI use Ghidra to get the following decompiled code and I'm trying to make sense of the function calls and different offsets:\n\n```\n    1. std::__ndk1::ios_base::getloc();\n    2. plVar1 = (facet *)std::__ndk1::locale::use_facet(&local_1a0,(id *)&std::__ndk1::ctype<char>::id );\n    3. cVar3 = (**(code **)(*plVar1 + 0x38))(plVar1,10);\n    4. std::__ndk1::locale::~locale(&local_1a0);\n    5. plVar2 = (basic_istream *)FUN_00165008(local_180,&local_1e8,(int)cVar3);\n    6. if (((byte)plVar2[*(long *)(*(long *)plVar2 + -0x18) + 0x20] & 5) != 0) {\n    7.     do_nasty_stuff();\n    8. }\n\n```\nIn Ghidra GDT files define names of classes, types, functions, sizes, offsets, etc..\nI added and applied jni_all in my Ghidra project, and retyped the relevant parameters and variables (for example plVar1 to facet * and plVar2 to basic_istream *). However, these structure definitions are empty. \n\nI created a new native android project, defined a variable of type basic_istream *, which led to the file istream.h. I tried using \"Parse C Source\" in Ghidra and added the file in the configuration, but I couldn't generate a GDT file.\n\nCan someone explain how to adjust it for clear decompilation? Thanks!\n\n",
