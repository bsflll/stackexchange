  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/14927/ld-preload-in-qemu-user-space-emulation",
  "content": "I was trying to emulate a firmware and as a part of the process I was interested in knowing what device files are being registered using mknod. In order to intercept those calls I had created a shared object file and just for a dry run, I was trying to preload this shared library while making a call to mknod to register a character device while doing user space emulation with QEMU like so.\n\nThe files are in the correct place and I was following a tutorial very closely so I know am not making a syntactical as such, but my strace log showed my preloaded library not being accessed at all. Please note that in this case, my mknod is a symbolic link to the busybox binary which in turn executes the mknod syscall. I was wondering if that level of indirection could be an issue and possibly a reason as to why my library isn't getting preloaded? \n\n",
