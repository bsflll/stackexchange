      "content": "You probably found the correct line - the start of the dialog function that gets called whenever something happens with the dialog.\n\nThe problem is, this function gets called a lot of times; especially, when Windows wants the dialog shown, it sends a WM_PAINT message to the dialog. This calls the dialog function as well, so whenever you tell Ollydbg to continue, and alt-tab to your game client, windows redraws the dialog, which calls your function, which triggers your breakpoint.\n\nWhat you want to do is disassemble and understand the complete function. The function should check the message for WM_COMMAND (0x111), then check the wParam parameter for the ID of your button. Find the assembly lines that are executed in this specific case. Then, you can start changing stuff - for example, if these lines call some function, replace the function calls with NOP to prevent the button from doing what it's supposed to do.\n\n",

If you want to do any reverse engineering, you need to a) be able to read assembler easily, b) know about the specifics of your processor, and c) know about stack usage and procedure calling conventions of the mostly-used compilers. Right now, it's like a student pilot asking how to fly loopings on his first day.",
