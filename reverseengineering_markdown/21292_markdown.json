  "content": "I have an application, which sometimes fails. I run procdump and see some first chance exceptions like this:\n\n```\n[14:29:38] Exception: E06D7363.?AVCServicesMDException@@\n[14:29:38] Exception: E06D7363.?AVCServicesMDException@@\n[14:29:38] Exception: E06D7363.?AVCBaseException@@\n[14:29:38] Exception: E06D7363.?AVCBaseException@@\n\n```\nI want to attach to process and analyze some of these exceptions. But have difficulties with setting WinDbg to handle it.\n\nI run .foreach(exc {sx}) {.catch{sxe ${exc}}} & sxe * to catch all first chance exceptions and events.\n\nBut got nothing similar to exceptions from dump (written by procdump).\n\n",
