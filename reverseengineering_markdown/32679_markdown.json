  "content": "I'm new to reverse engineering and recently met with a problem:\n\nI have the dll and pdb of a debug version third party module, but I don't have its source codes. Now I want to write a piece of C++ code to test the stability and efficiency of the interfaces of the module, among which the functions are mainly unexported.\n\nSo my question is that how can I find the address of an unexported function and correctly call it from C++ with DLL and PDB?\n\n",

      "text": "You can get the function address by loading the DLL in Ghidra or IDA and get the function address (minus the base address). At run-time you need to add the base address of the DLL (which may change because of ASLR) and you have the full address of the function. Assuming the function doesn't expect special calling conventions you can then call it using the pointer.",

There should be more clues inside.\n\n",
