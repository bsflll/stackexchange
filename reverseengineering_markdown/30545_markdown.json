      "content": "You can easily unpack MPRESS packed binary manually, this process can be applied to many more packers such as UPX etc. with minimal changes.\n\nI assume you are familiar with debugger and breakpoints(bp). Since you have not provided any instruction snippets or disassembly, I will try to wrap up process in few points in abstract way, though it will be cumbersome but bear with me:\n\nI know we haven't discussed working of MPRESS and few other details but that would make answer very long and unnecessary given the fact you have not provided disassembly.\n\n",
