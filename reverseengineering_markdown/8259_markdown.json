  "content": "\n\nI have been analyzing a Kazy (derp) Ramdo variant that is relatively recent and was surprised to see an access violation in resource hacker when trying to view an embedded bitmap. Is this common or potentially something more sinister? Is the next best course of action to run reshack in a debugger and watch what happens? \n\nUPDATE\n\nI manually saved the potentially offending bitmap in question by right clicking and pressing 'save'. I will analyze the bitmap independently. \n\n",
