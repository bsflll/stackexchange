  "content": "Related to UE Megaboom serial protocol: I am trying to get some insights on the serial protocol spoken by the UE Megaboom, which I suspect is how the app controls the advanced features of the speaker.\n\nOne approach would be to install the app on an Android VM, connect to the speaker and capture the traffic exchanged.\n\nWith VirtualBox, I would probably need to connect a Bluetooth dongle as a USB device and let the VM control it.\n\nHow can I capture the serial traffic exchanged between the speaker and the app?\n\n",

      "content": "According to this StackOverflow answer, Android has a setting in Developer Options from 4.4 onwards. You first need to enable Developer Settings (if you have not done so already), then enable “Enable Bluetooth HCI snoop log”.\n\nI have not tried this myself yet, but according to the information I could find:\n\nTo get Bluetooth from an Android VM running on VirtualBox:\n\nIn practice, however, I was unable to get a reliable Bluetooth connection from the Android VM. I can scan for devices and managed to pair the BT device (though that took multiple attempts), but I never managed to connect to the device. I suspect that is because Android is quite resource-hungry, and the overhead of virtualization along with a restriction to 2 out of 4 processor cores (which I have set this way to keep VMs from hogging my entire CPU) does not leave enough room for Android to run smoothly. Will need to retry with Android x86_64 on a USB stick, running on physical hardware.\n\n",
