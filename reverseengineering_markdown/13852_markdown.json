I guess it is some kind of corrupted file, however not sure, so asking if someone has any references to SR files.\n\n",

I suspect the malware either restores MZ before actually running the file, or uses a custom loader (a la RunPE) to map and execute it, and of course the custom loader can be coded to handle the SR signature in addition (or instead of) MZ.\n\n",
