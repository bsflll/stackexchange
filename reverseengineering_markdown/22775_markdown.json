  "content": "i am looking to expand my knowledge so i can someday(hopefully within few months) be able to join the reverse engineering community, probably in the anti-virus/defense field.\n\ni was wondering, since it is not easy to find information regarding those topics: is there a book(preferably modern) or a course that teaches important and vital subjects such as detour and code injections? i am really enthusiastic with this field and i really eager to study as much as possible to improve and be efficient so i could help a lot of people in this important field.\n\nhowever, sadly, after many searches, i found it to be extremely hard to locate information on those subjects, let alone modern information. so i'd like to request your help with it.\n\np.s: if no book/course available, even resources on the web will be gems to me. \n\n",

      "content": "Detouring is more or less a patching of the .text section inside of a program. It's practically more or less hacking, you're rerouting a program to do what you want it to do with your own function. Usually by placing the opcode 0xE9 (known as JMP, also added with some 0x90 which is NOP, for alignment) inside of the memory address you're detouring, that JMPs to your personal function you wrote.\n\nI recommend reading up on x86 Assembly, along with detouring itself. It's a pretty basic topic once you get it down, but it's definitely a struggle to start learning.\n\nResources to get you started:\nDetour Video by Guide\nVirginia EDU for x86 Assembly\n\n",
