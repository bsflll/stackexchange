So, why do we need the data stored on 0x0A? And what does it include (Almost not 0x52)?\n\n",

      "text": "Wait, what? Where did you get that information. Here? For starters attributes (and the file name is an attribute in NTFS terms, IIRC), can be resident (inside the record) or non-resident (elsewhere). So your assumption that the file name ought to be at offset 0x52 is already wrong. But what you describe here looks more like an ATTRIBUTE_RECORD_HEADER? I think you need to give more information.",
