  "content": "In a program I'm working on, a variable is set using a memory address:\n\n```\nmov r9, [0x0000000000472C10]\n\n```\nIs this the equivalent? (forgive the python code):\n\n```\nvalue = 55 <---- value at memory address 472C10?\n...\nx = number <---- x is set from r9?\n\n```\nIn that case, instead of the hard-coded 55 in the code, I'd like to use my own number. The trouble is I don't know how to access it. My own value has been defined somewhere in the program for example:\n\n```\nuser_value = getValue()\n...\n# assuming we're still in the same function\n...\nvalue = 55\n\n```\nHow can I now change value to be equal to user_value, where can I find the memory address of user_value so I can change the mov instruction?\n\nedit: I know that x64dbg has a way of tracing registry changes, could this be a way of tracking when 55 is set?\n\n",

      "text": "Before I post an answer, let me clarify a few things to make sure I have your question right. 1) You want to find the hard-coded 55 in memory, but you don't know the address. 2) You want to change the value in that memory address to whatever is in the user_value mem address, of which you also do not know. Is this value one you can change multiple times during execution? 3) Are you just assuming that mov instruction, or do you know the value is being read just like that? 4) Have you ever used memory scanning, like via Cheat Engine? If not, that's the path I'm going to answer you with.",
