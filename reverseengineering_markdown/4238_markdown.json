      "content": "Technically speaking what you're describing is an archive. If the archiving data structure was properly designed, in the header you must find either the start offset & the size or the start & end offsets of each file entry in the header, unless the files are all stored one after the other. In that latter case all you need to know is the start offset of each file because (suppose file0 comes first, followed by file1) file1's start offset is file0's end offset. \n\nThe example below shows the latter case :\n\n```\n  Offset00:file0\n  Offset10:file1\n  Offset30:file2\n  Offset35:file3\n\n```\n",

      "content": "In addition to what yaspr said, i'd suggest looking for specification of those contained files. Most file formats have their size specified in the header somewhere. That would allow you to carve the file from the archive, without even knowing the archive structure. \n\nThis is what tools like scalpel are doing to carve files. They match the header to a known file type, and then lookup the file size in that header.\nSome file formats have specific endings which you could also use to carve them out (for example, every png file has IEND and the end).\n\nTry your luck with scalpel and similar file carving tools.\n\n",
