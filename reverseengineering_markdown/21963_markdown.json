  "content": "I decompiled an Android game APK to look at the source code / resources and the .pngs give me the error \"It looks like we don't support this file format\" when I try to view them in the Photos App. I've tried decompiling with Apktool and just changing the extension to .zip but still no luck. Any help would be appreciated.\n\n",
