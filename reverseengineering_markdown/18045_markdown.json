  "content": "How can I display any standard write in visual mode. \n\nFor example if I run dc command it runs the program normally and displays all the text normally. But if I enter visual mode with V< enter > and use S to run through the program it displays the output maybe a 1/10th of a second:\n\n\nCan I have it display it for longer, or enter a command and see what has been printed to stdout so far?\n\n",

      "content": "I'm afraid there's no straight way to do so. You'll need to use rarun2 or radare's dd command.\n\nI prefer the rarun2 way, it is more flexible and simple.\n\nFrom man rarun2 output:\n\n```\n  Debugging a program redirecting io to another terminal\n\n   ## open a new terminal and type 'tty' to get\n   $ tty ; clear ; sleep 999999\n   /dev/ttyS010\n\n   ## in another terminal run r2\n   $ r2 -e dbg.profile=foo.rr2 -d ls\n\n   ## or you can use -R option\n   $ r2 -R foo.rr2 -d ls\n   $ cat foo.rr2\n   #!/usr/bin/rarun2\n   stdio=/dev/ttys010\n\n```\nFor a step-by-step guide and more detailed answer, check my answer to a similar question here.\n\ndd can be used to change file descriptors at runtime:\n\n```\n[0x00000000]> dd?\n|Usage: dd Descriptors commands\n| dd                   List file descriptors\n| dd <file>            Open and map that file into the UI\n| dd-<fd>              Close stdout fd\n| dd*                  List file descriptors (in radare commands)\n| dds <fd> <off>       Seek given fd)\n| ddd <fd1> <fd2>      Dup2 from fd1 to fd2\n| ddr <fd> <size>      Read N bytes from fd\n| ddw <fd> <hexpairs>  Write N bytes to fd\n\n```\n",
