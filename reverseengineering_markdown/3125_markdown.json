  "content": "I'm trying to insert some instrumentation into libraries such as System.Windows.Browser.dll.\n\nI tried to use ildasm+ilasm and Reflexil and both failed - reassembled library causes browser crashes, even when i do not do any changes between disassembling and assembling.\n\nI've managed to change the runtime using simple hex-editor, and it was successful. but it's so annoying.\n\nWhat do i do wrong? Why it's impossible to reassemble Silverlight5 runtime  with ildasm/ilasm?\n\n```\nildasm.exe /out=System.Windows.Browser.il System.Windows.Browser.dll\nilasm.exe /dll System.Windows.Browser.il\n\n```\nIt works perfectly with .NET runtime and with Silverlight applications but not with Silverlight runtime.\n\n",
