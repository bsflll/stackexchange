  "content": "I'm trying to find libc symbols in some Windows 32-bit application. For some reason, Ida autoanalysis didn't recognized code that comes from libc as \"library function\", but as a \"regular function\". Let me make it more clear with some screenshots.\n\nMy tutor got the following result (sorry for the low quality, I describe whats in it after the shot):\n\nThis is the same image and you (maybe) can see that the malloc function at 0xE0E5DE is recognized as library function. The whole neighborhood is recognized as library function, since this section is for static-linked libc symbols.\n\nBut when I'm loading the image its a \"regular function\", and of course it doesn't resolve as malloc():\n\n\nI tried to re-autoanalyze the code (Options --> General --> Reanalyze Program) but it didn't help. Hence I'm asking for help:\n\nP.S: the app was once packed with UPX, I decompress it. I don't believe it has anything to do with this problem, but maybe it has so I'm mentioning it\n\n",

Ida comes with a lot of pre-calculated FLIRT signatures but of course it can not contain signatures for each and every combination of library version and used compiler.
