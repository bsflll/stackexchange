  "content": "Recently, i have gone through some kind of win32-64 executable files which can't be decompiled under IDA (into Pseudocode). Only the Assembly Code can be read. When i try to press F5 to decompile the file,it only shows me a Diaglog Box says \"Positive Stack Value found\".The Debugging process is still fine.It's just i can't not decompile the file into c source code.\n\nI wonder how can they do that? I mean they can make the executable unable to decompile under IDA or maybe other Disassembler.\n\nI want to accomplish this using other compilers such as GCC,MinGW,Clang,or even Turbo.\n\n",
