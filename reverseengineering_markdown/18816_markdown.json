  "content": "I have a binary file that I found on a 3D printer that is used to program a dsPIC30F5011 microcontroller. It is responsible for some basic data encryption. The only problem is, I am not sure how this file is formatted.\n\nIt is raw binary, not like an Intel HEX file or anything. Here's a few sample lines:\n\n0C4230050037600010E0801802003B21\n\n0C424001F02C1A00370004BE6011B819\n\n0C42506B09200982CF0200390882CFE0\n\n0C42600441B06942520E003208003BDD\n\nFor the first line:\n\nSo the first byte (0x0C) is the length of the data.\n\nThe next two bytes (0x4230) is the address (I believe it is twice the address, I'll explain that further down)\n\nThen is the data (length 0x0C in this case)  - 050037600010E0801802003Bh\n\nThe last two bytes are a Checksum  - 2's complement of the lower byte of the sum of all bytes (length through end of data). \n\nThe reason I believe the address listed is twice the address desired is in the Programming Manual the Intel Hex format says:\n\nIn fact, this format closely matches the Intel HEX format, although it isn't in ASCII format, nor does it use valid record types.\n\nIn addition, the last few commands in the file reference address 0x0008 - 0x01FF. Dividing this by 2 gives us 0x0004 - 0x00FF, which according to the datasheet is the interrupt vector locations.\n\nI have been poking at this for ages, and I can't seem to understand how this is actually translated to the MCU. For one thing, the addresses all increment in 16 byte increments, despite the fact that there is only 12 bytes of data in that line. \n\nIf anyone can make any sense out of this, I feel like I am at wit's end on this one.\n\nHere's the full file (42 KB)\n\nAnd here's some more hex if you don't feel like downloading the file:\n\n```\n0C4210889FBE8A9FBE0105780100E077\n0C422004003508003C0000E0200032E3\n0C4230050037600010E0801802003B21\n0C424001F02C1A00370004BE6011B819\n0C42506B09200982CF0200390882CFE0\n0C42600441B06942520E003208003BDD\n0C42708281716101648904D10884D34B\n0C42808B05E80442E8F9FF3A0500371E\n0C429008044489844C8B05E90442E9D1\n0C42A0FBFF3A1B01070AF0A701F0A089\n0C42B04F05BE4F04BE000006889FBEF4\n0C42C08A9FBE8C1F783801073F013335\n0C42D003866C6450E12E00326420E193\n0C42E03300326150E12F00326120E118\n0C42F0310032858555EB07B009002035\n0C430008042005003708044489844CA0\n0C43100A003106034387834B00015371\n0C432081815BF8FF330203BE0800A09F\n0C433008044489844CF6FF39C639DDCE\n0C43408301730100321300208904D1B6\n0C43500884D30998A30500320800A7D8\n0C43600300A08904D10884D38B05E879\n0C43708904D10884D30001EB0281D243\n0C4380E4000701F0A10CF0A701F0A080\n0C43901701376420E11901320801BE5A\n0C43A00200BEF7FF376120E11401327B\n0C43B06000B8F3FF3700002001F82780\n0C43C0F0FF3704002010013703F0A2CA\n0C43D0889FBE8A9FBE8C1F78F30007F8\n0C43E0FA00336450E14F00326420E129\n0C43F052003203826C07003B0905D02C\n0C44000306D0820F540C065D02003948\n0C44100200328901780306788582558D\n0C442004003D0003FD8103FD8502EA5D\n0C44308B8542840F7202003B6000107C\n0C4440E080186011B80005EB7A28E15C\n0C44500A0039060078C75DDDF707B2EE\n0C44608780752D00378281710A017879\n0C44706105608180D10080D38502E9E5\n0C4480F9FF3B06044087844802003B23\n0C4490600414E0841C0988A3070032BB\n0C44A08A81718281716101648904D1FC\n0C44B00884D38B05E81700370978A3B7\n\n```\n",

      "content": "As you found, the binary format is similar to the Intelhex format, even if that is text.\n\nOne important thing to note is that the program space is addressed in 16 bit words, but stores only 24 bits of resulting 32 bit words. The topmost byte is a \"phantom byte\" as the documentation calls it. When read, it is always zero.\n\nAll \"records\" are 16 bytes long.\n\nThis is an example in details:\n\n```\n0C4230050037600010E0801802003B21\n\n```\nThe linked complete file has few duplicate entries and some zero-data entries. Perhaps this comes from the build or conversion process.  However, it makes some sense.\n\nThis is part of the vector table:\n\nFor another plausibility check I disassembled (by hand using the Programmer's Reference Manual, there can be errors) the oscillator fail trap interrupt:\n\n",
