  "content": "I read some things about trusted computing platforms (TPM) and its applications in the past.\n\nAFAIK, its applications include such things as countering software reverse engineering/crack and cheating in multiplayer games. And nowadays, it seems that most systems (including most PCs) have trusted computing capabilities or TPM chips.\n\nI want to know how widespread are TC applications at the moment and how successful they were (or can be if implemented/used properly - I mean without any human mistakes) in achieving their goals.\n\nAnd, can TC be a definitive end to reverse engineering/crack (at least in some cases), and if not, why?\n\nIt seems to me that TC has great capabilities and can create strong protection against software manipulation, because I am somewhat informed in cryptography and I know it uses modern and strong cryptographic algorithms/protocols ... that breaking them is almost infeasible if implemented properly (free of human mistakes). But, on the other hand, I don't know why its use is not widespread yet (apparently) and almost all software are cracked everyday (Although I have some guesses myself, like extra complexity and cost required to implement such software, also the cryptography knowledge/expertise required that almost no ordinary programmer has).\n\nSo, I decided to ask this question from you here.\n\nPS: Maybe I should have posted this question in crypto or security StackExchange sites. IDK for sure, but probably will try them if I don't get enough info here.\n\n",

      "content": "I am not sure there is a definitive answer to this.\n\nFor example, anyone with physical access to the system can do a whole manner of things that TPM may not be able to prevent. \n\nFor example, the TPM itself could be reverse engineered: http://gcn.com/articles/2010/02/02/black-hat-chip-crack-020210.aspx?m=1\n\nThen you have timing attacks and other side channels.\n\nAnd as you say yourself, cost and complexity: this is well summed up by Andrew 'Bunnie' Huang in 'Hacking the Xbox' (pg. 203, http://www.nostarch.com/xboxfree)\n\n",
