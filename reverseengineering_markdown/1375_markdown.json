  "content": "I've previously rolled my own Fuzzing Framework, and tried a few others like Peach Fuzzer.  It's been awhile since I've looked at vulnerability hunting, what is the state of the art with regard to fuzzing?  That is, if I were to start fuzzing Acme Corp's PDF Reader today, what toolset should I look into?  \n\n",

Also A Taint Based Approach for Smart Fuzzing shows how to combine taint analysis for advanced fuzzing (there should be some non-paywalled version around). Also, I expect most people don't really publish their advanced techniques until they exhaust them, which is the main problem of this question.\n\n",

That is, it is the current state of the highest level of general development.  There will always be outliers that perform better, but they are not the state of the art, they are the outliers above it.  Nonetheless, thanks for the suggested reading.",
