The right branch isn't out by quite as much as in the original screenshot for some reason. Taken from a fresh db with just the stack pointer corrected on the indirect calls and pD3DDevice named.",

      "content": "So, the problem is that you have two branches with different stack delta: E8 at 5018E4 (fall through from jnz) and F0 at 501c49 (destination of jnz). Normally they should be the same, however IDA failed to reconcile them, probably due to too many indirect calls in the function.\n\nOne peculiarity of manual stack delta adjustments is that they apply after the instruction at which you're setting them. In our case, we need to make 501C49 have the delta of E8, however we can't do it on the instruction itself but need to go to the previous one by address and not the control flow, i.e. the jmp at 501C44. Since that address has SPD=E0, specifying delta of -8 should work.\n\nThis is why such manipulations are best done in text view and not graph.\n\n",
