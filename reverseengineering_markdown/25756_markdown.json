When stepping through this function, after return it's redirecting me here:\n\n```\nif ( *(_QWORD *)(v9 + v8 + 8) || *(_QWORD *)(v9 + v8 + 16) )\n  (*(void (__fastcall **)(_QWORD, __int64))(v9 + v8 + 16))(*(_QWORD *)(v9 + v8 + 8), v4);\nif ( v5 == 0xFFFFFFF ) //Here..\n  v5 = *((_DWORD *)v2 + 9);\n\n```\n",
