I am used to seeing a conditional jump right after it. But here there is a test, cmp and then a conditional jump and also a test followed by no jumps. Would it make any difference if the test instructions were omitted?\n\n",

The result of the first test is not used because of a cmp right after it, but there is still a (small) chance that the result of the second test is actually used later on after ret - it affected flags whch were not overwritten afterwards. The first test is a junk instruction and so is the second most likely.",
