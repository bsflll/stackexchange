  "content": "I am trying to reverse-engineer a protocol which includes a final byte that is (possibly) a CRC-8 with some unknown parameters.\n\nI have collected some data, however, the downside is the fixed length\n\n```\n<------------------ data ------------------>  CRC Byte\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  B1\n20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20  6B\nC8 6E 4D 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  55\n38 3C 80 40 40 40 A0 95 91 33 23 0B A1 C6 19  44\n01 40 BA 1E 5D 4C 0A 04 16 60 E5 4A C0 78 35  DF\n\n```\nI have already tried reveng with no luck. I can provide more messages and their respective CRCs.\n\nEDIT 1:\n\nData with small differences. I have collected some data (pastebin) with small differences, for example, the following:\n\n```\n38 3C 80 40 20 70 A5 15 A5 33 64 F5 A0 2A 59 BD\n38 3C 80 40 20 70 A5 15 A5 33 64 F5 A0 26 59 B4\n                                        ^\n\n38 3C 80 40 20 40 A0 95 91 33 23 0B A0 CA 1D 09\n38 3C 80 40 20 40 A0 95 91 33 23 0B A0 C5 1D 42\n                                        ^\n\n```\nEDIT 2:\n\nI have found some messages with one bit of difference:\n\n```\n38 3C 80 40 40 70 A5 15 A5 33 64 F5 A1 31 5D B1\n38 3C 80 40 40 70 A5 15 A5 33 64 F5 A1 34 5D 77\n38 3C 80 40 40 70 A5 15 A5 33 64 F5 A1 35 5D B6\n38 3C 80 40 40 70 A5 15 A5 33 64 F5 A1 38 5D 7E\n38 3C 80 40 40 70 A5 15 A5 33 64 F5 A1 39 5D BF\n                                        ^\n\n38 3C 80 40 40 40 A0 95 91 33 23 E7 A1 38 1E EC\n38 3C 80 40 40 40 A0 95 91 33 23 E7 A1 39 1E 2D\n                                        ^\n\n38 3C 80 40 40 40 A0 95 91 33 23 0B A1 CA 1D 2F\n38 3C 80 40 40 40 A0 95 91 33 23 0B A1 CE 1D 28\n                                        ^\n\n```\nEDIT 3:\n\nI have found some patterns following this tutorial using the following messages (pastebin):\n\n```\n383c80404070a515a53364f5a1315db1\n383c80404070a515a53364f5a1345d77\n383c80404070a515a53364f5a1355db6\n383c80404070a515a53364f5a1385d7e\n383c80404070a515a53364f5a1395dbf\n383c80404070a515a53364f5a13a5dfd\n383c80404070a515a53364f5a13b5d3c\n                           ^\n\n```\nAfter XORing I can get the following difference messages:\n\n```\n0100C1\n020083\n040007\n08000E\n\n```\nIt seems that after shifting the difference message 1 bit to the left, the resulting checksum also is being shifted 1 bit to the left. And if the leading bit of the checksum (the one about to be shifted out) is 1, then the resulting checksum will be equal to the previous shifted one place and XORed with 1 (as if 1 was the polynomial of the crc8).\n\nHowever, this does not hold further for these messages:\n\n```\n383c80404070a515a53364f5a1245d73\n383c80404070a515a53364f5a1345d77\n\n```\nAfter XORing:\n\n```\n100004\n\n```\nSome other examples:\n\n```\n383c80404040a095913323e0a0d51d0d\n383c80404040a095913323e0a1d51d8b\n--------------------------------\n                         1000086\n\n383c80402070a515a5332422a02d7568\n383c80402070a515a5332422a42d756a\n--------------------------------\n                         4000002\n\n```\nEDIT 4:\n\nTake the following example:\n\n```\n383c80404040a0959133230ba1ce1d28\n383c80404040a0959133230ba1d41da1\n--------------------------------\n                          1A0089\n\n```\n1A0089 can be obtained by XORing 100004 ^ 8000E ^ 20083. I am not sure if it has something to do with the checksum.\n\nEDIT 5:\n\nI have made a table of single bit difference messages:\n\n```\n00 00 00 01 -> 98\n00 00 00 02 -> 31 ?\n00 00 00 04 -> 62\n00 00 00 08 -> C4\n\n00 00 00 10 -> 91\n00 00 00 20 -> 23\n00 00 00 40 -> 46 ?\n00 00 00 80 -> 8C ?\n\n00 00 01 00 -> C1\n00 00 02 00 -> 83\n00 00 04 00 -> 07\n00 00 08 00 -> 0E\n\n00 00 10 00 -> 04\n00 00 20 00 -> 08 ?\n00 00 40 00 -> 10 ?\n00 00 80 00 -> 20 ?\n\n00 01 00 00 -> 86\n00 02 00 00 -> \n00 04 00 00 -> 02\n00 08 00 00 -> \n\n00 10 00 00 ->\n00 20 00 00 ->\n00 40 00 00 -> 67\n00 80 00 00 ->\n\n```\nI have marked with ? the entries I predicted myself following the steps described in edit 3. Other entries were obtained XORing either original or difference messages (as described in edit 4).\n\nEDIT 6:\n\nI have collected more data (pastebin).\n\n",
