  "content": "Reverse engineering SWFs with ActionScript 3 on a Mac typically requires a Windows VM and a lot of copying and pasting. There are some good decompilers for Windows such as as3extractor but I haven't found anything that seems to work on MacOS X.\n\nDoes a functional equivalent to as3extractor exist for Mac OS X ?\n\n",

I've only used the Windows version but I believe their features should be mostly similar. They have a feature to export FLA from a SWF file which works very well for most cases.\n\nTheir product page mentions\n\nhttp://www.sothink.com/product/flash-decompiler-for-mac/\n\nFreeware:\n\nI do not know of a good freeware solution. If you'd like to use AS3Extractor on your Mac, you can consider running Wine (install via Homebrew). AS3Extractor also mentions that they have a dependency on Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package so do take note!\n\n",
