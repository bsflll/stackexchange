  "content": "I developing online game. I have full sources for server, but game client I am using is closed-source so I need to do some reverse engineering there. So for 2 weeks I am trying to properly call draw_rectangle function. In the image below you can see screenshot from OLLY.\nThere are functions:\n\nDRAW_BLACK_BAR(black frame for health bar),\n\nDRAW_COLORED_BAR(The health inside),\n\nDRAW_NICK(already hooked)\n\n\n\nthe CALL DWORD PTR DS:[EDX+14] always points to 0x4EB2F0\n\nSo the addres contains that function in debugger:\n\n\n\nAs you can see there are parameters on the stack such as: Surface_id, position, size, color, pointer to creature.\n\nSo theres my hook:\n\n```\nsuperHook(dwHandle, 0x4C8C28, (unsigned int)newFunc); //instead of call print rectangle func for colored bar\n \nvoid superHook(HANDLE dwHandle, int adr, unsigned int targetFunction)\n{\n    //its not normal CALL ADDR which takes 5 bytes (E8 + 4x bytes for address)\n    //It is CALL DWORD PTR DS:[EDX+14] which takes 3bytes, so we will take more space\n    //and we will rebuild the function\n     \n     \n    // jmp to address +2x nop\n    BYTE bytes[7] = { 0xE9, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x90, 0x90};\n    DWORD targetAddr = targetFunction - adr - 5;\n    *(DWORD*)(bytes + 1) = targetAddr;\n    WriteProcessMemory(dwHandle, (void *)adr, bytes, 7, NULL);\n}\n \nvoid newFunc()\n{\n    //Rebuild the function (Earsed commands to be able to put JMP address)\n    __asm {\n            MOV ECX, DWORD PTR SS : [EBP - 0x18]\n            PUSH ESI\n    }\n \n    //Here I can access all the registers and stack before CALL will be executed\n     \n \n    //call draw rectangle\n    __asm {\n            CALL DWORD PTR DS : [EDX + 0x14]//always call 0x4EB2F0?\n    }\n \n \n    //go back\n    __asm {\n        PUSH 0x4C8C2F\n            RET\n    }\n \n}\n\n```\nAnd it works fine, I can acces the params on stack and modify them (CHange color,size, location etc). BUt I would like to be able to create another rectangle, for example next one with another color and position. I tried a lot of combinations of setting up the new stack with params calling the func and then calling it again with original ones but I always end up with client crash.\n\nHeres an one of example of my attempt to create new call + restoring old one\nhttps://pastebin.com/RUmaPGya (pastebin to not make this post too long)\n\nHelp plz :)\n\n",

General purpose registers must be individually preserved/restored in x64. That aside, have you tried placing a breakpoint and stepping through your code to see exactly where the crash happens? That should elaborate on register/stack states for you to identify key problem areas.",
