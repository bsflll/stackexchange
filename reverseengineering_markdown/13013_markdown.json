  "content": "I have the STM32L151's firmware that I extracted via JTAG, but I cannot find a start point in IDA. I have tried two methods:\n\n1) I start IDA, drag the binary into the workspace, select ARM Little-endian for the processor type, click ok, the disassembly memory organization window appears, entered in relevant information found here on page 48, click ok, windows pops up saying \"IDA can not identify the entry point...\", in the workspace I see \"RAM:08000000        DCB [some hex number]\"\n\n2) Converted the binary to elf using my arm toolchain's objcopy, used \"readelf -h [my binary file]\" to find the entry point, got this output where the entry point is 0xff810000, dragged the elf into IDA's workspace, selected ARM Little-endian processor under processor type, clicked ok, and the workspace shows lines that look like \".data:0000002C        [several hex values separated by commas]\"\n\nIf I try to jump to the entry point address (0xff810000 from readelf) I get an JumpAsk fail. How do I find my start point so I can start reading the disassembled ARM assembly code?\n\n",

For example, for STM32L01xxx/02xxx chips, page 174 specifies that the the bootloader's firmware is a 4 KB chunk that begins at address 0x1FF00000.\n\n\n\n",
