  "content": "I'm trying to reverse-engineer a function in IDA Pro that was originally identified by IDA as such (I was able to rename it into Device_CreateCloseIoControl):\n\n\n\nbut I know that this function was originally compiled as this:\n\n\n\nwhere DEVICE_OBJECT and IRP structs are defined in wdm.h from Windows Driver Kit.\n\nSo I'm curious, is there a way to rename this function to make IDA use those custom types? (Included in a specific header file.)\n\n",
