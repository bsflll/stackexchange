So, you can obtain this file (or any other file of interest) from device or VM using fnsysctl and exec backup commands, together with the configured tftp-server. In my case it looks like this:\n\n```\n#> fnsysctl cp /bin/init /var/log/root/mlog.0\n#> exec backup disk log tftp AA.BB.CC.DD anomaly\n\n```\nThen, rename the received file on the tftp-server.\n\n",
