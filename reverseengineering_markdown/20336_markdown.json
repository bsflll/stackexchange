What does the 3 columns in the radare2 visual mode represent?\n\nMay I know how the command below:\n\nwa je 0x400976 @0x00400968\n\nchanges 760c to 740c and jne 0x400976 to je 0x400976?\n\nAlso, what does that accomplish?\nDoes it just bypass the function\n\nThank you!\n\nfull program\n\n\ncommand\n\n\n",

On the far left you have also some arrows indicating jumps and on the far right there are comments.\n\nwa command, which you could check by requesting help in r2, is a command that writes the opcode of the provided mnemonic.\n\n```\n| wa[?] push ebp       write opcode, separated by ';' (use '\"' around the command)\n\n```\nSo executing wa je 0x400976 @0x00400968 will write the opcodes for the je 0x400976 at the address of 0x400968. \n\nAnd actually it changes from 750c, and that is the opcode of the jump-not-equal with the offset of 0xC bytes. You requested (by issuing the command wa) to write on that spot the jump-if-equal and the opcode of this is 74. The offset stays the same.\n\nIt changes the condition so from now on the jump will be taken when the strings that are being compared (@0x400961) are equal and not taken if they are different. This also happens to the string being printed at offset 0x400971.\n\nApart from the first question this is nor really radare2 specific stuff. It looks like you should start with some basic assembly and/or RE topics/tutorials that are plenty on the internet.\n\n",
