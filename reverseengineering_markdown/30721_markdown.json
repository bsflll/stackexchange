  "content": "I have a code like this:\n\n```\nclass CURLNetRequest : public CNetRequestBase\n{\n    DEFINE_LOGCLASS;\n    \n    struct ProxySettings\n    {\n        void initFromConfig();\n        \n        String  host;\n        int     port;\n        String  username;\n        String  password;\n    };\n\n    struct AuthSettings\n    {\n        AuthSettings( AuthMethod m, const String& u, const String& p )\n        : method(m)\n        , user(u)\n        , password(p)\n        {}\n\n        const AuthMethod method;\n        const String user;\n        const String password;\n    };\n...\n\n```\nI want to hook the structure members i.e. user and password using frida. so far I did like below:\n\n```\nconst some_func_pointer = Module.getExportByName('librhodes.so', '_ZN3rho3net14CURLNetRequest10CURLHolder11set_optionsEPKcRKNSt6__ndk\n112basic_stringIcNS5_11char_traitsIcEENS5_9allocatorIcEEEESD_PNS0_11IRhoSessionEPNS_9HashtableISB_SB_EERKNS1_13ProxySettingsERKNS1_12AuthSettingsE');\nconst some_func = new NativeFunction(some_func_pointer, \"void\", [\"int\", \"pointer\"]);\nInterceptor.replace(some_func_pointer, new NativeCallback(function (size, data) {\n  console.log(size)\n  console.log(data.readUtf8String())\n  some_func(size, data);\n}, \"void\", [\"int\", \"pointer\"]));\n\n```\nand I can only get the AuthMethod m which could either be POST or GET in this case. How can I hook others like username and password.\n\nFYI, this is rhomobile built app, and the above snippet taken from the open source code, so apparently decompiling librhodes.so  produces some stripped functions, etc.\n\nplease help me with this.\n\n",
