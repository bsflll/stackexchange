  "content": "I'm trying to create UART cable for A520F phone with USB type-c. Seems, there is no UART debug modes S8+ either.  On Samsung phones with micro USB one may access UART JIG mode with  619K resistor, connected to micro USB ID pin. \n\nHow I test:\n\nI can dump MUIC registers. I have raw usb type c plug(mounted on board with solder pads), with cable soldered, which maps usb type c pins on breadboard. So I assemble test scheme and analyze MUIC registers and MUIC linux kernel module log output upon attachment.\n\nWhat I currently find:\n\nWhat else can I try?\nIf you were this device developer, how would you hide UART debug mode from users?\n\n",
