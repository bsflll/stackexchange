  "content": "I am exploring MacOS Deckset app.\nIt has a trial version available on the official website.\nBut there's a cracked version available on torrent trackers.\n\nI want to know what was changed by the people who cracked that app: strings? symbols? few assembly instructions?\n\nBoth (genuine and cracked) versions are available as .DMG installers.\nI've extracted Deckset.app containers from both of them.\n\nNow, I'm able to explore Deckset.app/Contents/MacOS/Deckset binary in Hopper tool.\nBut as the cracked version is patched, I want to understand what actually was patched.\nFor this, I used radiff2 tool from Radare2 toolset:\n\n```\nradiff2 genuine.app/Contents/MacOS/Deckset cracked.app/Contents/MacOS/Deckset  > bin_diff.txt\n\n```\nIt gave me output like this:\n\n```\n0x00000e98 901e => 101c 0x00000e98\n0x0000201c 109a => 9097 0x0000201c\n0x0027d486 770c => 585e 0x0027d486\n0x0027d48b 04 => 03 0x0027d48b\n0x0027d493 2c => 24 0x0027d493\n0x0027d49a 511a => 5097 0x0027d49a\n0x0027d49d 00 => 01 0x0027d49d\n0x0027d49f 05 => 00 0x0027d49f\n0x0027d4a3 fe00010000 => 07fade0c02 0x0027d4a3\n0x0027d4aa 53bcfade0c02 => 507300020100 0x0027d4aa\n0x0027d4b2 50ee => 0000 0x0027d4b2\n0x0027d4b5 020500 => 0000b3 0x0027d4b5\n0x0027d4b9 01 => 00 0x0027d4b9\n0x0027d4bb 00 => 30 0x0027d4bb\n0x0027d4be 012e => 0003 0x0027d4be\n0x0027d4c2 0060 => 027e 0x0027d4c2\n\n```\nNow, when I open \"genuine\" app in Hopper, and search for either 0x00000e98, or 901e, or 101c, it gives nothing useful.\n\nE.g. when I do Menu > Navigate > Go to Address or Symbol and enter 0x00000e98, it gives me such segment:\n\n\nI don't see nor 901e, neither 101c in this segment.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\nDo you know better tools for doing this (except IDA Pro, because it's expensive)?\n\n",
