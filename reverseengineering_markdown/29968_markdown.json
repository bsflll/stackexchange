  "content": "I am new to reverse engineering. I did a couple of projects. now I was doing another project and faced kind of a problem.\n\nat the start of the program, there is a label that points to an address of memory but when going to that address there is only hex data instead of instruction.\nhow I can convert those to the instruction. I used \"C (convert to code)\" which was nonsense.\n\n\nthanks in advance\n\n",
