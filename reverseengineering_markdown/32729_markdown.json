  "content": "I'm starting in the world of reverse engineering, for educational purpose, by studying a (supposed-to-be) relatively simple system as black-box.\n\nThe system uses a NFC Mifare 1k badge to store persistent data. Upon each completed operation, it writes a single chunk of 3*128bits ; no other sector gets modified. My  first experiments led me to identify some 64bits patterns in the produced data.\n\n```\n# date:2024-02-06 time:???\n0x0010: FD C9 D4 5B E7 7A 09 89 | 26 C9 75 47 8E 01 AE 56\n\n# date:2024-02-07 time:???\n0x0010: 20 29 4E 54 82 ED 12 3E | A3 22 73 3A BE B2 55 5E\n\n# date:2024-02-12 time:???\n0x0010: 00 EB 83 C7 98 FC E5 DE | D9 2B FD F9 B9 F7 22 8F\n\n```\nNOTE: I use the word \"encoding\" because I cannot tell whether the data is encoded or encrypted. If the data is encrypted, I guess a fairly simple algorithm may be in use without random IV or seed (because of the patterns and constant results for constant inputs).\n\nHow can I go further with the pieces of information I gathered until now? Is there some tools for guessing the encoding/ciphering of a data without knowing its exact representation (I mean, I know the date is valid, but I do not know how the system represents it nor how the system produced the resulting encoded/ciphered data)?\n\n",
