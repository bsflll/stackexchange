Its datasheet can be found here.\n\nSince I have found in the internet only firmware that seems to be encrypted/compressed, I'm trying to figure out how to dump it from the flash (using logic analyzer or Bus Pirate, etc.).\n\nCan someone please help me out with this challenge?\nElaborated answer will be appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",
