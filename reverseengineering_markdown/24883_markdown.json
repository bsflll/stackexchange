Enter the data type for the variable-length structure member first.  Then select the row for that new structure member and press the [ key to invoke the array action.  Entering 0 as the element count in the resulting dialog will create a flexible array.\n\nGhidra flexible arrays have limited functionality.  From Ghidra help:\n\n",
