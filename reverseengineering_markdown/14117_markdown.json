  "content": "Not sure if the title is that telling but what I want to do is hack into an executable and do as little as necessary to get the code from my DLL running since I want to write as few lines of assembly code as possible.\n\nI already have the place where I'd like to jump in and I am ready to insert the necessary assembly instructions into the executable using ollydbg but since I never did that before I'm afraid I need a little help on those last steps.\n\nWhat I want to do is basically:\n\nbut I'm not sure what's the best way to accomplish that. Is there a straight forward way to get this done?\n\nBtw: Is what I'm doing here actually called \"dll-injection\"? \n\n",

      "text": "But to answer your question - yes, what you're doing is called DLL / code injection, and what you want to do can be relatively easily achieved using Windows APIs (VirtualAllocEx -> CreateRemoteThread(..., LoadLibraryA, \"your_dll.dll\", ...)). You can do it yourself if you want, too (that's called manual mapping).",

      "text": "This is \"dll-injection\". Like mentioned by Martin, just create a thread at the location of 'LoadLibraryA' with the library name. As for additional parameters, you should be able to mess with the stack.",

      "text": "@Martin So the \"easiest\" way is to inject code into the executable which calls CreateRemoteThread() in order to load my dll, then call GetProcAddress() to get the address of  init_my_dll() and call it? The link you are referring seems to do something different - if I get this right there are two processes in the end. I don't get how I would make the target process call init_my_dll() as described there.",

    {
      "user": "Martin",
      "text": "No - you don't use GetProcAddress to call your function. You use it to find LoadLibraryA, and call it. That function will load your DLL, and will call its DllMain - and that function could be calling your init_my_dll function. That said - if you're trying to do this with a game, be careful, those have anti-cheats which usually detect this technique and ban you.",
