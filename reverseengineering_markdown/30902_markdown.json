  "content": "So I just got Zyxel nas326 and I looked from internet how to protect nas from bruteforce attack and I found that fail2ban can protect my nas.\n\nThen I found that I can't download any programs to nas326. So now I ask how I can Install fail2ban to Zyxel nas326.\n\nI know in theory I can use wget to download it from my own ftp server and run it, because that nas have python by default, but command pip doesn't work\" (python work). Commands like sudo and apt- dont work\n\nAnyone have done this before? Any other suggestions for bruteforce protection?\n\n",
