  "content": "I'm trying to identify the rating algorithm used to calculate the displayed average of a 1 star to 5 stars rating system. To analyze the data I collated the first and last 1000 ranks and added the real average.\n\nPlease see my EtherCalc table.\n\nHere is what I know about the underlying algorithm:\n\nI guess the easiest way to determine the algorithm is to analyze the items with the fewest numbers of total ratings. For example:\n\nSince I've been thinking about this for too long and can't come up with the solution, I kindly ask for your valuable help.\n\n",

That might help to confirm those - or not.\n\nAm I correct that you cannot create a response from the site by creating specific input for your own defined combinations?\n\nThen I would try to attack the algorithm by\n\n\n\nEdit 10.04.22\n\nMeanwhile, I did a second approach: guessing an almost linear formula with a fixed factor for each star, so that the average is calculated by (number of 5 stars)*a+(number of 4 stars)*b+etc/total.\nThen I selected the ones with Zero 1 star, and Zero 2 stars and optimized the factors, resulting in\n\nTotal difference of deltas of that model (abs(result - displayed average) versus average model is reduced, but not Zero => guessed formula is not good enough. This is expected from the information you gave for the algorithm. However the biggest deltas are found for good scored results => a new model is to be guessed to represent that non-linear impact.\n\nI think in that way you can come closer to a model that is good enough and get a final low delta, but it will never be the original algorithm.\nAlternatively, an \"automated formula guesser\" is needed, that combines the 5 variables to a result that comes close to the displayed average. However, this will also most probably not be the original algorithm.\n\n",

If you fit a least squares model to the five data values you've provided, you can get a prediction formula for this data that looks like:\n\ndisplayed_average = 3.6746154 + 0.162307923 * five_stars + 0.275384615 * four_stars -0.171548462*three_stars - 0.45 * one_star\n\nwhich predicts the displayed average as\n\n\n\nObviously, this is only based upon the five data values you provided. If you had 10000 values, you could come a lot closer to the actual formula by using those additional data points.

The patterns of residuals are very good indication of the existence of non-linear features which the question indicates.   In your example regression it's not surprising that you get a perfect fit as you've fitted a 5 parameter model to just 5 data points.
