  "content": "I am using Immunity Dbg v1.85 (the latest version to date). I spent about an hour analyzing a piece of malware, while making comments and relabeling functions from something like X.00402AC0 to something more useful like X.password_checker. After patching the malware to skip over the password checker function (Copy to executable > All modifications) and saving it to a new file, I see all my comments and label changes have disappeared upon opening the patched version in the debugger.\n\nThe interesting thing is when you terminate the debugger and then re-open the original unpatched executable, the comments and labels remain. It's only when you save binary modifications to a new file that they are lost. Needless to say, this is a huge inconvenience when working on complex binaries that need to be patched and shared.\n\nIs there any way to save changes to labels and comments to new executables in Immunity?\n\n",

These tutorials are about saving comments when analyzing an executable and what to do if comments aren't saved when working with DLL files called by the executable. When you patch a binary, you save it to a new executable, and the new UDD file is not created until the new executable is opened, so I don't think any data saved in the original executable UDD is ever transferred.",
