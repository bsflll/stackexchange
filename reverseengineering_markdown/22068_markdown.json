  "content": "I'm reversing an open-source windows application written in C++. I found in the disassembler the desired function that I'm trying to understand its behavior.\n\nIn the code this function is defined as follow:\n\n```\nvoid ProtocolGame::sendUseItem(const Position& position, int itemId, int stackpos, int index)\n{\n    OutputMessagePtr msg(new OutputMessage);\n    msg->addU8(Proto::ClientUseItem);\n    addPosition(msg, position);\n    msg->addU16(itemId);\n    msg->addU8(stackpos);\n    msg->addU8(index);\n    send(msg);\n}\n\n```\nAs you can see, this function has 4 parameters, but in assembly code it only pushes 2 args. See picture below.\n\n\n\nWhat is going on with this CALL procedure? Shouldn't it have 4 arguments?\n\n",

It will more likely be __thiscall instead, so ecx does contain a parameter, but it will be the hidden this pointer, and not one of the four named argument. I agree that more context is needed to be sure, though.",

Are those mov and lea instruction confusing you? If you've expected to have 4 push instruction in a row, then let me disappoint you: compiler can insert as many instructions as it likes between the push instructions. And let let me disappoint you again: push instruction is not the only way compiler can pass the arguments through stack.\n\n",
