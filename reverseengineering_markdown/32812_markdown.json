  "content": "I have run the following commands at a breakpoint in gdb and I don't understand how the x/d $rdx commands returns two different values, one before and one after x/s $rdx is executed. To my understanding x is just for reading values?\n\n```\n(gdb) x/d $rdx\n0x555555559180: -6681\n(gdb) x/s $rdx\n0x555555559180: \"\\347\\345\\377\\377\\221\\345\\377\\377\\261\\345\\377\\377\\270\\345\\377\\377\\277\\345\\377\\377\\306\\345\\377\\377\\315\\345\\377\\377\\324\\345\\377\\377\\002\"\n(gdb) x/d $rdx\n0x555555559180: -25\n\n```\nI guess it's more likely I'm misunderstanding something in terms of the x command and how it works so any info on that would be really helpful.\n\n",
