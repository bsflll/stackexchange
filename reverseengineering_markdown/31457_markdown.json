I'm guessing some kind of global table or something, but I can't make heads or tails of what it is. What would this be in regular C code?\n\n",

But to the best of my knowledge IDA and Hex-Rays do not yet offer this sort of functionality. Either way, what I typically do is to try and find code that acts on (i.e. reads or writes) the data. It's practically the only way one can make sense of types during static RCE.",
