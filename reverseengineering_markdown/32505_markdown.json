Technically this is also true for Windows at the NT native API level - much more so than it lets on - but this means first and foremost that a path can be accessed uniformly through a common root. This is true on Windows (\\  -> \\REGISTRY and \\GLOBAL??\\C:) as well as Unix. My guess is that a driver exists that populates whatever is in there and you can use standard read/write to interact with that data. /proc and /sys are not much different in that respect. But I didn't see that exact system, no.",
