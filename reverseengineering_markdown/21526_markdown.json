      "content": "Although lldb help doesn't explicitly state gdb's info functions equivalent, it shows the command mapped from info function <FUNC_REGEX>. \n\nNonetheless, you may realise that info functions in gdb gives you the same output as info function .*, where .* is the regular expression that matches every function name.\n\nThat being said, from GDB to LDB command map you get two corresponding commands:\n\n```\nimage lookup -r -n <FUNC_REGEX> \n\n```\nand\n\n```\nimage lookup -r -s <FUNC_REGEX>\n\n```\nwhere the first one will find debug symbols matching <FUNC_REGEX>, while the second one: non-debug symbols matching this regular expression.\n\nThe combination of both with <FUNC_REGEX> equal .* should give you the desired result. \n\n",
