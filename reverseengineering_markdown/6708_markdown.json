  "content": "I have to check massive amount of binaries whether they were compiled with the /GS option. I assume a good indicator would be to check if they have stack cookie or not. Do you know any tool that can do this, or any tool that I could build into a script, so I don't have to do it manually?\n\nFound Binscope, I'll check if it's capable to check more binaries at the same time or it's scriptable.\n\nIt requires debug symbols, so this is not a solution.\n\nhttps://github.com/NetSPI/PEchecker\n\n",
