  "content": "Hello I am trying to obtain the music from the new game Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp. The music is contained in files like these:\n\nThey seem to be split up and saved locally, like this:\n\nAlthough the split up files contain no header, you can see the FSB5 headers inside both, which means they contain music. Although no program I've tested knows how to extract or convert these.\n\nThe files do not look encrypted. But cutting out the FSB's do not produce anything valid. Any ideas?\n\n",

The .unity3d files contained within are the typical Unit3d webpack files. You can google around for a depacker for those, there are several.\n\n\n\n",
