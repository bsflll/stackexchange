  "content": "i want to do kernel debugging on my vm from another vm.\n\nMy setup is pretty simple,\n\nDebugged - VM:\nWindows XP SP3 x32 (To be debugged)\n\nDebugger - VM: \nWindows 7 SP1 x64 (With Windbg installed - the Debugger)\n\nthe pipe configuration is pretty simple as well..\nboth ends should be set as The other end is a virtual machine, and on the XP VM i set the pipe as This end is the server and on the Win7 vm i set This end is the client. Im using Vmware Workstation 10.0.3 btw..\n\nI know i did setup my XP vm correctly because i can debug it from the host easily - configuring The other end is an application and connecting it with Windbg from my host computer (Win7 x64) and its working properly. So i know there is no problem with my Win-XP setup\n\nBut doing the same thing from the other vm, nothing happens. I looked through the internet and i even followed tutorials that explained exactly what i already did.\nI have no idea what i'm missing and i feel pretty helpless so i came asking here.\n\nAnyone got any ideas what is the problem with my setup?\n\n",

      "text": "@JasonGeffner, It does look a little different than my setup, yet its still not working. The difference is (Between what i thought is correct): They put on the Debugged vm The other end is an application when the other side is a VM that is supposed to debug it.   Also on the windbg, the pipe name they use is \\\\.\\com1 instead of \\\\.\\pipe\\com_1 which is what i did. Nonetheless its still not working even with their setup",
