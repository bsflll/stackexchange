  "content": "I'd like to write a Radare2 plugin for a legacy 48-bit word-oriented CPU which has two 24-bit instructions per word, and, naturally, uses word addressing. I wrote a disassembler plugin which prints the instructions, but it is hard to follow the control flow.\nIt would be nice to have word offsets printed on the left instead of the byte offsets, and to be able to specify the way raw instructions are printed.\n\nIs it possible in the current version?\n\nInstead of\n\n```\n        0x00001800    002041       mode 101\n        0x00001803    2a04b0       seti 2260(r2)\n        0x00001806    aa0542       seti 2502(r12)\n        0x00001809    6a7fd2       seti 77722(r6) ; 0x0000007f \n        0x0000180c    00855f       ld   2537\n        0x0000180f    000585       st   2605\n        0x00001812    01e041       shr  1\n        0x00001815    6005b4       st   2664(r6)\n        0x00001818    6f8403       loop 2003(r6)\n\n```\nI would like, ideally, to get something like\n\n```\n           02000 00 002 0101    mode 101\n                 02 24 02260    seti 2260(r2)\n           02001 12 24 02502    seti 2502(r12)\n                 06 24 77722    seti 77722(r6)\n           02002 00 010 2537    ld   2537\n                 00 000 2605    st   2605\n           02003 00 036 0101    shr  1\n                 06 000 2664    st   2664(r6)\n           02004 06 37 02003    loop 2003(r6)\n                 ...\n\n```\n(The 0x0000007f comment is likely due to the x86 analyzer which kicks in by default, is that right?)\n\n",
