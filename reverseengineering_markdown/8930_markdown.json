      "content": "One of the close reasons on Reverse Engineering is:\n\n... and you don't appear to understand the \"concepts involved\". This is because I asked for a \"binary\", and you posted a paste bin link that starts like this:\n\n```\n00000000 11011010 11110111 11101111 00101111 01001100 00000000 11011010 11110111 11101111 00101111 00110000 11010011 10101010 00000001 00001001\n00000100 01100110 01110010 01100101 01100101 00000001 00000111 01110000 01110010 01100101 01101101 01101001 01110101 01101101 00000001 00000111\n(1998 similar lines omitted)\n\n```\nA 'binary', in the context of Reverse Engineering, is an original file. As it is in binary, before you can parse it, you have to know the exact file format, which seems to be not documented. A cursory search for the first few bytes lead to nothing (if they were known, they could indicate a magic number for this particular file type).\n\nBut all is not lost yet. After converting the (*cough*) binary to a real file again and inspecting it with a simple hex viewer, I noticed plain text strings, where the byte immediately before it indicated the length of that text string. Further examination - looking at the values immediately following the text strings - indicated there is at least a single other byte before the length/data sequences. Not all data are plain text, but that was enough to quickly make up a C program and display what could be read.\n\nAll the program initially did was read two bytes, show them, and then display n characters that immediately follow. I let the program start at a 'reasonable' position, further up in the file, because the first few entries did not seem to follow the exact same format.\n\nThis was okay for the very first entry (I got a few lines of data and a text string), but right after that it got lost and didn't display anything useful. Careful examination of the 'failure point' showed that at least one value was special: hex 78, followed by another number, did not indicate that the second number was a data length. So I treated that as a special case: 'no data', and looped on with the rest.\n\nFor the first 65 entries this went okay-ish: a regular list of raw data, text string, followed by 4 other lists of raw data. Only after that, the same problem appeared again: the list went 'out of sync' and displayed gibberish again. Further examination showed another problematic type byte: 08. This seems to have two bytes of fixed data. When I treated that as a special case as well, I got loads more useful output.\n\nAt that point I stopped, because the general idea was clear. I found it not worth looking further into what the 'raw' data bytes mean, because they do not clearly indicate 'time stamps' or 'song lengths'. The first set of 16 bytes may indicate a hash or an encryption key; the 4 other sets, all 20 bytes, could be the data you are looking for - but they are not in a regular format.\n\nI skipped the first 70 or so bytes because I did not immediately could see what they were for – I strongly suspect they contain metadata about the list itself (its number of entries, for example).\n\nNote that the 'text strings' are encoded using UTF8. The 'unknown' characters in\n\n```\n\"Skrillex and Diplo present Jack [c3][9c]\"\n\n```\nis actually a regular encoding of \"Jack Ü\", which is \"an American DJ duo, side group and collaborative project\" (source). Recognizing 'regular' data sequences such as these is an acquired skill (and verifying that the interpretation is valid is plain common sense; it is only a quick Wikipedia lookup).\n\nWithout further a-do, I wrote up the following C program in less time than it took to write this post.\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main (void)\n{\n    FILE *f = fopen (\"spotify.bin\", \"rb\");\n    int i,type,len;\n\n    if (!f)\n    {\n        printf (\"no file?  \n\");\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    fseek (f, 0x45, SEEK_SET);\n\n    do\n    {\n        type = fgetc(f);\n        if (type == EOF)\n            break;\n        type &= 0xff;\n        len = fgetc(f) & 0xff;\n\n        printf (\"type %02X len %02X: \", type, len);\n        switch (type)\n        {\n            case 0x08:\n                i = fgetc(f);\n                printf (\" %02X\", i & 0xff);\n                printf (\"  \n\");\n                break;\n            case 9:\n                printf (\"\\\"\");\n                while (len--)\n                {\n                    i = fgetc(f);\n                    if (i >= ' ' && i <= '~')\n                        putchar (i);\n                    else\n                        printf (\"[%02x]\", i & 0xff);\n                }\n                printf (\"\\\"  \n\");\n                break;\n            case 0x78:\n                printf (\"  \n\");\n                break;\n            default:\n                while (len--)\n                {\n                    i = fgetc(f);\n                    printf (\" %02X\", i & 0xff);\n                }\n                printf (\"  \n\");\n        }\n    } while (1);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\n",
