  "content": "I didn't know That we've got a Reverse Engineering community around here :D\nI am very glad on that....\n\nanyway...\nI haven't used IDA Pro for quite some time, upgraded to win 10 in the mean time.\n\nI am unable to launch debugging directly from IDA Pro. WinDbg is setup correctly, windbg attaches a process just fine on itself. WinDbg has been added to the PATH variable.\n\nWhen i try to launch debugging from ida PRO,or attach I get the error:\n\n\"Could not initialize WinDgbEngine (..) %1 is not a valid Win32 application\"\n\nideas? seems like something is wrong with parameters passing?\n\n",

I don't remember the exact details but opening .dmp files directly with WinDbg required setting up the shell extension registry key somewhat differently. Can you open a .dmp file by double clicking it? If not, you could research that and that might also solve your issue.",

      "content": "Normally, to solve that problem in WinDbg, I just have to run the Debugger as Administrator, and the (%1 is not a win32 application) message goes away when I use Open dump file with WinDbg.  It only happens if you try to double click a dump file without having the correct permissions. I know it's pretty basic, but always run IDA Pro or WinDBG as administrator and that message should not appear.  \n\n",
