  "content": "I have two NFC readers, reader A reads card ID numbers according to the ISO standard and the algorithm is publicly available. Reader B is from a Canon printer. The card numbers read by reader B are 1.52 times larger than those read by reader A for the same card.\n\nIs there a genius who can help me figure out the encryption algorithm of the NFC reader B?\n\nHere are some card data for reference.\n\ncard1:\nreader A：0565932061\nreader B：0863528701\n\ncard2:\nreaderA：0100347102\nreaderB：0153111486\n\ncard3:\nreaderA：1816830668\nreaderB：2772241676\n\ncard4:\nreaderA：1530064599\nreaderB：2363059447\n\ncard5:\nreaderA：3783796822\nreaderB：5773610326\n\nmy card is standard mifare m1 card.\nreader B is from cannon c5560i printer.\nAccording to the ISO14443-a standard：The first four bytes of my card is 1D 70 BB 21, reversing the orde gives 21 BB 70 1D which is the value 565932061 in decimal.\n\nso:\nreader A：0565932061 ：ISO standard\n\nreader B：0863528701 ：unknown\n\nAs you can see the value B shows is approximately 1.52 times more，So I think it's possible to find an algorithm compared to those with irregular encryption.\n\nWho can help me figure out the encryption algorithm of the NFC reader B?\n\n",
