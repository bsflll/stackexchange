  "content": "I have a dos file/database(decades old) that I need to extract into MS Excel or My SQL.\nI am using a MacBook.\n\nThe file appears to have no extension.\n\nThe file type I can see when I do \"get info\" after a right-click is, \"kind: Unix Executable File\".\n\nwhen I hit the \"file\" command on my terminal, this is what I get, \"Atari 68xxx CPX file (version 4143).\"\n\nI need to filter some data through this file/database, for example, print files with the title \"XYZ\".\n\nCurrently, I am using DOSBOX to do it. But it is manual, and I am only able to filter my files one at a time.\n\nIt would save hundreds of hours of misery if I could automate this process. I can code in java and javascript. I can also use MySQL. But I have no idea how to start on this problem.\n\nIt would be great if I could convert this dos database into excel or MySQL database. Or I could also write some java programs to do the filtering.\n\nBut I have little clue on how to approach this problem.\n\n",
