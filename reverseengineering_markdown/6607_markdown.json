  "content": "I have a packed executable. To take care of the unpacking, I would like to extract the in-memory version of the process, which would ideally be rolled back into the equivalent Mach-O binary -- such that it can be viewed in a disassembler -- I do not need the unpacked file to be runnable.\n\nA Windows version of the same program exists, and it is also packed. Utilities such as PE Tool make this task simple: you select the process, then the module, and then you have an unpacked binary.\n\nI am not able find any applications that can do this on the OS X side. I can imagine two broad approaches with runtime in mind:\n\nI would appreciate any advice on either of these points. I have an OS X environment at my disposal though I am not familiar with it.\n\nAdvice relating to solving this problem through static analysis would also be appreciated\n\n",
