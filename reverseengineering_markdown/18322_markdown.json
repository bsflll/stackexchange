  "content": "I am currently trying to bypass a CRC check, that exists inline on many places in an application to check if memory pages in the .text section have been modified.\n\n\nShort explanation of the crc32 instruction:\n\nOkay so: rsi contains the pointer of the next memory page that gets scanned and rax is the offset/counter. rdx is usually 200 (200 loops).\n\nMy goal: find where rsi is set. There has to be some instruction like mov rsi, next_memory_page_to_be_scanned.\n\nGoing further up in code:\n\n\nSo here are the loop vars initialized (rdx,rax).\n\nGoing more up:\n\nSo here is one of the things I am stuck: the yellow marked part seems to be the first instructions I can bp that gets executed before CRC_CHECK. I mean some other place obviously calls it, but I don't know how to find that place.\n\nI tried to follow the return pointer: \n\nbut the return pointer points to nothing basically. Breakpointing one instruction above (and [rcx], al) won't trigger the bp (seems to not have anything todo with the CRC check). How do I backtrace this further?\n\nThe value of rsi lays also not on the stack when I bp the CRC.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

      "content": "Jumping off of Igor's suggestion of a trace, have you tried a break and trace via Cheat Engine yet? If not, consider the following:\n\nNow work your way down the list of recorded instructions (which will take you back up through callers with each branch). You can watch the registers on the right-hand side, as well as the stack via the Stack View window. You can double-click on any instruction in the Tracer to take you to that instruction in the disassembler, where you can then read up through sub-routines from callers.\n\nIf there isn't enough branching for you, then run the trace again and change the initial number of instructions traced from 1000 to whatever you'd like. Also, if you find your way into a caller's sub-routine and there are other calls from within it that you'd like to drill down into, simply run another break/trace at some point before the call, then do not select (or de-select, if it's already selected) Step over instead of single step.\n\nFinally as another tip, in the Memory Viewer, if you run Tools -> Dissect Code, you can then select the base module and any other dependencies to run a bunch of automated tasks on, like finding all referenced strings and functions, and finding all xrefs to all routines!\n\nThe xrefs one is great for being able to head to the prologue of any given function (right-click on any instruction and choose Select current function, then scroll to the top) and quickly see how many callers there are (of which you can double-click any of to go to them).\n\nThis allows you to quickly see if a function is shared, thus potentially acting as a pivot point to either patch with a ret (or however you'd prefer to patch), or allowing you to choose which specific call instructions to that particular function you'd like to individually patch.\n\n",
