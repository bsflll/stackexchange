  "content": "I have disassembled two armv7 files in IDA. I am trying to figure out how I can create a patch to change one to another.\n\nThe original file has:\n\n```\n__text:00017B60 loc_17B60                           ; CODE XREF: sub_17384+5B2j\n__text:00017B60                                     ; sub_17384+636j\n__text:00017B60                 MOV             R0, #(aImageCheck - 0x17B6C) ;\n__text:00017B68                 ADD             R0, PC  ;\n__text:00017B6A                 BLX             _warnx\n__text:00017B6E                 MOV.W           R11, #0x50\n__text:00017B72                 B               loc_17956\n\n```\nThe modified files has:\n\n```\n__text:00017B60 loc_17B60                           ; CODE XREF: sub_17384+5B2j\n__text:00017B60                                     ; sub_17384+636j\n__text:00017B60                 B               loc_17B16\n__text:00017B60 ; End of function sub_17384\n__text:00017B60\n__text:00017B62 ; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n__text:00017B62                 STR             R1, [R1,#0xC]\n__text:00017B64                 MOVT.W          R0, #0\n__text:00017B68                 ADD             R0, PC  ;\n__text:00017B6A                 BLX             _warnx\n__text:00017B6E                 MOV.W           R11, #0x50\n__text:00017B72                 B               loc_17956\n\n```\nIn essence, we're forcing a branch to another address, instead of continuing.\n\nIn IDA, when I go to the byte patch menu, I get the following for the MOV I want to change: \n\n```\n4D F6 C9 60 C0 F2 00 00 78 44 10 F0 46 EA 4F F0\n\n```\nIn the patched file, I get the following for the new Branch:\n\n```\nD9 E7 C9 60 C0 F2 00 00 78 44 10 F0 46 EA 4F F0\n\n```\nThe difference between both is the beginning: D9 E7. Does this mean D9 is the Branch, and E7 is the loc_17B16? How would you translate loc_17B16 to the byte value?\n\nAny insight would be appreciated.\n\n",
