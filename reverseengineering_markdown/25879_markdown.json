  "content": "To get a basic understanding of the ELF format, I'm writing a basic program to generate a valid elf file from the most basic assembly output. I'm going step-by-step so I'll probably ask a few questions here as I make my way through it. I've generated the first 16-bytes of the header and verified that it's the same from a gcc-compiled program on my machine (nothing special, since those first 16-bytes are almost always the same). Here is what I have so far (using python):\n\n```\n# https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/elf.pdf\nb = bytearray()\n\n# (1) magic header\nb.append(0x7F) # starting number\nb.extend([ord('E'), ord('L'), ord('F')])\n\n# (2) ei-class ('capacity') -- 1 for 32-bit, 2 for 64-bit\n# uname -m # x86_64\nBITS_32 = 1\nBITS_64 = 2\nb.append(BITS_64)\n\n# (3) ei-data ('data-encoding') -- 1 for little-endian (standard), 2 for big-endian\nLITTLE_ENDIAN = 1\nBIG_ENDIAN    = 2\nb.append(LITTLE_ENDIAN)\n\n# (4) ei-version -- always will be 1 -- \nEV_CURRENT = 1\nb.append(EV_CURRENT)\n\n# (5) ei-pad -- padding --> pad 0's up to 16 bytes\nb.extend([0,] * (16-len(b)))\n\nprint('%s  \nLength: %s' % (b, len(b)))\n\n```\nAnd I get:\n\n```\nbytearray(b'\\x7fELF\\x02\\x01\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00')\nLength: 16\n\n```\nI have a few questions about this:\n\n",
