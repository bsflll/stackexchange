  "content": "I have learned about how to get xref to a stack variable,but it is in the form of \nassembly:idapython - Get Xrefs to a stack variable\n\nThis way works well on a variable like [ebp+var_0] but do not support the registers.Some times if  a segment error occurs on an instruction like \"mov eax,[esi]\", I have to know where the value of \"esi\" comes from,so I need to make sure I can get xref to a register.\n\nIt also means I have to do more work about analysis even if ida has provided.\nI think the xref in the form of pseudocode is more clear and convenient, just like what i am used to look up in ida:\n\n\nida define the stack data and registers to variables like \"v1\" or \"v13\",and then I can get xref by press 'X'.\nI have searched for some time,including the examples in github.There are some ways to get xref to the global variables but not the stack variables.So if there exist any API about this?\n\n",
