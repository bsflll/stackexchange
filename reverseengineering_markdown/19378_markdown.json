  "content": "I tried to disassemble a ELF file which is a shared object file executed on armv7a (Android). I saw a strange block. It seems  that the PC, program counter register, is set to 0. Did I miss something or do something wrong?\n\nThe process goes into 0x1708 in ARM mode. Below is the strange block of asm code I disassembled from the ELF file.\n\n```\n; section: .plt\n; function: function_1708 at 0x1708 -- 0x1718\n0x1708:   04 e0 2d e5       str lr, [sp, #-4]!\n0x170c:   04 e0 9f e5       ldr lr, [pc, #4]\n0x1710:   0e e0 8f e0       add lr, pc, lr\n0x1714:   08 f0 be e5       ldr pc, [lr, #8]!\n; data inside code section at 0x1718 -- 0x171c\n0x1718:   b4 77 00 00                                        |.w..            |\n\n```\nAfter executing line 0x170c, the LR register should be set as the value at the address 0x1718. The value is 0x77b4 (this file is stored in little-endian).  And go ahead.\n\n```\n0x1710: lr += 0x1710 + 8  // lr = 0x8ecc\n0x1714: pc = *(lr + 8)    // pc = *(0x8ed4)\n        lr += 8  \n\n```\nAnd 0x8ed4 is in .got section.\n\n```\n; section: .got\n0x8eac:   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   |................|\n0x8ebc:   00 00 00 00 58 70 00 00  e0 6e 00 00 00 00 00 00   |....Xp...n......|\n0x8ecc:   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 08 17 00 00   |................|\n0x8edc:   08 17 00 00 08 17 00 00  08 17 00 00 08 17 00 00   |................|\n0x8eec:   08 17 00 00 08 17 00 00  08 17 00 00 08 17 00 00   |................|\n0x8efc:   08 17 00 00 08 17 00 00  08 17 00 00 08 17 00 00   |................|\n0x8f0c:   08 17 00 00 08 17 00 00  08 17 00 00 08 17 00 00   |................|\n0x8f1c:   08 17 00 00 08 17 00 00  08 17 00 00 08 17 00 00   |................|\n0x8f2c:   08 17 00 00 08 17 00 00  08 17 00 00 08 17 00 00   |................|\n0x8f3c:   08 17 00 00 08 17 00 00  08 17 00 00 08 17 00 00   |................|\n\n```\nIt seems that the value at 0x8ed4 is zero. I traced to this strange block from JNI_OnLoad(), so no data should be modified before executing this block.\n\nDid I do something wrong, or is this a specific behavior of ARM architecture?\n\n",

      "content": "In fact, the behavior you are describing is coming from the usual behavior of the GOT/PLT sections. They are used to dynamically link the program calls to shared libraries functions at runtime.\n\nIn fact, a shared library can be loaded at any place in the process memory, there is no way to predict statically where it will pop up. So, the GOT/PLT load the address of each library's function dynamically at runtime and cache it for further use.\n\nThe way it works is pretty simple, the PLT (Procedure Linkage Table) is just a bunch of small code gadgets (one for each library's function called in the program, plus one generic code located at the beginning of the PLT section).\n\nAnd, the GOT (Global Offset Table) is just a table used to store (and cache) the addresses of the library's functions.\n\nAt first, the GOT is all set to zero because no function address has been resolved yet. The GOT get filled all along the program is executed and call new functions (some functions may be called only rarely and their address may be only rarely filled in the GOT).\n\nWhen a library function get called the program counter goes to the PLT (see the figure below) and executes the code specifically written for this function (each of the code gadget has its own offsets to get the proper address from the GOT). But, at first, the GOT contains only zeroes, so you need to initialize it.\n\nTo initialize it, you jump at the very beginning of the PLT and find the address of library's function the program want to call. You execute this code and, then, you write the address of the function in the GOT.\n\n\n\nOnce you cached the address of the function, you do not need anymore to recompute the address if you call your function and you jump directly to it (as in the following picture).\n\n\n\nIn the case of ARM, you have two types of GOT/PLT schemas:\n\nIn your case, this is a direct PLT (but it seems to be quite old code, I would suspect an old compiler or so, because new ones better use ip in place of lr for that).\n\n```\n; section: .plt\n; function: function_1708 at 0x1708 -- 0x1718\n0x1708:   04 e0 2d e5     str lr, [sp, #-4]! <-- Save lr on the stack\n0x170c:   04 e0 9f e5     ldr lr, [pc, #4] <-- Get a point of reference in memory\n0x1710:   0e e0 8f e0     add lr, pc, lr <-- Load offset to the next step\n0x1714:   08 f0 be e5     ldr pc, [lr, #8]! <-- Jump to the next step\n\n```\nNote that the PLT is a static section, therefore the 0x170c will always stay the same (and, therefore, the pc will always be loaded with the same value at 0x170c).\n\n",

      "content": "While the other answer is not wrong, it does not actually cover the real issue: how come that calling a zero address does not lead to a crash?\n\nAFAIK there is no official standard or complete documentation for this, but de facto the first few GOT entries are special/reserved and are used by the dynamic loader/linker (sometimes also called interpreter) for its own purposes:\n\nThe snippet you quoted is the resolver stub which is called on first call of an external symbol (you can see that all GOT entries are initialized to its address, 1708). It fetches GOT[2] and jumps to it, which should end up in the dynamic linker, which would look up the symbol, patch the GOT entry and jump to the function as the last step.\n\nAs I said, there are no (AFAIK) official docs on this, just random pieces of the ELF ABI spec, glibc source code and various blog posts. I would suggest you to step through this code in a debugger to see what actually happens, and match it against the source code. In addition to links from @perror, I found this post which explains some of the reserved GOT entries (although for x64 Linux and not ARM Android).\n\n",
