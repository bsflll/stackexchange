  "content": "I'm trying to understand how the procedural generation in a particular Unity 3D game works. I do not have the source code/project file, just a windows build.\n\nI've opened up a dll called Assembly-UnityScript.dll with ILSpy and found some classes, but it's not immediately apparent how the classes are put together, i.e. how and when methods on the classes are called.\n\nI've looked at some tutorials but they are all concerned with injecting their own code into the game. I'm just interested in how my target game does what it does. \n\nIs there any straightforward way to figure out how the classes are used?\n\n",

I didn't expect building to work but I tried it anyways and the build errors out when it gets to a part in a CompilerGenerated namespace called __enterName_Update$callable0$30_61__. I'm guessing that's some kind of hook/callback back into the rest of the game, where the part I\"m currently interested in takes place.",
