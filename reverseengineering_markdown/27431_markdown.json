  "content": "If I change any character in the firmware file and try to flash it, it will failed. But it will successfully flashed if I changed the string with the same number of character if it's not a function.\n\nAfter further searching, I found out about the checksum and that in order to flash the custom firmware, you need to calculate it and modify it in the firmware.\n\nThis is the firmware:\n\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/ok2c0qodao5fld1/Nokia_215_4G_readed_test.pac/file\n\nI use HxD to read the file.\n\nIf I search for checksum, I got some results ->\n\n\n\nAlso, I searched for sha ->\n\n\n\nSo here, I tried to change == with != and also I changed it to 1 == 1 but, It always failed to flash\n\nI am lost. I don't know what to search for or from where to start.\n\nI hope that someone could help me out!\n\nNote: I can provide access to my PC to try the flash tool (nokia tool v0.060 using easybox) and maybe debugging in the phone.\n\n",
