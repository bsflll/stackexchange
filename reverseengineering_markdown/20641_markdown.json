  "content": "I have a PE executable which uses threads to handle most of its functionality. It uses CreateThread API to spawn local threads to handle functions.\n\n\n\nThe call to the CreateThread returns a valid handle value.\n\n\n\nThe problem is sometimes I don't see the thread getting created.\n\nOr other times the thread gets created but none of the code that's specified at that thread's start address gets executed.(even though the thread is created with the dwCreationFlags parameter being set to 0)\n\nWhat would the problem be?\n\nP.S. I can't share the executable but I can provide more screenshots.\n\n",

      "content": "I cannot tell specifically what your problem is (as is often the case with RE).  Something I would recommend though is trying kernel debugging with Windbg.  It's excellent because it has far more capability than ollydbg, albeit with a steeper learning curve.  \n\nSpecifically you can have Windbg break on thread creation.  No thread can begin without going through the operating system, and windbg catches that.  \n\nNote: you are going to need to set up kernel debugging with Windbg which means you will need a VM.  You should probably be doing your dynamic analysis in a VM anyways...\n\n```\nSXE ct\n\n```\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/controlling-exceptions-and-events\n\n",
