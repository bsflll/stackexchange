      "content": "TLDR: In radare2, while debugging, you use dr <register>=<val>\n\nUse the -d flag to begin Radare2 in debugging mode\n\n```\nr2 -d /usr/bin\n\n```\nYou'll have a prompt in front of you, type v and then p a few times to get to the debugging view.\n\nPress colon to enter commands. You'll most likely want to analyze the binary. To do this, press colon and then aaa or aa. Note, that aaa does could take more time, but does performs a more in-depth analysis.\n\nOnce in debugging mode, use db [address] to set a breakpoint. For example, to set a breakpoint at main\n\n```\ndb main\n\n```\nAnd you can get to main, enter s main. This jumps to main (s is for seek).\n\nThen, if you want to change the register rdi\n\n```\ndr rdi=0x20\n\n```\nFor more register options, see: https://r2wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/options/d/dr/\n\n",
