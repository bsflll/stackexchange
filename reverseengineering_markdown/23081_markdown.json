  "content": "I remember that hexrays has the option to generate a dummy struct from a pointer. That is if we access a pointer in offsets 0x36, 0x24 it will create a struct with members off24 , off36. \n\nIn what cases do I see this option in the menu? Or how to make it appear?\nI remember that I got it once and it helped me. But since I don't see it , where it is very logical. So, I guess I don't understand its logic. \nEither this, or it is not present in IDA 7.4 .\n\n",
