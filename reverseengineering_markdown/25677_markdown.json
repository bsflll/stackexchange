  "content": "I am quite new in binary exploitation. I am doing a lot of beginners exercise here. I am confused about ASLR. I tried some binary exploitation thing in Linux. It was recommended that I should stop ASLR in Linux before analyzing the binary.\nit is the command for that --> echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space\nAm I right here? am I turning off my ASLR (randomizing stack addresses)?\n\nBut When I did the Windows 10 binary exploitation(vulnserver). I had to put my payload into stack address. And I noticed that the stack address (jmp esp) was constant, not changing.\nIs ASLR works differently in various OS?\nI don't know If I am asking a write question. please tell me if you know.\n\n",
