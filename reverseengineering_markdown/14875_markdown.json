  "content": "I am working on a MIPS binary: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-II version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=76438e9ed749bcfc6e191e548da153d0d3b3ee28, not stripped\n. IDA Pro 6.95 (32 bit) disassembles the file pretty well, yet the decompiler gives up: Sorry, the current file is not decompilable. Doesn't IDA Pro have decompilation support for MIPS?\n\n",

See hex-rays.com/products/decompiler for more details.\nRegarding other news and features see decompiler news page.\n\nUpdate (12/3/2020):\nThe original answer was written ~2017, and since then IDA added MIPS decompiler support. AFAIK it was added in version 7.5.2.\nSee here for comparison between decompilation and disassembly for various MIPS variants.\n\n",
