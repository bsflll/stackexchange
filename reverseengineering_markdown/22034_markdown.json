  "content": "I am trying to reverse a 32-bit Win32 GUI application. It was compiled using Visual C++ 6.0 and uses the Win32 API. I am trying to figure out what happens when I click any particular button in the application. The problem is, whenever I stop execution using a debugger (x32dbg) execution is in a Win32 DLL file, not in an application function.\n\nAny suggestions on how to tackle this? How do I determine what happens when I click any particular button?\n\nThank you\n\n",

You probably want to breakpoint the instruction following GetMessage() or whatever mechanism is being used.",
