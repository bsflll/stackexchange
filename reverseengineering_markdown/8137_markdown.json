  "content": "I have recorded a video from a set top box which I am not able to see on my computer/laptop. I have already tried multiple video converter softwares and converting it too. \nPlease !! I would really appreciate if someone could help me in watching and decoding and reverse engineer this file format. Also, I dont know which tags to include in this question. If somebody could suggest some tags, I would change it accordingly.\n\nYou can get the file here (8 MB only, a small recording)\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/5d62xkm1kj4sq7p/193135ZEE%20CLASSIC0.mpg?dl=0\n\n",

So it would appear that you would need that key in order to be able to decrypt the video stream's data.\n\n",
