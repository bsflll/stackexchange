  "content": "Unlike LogMeIn or GoToMyPC, TeamViewer does not have any driver files except for the INF and GPD files. LogMeIn and GoToMyPC have their own configuration and driver dlls, while TeamViewer uses the default unidrvui.dll for config and unidrv.dll as driver file. \n\nI don't seem to understand how Teamviewer is able to develop a virtual printer driver without writing their own driver dll.\n\nVNC also seems to follow similar way, they use unidrvui.dll and unidrv.dll, but they have one more custom dll VNCui.dll (guess this is also a config dll).\n\nHave anyone tried to reverse engineer TeamViewer or VNC's virtual printer driver? Please shed some light on this.\n\n",
