  "content": "As part of some school research I'm experimenting with Frida to see what can be done to bypass SSLpinning.\n\nAs I was hooking some methods of an application that throw SSLPeerUnverifiedException I logged the error argument saying: Certificate transparency failed.\n\nI tried to inform myself about certificate transparency and concluded that the error was raised because my proxy-certificate that I was using was not found in the transparency log.\n\nIs this assumption correct and is this also something that can be bypassed using Frida?\n\n",
