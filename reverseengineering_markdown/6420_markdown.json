  "content": "As part of an assignment, I am trying to do some debugging in iexplore.exe (Aurora vulnerability).\n\nAfter I load the test webpage in iexplorer 8, I open windbg and attach to the iexplore process.\n\nI verify my symbolpath by using:\n\n```\n.sympathy\nSymbol search path is: srv*C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\Symbols\nExpanded Symbol search path is: srv*c:\\users\\user\\desktop\\symbols\n\n```\nI know that what I am interested in is inside of mshtml, so I list all the symbols in mshtml via:\n\n```\nx /t /n mshtml!*\n\n```\nNext, I use:\n\n```\nu mshtml!CEventObj::GenericGetElement\n\n```\nTo see the function I am interested in and discover that one of the instructions I want to examine is at:\n\n```\nmshtml!CEventObj::GenericGetElement+0x91\n\n```\nI try setting a breakpoint at that address by:\n\n```\n bp mshtml!CEventObj::GenericGetElement+0x91\n\n```\nThen, I run:\n\n```\nbl\n\n```\nAnd the breakpoint shown is actually at:\n\n```\nmshtml!CEventObj::GenericGetElement+0x3b\n\n```\nWhy isn't my breakpoint at the point I specified ?\n\nAlso I have tried using:\n\n```\nu mshtml!CEventObj::GenericGetElement+0x91\n\n```\nAnd the code is totally different than when I simply unassembled the entire function based on the symbol address for the function.\n\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",
