  "content": "I'm able to see the packets before they're encrypted by setting a breakpoint before the encryption subroutine. My problem is that this subroutine is really complicated and goes really deep. Which steps should I follow in order to obtain this encryption function? Or rather to be able to decrypt this packet protocol?\n\n",

Set hardware breakpoints on those data tables, and step over the encryption function. Or, check where these tables are used, and set normal breakpoints on the code that uses them. Or, look at the source code of open-source implementations of these, and compare the source with your subroutine.",
