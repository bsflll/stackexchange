  "content": "I've some experience with gdb and debugging in Linux environment (I'm studying computer science at University and I'm able to handle bof in Linux).\n\nThe problem now is on a Windows program. I start it up but after a few seconds a popup appears with the message \"You are not connected to the Internet\", although I am regularly connected to the Internet. I am trying to parse the assembly code and debug with OllyDbg. First I searched for the string \"You are not connected\" but I didn't find it anywhere. On closer analysis, I found that the error popup appears when the eip is inside the ntdll dll library and sometimes win32u. I am attaching two screenshots to explain myself better. How do I know where the problem lies? Is it correct to say that the problem lies within a dll? Thank you\n\nWith your help, I found the function that calls the MessageBox. But unfortunately I think it is part of a very long loop and it is difficult for me to be able to identify the problem. I was noticing, that when the program starts, the ASCII string \"Error writing temporary file ..\" is loaded. Does it correspond to an allocated variable or is it a message I should see when I start the program? Maybe that's the problem\n\n\n\n",
