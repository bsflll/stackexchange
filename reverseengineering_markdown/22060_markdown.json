  "content": "I have been trying to debug a crash using windbg on windows xp sp3. I have been getting the below error while trying to debug. I googled around and found the Microsoft no longer offers symbols exe as downloads and we need to link the MS symbols server in windbg. I tried that route too, but still failed to get rid of this error.\n\nERROR: Symbol file could not be found.  Defaulted to export symbols for ntdll.dll - \nntdll!DbgBreakPoint\n\nIs there a way I can download the symbols for windows xp sp3 on to my local machine and then run the windbg.\n\n",
