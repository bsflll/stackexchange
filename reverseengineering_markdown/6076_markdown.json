  "content": "I'm trying to reverse engineer a PHP obfuscator. I know that it pre-compiles the PHP to bytecode, so the recovery of original PHP source is out of scope, but I would still like to get the bytecode out. The problem is that I don't know what it looks like. I can see stuff being decoded in memory (e.g. I encode echo \"abcdefg\"; and I can see the string in memory, but I'm not sure where does the bytecode start or what is the structure of it). Is there any documentation or examples of PHP byteccode online?\n\n",
