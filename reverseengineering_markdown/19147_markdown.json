  "content": "Okay so not too long ago i was introduced to the concept of hooking/detouring, it took me some time to get my head around, but despite the lack of information available, eventually i was able to hook BeginScene and EndScene using IDA, MS Detours and one of the sample d3d9 applications for testing.\n\nBut i realised, that was just one way to do it, so i decided that i'd like to also become familiar with the other methods i'd seen used.\n\nThis led me to do some studying on V-Tables, and more specifically, a practice that has been described as dynamic patching of V-Tables.\n\nI found that the typical way of doing this for DirectX is to create a \"Dummy device\" Then alter it's V-Table, which supposedly affects all instances of the device class.\n\nI went on to try create a scaled down environment using my own class with a single virtual function and some code that instantiated said class, then continuously called said function.\n\nI then injected some code that had access to a copy of this class, it created a new instance and attempted to patch the V-Table function pointer with that of another function.\n\nBut i soon found that the way i'd set it up just didn't work as i'd expected.\nI'm quite certain it modified the V-Table, but only for that instance of the class. \n(i'd tested this by combining the code into a single program which simply called the function, grabbed the V-Table, modified it to point to another function, then called the function again to confirm it had been swapped)\n\nSo i wonder, what is it about DirectX that makes it possible to patch the original V-Table using a new instance of a device class/object?\n\nIs hot patching something specific to COM, or is there some other explanation, maybe i have it all wrong?\n\n(EDIT)\nHere's what i'm trying to do.\n\nTarget:\n\n```\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass A {\npublic:\n    virtual void doThing() {\n        cout << \"Class A doThing\" << endl;\n    }\n\n};\n\n\nvoid dynamicOverride() {\n    cout << \"Function replaced\" << endl;\n}\n\n\nint main()\n{\n\n    A* a = new A();\n    while (1)\n    {\n        a->doThing();\n        Sleep(2000);\n    }\n\n    system(\"pause\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\nCode to inject:\n\n```\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass A {\npublic:\n    virtual void doThing() {\n        cout << \"Class A doThing\" << endl;\n    }\n\n};\n\n\nvoid dynamicOverride() {\n    cout << \"Function replaced\" << endl;\n}\n\n\nvoid MainThread()\n{\n    A* a = new A();\n    void** vtable = *(void***)a;\n\n    DWORD curProtection;\n    VirtualProtect(&vtable[0], 4, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &curProtection);\n    vtable[0] = dynamicOverride;\n}\n\n```\nI've seen this done in code that hooks various d3d9 functions, most refer to it as creating a dummy device.\nBut in this case when i try use a class in a DLL and inject the code to modify the V-Table for that class. It never affects the instance of that class in the target process.\n\n",

It means there will be a straight call to A::doThing instead of a reference through the vtable. Another possibility is that the compiler caches the result of the VTable lookup of the first invocation of doThing and reuses the cached address.",

I expected both instances of A class to be treated by the target process as actually being the same class, from what i know all class instances share a V-Table, and i'd like to be able to re-write the V-Table function pointer from the DLL.  As i said, i have seen code that does this but i'd like to be able to re-create it in my own scenario and understand how/why it works.",

      "content": "You are absolutely on the right track \n\nBut,\n\n```\nA* a = new A();\n...\na->doThing()\n\n```\nIs not going to bother with the vtable at all. Because a can only be of A type. MSVC will still create the vftable, but in that context a->doThing() will just become A::doThing()\n\nHere, I fixed up your example into my own to demonstrate that you were correct, you just needed to call doThing through some level of inheritance to trigger the vftable lookup.\n\nThe A_vftable struct also provides a better representation of what the vtable would be if you could see it.\n\n```\nclass Base {\npublic:\n    void virtual VirtualMethod1() = 0;\n    void virtual VirtualMethod2() = 0;\n};\n\nclass A : public Base {\npublic:\n    A() {\n        printf(\"A Constructor  \n\");\n    }\n\n    void virtual VirtualMethod1() {                 \n        printf(\"VirtualMethod1  \n\");\n    }\n\n    void virtual VirtualMethod2() {\n        printf(\"VirtualMethod2  \n\");  \n    }\n};\n\nstruct A_vftable {\n    void(*VirtualMethod1)(A* self);\n    void(*VirtualMethod2)(A* self);\n};\n\nint main() {\n\n    A a;\n    A_vftable* vtable = *(A_vftable**)&a;\n\n    vtable->VirtualMethod1(&a);\n    a.VirtualMethod1();\n\n    DWORD oldprotect;\n    VirtualProtect(vtable, sizeof(vtable), PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &oldprotect);\n    vtable->VirtualMethod1 = vtable->VirtualMethod2;\n    VirtualProtect(vtable, sizeof(vtable), oldprotect, NULL);\n\n    a.VirtualMethod1(); // calls A::VirtualMethod1()\n    Base* b = &a;\n    b->VirtualMethod1(); // calls our redirected function\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\nOh and void dynamicOverride() actually has different arguments to virtual void doThing(). \n\ndoThing() is actually void __thiscall doThing(A* this)\n\nsince dynamicOverride() is missing the arg here, it's bad, but not catastrophic because in a __thiscall the first arg is passed through ECX. \n\nBut not knowing this is a good way to blow the stack, and yourself up later down the line.\n\nAlways replace a hooked function with one that handles the args/calling convention exactly.\n\n",
