  "content": "I am using Qemu with its internal GDB server to attach IDA Pro to an instance of Windows 8 x64.\n\nThere are some problems to solve, because when I am connecting to the GDB server, I am just seeing a bunch of memory.\n\nI was able to solve the first parts with this script.\n\nThe script tries to get the pdb information for each loaded module, but I want to get IDA to analyse the loaded modules themselves, as there are already all needed information in the PE header (I think). Is this possible with IDA or with IDAPython?\n\nEdit: I was able to set a module for every detected segment with these commands:\n\n```\nfrom idaapi import module_info_t\ncurrent_module = module_info_t()\ncurrent_module.base = 0xFFFF...\ncurrent_module.size = 1234\ncurrent_module.name = \"ntoskrnl.exe\"\nidaapi.add_virt_module(current_module)\n\n```\nBut if i activate \"Analyse module\" nothing happens.\nIs it possible, that the PE header in memory is not complete?\n\n",
