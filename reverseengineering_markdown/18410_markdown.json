  "content": "When I'm using Windbg (in kernel mode) to step into assembly, I would encounter context switching once in a while - which is annoying.\n\nSo, for example, I placed a breakpoint for a process - let's call it A.exe using bp /1 /p <EPROCESS OF A> nt!NtDeviceIoControlFile. A runs, hits the breakpoint and as I am stepping into the assembly, sometimes, the context switches - so the current process, instead of A, becomes B. \n\nIs there anyway to prevent this from happening?\n\n",
