  "content": "I have a Winbond W25Q64JVSSIQ flash chip that supports SPI. I've connected BusPirate through a SOP8 cable to the memory chip. PWR and VREG LEDs are on, so they're connected. BusPirate is connected to a Kali Linux VM on my host. I'm using the command, sudo ./flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0 to identify the chip, but flashrom isn't able to.\n\n```\nroot@malnet:/opt/flashrom# sudo ./flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0\nflashrom v1.1-rc1-121-g8962267 on Linux 4.19.0-kali5-amd64 (x86_64)\nflashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org\n\nUsing clock_gettime for delay loops (clk_id: 1, resolution: 1ns).\nBus Pirate firmware 6.1 and older does not support SPI speeds above 2 MHz. Limiting speed to 2 MHz.\nIt is recommended to upgrade to firmware 6.2 or newer.\nNo EEPROM/flash device found.\nNote: flashrom can never write if the flash chip isn't found automatically.\n\n```\nHow do I get the firmware dumped from the chip? Any ideas as to why flashrom may not be working or alternate methods to dump?\n\n",
