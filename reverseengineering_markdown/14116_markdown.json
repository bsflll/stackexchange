  "content": "I have encrypted Android so library that decrypts itself on load. I want to get its unencrypted code. For me it looks good idea to dump that library from memory when application started.\n\nI used /proc/self/maps to get loaded process memory map. I found 3 segments that correspond to the library in memory maps and used /proc/self/mem to dump these 3 segments to binary files. So, I got 3 binary files: code, writable data and read only data.\n\nDoes anyone know how to parse these 3 binary files and assemble them back to so file that Android can run & debug?\n\n",

Need root.\n\nMemory editor tab - menu - memory dump - select range and folder - press ok - wait for toast \"Dump end\".\n\nHere some video examples how to do this:\n\nBut it not enough for build valid ELF (.so) file from dump. It is impossible because some data from ELF used only on load and never stored in memory. And some other data (relocations for example) changed during ELF load.\n\n",

I'm not sure if you can recover decrypted .so file.\n\nCustom GDB only works on ARM-based devices running Android 4.4.4 and below. If you want to get it work for 5.x.x, you need to bypassing PIE security check but there is a risk of bricking your device. https://www.alphagamers.net/threads/guide-bypassing-pie-security-check-android-5-0-up.242363/\n\n",
