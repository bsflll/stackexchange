Something equivalent on breaking on the main method (first line of the code)? Or I need to calculate the entry point manually? If so, how?\n\n",

      "content": "Binaries are usually stripped. For ELF binaries, you can check it with file command\n\n```\n$ file /bin/true\n/bin/true: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.26, BuildID[sha1]=0x73796652ea437df8ac7b3ba1864a7ac177e27600, stripped\n\n```\nNotice the stripped at the end of file's result. It means, among other things, that symbols have been removed, so it won't find main function. \n\nIn order to run the binary and stop the debugger right after the load, there is some kind of universal method that should almost always work (kind of universal, not 100%)\n\nYou have to find the entry point, retreived by this command :\n\n```\n$ readelf -h /bin/true | grep \"Entry point\"\n  Entry point address:               0x401264\n\n```\nThen load the binary into your favourite debugger (lldb, gdb, ...) and break on this address.\n\nlldb :\n\n```\n$ lldb /bin/true\n(lldb) target create \"/bin/true\"\nCurrent executable set to '/bin/true' (x86_64).\n(lldb) br s -a 0x401264\nBreakpoint 1: address = 0x0000000000401264\n(lldb) r\n...\n(lldb)\n\n```\ngdb :\n\n```\n$ gdb -q /bin/true\nReading symbols from /bin/true...(no debugging symbols found)...done.\ngdb$ b *0x401264\nBreakpoint 1 at 0x401264\ngdb$ r\nBreakpoint 1, 0x0000000000401264 in ?? ()\ngdb$\n\n```\nOnce you've loaded your binary and your breakpoint has been triggered, you can display following instructions that will be executed this way :\n\nlldb :\n\n```\n(lldb) x -s4 -fi -c11 $pc\n-> 0x401264:    xor    ebp,ebp\n   0x401266:    mov    r9,rdx\n   0x401269:    pop    rsi\n   0x40126a:    mov    rdx,rsp\n   0x40126d:    and    rsp,0xfffffffffffffff0\n   0x401271:    push   rax\n   0x401272:    push   rsp\n   0x401273:    mov    r8,0x403560\n   0x40127a:    mov    rcx,0x403570\n   0x401281:    mov    rdi,0x4011c0\n   0x401288:    call   0x401060 <__libc_start_main@plt>\n\n```\ngdb :\n\n```\ngdb$ x/11i $pc\n=> 0x401264:    xor    ebp,ebp\n   0x401266:    mov    r9,rdx\n   0x401269:    pop    rsi\n   0x40126a:    mov    rdx,rsp\n   0x40126d:    and    rsp,0xfffffffffffffff0\n   0x401271:    push   rax\n   0x401272:    push   rsp\n   0x401273:    mov    r8,0x403560\n   0x40127a:    mov    rcx,0x403570\n   0x401281:    mov    rdi,0x4011c0\n   0x401288:    call   0x401060 <__libc_start_main@plt>\n\n```\ni flag means instruction, and $pc means Program Counter (equivalent of EIP/RIP for 32/64 bits architecures). You can see that __libc_start_main will be called at address 0x401288. Its man page indicates its first argument is a pointer to binary main function. 1st argument is here loaded in rdi register, meaning that main function is located at address 0x4011c0.\n\nYou just have to finally place a breakpoint at this address (0x4011c0) and you'll be at the beginning of your binary main function.\n\nFurther reading : How to handle stripped binaries with GDB? No source, no symbols and GDB only shows addresses?\n\nGood luck and have fun !\n\n",
