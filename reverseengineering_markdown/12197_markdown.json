      "content": "The default output is in Intel syntax. Precisely, Ollydbg 1.10 uses MASM, IDEAL or HLA syntax which are both based on Intel syntax. AT&T syntax is not available in version 1.10 but it is available in version 2.0\n\nFor Ollydbg 1.10 you can choose between MASM, IDEAL or HLA in Options -> Debugging Options -> Disasm.\n\nFor Ollydbg 2.00 you can choose between the AT&T syntax and the mentioned above in  Options -> Options -> Code (Code options)\n\n",
