  "content": ".\nHello, everybody!\n\nFor my scientific work I need big amount of benign PE-files(dll, exe, scr, com). An amount of 500-600 files would be great.\nWhile there are plenty of websites where you can download malware, I have not found one where you may download a big amount of non malicious executables. \n\nDo you have some ideas where I could obtain such a big amount of Portable Executables which are not malicious?\nThank you in advance!\n\n",

These people may need additional benign files along with malware to compare them and do a research. That is why it is technical too and I believe that it is changing with the same pace as malware stuff. Don't be so strict, there are plenty of questions where somebody asks to find something.",

They have the option to automate installation of setups and also keep the dropped files.\n\nYou can go to download.com or softpedia.com and download a large amount of setups/installers(crawler is suggested), put them in a folder and run an automatic analysis on them. You will get a list of folders with each analysis where you can search for *.exe, *.dll, etc. \n\nSuggestion: as some setups come bundled with toolbars, adware, etc, I suggest running a virustotal scan for all the files you obtain in order to have 100% clean set.\n\n",

If it's an academic project, they might provide to you. Except them, I don't know who else might have such lists of safe PEs.",
