  "content": "I am looking at the registry keys created for three programs from a now defunct company, one of which is trial software. One entry of interest is the REG_BINARY key InstallTime. I have an idea of what the dates are supposed to be based on program install times. Actually, more curiously, it has different values under HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\n\nFirst line is under HKCU\\SOFTWARE, second is under HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\n\n11/30/16\nCBHome\n\n```\n46 f2 f7 39 8d 4b d2 01\n46 f2 f7 39 8d 4b d2 01\n\n```\n7/1/01\nCBPro\n\n```\n85 53 c1 13 18 3a c1 01\n7d 49 8e f1 93 02 c1 01\n\n```\n11/2/22\nCWViewer\n\n```\n94 01 d7 b8 37 ef d8 01\n94 01 d7 b8 37 ef d8 01\n\n```\nIt wasn't until I put this together that I realized that they match except for the second one. Not sure why.\n\n",

      "content": "Interpreting the values as unsigned long 64 bit integers and comparing to your dates suggests that these are date/time stamps with 100ns resolution and with a  base around January 1601.\n\nThis would be consistent with the values returned by the windows function GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime. This returns a FILETIME structure containing the UTC date & time with a base date of 1 January 1601.\n\nTreating your values as FILETIMEs and formatting appropriately (using SHFormatDateTime) gives the following values -\n\n```\n01D24B8D39F74246 => 01 December 2016, 04:41:48\n\n01C13A1813C15385 => 10 September 2001, 17:46:02\n01C10293F18E497D => 02 July 2001, 02:11:37\n\n01D8EF37B8D70194 => 03 November 2022, 03:52:41\n\n```\nThe dates are the day after you quoted. I'd surmise that this is because your dates are local time and that you are 5 or more hours behind UTC and installed the programs in the evening.\n\nIn your 2nd example which has 2 dates, perhaps one is an initial installation date and the other is some form of update date ?\n\n",

Funny thing is, it has a hard-coded expiration date of Sept 30, 2001, a whopping 20 days after that first date in its registry keys. Also, the first date key for this one stayed the same when I uninstalled the software and reinstalled on a later date",
