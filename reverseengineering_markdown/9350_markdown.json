  "content": "I have no idea how, when or why, but now, the \"default address\" (the one executed when pressing F9) is 0x77960884. It should be 0x00401000 (when I manually go to 0x00401000, everything works).\n\nThe problem is, I manually have to change the Origin every time I run any program.\n\nAdditionally, restarting Windows / reinstalling OllyDBG doesn't fix it. A few hours ago it was working fine, but now... \n\nI have no idea.\n\n",
