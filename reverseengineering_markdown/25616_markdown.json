  "content": "Sorry English isn't my first language.\n\nI noticed something when setting breakpoints in GDB. It appears that they are ignored if symbols aren't loaded.\n\nI have found it weird how GDB behaves when there are no symbols at all loaded and if I want to debug something I am having to set a break point at __libc_start_main@plt and nexti until I reach a the main binary.  I also noticed that I cannot disassemble there in the main binary either (I receive this odd message \"No function contains program counter for selected frame.\"), but that aside it break points are essentially ignored. I have found an odd work around and that is setting\n\n```\nset *0x56555878 = 0xcc \n\n```\nMy questions are:\n\nEdit: It looks like I cannot set *breakpoints in glibc but I can when I land in int main() program , But while in the int main() , I lose ability to disassemble.\n\n",
