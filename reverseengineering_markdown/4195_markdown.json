That may be all you need to provide whatever support you need to do.\n\nTo get \"a\" source code in Objective-C or in any higher language you will have to analyse the structure of your working assembly program and translate it into the language of your choice.  \n\nHowever it will never be \"the\" original source code, in all its glory.\n\n",
