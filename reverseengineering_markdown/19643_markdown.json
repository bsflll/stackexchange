  "content": "I've been trying to analyze an ARM binary but cannot figure out how the operators and operands are stored in the bytes of a program.\n\nFor example, by looking at the disassembly listing of an ARMv7 binary,  I cannot deduce what the opcode for cmp is from these three lines, nor do I understand how it's encoded or how it's operands are encoded:\n\n```\ncmp r5, #0; 0x2d00\ncmp r4, #0; 0x2c00\ncmp r0, r2; 0x4290\n\n```\nHow is the cmp operator, and it's respective operands encoded into two bytes?\n\n",
