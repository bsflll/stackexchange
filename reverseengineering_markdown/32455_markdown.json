  "content": "I am trying to find the correct Data Segment, corresponding to a certain File in a 16bit DOS Game.\nThe Assembly Instructions for the Decompiled .exe File in IDA Pro Version 5, I am looking at.\n\nI was wondering, is there a difference to DOS Assembly Hexadecimal, for a File, than a File opened up in a modern Hex Editor ? I use HxD the File in question, opened up in that Hex Editor is Offset(h):220A\n\nAn example of Assembly Instruction in the decompiled code is :- mov  ds:264Ah, ax\n\nthere is no Code with ds i.e. Data Segment ds:220Ah so what Value should I be looking for, if there is differences ? And are there any online converters, to help me achieve this ? or does anyone know how do work it out manually ?\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\n",

      "content": "Tip:\n\nDOS exe get \"relocated\" when loaded by DOS/Dosbox - and only the non header part of the EXE gets loaded at the load-segment behind the PSP\n\nand IDA offsets are relocated differently: normally to base adress 0x1000 and start segment is 0\n\nso there is a mapping between the real loaded EXE, the EXE as a file and the EXE loaded in IDA\n\nto your hex-question:\n\nhex is hex but there are many difference when talking about \"offsets\"\n\nyou want to read a book, written in encrypted chinese - without knowing anything about decryption AND chinese\n\nand the answer is completely different if the game is using some sort of non-standard overlay-technique or many other only-this-game-exe related stuff like self modifiying code, memory reduction techniques, partially packed data, strange stuff that were only done in the old times of coding\n\nand you still asking questions like the 4 before - questions out of context, no information what you already know, that just does not work\n\nreverse engineering is much more suffering as you think\n\nmaybe come up with a small assembler example and help people to explain that to you - maybe one i've already sent :)\n\n",
