  "content": "I'm debugging this process which has a lot of anti debugging techniques in it, and I faced something new which I don't know how to bypass yet.\n\nChanging the code dynamically causes exceptions to occur and the process to crash.\nSo setting INT 3 breakpoints is not an option. The way I'm debugging the process is only with Hardware Breakpoints.\n\nNow I have found the function (at least one of themâ€¦) which reads portions of the memory and using some CheckSum function over that memory, and then it checks if the memory CheckSum is as it expected. If I changed one byte in the memory, the CheckSum would not be as expected, thus the process would crash. This is actually very simple and done like this in the code:\n\n```\nCMP EAX,EDX                  ; Compare CheckSum\nJE __GoodCode                  ; jmp must be taken\nCALL <CrashProgram>\n__GoodCode: \nXOR EAX,EAX\n...\n\n```\nThe hex value of JE short is 0x74 0x0B and I want to change it to JMP short which is 0xEB 0x0B. When I do that, the program would crash.\nI found out where the program is crashing using Memory breakpoints at different places of the code and then I found the function doing the CheckSum (it reads all the memory). But now I figured out there is another existing function which probably does something similar! causing the program to crash.\n\nBut this time when I put a Memory breakpoint on my 'changed' JE to JMP it never stops on the breakpoint.\n\nSo this is my first problem, another problem I had is that I had a function I suspected had something to do with the crashing when changing the code, but when I set a Hardware breakpoint on it, it didn't break. I know for sure that this function is being called and the code definitely runs. So I thought to myself there is probably something making sure my Memory & Hardware breakpoints won't work, some sort of anti-debugging mechanism.\n\nI read a little bit about it and found out about GetThreadContext, in my case it calls Wow64GetThreadContext. It receives a Context structure which holds most registers. Here is how the Context structure looks like:\n\n```\nCONTEXT _X86_\n\ntypedef struct _CONTEXT {\nDWORD ContextFlags;\n/* ContextFlags contians CONTEXT_DEBUG_REGISTERS. */\nDWORD Dr0;\nDWORD Dr1;\nDWORD Dr2;\nDWORD Dr3;\nDWORD Dr6;\nDWORD Dr7;\n/* ContextFlags contians CONTEXT_FLOATING_POINT. */\nFLOATING_SAVE_AREA FloatSave;\n/* ContextFlags contians CONTEXT_SEGMENTS. */\nDWORD SegGs;\nDWORD SegFs;\nDWORD SegEs;\nDWORD SegDs;\n/* ContextFlags contians CONTEXT_INTEGER.*/\nDWORD Edi;\nDWORD Esi;\nDWORD Ebx;\nDWORD Edx;\nDWORD Ecx;\nDWORD Eax;\n/* ContextFlags contians CONTEXT_CONTROL */\nDWORD Ebp;\nDWORD Eip;\nDWORD SegCs; // MUST BE SANITIZED\nDWORD EFlags; // MUST BE SANITIZED\nDWORD Esp;\nDWORD SegSs;\n/* ContextFlags word contains CONTEXT_EXTENDED_REGISTERS */\nBYTE ExtendedRegisters[MAXIMUM_SUPPORTED_EXTENSION];\n} CONTEXT;\n\n```\nThe first parameters are my Hardware breakpoints and I can see them clearly, but it doesn't seem like it does something with their values. So I don't think it's this function which is causing the crash. Whenever it is called, it seems more like a debug code. Also, this function is never called regularly - only after the program is crashing.\n\nNow there is also ReadProcessMemory which I read it might bypass my Memory breakpoints for some reason. I set logging breakpoints on that function and it never seemed like it reads a Page(size 0x1000) close to the function I changed, and yes I checked the size it was reading as well.\nAlthough this function is called regularly it still doesn't seem like this is it.\n\nI have also heard about ZwProtectVirtualMemory functions to change the attributes of memory regions so that the Memory breakpoint 'exceptions' won't occur, and the debugger won't receive them. This function is being called out, but I'm not sure what is the usage, or what parameters are relevant to me in the memory.\n\nIs there anything else I might be missing?\n\nThe article I was reading which was helping me quite a lot, but did not help me find out what was causing the crash:\nhttp://waleedassar.blogspot.in/2012/11/defeating-memory-breakpoints.html\n\nI have changed my wording of this question. I hope it's clearer now.\n\n",

If the thread is hidden from the debugger then breakpoint exceptions will not be caught by a debugger but will be passed to the program, if unhandled - it will crash.\n\n",
