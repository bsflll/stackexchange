      "content": "Reduced to the minimum, this is how you get the name of a function and the module in Python 3:\n\n```\nimport ida_funcs\nimport ida_nalt\nimport idc\nimport pathlib\n\nreg_address = idc.get_reg_value('EAX') # or use the register relevant to your case\nfunc_name = ida_funcs.get_func_name(reg_address)\n\n# if you want to use the main image name:\n#image_name = pathlib.Path(ida_nalt.get_input_file_path()).name\n\n# if you want to use the segment from which the function is coming from:\nimage_name = idc.get_segm_name(reg_address)\n\nprint(f'{image_name}:{func_name}')\n\n```\nPlease note that this probably works properly only in case you have multiple images in the same database. Otherwise idc.get_segm_name might actually return the actual segment name, not the image name.\n\nYou can easily rewrite that for Python 2 if needed by not utilizing the pathlib and change the print()-function to be a print-statement in case you want to access the original image file name.\n\n",
