  "content": "It seems some possibly legit software, but also malware does wmiadap.exe /f /t /r. Apparently it's part of their anti-debugging attempts. (On Linux some such software I've seen drops a coredump_filter instead, in /proc.)\n\nI've looked at the Win docs for wmiadap but I don't quite understand the point:\n\nThe /t flag is not documented (there, by MS).\n\nHow does that wmiadap.exe /f /t /r help with anti-debugging?\n\n",
