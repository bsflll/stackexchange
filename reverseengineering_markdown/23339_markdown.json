  "content": "Assume we’re on an x86-64 machine and that we have read-access to the state of a program at a given instant, but we don’t have debugging symbols; in particular, we can read the program’s address space and the registers.\n\nIs it possible to reliably determine the depth of the call stack? Under which assumptions (e.g., calling conventions)?\n\nBy the depth of the call stack I mean the number of call instructions minus the number of ret instructions that have happened in total in the course of the execution of the program. In the following pseudo trace, the number in the bracket is the depth of the call stack after the instruction in the respective line:\n\n```\nadd eax ebx [0]\n...\ncall 0x1234 [1]\ncall 0x2345 [2]\ncall 0x3456 [3]\nadd eax ebx [3]\njmp 0x4567  [3]\n...\nret         [2]\n...\nret         [1]\ncall 0x1234 [2]\n...\nret         [1]\nret         [0]\n\n```\nI’m not yet an expert in x86, calling convention and the stack layout. However, I vaguely suppose that one can “walk” the stack with the help of the ebp and esp registers.\n\n",

      "content": "ret instructions are not going to the call stack. When a function executes call, the next instruction address is pushed to the stack and when ret instruction is executed, eip is updated with the next instruction from the stack. \n\nAfter the next instruction address is popped from the stack by ret, the address at the stack will most likely be overwritten by a stack frame of a function. Therefore it's impossible to know at a given time, how many calls were made until this point from the beginning - what you call depth of the call stack. \n\nA possible implementation of the current depth will be parsing the values from esp to the bottom of the stack, looking for pointers - values that point to the .text or any executable page of your memory. \n\n",
