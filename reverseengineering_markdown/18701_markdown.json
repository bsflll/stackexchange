  "content": "If I want to find all references to fs:[0x28] how would I go about doing it with radare2? For example,\n\n```\n0x000006b5      64488b042528.  mov rax, qword fs:[0x28]    ; [0x28:8]=0x1978 ; '(' ; \"x\\x19\"\n\n```\nI want to find all lines that reference fs:[0x28], like the one above. This address is used as a stack canary, and I'm especially interested to see what is reading from it.\n\n",

It just takes a string that's being converted to a number and that's all. If you want to see all the places where fs:[0x28] being used why not search for this part of the opcode?\n\n```\n[0x004049a0]> /c fs:[0x28]\n0x00402a19   # 9: mov rax, qword fs:[0x28]\n0x00403f81   # 9: xor rcx, qword fs:[0x28]\n0x00404dc1   # 9: mov rax, qword fs:[0x28]\n0x00404de6   # 9: xor rdx, qword fs:[0x28]\n0x00405431   # 9: mov rax, qword fs:[0x28]\n0x004054ea   # 9: xor rbx, qword fs:[0x28]\n...\n\n```\n",
