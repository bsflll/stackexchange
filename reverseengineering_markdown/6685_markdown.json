      "content": "One way to do is create a new process using CreateProcess with dwCreationFlags as CREATE_SUSPENDED. Next attach to the suspended process using your debugger, and resume all threads.\n\nSome other way would be to edit the PE file and change the bytes at the entrypoint to EB FE.\nThis is an instruction that jumps to itself, i.e. it is an infinite loop. Next start the application normally. Now use a debugger to attach to it. Restore the original bytes at the entrypoint and resume the process.\n\n",
