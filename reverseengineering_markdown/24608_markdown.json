The char for underscore could be different char in the binary, I sometimes see that for '$'. \n\nIt might be that the address is the same as a function might have and for some reason the function did not get analyzed correctly.\n\nFor most cases you should just get two labels, one for function name and one for section, pointing to the same address.\n\n",
