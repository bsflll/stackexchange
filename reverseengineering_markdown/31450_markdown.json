  "content": "I'm step by step debugging a program in IDA.\nThe program uses the Qt-toolkit.\nThe function that I'm stepping through is handling a json document.\nFor example here it is accessing the key workgroup and putting its value in v15 (pseudocode):\n\n\nv15 represents RAX, but when I take a look add the address RAX, I do expect to see the workgroup value but instead I see just zeros:\n\n\nHow can I see the textual value of the workgroup key of this json document?\n\n",
