  "content": "I need to write a script that uses the r2pipe API to call the radare2 instance, analyze notepad.exe, and have it return a JSON-represented list of each function in the binary along with its virtual address. I used the link below for help, but I still can't figure out how to do it.\nI have installed r2pipe bindings and radare2.\n My python file looks somewhat like this,\n\n```\nimport r2pipe\nimport json\n\nr2 = r2pipe.open(\"/bin/ls\")\nx=(r2.cmd(\"pd 10\"))\njson.dumps(x)\n\n```\nLinks i used to understand,\n\nhttps://github.com/radare/radare2/wiki/R2PipeAPI\n\nhttps://github.com/pwntester/cheatsheets/blob/master/radare2.md\n\n",
