  "content": "I am trying to extract the squashfs filesystem of my router. Here is firmware.\n\nFirst, I unzipped the file. Next, I ran binwalk to get some information about the file.\n\n```\nDECIMAL     HEX         DESCRIPTION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n58          0x3A        TRX firmware header, little endian, header size: 28 bytes,  image size: 6656000 bytes, CRC32: 0x2B1713B2 flags/version: 0x10000\n86          0x56        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 65536 bytes, uncompressed size: 3614368 bytes\n1282426     0x13917A    Squashfs filesystem, little endian, non-standard signature,  version 3.0, size: 5367357 bytes,  853 inodes, blocksize: 65536 bytes, created: Wed Aug  7 05:08:47 2013 \n\n```\nI then ran binwalk -e to extract the contents of the file. I got three files:\n\n```\n.\n├── 13917A.squashfs\n├── 56\n└── 56.7z\n\n```\nRunning unsquashfs on 13917A.squashfs failed, saying it was unable to find the magic block. This was because the file was using a non standard magic. Changing the magic to a standard one made unsquashfs and file detect it as a squashfs file system. But unsquashfs did not complete successfully:\n\n```\ncaff@UbunutuX2:~/Netgear/test$ unsquashfs 13917A.squashfs \nReading a different endian SQUASHFS filesystem on 13917A.squashfs\nFilesystem on 13917A.squashfs is (768:0), which is a later filesystem version than I support!\n\n```\nI also tried extracting the file system by using Jeremy Collake’s Firmware Mod Kit. This failed also:\n\n```\ncaff@UbunutuX2:~/Netgear/test$ /opt/firmware-mod-kit/trunk/unsquashfs_all.sh 13917A.squashfs \nAttempting to extract SquashFS .X file system...\n\n\nTrying ./src/others/squashfs-3.4-nb4/unsquashfs-lzma... Skipping others/squashfs-hg55x-bin (wrong version)...\nFile extraction failed!\n\n```\nHow do I extract this squashfs file system?\n\n",
