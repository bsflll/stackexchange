  "content": "I am new to reverse engineering and after some research, I haven't found a clear way to do what I want to do.\n\nI have an ELF file, but not the original source code that generated it. It is really simple and just prints some numbers. I wanted to make a small change in the range of numbers it prints. I have disassembled it and figured out where the change must be made, but I am not sure how to make this change.\n\nIs there a way to edit disassembled code and still generate an executable file? Or should I figure out where in the hex file is the  corresponding information that I want to change and use a hex editor?\n\n",
