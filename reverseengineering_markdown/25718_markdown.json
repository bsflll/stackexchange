  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/25718/trying-to-edit-the-source-code-of-aoc-monitor",
  "content": "So long story short the AOC monitor comes with a G-Menu gui that lets you customize different monitor features. One specific one I am interested in is the \"Dial Point\" setting. Where it overlays a red circle cross hair over the middle of the screen. I am trying to figure out how to reverse engineer through the code to find the img or code variables for the Dial Point cross hair so I can remove this obtrusive red circle they put over it. Ive tried opening the .dll files in visual studio then I tried dotPeek to see if I could use that I feel like im getting closer to a solution but as of right now im kinda worried im going in circles and dont want to waste too much time on this. Ive never really reverse engineered the code of a monitor so I dont really know where to start. Im a CS student so I know how to code a fair bit at this point but if I cant find the source code of what im looking for then I cant edit it. Any help is appreciated.\n\n",

Im almost positive when I purchased it I had to go to the website to download it since I dont see how a monitor would install a program to a pc on its own. Basically im trying to see if there is a way into their software to swap out the design they have for the cross hair as its kinda overkill but I strongly prefer red over white which most games use for cross hairs its just easier on my eyes.",
