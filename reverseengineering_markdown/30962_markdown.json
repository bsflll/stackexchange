  "content": "I am trying to parse an ELF file using custom code. With reference to the image below (output displayed is from objdump), I need to get the address of code gadget starting at , for example 401030 for the symbol printf@plt in the .plt section  , so for example when I get st_value for ELF64_Sym symbol printf@plt, it gives me a value of 0, and st_size is also 0. The r_offset field from ELF64_Rela also gives me the address in GOT table 404018, and not 401030. I was wondering how do I get this PC of 401030?\n\n\n\n",
