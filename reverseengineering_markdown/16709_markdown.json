  "content": "I used ollydbg to look at the disassembly of a binary I made to get some practice with reversing. When I close Olly, and then reopen it after a crash, the assembly window is at a different location. How do I search for my comments to jump back to where I was working? I've tried ctrl-g to search for them, but that only seems to search through the assembly code itself.\n\n",

Back in the days I used LabelMaster for this task.\n\nOn a personal note, I highly recommend to use x64dbg which is an active open-source project, unlike Ollydbg which is absolutely outdated. Moreover, x64dbg is inspired by OllyDbg so you should not have too many problems with migrating to it.  \n\nHere are some resources:\n\nFor the record, you can list your defined comments in x64dbg by pressing Ctrl + Alt + C or by clicking the \"View\" menu and choosing \"Comments\".\n\n",
