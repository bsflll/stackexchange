It takes more work than I'd like to spend to test to see if the binary has changed as I muck with the compile options. I'm trying to optimize for fewer instructions.\n\n",

      "content": "Well, it is not the exactly what you are asking, but could be useful for those, how are looking how to get instructions number for the function from radare2. When you are using r2pipe (a python API for radare2), you may execute radare2 commands \"aaa\" and \"aflj\" to get details for every function (including number of instructions). I suppose, these commands are available in radare2 cli, without API calls.\n\n",
