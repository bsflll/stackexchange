  "content": "We have 32bit & 64bit binaries, and in ROP (Return Oriented Programming), we sometimes target RSP/ESP, sometimes RIP/EIP, (maybe) sometimes RBP/EBP (I'm new to this, haven't seen RBP used yet). In ROP Emporium's ret2win challenge, I hit (with the target address) EIP on the 32bit binary, but RSP on the 64bit since I couldn't get my payload to hit RIP.\n\nHow do we choose which of the 3 registers to target when making a ROP chain/gadget?\n\n",
