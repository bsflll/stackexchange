  "content": "Hello reverse engineers,\n\nI'm analysing a fat Macho-O binary, and it has an ADRP and an ADD instruction in it.\nI'm talking about these instructions:\n\n```\n__text:00000001002E050C                 ADRP            X8, #some_function@PAGE\n__text:00000001002E0510                 ADD             X8, X8, #some_function@PAGEOFF\n\n```\nThe ADRP instruction has the bytes \"08 00 00 90\".\n\nThe ADD instruction has the bytes \"08 61 0D 91\"\nHow could I get the value out of the 2 instructions?\nThis is my program to calculate the address of some_function:\nIt should sign extend a 21-bit offset, shift it left by 12, and add it to PC with the 12 bottom bits cleared.\nThen I should get the last 12 bits from the ADD instruction, and add it to this value.\n\n```\n    int instr = 0x90000008;\n    //int instr = 0x80000090;\n    int value = 0x1fffff & instr;\n    int mask = 0x100000;\n    if(mask & instr)\n    {\n            value += 0xffe00000;\n    }\n    printf(\"value : %08x  \n\", value);\n    value = value << 12;\n    printf(\"value : %08x  \n\", value);\n    int instr2 = 0x910d6108;\n    //int instr2 = 0x08610d91;\n    value += (instr2 & 0xfff); //get the last 12 bits from instr2\n    printf(\"value : %08x  \n\", value);\n\n```\nAfter executing the instructions, the value 00000001002E0358 should be in X8, because that is the address of the function we want to calculate.\nThe output of my program is:\n\n```\nvalue : 00000008\nvalue : 00008000\nvalue : 00008108\n\n```\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nConclusion: I was reading the wrong ARM manual.\nThe official AArch64-manual from ARM is the one you should use.\n\nThe final code :\n\n```\n    const int tab32[32] = {\n     0,  9,  1, 10, 13, 21,  2, 29,\n    11, 14, 16, 18, 22, 25,  3, 30,\n     8, 12, 20, 28, 15, 17, 24,  7,\n    19, 27, 23,  6, 26,  5,  4, 31};\n\n    int log2_32 (uint32_t value)\n    {\n        value |= value >> 1;\n        value |= value >> 2;\n        value |= value >> 4;\n        value |= value >> 8;\n        value |= value >> 16;\n        return tab32[(uint32_t)(value*0x07C4ACDD) >> 27];\n    }\n\n    uint64_t get_page_address_64(uint64_t addr, uint32_t pagesize)\n    {\n            int bits_page_offset;\n            bits_page_offset = log2_32(pagesize);\n            return (addr >> (bits_page_offset - 1)) << (bits_page_offset - 1);\n    }\n\n    uint64_t get_adrp_add_va(unsigned char *adrp_loc, uint64_t va){\n        uint32_t instr, instr2, immlo, immhi;\n        int32_t value;\n        int64_t value_64;\n        //imm12 64 bits if sf = 1, else 32 bits\n        uint64_t imm12;\n        instr = *(uint32_t *)adrp_loc;\n        immlo = (0x60000000 & instr) >> 29;\n        immhi = (0xffffe0 & instr) >> 3;\n        value = (immlo | immhi) << 12;\n        //sign extend value to 64 bits\n        value_64 = value;\n        //get the imm value from add instruction\n        instr2 = *(uint32_t *)(adrp_loc + 4);\n        imm12 = (instr2 & 0x3ffc00) >> 10;\n        if(instr2 & 0xc00000)\n        {\n                imm12 <<= 12;\n\n        }\n        return get_page_address_64(va, PAGE_SIZE) + value_64 + imm12;\n    }\n\n```\n",
