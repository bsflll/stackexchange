  "content": "I have found the following in a trojan sample. First, it gets the token of the current process and then it calls the GetTokenInformation() API with TokenGroups as InfoClass parameter. So, it puts the TOKEN_GROUPS structure to a certain place. Later, it uses the AllocateAndInitializeSid() API with the following parameters:\n\n```\n      PUSH EAX\n      PUSH EBX\n      PUSH EBX\n      PUSH EBX\n      PUSH EBX\n      PUSH EBX\n      PUSH EBX\n      PUSH 220\n      PUSH 20\n      PUSH 2\n      LEA EAX, DWORD PTR DS:[EBP - C]\n      PUSH EAX\n      CALL DWORD PTR DS:[&ADVAPI32.AllocateAndInitializeSid]\n\n```\nSo, is the SID string S-1-20-220 ? If not, how I can extract this?\n\nNote: Some lines later, the trojan compares this SID with the SID values from the TOKEN_GROUPS structure using using the EqualSid() API. I mean, it accesses the 2nd field of TOKEN_GROUPS structure which is an array that consists of SID_AND_ATTRIBUTES structures. Each of these structures has a SID field which is compared with the initialized SID. For that reason, I would like to know how the initialized SID looks like. \n\nbest regards, \n\n",
