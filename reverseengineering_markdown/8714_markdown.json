  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/8714/use-of-ssa-single-static-assignment-while-dynamic-analysis",
  "content": "I have read that dynamic instrumentation can be done using tools like PIN or Valgrind. However Valgrind provides intermediate representation and converts the binary into SSA which makes it more convenient to perform binary analysis. Could anyone please explain why using an SSA form is more convenient. Why is it difficult to perform dynamic analysis using PIN without an Intermediate representation?\n\nThank you\n\n",

I rather point you to the best references you can find in order to deeply understand the requirement for SSA.\n\nFirst, start with Wikipedia so that you get familiarized with the basic structure and building blocks of SSA (Phi functions, ...). Then, move to this reference article published in 1991, which is a bit more hairy than the Wikipedia article. \n\nIf you want a more detailed document, though incomplete, read this book.\nIt covers a wide range of algorithms for construction/destruction and also analysis.\n\nIf you wish a long/detailed answer, let me know so that I can write a proper one.\n\n",
