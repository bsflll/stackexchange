  "content": "In the IDA view I see (glb_SomeVar is a byte array):\n\n```\ncmp al, glb_SomeVar+22h\n\n```\nBut when I hit x to find the cross references of glb_SomeVar, I only find two other matches in the same function:\n\n```\ncmp al, glb_SomeVar+0Ah\ncmp al, glb_SomeVar+0Bh\n\n```\nIs there a way to fix this, like making IDA re-analyze the selected function or even the whole code? I guess at other places, there are cross references missing too.\n\n",

For example we have an array:\n            A       db 100 dup(0)\n    If some instruction refers to the 5-th element of the array:\n            mov     al,A+5\n     with TD=3      we'll have no xrefs displayed\n     with TD=10     we'll have this xref\n\n   IDA.CFG parameter: MAX_TAIL\n\n```\n\"TD\" here refers to \"tail depth\" (old name of the setting)\n\n",

      "content": "I think the default in IDA 6.8 is a Cross reference depth of 16. I increased this first to 32 and then to 1024 and then to 65535 (because why not). None of this led to my xref working as desired so I must not understand something.\n\nI'm analyzing an ARM ELF shared object file. The function I'm looking at is called by a function referenced by an offset in the .init_array segment (not sure if that's relevant). The offset I want to see all references of is:\n\n```\n.bss:00424778 ; void *dword_424778\n.bss:00424778 dword_424778    % 4\n\n```\nIt was originally identified as unk_424778 but I pressed Y and set the type was \"void *\".\n\nHex Rays shows this assignment:\n\n```\n    dword_424778 = &_sF;\n\n```\nUsing HexRaysCodeXplorer I press J to jump back to disassembly from Hex Rays. It put me on line 0026D69C:\n\n```\n...\n.text:0026D668                 LDR             R5, [R4,R2] ; unk_424758\n.text:0026D66C                 ADD             R0, R5, #0x1C\n.text:0026D670                 STMIA           R5, {R3,R7}\n.text:0026D674                 STR             R7, [R5,#8]\n.text:0026D678                 STR             R7, [R5,#0xC]\n.text:0026D67C                 STR             R7, [R5,#0x10]\n.text:0026D680                 STR             R7, [R5,#0x14]\n.text:0026D684                 STR             R7, [R5,#0x18]\n.text:0026D688                 BL              sub_26F42C\n.text:0026D68C                 LDR             R2, =(off_374A30 - 0x374C20)\n.text:0026D690                 LDR             R3, [SP,#0x38+var_34]\n.text:0026D694                 STR             R9, [R5]\n.text:0026D698                 STR             R8, [R5,#0x24]\n.text:0026D69C                 STR             R11, [R5,#0x20]\n...\n\n```\nI don't know ARM very well but I read that the STMIA R5, {R3,R7} will result in unpredictable behavior due to the reglist ({R3,R7}) starting with a lower-number register than Rn (R5).\n\nCould the problem be related to dword_424778 being in the .bss section?\n\n",
