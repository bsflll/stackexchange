  "content": "At first it may seems that it uses ascii but the values don't match.\nThe numbers 1-15 seem to written in the first nibble(without knowing what the rest bits mean)\nFor higher values i don't have a clue.\n\nThe data received seems to be correct because the header is always right.\n\nBefore the header and after the data received there are many zeros.\n\nI donâ€™t have any information on the RFID writer I use. Is a generic Chinese with no documentation. The tag is the EM4305. And the reader I use is based on EM4095 in read only config.\n\n",

Ill do more tests with bigger numbers (the rfid copier can write up to 10 digits number). An interesting fact is that when I put 9999999999(10 digits of 9) it doesn't let me maybe it has something to do with the memory...",

You can try powers of 2 to find the actual usable width. -- If you extend your question with more and bigger values, I will extend my answer.",
