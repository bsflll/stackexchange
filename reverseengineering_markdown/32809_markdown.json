  "content": "I am trying to compare a source code to a disassembled version of a Sega Genesis (68000 processor) game. I ran the binary through IDA Pro 7.7 to disassemble it, and when I was going through the code and comparing it to the source code, I noticed that IDA Pro's disassembler labeled some instructions improperly. Is there a way to manually correct it? As it is, I cannot compile the disassembled code, because an error regarding that instruction will come up.\n\nIDA Pro identifies the code as the following:\n\n```\nROM:00005CA6 013C                                        d0              ; start of messed up disassembly\nROM:00005CA8 00F0 4E75\nROM:00005CAC\nROM:00005CAC                     _1:                                     ; CODE XREF: Findhittype+10â†‘j\nROM:00005CAC 013C                                        d0\nROM:00005CAE 001E 4E75                           ori.b   #$75,(a6)+ ; 'u' ; end of messed up disassembly\n\n```\nThe source code shows it as follows:\n\n```\n    btst    d0,#%11110000\n    rts\n.1\n    btst    d0,#%00011110\n    rts\n\n```\nChecking the opcode, it looks like the 68k disassembler does not recognize this instruction.\n\nHere is a description of the BTST instruction:\n\n\n\nIs there a way to change this? Thanks!\n\n",

By undefining (u) and then defining as code (c) pieces of code, based on the offset from where you say it wrongly identified it, should theoretically do the job. You can also manually set the instructions, but I don't remember the shortcuts for that (and don't know if the decompiler, for example, would heed those changes).",
