  "content": "I want to generate call graph from Ida pro but I want to do it automatically. I wrote these two scripts but they did not work. Could you help me what is the problem?\n\n1:\n\n```\n#include ida.idc;\n#include idc.idc;\nstatic main()\n{\ncur = MinEA()\nend = MaxEA()\nauto str_gdlpath;\nstr_gdlpath = GetIdbPath();\nstr_gdlpath = substr(str_gdlpath,0,strlen(str_gdlpath)-4)+\".gdl\";\nGenCallGdl(str_gdlpath, \"Call Gdl\",cur, end, CHART_WINGRAPH);\nMessage(\"Gdl file have been saved to %s\",str_gdlpath);\n}\n\n```\n2:\n\n```\n#include ida.idc;\n#include idc.idc;\nstatic main ()\n {\n auto str_gdlpath;\n str_gdlpath = GetIdbPath ();\n str_gdlpath = substr (str_gdlpath, 0, strlen (str_gdlpath) - 4) + \".gdl\";\n GenCallGdl (str_gdlpath, \"Call Gdl\", CHART_WINGRAPH);\n Message (\"Gdl file have been saved to% s\", str_gdlpath);\n } \n\n```\nThe command I am using to run is:\n\n```\n./idal -c -A -Sgdlscript.idc test.exe\n\n```\nIs it possible to do this in IDAPython too?\n\n",

Note that in the idc script ida has to be terminated by exit() in order for the script to return to the command prompt.\n\nThe GenCallGdl function may work as well, but the documentation is erroneous as the function works with less parameters than the Ida Help indicates.\n\nIn the output file, the .gdl extension is appended automatically. As I have no independent .gdl reader, I have not been able to control the output file if it shows the correct graph.\n\nAs a general rule for debugging such things, first let Ida show up when running the cmdline batch (i.e. without the -c -A parameters), to be able to see its errors. When everything works, run it silently.\n\n",
