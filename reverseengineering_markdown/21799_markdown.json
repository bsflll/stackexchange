      "content": "As far as I remember you need to modify stack frame of the function in order to achieve your goal.\n\nStack frame in IDA is represented by the structure which has its own id and type. \nIn order to get this structure id you need you can use idc.get_frame_id\nIn order to get structure itself in newer API (IDA 7.0 + if I remember it correctly) you can use ida_frame.get_frame\n\nAfter getting either frame id or the structure, you can modify it.\n\nIf you are working with structure, you can modify it with functions from module ida_struct.\n\nIf you are working with structure ID, you can use idc.add_struc_member.\n\nYou'll probably need to delete members of the frame occupying the required space first.\n\n",
