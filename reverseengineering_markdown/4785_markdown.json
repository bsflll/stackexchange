      "content": "As a GDB method has been presented, I will draw attention to other methods which are generally easier with other software to alter the program.\n\nHopper Disassembler (Linux, OS X)\n\nMove the cursor to the instruction to be modified, and in the edit menu select either patch to NOP (i.e. nullify instruction) or 'assemble instruction' which accepts x86 and ARM instructions.\n\n\n\nIt inserts the appropriate operation codes, and takes care of any offset adjustments to ensure the insertions do not affect the rest of the program. You can then run the program as modified and debug, or produce a new executable (ELF, Macho-O, PE/COFF).\n\nIDA Pro (Linux, Windows, OS X)\n\nEnable the patching menu by editing the idagui.cfg (with an editor with elevated privileges):\n\n```\nDISPLAY_PATCH_SUBMENU    = YES          // Display the Edit,Patch submenu\n\n```\nUse the patching menu under Edit to insert raw operation codes. Note by default IDA only auto-assembles for the IBM PC; see the Intel or ARM manuals for opcodes. IDA can then produce a new executable but often it may not work, and instead you need to resort to producing a .dif.\n\nPatchers\n\nIf you would like to create a patcher, I recommend dup2 patcher. Once you have your new executable, compare the old and new for differences in the raw hex, and then specify the changes that need to be made into the patcher creator. (Either it replaces something at a specific offset, or searches for a set of bytes and replaces those.)\n\nAlternate Methods\n\nRemember that manually editing the assembly instructions of a program is not the only way to alter control flow. Instead, you could use a DLL hook; see for example the InfoSec article here.\n\n",

It seems it's easier to install and get the GUI working now, so I'll give it a go. In principle, of course it should be able to do it, it's just a matter of how much may not be automated for you.",

      "content": "You can use the set command to enable writing to the executable's .text section:\n\n```\nset write on\n\n```\nAnd then you can use the set command again to set the actual memory\n\n```\nset {int}0xdeadc0de = 0Ã—90909090\n\n```\nBut keep in mind gdb doesn't have a built-in assembler so you'll need to know the bytes that you need to patch in ahead of time (via nasm or some other method). Depending on how complex what you're trying to do is it might be easier to just modify the necessary registers.\n\n",
