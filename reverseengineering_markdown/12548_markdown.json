Is there a better tool I could use to dump the .text section of MS Windows PE files on a Ubuntu system?\n\n",

      "content": "pedump from Mono utils is a software that does only work with .net assemblies. You can't use it to dump standard executables:\n\n```\n$ pedump /software/Windows/PortableInstalled/NavPaneCustomizer/Windows\\ 7\\ Navigation\\ Pane\\ Customizer.exe |head\n\nCOFF Header:\n                    Machine: 0x014c\n                   Sections: 0x0003\n                 Time stamp: 0x4d63c52b\n    Pointer to Symbol Table: 0x00000000\n           Symbol Count: 0x00000000\n       Optional Header Size: 0x00e0\n        Characteristics: 0x0102\n   ....\n\n```\nbut\n\n```\n$ pedump /software/Windows/PortableInstalled/wxHexEditor/wxHexEditor.exe \nCannot open image /software/Windows/PortableInstalled/wxHexEditor/wxHexEditor.exe\n$ ls -l /software/Windows/PortableInstalled/wxHexEditor/wxHexEditor.exe \n-rw-r--r-- 1 gbl users 1565696 Mai  9  2013 /software/Windows/PortableInstalled/wxHexEditor/wxHexEditor.exe\n\n```\n(the ls output shows you it's not an access rights problem)\n\nThere is a different software at https://github.com/zed-0xff/pedump that's named pedump as well, but these two have nothing to do with each other. You can proably use the online version at http://pedump.me/ if this is a once-only project, and you don't want to go through the hassle of getting a ruby environment working on your system.\n\nIf you want to use a local program, objdump works fine even for Windows PE executables:\n\n```\n$ objdump -d /software/Windows/PortableInstalled/wxHexEditor/wxHexEditor.exe \n\n/software/Windows/PortableInstalled/wxHexEditor/wxHexEditor.exe:     Dateiformat pei-i386\n\n\nDisassembly of section UPX0:\n\n00401000 <UPX0>:\n  401000:   10 1a                   adc    %bl,(%edx)\n  401002:   71 53                   jno    0x401057\n  401004:   80 67 17 4b             andb   $0x4b,0x17(%edi)\n  401008:   00 3c 3b                add    %bh,(%ebx,%edi,1)\n  40100b:   16                      push   %ss\n  40100c:   00 00                   add    %al,(%eax)\n  40100e:   ec                      in     (%dx),%al\n  40100f:   47                      inc    %edi\n  ....\n\n```\n(wxHexEditor is probably a bad example, as it's UPX-packed, but i have very few windows programs available on my Linux box right now)\n\n",
