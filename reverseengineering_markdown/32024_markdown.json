  "content": "I am missing a piece of the puzzle that is the TCP protocol the Battlefield Bad Company games use to transfer dogtag records to/from the FESL backend. The general packet structure is quite clear and I know the meaning of most of the 24 character bytestring sent for each record. However, the game shows a timestamp for each record, which I so far fail to extract from the data.\n\n```\nb'MIK813\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00E\\xb0\\xeb\\xe1\\x00\\x01\\x0e\\x00'\n\n```\nBased on this structure, the timestamp would be this\n\n```\nb'E\\xb0\\xeb\\xe1'\n\n```\nHowever, unpacking that as an unsigned int (Big Endian) gives me 1169222625. That would be some time in January of 2007. But I know that this was today. The game shows July 2nd 2023, 12:38 for this record. The Unix timestamp for that would be around 1688301494. Other records unpacked as unsigned int result in values that are not even valid as a Unix timestamp. Based on how different the values are, it also does not seem like an offset from a common timestamp.\n\nSo, how is the timestamp encoded? What am I missing here?\n\nSome more examples:\n\n```\n# July 3rd 2023 12:48\nb'Brain Wrought\\x00\\x00\\x00E\\xb0\\xeb\\xef\\x00\\x01\\x19\\x00'\n# July 3rd 2023 12:48\nb'lemenkool\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00E\\xb0\\xeb\\xef\\x00\\x01\\t\\x00'\n# July 3rd 2023 12:23\nb'FauxNameless\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00E\\xb0\\xeb\\xcc\\x00\\x01\\x19\\x00'\n# July 3rd 2023 12:17\nb'Darklord90xx\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00E\\xb0\\xeb\\xc4\\x00\\x01\\x00\\x00'\n\n```\n",
