  "content": "I am currently on Parrot Linux and have an image has a hidden steganographic inside.\n\nI know I need to decode it with Steghide in the Parrot Terminal.\n\nI also know that I will find out what the hidden steganographic data (that with be extracted to a .txt file) with this command:\n\nsteghide extract -sf IMAGE.jpg -p PASSPHRASE\n\nThe question is, using a command that steghide provides... how would I get the PASSPHRASE to find the hidden message within the image jpg?\n\nOh also, I know the seed is Found (possible) seed: \"b40d0b29\" - now I am not sure what that means and if that can assist me in anyway, but I thought I'd drop that here just in case.\n\nThanks all!\n\n",
