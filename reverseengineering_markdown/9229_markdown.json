  "content": "I am trying to extract this ONT I240w-A firmware and binwalk reports some LZMA compressed data (dump below) but the fact the all of them read \"uncompressed size: -1 bytes\" makes me suspect they are false positives.  Is this a correct assumption?  Can someone provide any suggestions on how to unpack this file?\n\n```\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0             0x0             LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n64613         0xFC65          LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n663307        0xA1F0B         LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n1277775       0x137F4F        VMware4 disk image\n1419798       0x15AA16        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n2167742       0x2113BE        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n2966631       0x2D4467        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n3649662       0x37B07E        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n4619541       0x467D15        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n5626408       0x55DA28        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n6526915       0x6397C3        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n7352076       0x702F0C        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n8028944       0x7A8310        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n8790601       0x862249        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n9628455       0x92EB27        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n10380524      0x9E64EC        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n11136805      0xA9EF25        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n11917494      0xB5D8B6        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n12590672      0xC01E50        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n13354487      0xCBC5F7        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n13954117      0xD4EC45        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n13955290      0xD4F0DA        uImage header, header size: 64 bytes, header CRC: 0xED8A6EC8, created: 2013-08-16 11:32:36, image size: 2369813 bytes, Data Address: 0x80010000, Entry Point: 0x80014110, data CRC: 0xB66029EE, OS: Linux, CPU: MIPS, image type: OS Kernel Image, compression type: gzip, image name: \"Linux Kernel Image\"\n13955354      0xD4F11A        gzip compressed data, maximum compression, from Unix, NULL date (1970-01-01 00:00:00)\n16325167      0xF91A2F        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n16476952      0xFB6B18        LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n\n```\n",

The \"file\" utility identifies the unpacked file as a TAR file, and \"tar -x\" extracts a \"tmp_file\" (only 720896 bytes).  If I use \"binwalk -e\" it does extracts a few more blocks.  I haven't been able to advance much more, but I will keep trying.  Thanks again.",
