  "content": "I investigating .Net Framework JITter compilation results and I want to get programmatically exceptions handlers chain. May be somebody can help me with this investigation? \n\nTo make task easier, I debug following code:\n\n```\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main(string[] args) { MethodA(); }\n\n    static void MethodA() { MethodB(); }\n\n    static void MethodB() \n    {\n        try { MethodC(); } \n          catch (Exception exception)  { MethodC(); }\n    }\n\n    static void MethodC() { MethodD(); }\n\n    static void MethodD()\n    {\n        try { MethodE(); }\n          catch (Exception exception) { MethodE(); }\n    }\n\n    static void MethodE() { throw new Exception(); }\n}\n\n```\nWhat's found?\n\nWhat I use: MS Visual Studio 2010, SOS extension for resolving .Net objects and metadata by address. VMMap to understand, what type of memory page by given address and (hehe) MS OneNote to mark memory dump with different colors to mark as resolved (that means, I understand what I found)\n\nI'll be happy to understand where is this chain, but I have no experience to do it.\n\nImportant note: CLR don't uses SEH for exceptions (many articles, where authors write about SEH in CLR lies. CLR only wraps SEH to translate its exceptions into CLR types)\n\n",

Once you can do it in the debugger you can automate using the CLR debugging API.\n\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/vstudio/bb397953(v=vs.100).aspx\n\n\"The CLR debugging services provide several ways to control the execution of a program. These include breakpoints, single stepping, exception notification, function evaluation, and other events that relate to the startup and shutdown of a program.\"\n\nBasically if you can understand the mechanisms of installing a new handler and looking up the handler when an exception is raised, then you can expand from there. Maybe this api will help maybe not.\n\n",
