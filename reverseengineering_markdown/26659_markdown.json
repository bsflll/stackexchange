  "content": "Concerning the outputting of an Toast, I found that there are some ways to make a Toast, that invoke calling a FindClass on JNIEnv object with the android/widget/Toast parameter, but I found no references in the code doing this.\n\nI found this code here\n\n```\njclass toast = (*env)->FindClass(env, \"android/widget/Toast\");\n// ToastクラスのmakeTextスタティックメソッドのメソッドIDを取得する\njmethodID methodMakeText = (*env)->GetStaticMethodID(env, toast, \"makeText\", \"(Landroid/content/Context;Ljava/lang/CharSequence;I)Landroid/widget/Toast;\");\nif(methodMakeText == NULL){\nLOGE(\"toast.makeText not Found\");\n\nreturn;\n\n```\nBut when using the strings tool on the C++ compiled files used in the app I'm decompiling, I haven't found any references to a Toast.\n\nWhat other ways there are to call methods in a Java library, e.g. make a Toast?\n\n",
