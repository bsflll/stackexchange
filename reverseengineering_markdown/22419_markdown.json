  "content": "I'm trying to reverse engineer a binary format, and I'm running up against a variable-length sequence of numbers which varies between files. I can't work out the pattern here and how to determine how long this sequence is. I'm 99% sure that the sequence is self-contained and isn't reliant on any information from the preceding parts of the file.\n\nAn example (in hex) of the sequence is:\n\n```\n06 00 00 00    01 00 00 00    fd ff ff  ff     08 00 00 00    f7 ff ff ff     0e 00 00 00 \n\n```\nTo me, this looks like a sequence of little endian signed integers (i.e. 6, 1, -3,  8, -9,  14)\n\nHere's some sequences I've collected:\n\nAny ideas?\n\nUpdate: \nAs requested, some extra context:\n\n",

What kind of application generates this kind of binary files? As Rup mentioned, what application is responsible for parsing this data? Are these sequences of numbers found in a header field? Are they appended to the end of the binary? Are they cherry-picked from wherever? Etc. etc. Please provide the details necessary to answer the question. Provide complete binaries as samples if possible.",
