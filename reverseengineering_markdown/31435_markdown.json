  "content": "I'm trying to access a site using it's API with Insomnia client, but some XHR responses are encoded, it seems. I don't know the exact algorithm that's being used (but it's not base64, I tried decoding). Here's alink to one of the encrypted responses that I receive.\n\nMy question: can someone tell what encoding this is, or how can I proceed from here?\n\n",
