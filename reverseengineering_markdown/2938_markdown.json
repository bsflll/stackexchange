  "content": "I have a program that has the ability to encrypt files and I want to be able to create a program that can read these files. I believe it uses a Blowfish encryption, but I'm not certain on that. How can I find the type of encryption used and its key?\n\nUsing Reflector, I was able to find the following code:\n\n```\npublic static unsafe string Encrypt(string text)\n{\n    string str;\n    basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char> > local2;\n    sbyte modopt(IsSignUnspecifiedByte)* numPtr = (sbyte modopt(IsSignUnspecifiedByte)*) Marshal.StringToHGlobalAnsi(text);\n    std.basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char> >.{ctor}(&local2, numPtr);\n    try\n    {\n        basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char> > local;\n        IntPtr hglobal = new IntPtr(numPtr);\n        Marshal.FreeHGlobal(hglobal);\n        basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char> >* localPtr = _Encrypt(&local, (basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char> > modopt(IsConst)* modopt(IsImplicitlyDereferenced)) &local2);\n        try\n        {\n            str = new string(std.basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char> >.c_str((basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char> > modopt(IsConst)* modopt(IsConst) modopt(IsConst)) localPtr));\n        }\n        fault\n        {\n            ___CxxCallUnwindDtor(std.basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char> >.{dtor}, (void*) &local);\n        }\n        std.basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char> >.{dtor}(&local);\n    }\n    fault\n    {\n        ___CxxCallUnwindDtor(std.basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char> >.{dtor}, (void*) &local2);\n    }\n    std.basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char> >.{dtor}(&local2);\n    return str;\n}\n\n```\nI notice it also references this, but I don't understand what it does at all...\n\n```\n[PreserveSig, MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.Unmanaged, MethodCodeType=MethodCodeType.Native), SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity]\ninternal static unsafe basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char> >* modreq(IsUdtReturn) modopt(CallConvCdecl) _Encrypt(basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char> >*, basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char> > modopt(IsConst)* modopt(IsImplicitlyDereferenced));\n\n```\nI'm still new to desktop programming, my only programming experience is mostly with web-based technologies and the absolute basics of C++. I've never gotten into reverse engineering before either. So please be gentle and thorough in your response as I'd really like to learn.\n\n-------------- EDIT\n\nI've finally been able to find the same function call in OllyDBG. However, setting a breakpoint and making it run the code does not cause it to break.\n\nWhat might I be doing wrong? :/\n\n```\nCPU Disasm\nAddress   Hex dump          Command                            Comments\n00A088D8  /$  02            ldarg.0\n00A088D9  |.  7B CC000004   ldfld openFileDialog3\n00A088DE  |.  02            ldarg.0\n00A088DF  |.  6F D101000A   callvirt ShowDialog\n00A088E4  |.  17            ldc.i4.1\n00A088E5  |.- 2E 01         beq.s 0A088E8\n00A088E7  |.  2A            ret\n00A088E8  |>  02            ldarg.0\n00A088E9  |.  7B CC000004   ldfld openFileDialog3\n00A088EE  |.  6F 8501000A   callvirt get_FileName\n00A088F3  |.  28 D201000A   call ReadAllText\n00A088F8  |.  0A            stloc.0\n00A088F9  |.  06            ldloc.0\n00A088FA  |.  6F 9000000A   callvirt Trim\n00A088FF  |.  6F 3900000A   callvirt get_Length\n00A08904  |.- 2D 01         brtrue.s 0A08907\n00A08906  |.  2A            ret\n00A08907  |>  06            ldloc.0\n00A08908  |.  6F 9000000A   callvirt Trim\n00A0890D  |.  72 99340070   ldstr \"ENCRYPTED\"                  ; UNICODE \"ENCRYPTED\"\n00A08912  |.  6F D301000A   callvirt StartsWith\n00A08917  |.- 2C 1F         brfalse.s 0A08938\n00A08919  |.  02            ldarg.0\n00A0891A  |.  72 AD340070   ldstr \"File is already encrypted\"  ; UNICODE \"File is already encrypted\"\n00A0891F  |.  28 14000006   call Translate\n00A08924  |.  72 E1340070   ldstr \"Error\"                      ; UNICODE \"Error\"\n00A08929  |.  28 14000006   call Translate\n00A0892E  |.  16            ldc.i4.0\n00A0892F  |.  1F 10         ldc.i4.s 10\n00A08931  |.  28 D401000A   call Show\n00A08936  |.  26            pop\n00A08937  |.  2A            ret\n00A08938  |>  06            ldloc.0\n00A08939  |.  28 D501000A   call Encrypt\n00A0893E  |.  0A            stloc.0\n00A0893F  |.  06            ldloc.0\n00A08940  |.  6F 9000000A   callvirt Trim\n00A08945  |.  6F 3900000A   callvirt get_Length\n00A0894A  |.- 2D 01         brtrue.s 0A0894D\n00A0894C  |.  2A            ret\n00A0894D  |>  02            ldarg.0\n00A0894E  |.  7B CC000004   ldfld openFileDialog3\n00A08953  |.  6F 8501000A   callvirt get_FileName\n00A08958  |.  02            ldarg.0\n00A08959  |.  7B CC000004   ldfld openFileDialog3\n00A0895E  |.  6F 8501000A   callvirt get_FileName\n00A08963  |.  72 ED340070   ldstr \".bak\"                       ; UNICODE \".bak\"\n00A08968  |.  28 3A00000A   call Concat\n00A0896D  |.  17            ldc.i4.1\n00A0896E  |.  28 B700000A   call Copy\n00A08973  |.  02            ldarg.0\n00A08974  |.  7B CC000004   ldfld openFileDialog3\n00A08979  |.  6F 8501000A   callvirt get_FileName\n00A0897E  |.  06            ldloc.0\n00A0897F  |.  28 A200000A   call WriteAllText\n00A08984  |.  02            ldarg.0\n00A08985  |.  72 F7340070   ldstr \"File encrypted\"             ; UNICODE \"File encrypted\"\n00A0898A  |.  28 14000006   call Translate\n00A0898F  |.  72 15350070   ldstr \"Info\"                       ; UNICODE \"Info\"\n00A08994  |.  28 14000006   call Translate\n00A08999  |.  16            ldc.i4.0\n00A0899A  |.  1F 40         ldc.i4.s 40\n00A0899C  |.  28 D401000A   call Show\n00A089A1  |.  26            pop\n00A089A2  \\.  2A            ret\n\n```\n",

As this is referred to the memory, I can tell you C and C++ are not (beware of C++.net as that is managed C++.\n\nAnyway, by the looks of this I'd say it calls the function from an external source (I'd suspect a DLL). \n\n```\ninternal static unsafe basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char> >* modreq(IsUdtReturn) modopt(CallConvCdecl) _Encrypt(basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char> >*, basic_string<char,std::char_traits<char>,std::allocator<char> > modopt(IsConst)* modopt(IsImplicitlyDereferenced));\n\n```\nThis says things about the method it is called Cdecl the function is called _Encrypt and has a few arguments.\n\nHope this helped, now you should first learn the basics, especially when you are going to dive into disassembling this native code.\n\n",
