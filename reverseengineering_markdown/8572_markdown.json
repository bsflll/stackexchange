      "content": "Disclaimer: I don't have IDA available to try it out right now, so a detail might be wrong.\n\nJust add some code to the breakpoint condition. For example\n\n```\nextern bpcount;\nbpcount++;\nMessage(form(\"%d. hit  \n\"), bpcount);\nreturn (bpcount>500);\n\n```\nThis will increment the count each time the breakpoint is it, but only break the program after more than 500 hits. Replace the return instruction with return 0 if you never want to break, or return 1 if you always want to break.\n\n",

      "content": "Apparently IDA 7.0 (and earlier?) supports a \"pass count\" for a breakpoint, you can even see a column for that in the breakpoint list window, but I found no way to configure it via the UI.\n\nYou can use the following Python commands to create a breakpoint with a pass count though, where 0x12345678 is the address at which you want to set it, and 42 the hit count:\n\n```\nadd_bpt(0x12345678, 1, BPT_DEFAULT)\nset_bpt_attr(0x12345678, BPTATTR_COUNT, 42)\n\n```\n",

File IO is slow, so registry counters may be used because it is stored in memory (that is only for Windows).\n\n",
