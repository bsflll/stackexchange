  "content": "During an analysis, I have found a call to ZwContinue. The executable file first gets the address of ntdll.NtContinue and stores it in the EAX register.\n\nAfter I step over the following assembly line, \n\n```\n  CALL EAX      ; ntdll.ZwContinue\n\n```\nthen OllyDbg (v1.10) terminates the process.\n\nI have found out that this is a kind of anti-debugging mechanism but I could not figure out how to defeat it.\n\nIs there any plugin which I can use or any other helpful trick?\n\n",
