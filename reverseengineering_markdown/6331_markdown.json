  "content": "I'm training reverse engineering and I'm creating some codes in C++ in other to reverse and see what I can do to learn.\n\nI've compiled this code:\n\n```\n#include <iostream>\n\nenum Types\n{\n    One,\n    Two\n} type;\n\nvoid helloWorld()\n{\n    if (not type == Two)\n      std::cout << \"Sorry, you coundl't do that.\" << std::endl;\n    else\n      std::cout << \"Yeah, you rocks!\" << std::endl;\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char ** argv)\n{\n    type = One;\n    helloWorld();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\nAs you can see, it's a really simple code, just for learning. What I want to know is: How can I change the \"type\" of the enum value.\n\nI'm using Windows 64bit, the only debuggers I have here is WinDbg and Visual DuxDebugger and IDA as disassembler.\n\n",
