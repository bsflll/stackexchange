      "content": "You can convert it to structure, this will produce much more readable code. \n\nIn order to do this you have to do the following:\n\nLet me know if you need more detailed walkthrough.\n\nAs an alternative for defining structure inside IDA (bullets 1 and 2) you can write a header file with something similar to the following (btw, see the type definitions in the structure):\n\n```\nstruct apis\n{\n  void* (__stdcall *pGetProcAddress)(_DWORD, _DWORD);\n  _DWORD (__stdcall *pSetErrorMode)(_DWORD);\n  _DWORD (__stdcall *pGetTempPathA)(_DWORD, _DWORD);\n  _DWORD (__stdcall *pGetTempGileNameA)(_DWORD *, _DWORD *, _DWORD, _DWORD *);\n};\n\n```\nand import it into the IDB with Ctrl+F9. You can find and edit this structure in Local types window (Shift+F1).\n\n",
