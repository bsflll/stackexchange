And now, more than ever, i need the help of the most powerful community to clarify my mistake.\n\nTrying to increase the amount of text, I came across an error when the game just crashes.\nThe section code is below:\n\n\n\nOffset (0046A1EC):\n\n```\n.text:0046A1EC push offset aEnaPokupkiSPix\n\n```\nTrying to increase the offset index beyond zone 2 results in a game crash, but if the index is in zone 1 or higher, everything works fine.\n\n\n\nI really don't know where to search anymore :(\n\nHelp who can, at least in which direction to search:(\n\n",
