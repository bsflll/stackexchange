      "content": "Yes you can do that. If you don't know how to set conditional breakpoints take a look here\n\nThe condition you need to set depends if you are debugging 32 (EIP register) or 64 (RIP register) bit program.\nSo for example let's say you don't want to stop at address 0xDEADBEEF for 32 bit program, you can set the break condition to EIP != DEADBEEF. You can add multiple addresses like this: EIP != addy1 && EIP != addy2 and so on.\n\n",
