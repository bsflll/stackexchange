      "content": "An array is an example of a data item. Like all items in IDA (the other item type is instruction), it has a starting address (head) and size. You can retrieve the whole item's size using the function get_item_size() (legacy name ItemSize()).\n\nTo figure out the number of items in an array, you can divide the whole array's size by the size of one element. But how to know the size of element? For this you need to inspect the flags of the item (attached to the head byte) using get_flags() function. Base item type is encoded in the bits defined by the DT_TYPE bits (top 4 bits of the flags) and takes values such as FF_BYTE (byte), FF_WORD (word), FF_DWORD and so on. But instead of checking the bits manually, you can use the function get_data_elsize() which return the size in bytes from the flags.\n\nFor more info check the bytes.hpp header in the SDK.\n\n",
