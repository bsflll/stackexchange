  "content": "I'm attempting to use a legacy systems recovery feature that typically required calling/faxing a company that is no longer around. \n\nBasically, the system was designed to go into a recovery mode and it provided a 4 character code that was provided over phone/fax to the software company and they would provide you with what looks like a HEX code to gain access to the system. \n\nI've been playing around with my limited knowledge on the subject for a little while now and have made zero progress. The system does run on a local server so maybe there are some decompilers or other processes that can be recommended? (Tomcat Based Webserver)\n\nThe Username is Administrator, below are 4 records from previous resets. Looks like MD4  or MD5 Hash to me.\n\nThe other details:\n\nWindows XP \"Server\"\n\nFull file system administrative access\n\nURL http://localhost/recoverymode=true\n\n",
