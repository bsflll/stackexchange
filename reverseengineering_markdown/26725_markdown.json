  "content": "I am using the following IDC script in IDA:\n\n```\n#include <idc.idc>\n\nstatic main()\n{   \n    for (i=0; i<10; i++)\n    {                           \n        PauseProcess();\n        \n        GetDebuggerEvent(WFNE_SUSP, -1);\n        Message(\"%s  \n\", GetFunctionName(ScreenEA()));\n            \n        ResumeProcess();    \n\n        //Sleep(50);                      //does not work, see remarks below\n        //GetDebuggerEvent(WFNE_SUSP, 1); //same\n    }\n}\n\n```\nThe main idea is to pause/resume process at regular intervals and check what is the current function (for profiling purposes).\n\nWhat I am searching for is a IDC function that will pause the script for a given amount of time (eg : 50ms) while the process will be still running. A function that would resume debugged process execution from a suspended state and run code for a given amount of time will be OK too.\n\nWhat I have tried so far :\n\n",
