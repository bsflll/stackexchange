  "content": "As part of a CTF challenge I have to understand the inner workings of a cryptlock type malware, and use it to decrypt a file containing the flag.\n\nI used GHIDRA to decompile the binary.\n\nThe encryption function seems pretty basic, it is just the following line inside a while loop repeated until all bytes of the file have been xored : local_111c[local_1120] = local_111c[local_1120] ^ *(byte *)(param_2 + local_1120 % 0x20);\n\nWhere local_1120 is the loop counter, local_111c is a buffer where the file to encrypt is read into, and param_2 is an integer that seems to be always 0, the function is called like the following FUN_00401000((LPCSTR)0x0,0), with both parameters set to 0;\n\nWhat does *(byte *)(param_2 + local_1120 % 0x20 refer to? As far as I understand it, it would be the value at the address pointed to by an integer cast to a byte pointer, but the modulo makes it so the adress can't be above 32?\n\nI need to understand what could the value pointed to could have been in order to xor back the file to its original state.\n\n",

      "content": "Let's see.\n\n```\n*(byte *)(param_2 + local_1120 % 0x20)\n\n```\nInside we take local_1120 and mod it with 32, as you note.  Then we add an offset from param_2, and cast that new address to a pointer to a byte.  Finally, we dereference the pointer to obtain a byte at that address.\n\nTo my eye, we are using a 32-byte decryption key that we use over and over (thus the modular arithmetic).  We have to get a real address; we cannot dereference NULL without a problem, so param_2 must be the address of the decryption key when you enter the loop.\n\n",
