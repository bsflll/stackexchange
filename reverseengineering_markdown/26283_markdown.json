  "content": "First post here, so sorry. I'll try to keep it short. Anyways, when trying to xref an operand (to find its offset), it brings me to an rdata function. It looks like this:\n\n```\n.rdata:00000001419318D8                 dq offset aFhealth      ; \"fHealth\"\n\n```\nAny idea how I can get the offset from this? It's the only thing that shows up when I search for fHealth in the strings view, and in this game the game itself is stored in the exe, not in another dll.\n\n",
