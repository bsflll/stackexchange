  "content": "I'm working on a crack me, specifically: jaunsacco's DragonCrack and the first thing I've gotten stuck on is that the program is built mostly as a enormous main function. After attempting to decompile I get the error: \n\nI've increased my max function size for decompilation to 512K (defaults at 64), the main function is approx. 400K. But this is too much processing and IDA froze for at least 5 minutes before I gave up.\n\nIs there an alternative approach to decompiling a large (400K) function using Hex-Rays decompiler? Maybe partial decompilation, or non-default decompiler configuration.\n\nIDA: Version 7.2.181105\n\nHex-Rays Decompiler: v7.0.0.170914\n\n",

It'd be good if you would state both the IDA and Hex-Rays versions, so there is a chance we can better help. Alternatively you could send an email to the Hex-Rays support. In the past they were generally very helpful whenever I ran into an issue.",

So it possibly could decompile this function without much hesitation. Although I can't promise anything.\n\nGood luck! :-)\n\n",
