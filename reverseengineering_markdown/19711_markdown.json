  "content": "Has anyone looked at the hardware to see what processor they're using or disassembled the firmware? \n\nWyze claims to have opensourced their firmware but their github repository seems to be mostly binary files with a few scripts tossed in. Further, they admit to not being fully open in the readme file.\n\nAt $20 for a 1080p IP camera, the offer seems to be too good not to have some string attached. HIK Vision cameras were all the rage a few years back until they were caught phoning home.\n\n",
