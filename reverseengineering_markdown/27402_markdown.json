      "content": "Debug Symbol information is often \"stripped off\" from C++ binaries. Symbol information stores all user-created names, symbols, and types, bounds, fouction boundary and other function related metadata information (it is generally stored according to a popular and standardized \"dwarf\" format which is widely used and employed in modern compilers). If you want to keep this information then compile your binary with - say -g flag in gcc or clang. For e.g. gcc -g myprog.c. You will find all user-defined symbols rendered by Ghidra.\n\nOn the other hand, in C# .NET removal of name symbol metadata is not possible (as reflection requires retrieval of symbol for types at runtime). Thus to work around this, C# symbols are generally obfuscated.\n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.appsealing.com/code-obfuscation-comprehensive-guide/\nhttp://www.semdesigns.com/Products/Obfuscators/CSharpObfuscationExample.html\nhttps://help.gapotchenko.com/eazfuscator.net/53/advanced-features/symbol-names-encryption\n\n",

In C#, like in Java, fields are identified by their fully qualified name. In fact, you can create an assembly without having its dependencies at hand, but you can only compile (but not link) a C++ program without its dependencies. That's why names cannot be removed (but can be renamed) and why local vars in a methods are not reversed to their original names,",

I've been working with C# since way before it shipped (and I was working for Microsoft, doing high end dev support for the first 10 years of .NET).  Other than demos, I've never seen anyone obfuscate their code (I'm not saying no one does, but I dispute generally).",

The IL code uses addresses (and slot numbers) internally.  The symbolic information is part of the metadata that is stored within the assembly, separate from the code. The .NET compilers also produce PDB files that are used by debuggers like Visual Studio (augmenting the symbol info in the metadata). For what it's worth, keeping PDBs around can be a best practice (in C# and particularly C++).  It allows for a more usable post-mortem debug experience",
