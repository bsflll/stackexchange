  "content": "I want to remove a LOAD_COMMAND from my iOS app binary.\n\nI tried jtool:\n\n```\njtool -rC 3 my_app_binary\n\n```\nThis worked when I was removing a dynamic library.  But it generated an empty binary file and the original binary was not altered when I wanted to remove: \n\n```\nLC 03: LC_SEGMENT_64          Mem: 0x100007000-0x100007000  __RESTRICT\n\n```\nI found the same with optool.  I could delete a dylib but not this RESTRICT load command.\n\nNext stop is Hopper...\n\n",
