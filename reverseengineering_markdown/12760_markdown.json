  "content": "I have installed FMK and binwalk. FMK have an old binwalk that does not work. So, I ran a fresh binwalk (from git) as follow:\n\n```\n$> binwalk -e wr741ndv4_ru_3_13_2_up_boot(140521).bin\n\n```\nAnd in the directory _wr741ndv4_ru_3_13_2_up_boot(140521).bin.extracted/\n\n```\n$ls \n120200.squashfs  20400  20400.7z  3CEC  3CEC.7z  squashfs-root  unsquashfs\n\n```\nThen I compile unsquashfs with LZMA_XZ_SUPPORT = 1:\n\n```\n$> ./unsquashfs -v \nunsquashfs version 4.2 (2011/02/28)\n\n$> ./unsquashfs -h\nSYNTAX: ./unsquashfs [options] filesystem [directories or files to extract]\n[...]\nDecompressors available:\ngzip\nlzma\n\n```\nThen, I have an error to unpack squashfs:\n\n```\n$> ./unsquashfs 120200.squashfs\nParallel unsquashfs: Using 1 processor\nlzma uncompress failed with error code 9\nread_block: failed to read block @0x23d12a\nread_fragment_table: failed to read fragment table index\nFATAL ERROR aborting: failed to read fragment table\n\n```\nWhat did I do wrong?\n\nP.S. If anyone have unpacked squashfs with this version firmware, please share it.\n\n",
