  "content": "Is there any easy way to get a function call graph of a binary program using IDApython then convert it to a networkx graph other than going through every function and constructing the call-graph ourselves?\n\nBasically i want to have a call graph that i can tell which nodes are library calls and which are locals, and not including functions that are called by libraries ( so i dont go deep into nested library functions calling each other)\n\ni tried gen_simple_call_chart() but there are two big problems :\n\nFor example all the nodes are black no matter library or local :\n\n```\n\"205\" [ label = \"sub_40AF20\", pencolor = black ];\n\"206\" [ label = \"ShellExecuteW\", pencolor = black ];\n\n```\n",

(although for function call graph it seems to be gen_simple_call_chart), but there are two big problems : 1. there is no difference between library nodes and local nodes in the generated DOT file (no color or anything), 2. CHART_IGNORE_LIB_FROM  doesnt work, i dont want to include nodes that are called by library calls :(",
