  "content": "I'm trying to crack winrar's password using some methods as explained below.\n\nBecause rar uses AES-128 encryption, brute-force and dictionary attacks are useless as they would take years.\nBut, if we convert a password-protected rar file into an SFX archive \n\nI used w32dasm, olly dbg & pe explorer to modify these exe files.\nAll I could find are the strings like \"Extracting, CRC failed, Encrypted\" and some other things. I used several sfx archives as test files (with different passwords) and tried it through disassembly. Those hexadecimal keys are looking quite similar!\n\nSo do I need a better disassembler or debugger?Am i on the right way or anyother way to decompile it.\n\nMy main aim was to extract the password protected file and ensure the file is safe,I already refered this question stating that it is possible only by brute forcing the winrar file.\n\nSome of my win32dasm snapshots were as below :\n\n\n\n",
