  "content": "I am using Detours 3.0 to hook onto a function I obtained from Ida Pro. The problem is I came across a function which I cannot seem to hook which is due to either invalid arguements or the fact that it uses a variable arguement list.\n\n```\nint (*MakePacketBuffer)(const char * buf, int len, const char * splitstr, ...);\n#define MakePacketBufferProto int (*)(const char *, int, const char *, ...)\n\n```\nThat is what I imagine the parameters to be like, in Ida Pro its actually shown like this:\n\n```\nint sub_66EEF0(int a1, int a2, const char *a3, ...)\n\n```\nHow that function is called in Ida:\n\n```\nsub_66EEF0(buf, 2048, \"%c%c%c%c%s%c%c\", v15, 250, v20, v21, v22, v23, v25);\n\n```\n",

      "content": "You'll need to know how the compiler generated the function.  For 32-bit Windows applications compiled with MSVC, your life gets a little bit easier since all arguments are passed on the stack.\n\nThe way that the stack frame is set up upon entry to a routine on x86 Windows:\n\n```\n----------------\n Return Address \n----------------\n Argument #0 \n----------------\n Argument #1\n----------------\n Argument #2 \n----------------\n  ....\n\n```\nThis continues to be the case for vararg routines.  Here's a quick example that shows you how to get at the additional values.  The issue that you'll run into if you're intercepting things like printf is that you have to parse the format string to know how many arguments have been passed to you.\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <windows.h>\n#include <intrin.h>\n\n#define print(x) printf(\"%10s: %x  \n\", #x, x)\n\nvoid fn(int a, int b, ...) {\n    void ** Stack = (void**) _AddressOfReturnAddress();\n\n    print(Stack);    // Address of SP upon function entry\n    print(Stack[0]); // Return address\n    print(Stack[1]); // a\n    print(Stack[2]); // b\n    print(Stack[3]); // vararg 1\n};\n\nvoid main() {\n    fn(1,2,3,4,5,6);\n}\n\n```\nThis prints out:\n\n```\n   Stack: 101feac\nStack[0]: ce10a4\nStack[1]: 1\nStack[2]: 2\nStack[3]: 3\n\n```\n",

      "content": "It is not necessary to know the number of arguments.\n\nIn practice, the number of arguments is limited by a constant (otherwise the program would need infinite memory :).\n\nTherefore, you can declare a hook function with, say, 16 args, print the args, and call the original function with the same 16 args. If the code breaks, double the number of args.\n\n```\ntypedef unsigned long DW;\n#define DW_MANYARGS  DW arg1,DW arg2,DW arg3,DW arg4,DW arg5,DW arg6,DW arg7,DW arg8\n#define MANYARGS     arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4,arg5,arg6,arg7,arg8\n\nDW hookFunc(DW_MANYARGS) {\n    // we do not expect a quadruple-word result here\n    DW res = originalFunc(MANYARGS);\n    return res;\n}\n\n```\nCaveats:\n\nDo not forget to return what the original function returns.\n\nRemember that there are two hidden arguments:\n\n0) the address of the return value, if the return value does not fit into the size of int;\n\n1) the this pointer\n\n",
