  "content": "Could you please explain how the INC x86 assembly instruction is affecting the Parity Flag (PF)?\n\nI have the following code:\n\n```\n.text:00401413 mov     edi, offset user_id ; user_id at memory location 0x40D020\n...\n.text:00401421 inc     edi                 ; edi = 0x40D021\n...\n.text:0040142D inc     edi\n.text:0040142E jnp     short no_parity\n\n```\nWith user_id defined as follows:\n\n```\n.bss:0040D020 user_id         db 21h dup(?)\n.bss:0040D042                 db    ? ;\n.bss:0040D043                 db    ? ;\n.bss:0040D044                 db    ? ;\n...\n\n```\nAt offset 0x40142D:\n\n```\n0:000> r edi\nedi=0040d021\n0:000> dd 40d021\n0040d021  4f4f4f4f 4f4f4f4f 4f4f4f4f 4f4f4f4f\n0040d031  4f4f4f4f 4f4f4f4f 4f4f4f4f 004f4f4f\n0040d041  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000\n0040d051  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000\n0040d061  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000\n0040d071  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000\n0040d081  00000000 ff000000 01000000 01000000\n0040d091  02000000 00000000 01000000 00000000\n\n```\nIf my understanding of the parity flag is correct, it should apply to the low 8 bits: 01001111 because:\n\n```\nedi = 0x4f4f4f4f = 0b1001111010011110100111101001111\n\n```\nThe number of 1 in 01001111 is odd (five 1), which should set the PF to 1. But this is not the case:\n\n```\n0:000> r pf\npf=1\n\n```\n...which leads to the jump not to be taken at offset 0x40142E.\n\nThank you for your help.\n\n",

If it's before then after the inc edi will equal 0x0040d022, which still has 2 bits set.)\n\n",
