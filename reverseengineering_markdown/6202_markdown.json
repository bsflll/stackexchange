I have many dll files, when I open the dll file with .NET Reflector, it appears like this:\n\n\n\nAnd when I did the deobfuscation again with de4dot, some stuff are cleaned:\n\n\n\nWhen I open that cleaned-dll, all the variables and class name look very strange, it's not related with the code inside that function.\n\n\n\nHave you guys seen this before? How can I get the real name of functions and variables ? Did they use 2 times obfuscation ?\n\nLink to download application files :\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10907501/bc/UW.rar\n\n",

      "text": "I doubt you could get the original name of the functions. I think the obfuscation technique used randomly switched the function names within the assembly, or used random function names from a list. If the prior happend, you could guess which function name belongs to a certain function, after observing what it does. I don't know which obfuscation software has this \"func name switching\" feature, but if you find out, maybe you can observe what it uses to decide  the switching and restore it manually.",

It's possible that in the RNG the value [3,4,0,1,2] is really positions [4,5,1,2,3] The more dedicated you are to figuring this out then you will actually figure it out.. because nothing is really lost, it's just computed/swapped :) You will need to find the string table then re-order it back and if it's correct everything will go back in place",
