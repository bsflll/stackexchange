  "content": "I am trying to get the commentary (casters voice) from a dota2 game file. I've managed to parse the game file and select what I believe is the voice data. This is in a weird format (CSVCMsg_VoiceData) which has the following struc:\n\n```\ntype CSVCMsg_VoiceData struct {\nClient                   *int32            `protobuf:\"varint,1,opt,name=client\" json:\"client,omitempty\"`\nProximity                *bool             `protobuf:\"varint,2,opt,name=proximity\" json:\"proximity,omitempty\"`\nXuid                     *uint64           `protobuf:\"fixed64,3,opt,name=xuid\" json:\"xuid,omitempty\"`\nAudibleMask              *int32            `protobuf:\"varint,4,opt,name=audible_mask\" json:\"audible_mask,omitempty\"`\nVoiceData                []byte            `protobuf:\"bytes,5,opt,name=voice_data\" json:\"voice_data,omitempty\"`\nCaster                   *bool             `protobuf:\"varint,6,opt,name=caster\" json:\"caster,omitempty\"`\nFormat                   *VoiceDataFormatT `protobuf:\"varint,7,opt,name=format,enum=VoiceDataFormatT,def=1\" json:\"format,omitempty\"`\nSequenceBytes            *int32            `protobuf:\"varint,8,opt,name=sequence_bytes\" json:\"sequence_bytes,omitempty\"`\nSectionNumber            *uint32           `protobuf:\"varint,9,opt,name=section_number\" json:\"section_number,omitempty\"`\nUncompressedSampleOffset *uint32           `protobuf:\"varint,10,opt,name=uncompressed_sample_offset\" json:\"uncompressed_sample_offset,omitempty\"`\nXXX_unrecognized         []byte            `json:\"-\"`\n\n```\n}\n\nThis seems to work when reading the data.

This data is in an unknown format. I've tried to do some research on what the format might be and I've found that steam started using SILK codec for voice data in 2011 - however when trying to write this data to file and open it with opus (which I believe supports SILK) the opus decoder tells me it can't open the file - so I'm not 100% convinced it is silk codec. Recognising audio data isn't something I have a great deal of experience with - so any advice would be great.\n\nI have noticed there's a VoiceDataFormatT part of the struct but the only definition I can find for it is this:\n\n```\ntype VoiceDataFormatT int32\n\n```\nWhich doesn't seem too helpful! :/\n\nEDIT 1:\nAs per advice from user Ian Cook I've decoded the data from base64 into the following (as hex dump):\n\n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n\nI'm still at a loss as to what this information is - I've tried converting it to a wav file using ffmpeg (assuming is pcm) but it still comes out as white noise.\n\nEDIT 2:\nSo it's occurred to me that it might help if I include more samples of the data - the decoded hex of the data can be found here (each sample separated by a new line character):\n\npastebin\n\nI've noticed that each one seems to start with the following hex:\n\nBB 3F 80 0A 01 00 10 01 0B 80 3E 04\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n»?€\n�€>\n\nI'm still at a loss as to how to convert this to audio data.\n\nEDIT 3:\nI've uploaded some more datadumps to the following pastebin (More data), it's not a full dump as it's roughly 15mb and pastebin crashed when I was trying to paste!\n\nThe data file is a dota2 demo file (extension .dem) which is a collection of protobuf messages that I parse using GoLang and the Manta replay parse (found here). This allows me to pull out any type of message, and I select OnCSVCMsg_VoiceData, which returns m.Audio.VoiceData of the form: CSVCMsg_VoiceData (the struct I display above).\n\nEDIT 4\n\nHere's (finally) the link to the file with the concatenated voiceData messages.\n\nAnd here's the link to the original file of protobuff messages\n\n",

      "content": "TL;DR\n\nLong version\n\nUsing the sample data you posted, first thing I had to do was replace the final comma with a ] to make it valid JSON.\n\nI originally used shell scripts to to convert the structs from JSON to SILK, but in the interest of efficiency, I re-implemented the conversion in Python.\n\n```\nimport json\nimport base64\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    if len(sys.argv) < 2:\n        print(\"Usage: python3\", sys.argv[0], \"<CSVCMsg_VoiceData json file>\")\n        exit(1)\n\n    with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as infile:\n        json_data = json.load(infile)\n\n    # Create dictionary with section number as the key and list of\n    # that section's structs as the value\n    section_dict = {}\n    for obj in json_data:\n        sec_num = obj['section_number']\n        if sec_num not in section_dict:\n            section_dict[sec_num] = []\n        section_dict[sec_num].append(obj)\n\n    # Create SILK file for each section number stream\n    for section in section_dict.keys():\n        filename=f\"section_{section}.slk\"\n        print(f\"Generating SILK file {filename} for section {section}...\")\n        with open(filename, 'wb') as outfile:\n            # SILK header\n            outfile.write(b\"#!SILK_V3\")\n            # Sort frames in ascending order based on sequence_bytes value\n            for frame in sorted(section_dict[section], key=lambda x : x['sequence_bytes']):\n                decoded = base64.b64decode(frame['voice_data'])\n                # strip first 14 bytes and last 4 bytes before writing\n                outfile.write(decoded[14:-4])\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```\nTo decode SILK, I used the official SDK (that's what the decoder linked by Gordon Freeman is built on top of). The SDK can be downloaded from this link, which I found from this page.\n\nAfter I downloaded the SDK, I extracted it, went into the directory named SILK_SDK_SRC_FIX_v1.0.9, and ran make (I'm on Kali, but pretty much any Linux variant should be fine).\n\nOnce make completes, you're left with a couple executables; the only one we care about is decoder.\n\nSimply run decoder on the SILK payloads generated above, and you'll get a pcm file you can do whatever you want with. For example, ./decoder section_12.slk section_12.pcm. The output file is at 22050 Hz.\n\nHat tip to @Gordon Freeman for pointing out that the header isn't 18 bytes like I originally suspected and that the last 4 bytes aren't part of the SILK payload.\n\nFor posterity, here's how I converted the JSON to SILK files with shell scripts.\n\nI used the following script to extract the data, de-base64 it, and put each struct's data in its own file.\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Write each decoded VoiceData to a file with the naming convention\n# <sequence_bytes>_<section_number>\nwrite_data ()\n{\n    filename=`echo $1 | cut -d_ -f1,2`\n    data=`echo $1 | cut -d_ -f3`\n    echo -n \"$data\" | base64 -d > $filename\n}\nexport -f write_data\njq -r '.[] | \"\\(.sequence_bytes)_\\(.section_number)_\\(.voice_data)\"' dota2CasterParse.json | xargs -I '{}' bash -c \"write_data '{}'\"\n\n\n```\nI then used the following script to create a SILK file for each section:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsection_numbers=$(ls [0-9]*_[0-9]* | cut -d_ -f2 | sort -u)\n\nfor section in $section_numbers; do\n    output=\"section_${section}_voiceData.slk\"\n    echo -n '#!SILK_V3' > $output\n    for i in $(ls *_${section} | sort -n); do\n        dd bs=1 skip=14 count=$(($(stat -c \"%s\" $i)-18)) if=$i of=$output conv=notrunc oflag=append\n    done\ndone\n\n```\n",
