  "content": "I'm performing static analysis on system framework code, and some of the interesting ones seem to be talking to daemons via sockets. How do I get to the source of the daemons to see what they do with the data being sent over? I suppose these are C code rather than java? Do the binaries reside as ELF binaries somewhere or compiled into a library? How do I figure it out?\n\nThanks!\n\n",
