  "content": "I am trying to reverse a Seed/Key algorithm. i have some sample and knowledge about it, for example i know this algorithm work with only \"xor\" and \"shift\" operations. \nsome sample shown in below:\n\n     seed            key\n  ---------       ----------\n 0x01010101       0xDFBB4565\n 0x02020202       0x21028781\n 0x02010101       0xB1C7ED2B\n 0x08010101       0xFB9718DE\n\nis this enough for reverse this algorithm?\naccording to the this Question i know this algorithm will be must like each other but i dont know what is difference between them.\nhow i can reverse this algorithm and how i can reverse anything like this? \n\n",
