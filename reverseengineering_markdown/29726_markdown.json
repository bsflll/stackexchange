  "content": "I'm examining my Windows programs to determine which ones are written in Java, and if so, whether they import a log4j library affected by the log4shell vulnerability.\n\nPrograms that are packaged as JAR files and use the JVM to run are fairly easy to identify.\n\nHowever, I am less certain about .exe files. Usually these are compiled from say C++, but there are ways to compile Java code into .exe files.\n\nIs there a method to identify whether an .exe was written using Java? Is this method reliable?\n\n",

      "content": "Been a while since I went back to any Java reversing, but I seem to remember being able to use 7zip to open “Java executables” with a .exe file extension.\n\nMost (if not all?) .jars have a META-INF folder within them, so this is usually a pretty easily identifiable folder to look for.\n\nThis could probably be automated fairly easily. You could write a script that tries to “extract” .exes and if the base level directory contains META-INF then there is a good chance it's a packaged .jar.\n\nEdit for clarity:\nas 'masterX244' pointed out, I was referring to the .exe files that are essentially a Jar file with a small stub loader of an executable tacked on to the front of it (which handles all the JVM args, etc, internally).\nThe reference I have has the initial stub, and the Jar itself starts at offset 0x12A00 (location found via the PK magic number).\nI had not considered graalVM as suggested by 'Thorbjørn Ravn Andersen', so this only works under specific circumstances.\n\n",
