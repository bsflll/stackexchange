  "content": "I am a beginner in reverse engineering.\n\nFor a challenge I need to reverse a code in python this code use enigma algorithm :\nTo found the good configuration to decode the enigma code received. \n\nThe goal is to found the good configuration the bellow : \n\n```\ndef create_configuration():\nnumber_of_rotors = random.randrange(3, 6)\nrotates_amounts = [3, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19, 23]\n\nresult = []\nfor _ in range(number_of_rotors):\n    rotor = \"\".join(random.sample(string.ascii_uppercase, 26))\n    rotates_amount = random.choice(rotates_amounts)\n    result.append([rotor, rotates_amount])\nreturn result\n\n```\ncode : \n\n```\ndef create_configuration(number_of_rotors, rotates_amounts):\nresult = []\n    for i in range(number_of_rotors):\n    rotor = \"\".join(random.sample(string.ascii_uppercase, 26))\n    rotates_amount = rotates_amounts[i]\n    result.append([rotor, rotates_amount])\nreturn result\n\n```\nI added The generator function to generate all the possibilities as (i am using itertools): \n  [3,3,3,3,3,3,3],[3,3,3,3,3,5],...\n\n```\ndef generators():\nvalues = []\nval = [3, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19, 23]\nfor _set in product(val, repeat=7):\n    values.append(_set)\nreturn values\n\n```\nThis part of code also generate randomly ascii list : \n\n```\nrotor = \"\".join(random.sample(string.ascii_uppercase, 26))\n\n```\nSo my questions is : \n\nThank you very much.\n\n",
