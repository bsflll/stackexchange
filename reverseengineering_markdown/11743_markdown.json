  "content": "I got a malicious kernel mode driver from VirusTotal. Now, I am trying to debug it using Windbg.\n\nBelow are the details of the setup:\n\nHost OS: Win 7 Ultimate 64-bit, Windbg version 6.11.x, VMWare Workstation and Guest OS: Win XP SP3\n\nI placed the kernel mode driver in Guest OS in the path: C:\\drivers\\test\n\nAdded .sys extension to the kernel mode driver.\n\nIn Windbg on Host OS, I attached to the guest OS through Named Pipe. Set the breakpoint to break at DriverEntry of the driver as shown below:\n\n```\nbu malicious_driver!DriverEntry\n\n```\nThen press g.\n\nIn Guest OS, used OSR Driver Loader from osronline.com to load the driver.\n\nBrowsed for the Driver, Registered the Service and started the Service.\n\nI break in Windbg however I receive the following error message:\n\n```\nkd> bu malicious_driver!DriverEntry\nkd> g\n*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for malicious_driver.sys\nBreakpoint 0's offset expression evaluation failed.\nCheck for invalid symbols or bad syntax.\nWaitForEvent failed\nnt!DebugService2+0x11:\n8052e4c5 5d              pop     ebp\nkd> !drvobj malicious_driver\nDriver object (b25eb000) is for:\nb25eb000: is not a driver object\n\n```\nPlease note that I am able to successfully break at the DriverEntry of known legitimate Microsoft Windows OS drivers like ndis.sys, http.sys\n\nHowever, how do I break at the entry point of malicious drivers as in this case? I don't have the symbols for them either.\n\nThanks.\n\n",
