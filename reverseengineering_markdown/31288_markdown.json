      "content": "Based on the link provided by rce, Ghidra needs extra help to disassemble this code correctly.\n\nI select Language = \"PowerISA-VLE-64-32addr\" in the Ghidra project editor: Then to start the disassembly it will ONLY work by pressing the F12 key:\n\n\n\nAlso with IDA pro 7.5 I can disassemble my binary file. IDA pro has only two options for PowerPC: Big endian and Little endian. I selected Big Endian. When loading I chose that all the code is VLE and I get a successful disassembly:\n\n\n\nAfter loading the file you must press \"C\" to start the disassembly which is done very fast.\n\nTo see also the hex bytes (blue) in the disassembly you must edit the file ida.cfg and set\n\nOPCODE_BYTES            = 4\n\nbecause these bytes are disabled by default.\n\n",
