  "content": "For the source generated by Hex Ray's decompiler in IDA, is it possible to highlight matching braces once I place the pointer at the beginning of a block?\n\nAs an example, in the screenshot below, the if block begins at line# 263 and ends at line# 269. What I want is, if I place the cursor at line# 263, IDA should highlight the block end at line# 269. Is such a feature available? Many code editors provides similar feature to make code browsing easier for larger blocks of code.\n\n\n\n",
