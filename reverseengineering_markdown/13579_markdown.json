  "content": "I am running an application that just after starting, it creates a service (process hacker tool notifies me that driver_app.sys has been created). Indeed, it says that the location of driver_app.sys is:\n\nMy problem is that I would like to reverse such driver, but I do not manage to find a way to get the .sys file (I cannot find it anywhere while the app is running, and when it is closed the service stops and the .sys file disappears from the list displayed by process hacker). I am just asking how to do this since I have seen some people on the Internet analyzing this kind of files.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",
