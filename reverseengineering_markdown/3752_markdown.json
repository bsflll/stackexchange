      "content": "You cannot prevent reverse engineering. You can make it more or less harder but you cannot prevent it. No.\n\nUpdate\n\nOk, as the author updated it with a more clearer question... this is what one can do:\n\nAs for the Python code... If you're lucky enough, you can use Shedskin to compile to native code and then apply the same techniques discussed before. If not, you may give a try to Cython instead of Python. Also, there is a question here about obfuscating Python code.\n\nPS: Anyway, in my opinion, code protection is overrated. You cannot prevent a decided person or group from reverse engineering a piece of software and, sometimes, it's a lose of time and money.\n\n",

      "content": "As for C compiler (gcc), first make sure you do not make a mistake of compiling it with -g option (adds symbols for debugging, basically whole source code).\n\nSecondly, try with -s option:\n\nWithout function names is would be harder to reverse engineer it. Take a look at man strip. I haven't tried it, but something like\n\nor:\n\non your object files could be useful.\n\nTurn on as much optimisation as you can -O3. It is really hard to read an optimized assembly, making it another impediment. There is really no good way of preventing disassembly and reverse-engineering, but it makes it harder.\n\nAs for Python, it is absolutely OK to ship only .pyc bytecode files. It is compiled version of source code for Python Virtual Machine. How do I create a .pyc file?. Try this one, maybe it is what you need. User can run bytecode file using python just as easily as a source code file.\n\nLastly, try to google for code obfuscation. It makes no sense to obfuscate C++ code, but maybe someone knows if code obfuscation is a good strategy for Python.\n\n",
