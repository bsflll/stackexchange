It's not documented under aa? nor aaa? nor \n\n```\n[0x000028e0]> aaa?\nUsage: See aa? for more help\n[0x000028e0]> aaaa?\nUsage: See aa? for more help\n\n```\nAnd man radare isn't more useful only saying,\n\n```\n -A  run 'aaa' command before prompt or patch to analyze all referenced code. Use -AA to run aaaa\n\n```\nradare --help, says\n\n```\n -A run 'aaa' command to analyze all referenced code\n\n```\n",

      "content": "When you execute the aaa command, radare is showing you what are the steps it takes. Each step has the command responsible for it inside parentheses.\n\n```\n[0x00000000]> aaa\n[x] Analyze all flags starting with sym. and entry0 (aa)\n[x] Analyze function calls (aac)\n[x] Analyze len bytes of instructions for references (aar)\n[x] Constructing a function name for fcn.* and sym.func.* functions (aan)\n[x] Type matching analysis for all functions (afta)\n[x] Use -AA or aaaa to perform additional experimental analysis.\n\n```\nAs you can see, aaa is a command which is executing other commands. It also prints a short description of what each command is doing. A little bit more detailed information can be found under aa?. So, to append this information together:\n\nSimilar to aaa, this information is being printed when aaaa is executed.\n\n```\n[0x00000000]> aaaa\n[x] Analyze all flags starting with sym. and entry0 (aa)\n[x] Analyze function calls (aac)\n[x] Analyze len bytes of instructions for references (aar)\n[x] Constructing a function name for fcn.* and sym.func.* functions (aan)\n[x] Enable constraint types analysis for variables\n\n```\nThe main change of aaaa is \"[x] Enable constraint types analysis for variables\". This basically enables the anal.types.constraint configuration variable.\n\n```\n[0x00000000]> e? anal.types.constraint\nanal.types.constraint: Enable constraint types analysis for variables\n\n```\nOn a personal note here, I would suggest not to use aaaa since it is quite buggy sometimes and probably would not be necessary.\n\n",
