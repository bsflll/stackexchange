  "content": "I have a clear .class file, which is likely obfuscated. However, Ghidra is not detecting it as Java, and shows it as Raw binary, which prevents me from using the Java Class Analyzer on the file.\n\nHow can I force Ghidra to identify the file as Java class file or to show me the Java Class Analyzer?\n\n\n\n",
