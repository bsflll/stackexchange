  "content": "IDA autodetected some kind of offset like this:\n\n```\nmov     bx, word ptr (aSomeString+8)[di]\n\n```\nI want to set the base address to something else, like for example:\n\n```\nmov     bx, word ptr (glb_AnArray-6)[di]\n\n```\nbecause the pointer is actually a pointer to an array (of elements with size 6) that is indexed starting from 1. Bonus points if it's possible to transform it to something like this:\n\n```\nmov     bx, word ptr glb_AnArray[di+6]\n\n```\nSo the question is: How can I tell IDA to take a specific address as base?\n\n",
