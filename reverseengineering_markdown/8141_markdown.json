  "content": "I recently got a copy of a space game and id like to be able to extract the audio/models from the game. \n\nI've attached an example .ovl file and a .aux file below. \nI have no knowledge on reverse engineering file formats.\nSo I'm sorry if I'm not the best at learning things. \nHowever i will try to do the best that I can.  I was able to gather a bit of information on the web. However no one has archived this yet.\n\nHere is the top of the .aux file in hex workshop.\n\n\n\nHere is the .ovl file.\n\n\n\nQuick Update: I was able to extract some of the files and get the proper name. However, I'm not able too play them. They're corupt.\n\nI used this quickbms script.\n\nhttp://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&p=74664#p74664\n\n\n\nOVL FILE DOWNLOAD: \n/mega.co.nz/#!Cx5nHLTa!JgTCENPHMY4MD1LeOLFhwwt8DcZr8pngforLIdPibqs\n\nAUX FILE DOWNLOAD: \n/mega.co.nz/#!60YAkQ5Q!6M_aexZSx8JyE7GQAKi1K1qD17n9ULOMGKM7t26BaUs\n\n",
