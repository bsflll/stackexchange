I think the research available publicly all let the iOS loader decrypt the encrypted sections and dump them from memory once decrypted. This accomplishes what 99.9% of researchers need. Few people have exploring the DRM itself as a goal. Perhaps they rely on the UID key? A quick check would be to diff the same apps encrypted sections on two different devices of the same model. It would mean Apple would need to dynamically sign apps per device though and store UID keys, which they've said they don't do. Maybe GID? Hmm...",

      "content": "My answer What you can actually do is to look for \"cracked IPA apps\", which basically mean they are decrypted (FairPlay encryption removed). There are many sites like this one (AppAddict).\n\nNote \nI had to do that since I upgraded my jailbroken device to iOS 8.4 (Pangu jailbreak). The iOS8.4 jailbreak disabled debugger tools like Clutch, which I used to decrypt binaries. Maybe the iOS 9.0 jailbreak allows them to work again.\nI couldn't even get to decrypt some older versions of Facebook or Tinder. That's when you really rely on the community to have uploaded their cracked binaries.\n\nPlease note that I am not supporting piracy. Linking cracked IPA resources is meant for reverse engineering and research purpose. In this point of view I find it helpful to provide decrypted (\"cracked\") binaries of free apps to the community (via AppAddict for instance).\n\n",
