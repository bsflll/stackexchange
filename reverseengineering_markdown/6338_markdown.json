  "content": "Hopper allows you to change the representation of numbers in the disassembly window so that:\n\n```\n0000be84         str        r3, [r11, #0xfffffff0]\n\n```\nbecomes:\n\n```\n0000be84         str        r3, [r11, #-0x10]\n\n```\nThis doesn't carry over into the decompiled code though:\n\n```\nr3 = *(r11 + 0xffffffffffffffd8);\n\n```\nWhilst it's not a major thing, it would be nice for the representation to be carried across.\n\nCan this be done?\n\n",
