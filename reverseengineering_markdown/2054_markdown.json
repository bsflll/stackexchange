  "content": "I have loaded a raw binary (ARM firmware image) into Hopper, and manually marked the entry point as code. But now I'd like to have Hopper do auto-analysis (recursive traversal) starting from that code region, and I can't figure out how to get it to do that (the way it would if I'd loaded a standard PE or elf binary). I can use \"Disassemble whole segment\", but that seems to do a linear sweep of the entire (30M) binary, which results in a lot of garbage.\n\nIs there any way to do this?\n\n",

Pressing 'P' creates a procedure for the function at cursor but doesn't do anything for the functions referenced from that function. So, while recursive disassembly is supported by Hopper it fails to do so properly in current versions.",
