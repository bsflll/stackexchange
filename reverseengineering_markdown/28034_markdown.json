  "content": "I need to call an encryption function in a program with the following signature (the second argument is returned):\n\n```\nchar** __usercall decode(char** input, char** output)\n\n```\nAs far as I can tell, Appcall should be used for this kind of thing. There's an example given for functions that take pointers to character arrays, but there's no documented way to use functions that take pointers to pointers to character arrays.\n\nHow can I do this?\n\n",
