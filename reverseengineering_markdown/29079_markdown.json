  "content": "I pulled down boot.oat from an API22 Android phone. It's Android 5.1 Lollipop which brought the change from Dalvik to ART and is a bit mistified.\n\nAs far as I understand, modifying boot.oat is not easy, and permanent, as this file is regenerated whenever a package installation is happening.\n\nNow, I have a class which I need to modify (just a very tiny bit of it), which resides in framework.dex which was the part of boot.oat.\n\nI have two questions:\n\nThanks!\n\n",
