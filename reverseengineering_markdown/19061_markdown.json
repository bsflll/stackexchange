  "content": "I am analyzing a malicious javascript. The code is encoded and obfuscated in a way that I did not manage to even partially deobfuscate yet and it is filled with long strings. In order to simplify the task I put the code to JShint. According to the tool, there are 82 variables that are not used:\n\n\nGiven the context, is it safe to assume that the reason these variables exist is most likely to add to obfuscation but not to fulfill any operation? Would it be reasonable to delete declarations of these variables and have a shorter code to work with?\n\n",

      "content": "This might be true that those variables are added only to confuse analysis but remember that in Javascript there are so many ways to access the variable that I would take such info from an automated tool with a little grain of salt. \n\nIt might be true but it also might be that this code uses non-direct access to those 82 variables.\n\nHaving such code:\n\n```\nre = 'testing a variable';\nalert(window['re']);\n\n```\nJSHint will tell you that the variable is not used but it is. eval would be another example of indirect usage the linter can miss.\n\n",

      "content": "Often then unsued variables are unusued only until you make the first deobfuscation step.\n\nAfter first run, you could see that some code uses these variables, for example using an eval. This because the previous step of obfuscation make  vars look like unusued, only because their use in the code is obfuscated on a (again) previous step.\n\nFor example. You could use eval and base64 encoding to hide the use of a piece of code. \n\nIn a situation like your I tend to remove apparently unused code using IDE tools, then, if the code is still working I can be sure I removed useless fog from the code.  \n\nPerson opinion: JsHint fall to detect used cars just when JavaScript coding is confused... An alert using window object to access a variable make JsHint blind. Is not a good help for this specific purpose.\n\nobviously you need to run every sort of sandboxing, sw and hw isolation and emulation when you try a malicious code . \n\n",
