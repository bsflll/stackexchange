  "content": "I'm working on reversing a c++ binary and it has a function that I want to call with Frida.\nHere's the function signature from IDA: const __m128i *__fastcall sub_0123(__m128i * a1);\n\nIt doesn't seem possible to create an __m128i datatype in a Frida script. Does anyone know how to achieve this?\n\nFor reference, I am on android and this is an Intel x64 intrinsic. Info on the datatype here: http://portal.nacad.ufrj.br/online/intel/compiler_c/common/core/GUID-7478B278-2240-44D8-B396-1DC508E3656E.htm\n\n",
