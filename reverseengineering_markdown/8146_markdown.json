  "content": "I've had two laptops, one Sony and another Acer. Sony laptops backlight can be decreased quite a bit, however the Acer laptops backlight brightness is too much.\n\nI was wondering where these values sit and if there is a possibility to lower the laptop screen backlight brightness any lower than their current settings.\n\nI don't know if this question belongs here but I've asked around a bit in forums and usual answer is to simply decrease brightness using GPU software. Yet this does nothing to the actual backlights, which in the night are eye piercing.\n\n",

I've programmed in Java, C# and a little bit python but have no clue how to reverse engineer. I thought I'd modify the following source codeproject.com/Articles/236898/… to lower the backlight even further yet I found out laptops have preset for backlight. So i guess this falls under reverse engineering.",

So if you need more fine-grained control over the brightness, use the Intel HD Graphics Control Panel (latest drivers for your laptop) to manually adjust the backlight brightness:\n\n\n\n",
