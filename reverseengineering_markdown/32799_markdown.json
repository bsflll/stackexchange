  "content": "I'm currently debugging a program using x64dbg, and I'm struggling to set up a conditional breakpoint on the CreateFileW function:\n\n```\nHANDLE CreateFileW(\n  [in]           LPCWSTR               lpFileName,\n  [in]           DWORD                 dwDesiredAccess,\n  [in]           DWORD                 dwShareMode,\n  [in, optional] LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpSecurityAttributes,\n  [in]           DWORD                 dwCreationDisposition,\n  [in]           DWORD                 dwFlagsAndAttributes,\n  [in, optional] HANDLE                hTemplateFile\n);\n\n```\nSpecifically, I need the breakpoint to trigger only when the function is called with a specific filename/path, such as \"C:/my/file/txt.txt\".\n\nDespite searching online, I haven't found a clear solution for my scenario. Can anyone guide how to achieve this in x64dbg?\n\nWhat I tried\n\nI tried to set a conditional breakpoint with:\n\n```\narg.get(0) == \"C:/my/file/\"\n\n```\nHowever, that doesn't work, it seemingly breaks on every file, no matter the path.\n\n",

      "content": "You can use expression functions to achieve what you want, specifically the streq/strstr functions.\n\nTo break when a specific file is accessed:\n\n```\nstreq(utf16(arg.get(0)), \"C:\\my\\file\\bla.txt\")\n\n```\nTo break if a file in a specific folder in accessed:\n\n```\nstrstr(utf16(arg.get(0)), \"C:\\my\\folder\")\n\n```\nI recommend testing individual subexpressions by putting them in the command bar while paused at the unconditional CreateFileW breakpoint. This makes it easier to debug potential issues (for example using a / as formulated in your question would not work and might be frustrating to find out without doing this).\n\n",
