  "content": "I have an old IP camera that no longer works, doesn't start the ipcamn executable (application that also listens for port 80 connections).\nTherefore I cannot access it via the network and the camera doesn't perform its intended purpose.\n\nIt is based on a RA5350 chip, if I attach a serial to USB adapter to it I can see it booting, then it outputs:\n\n```\nData CRC 01e4cb65 != calculated CRC ed5f8089 for node at 00240af0\nData CRC 01e4cb65 != calculated CRC ed5f8089 for node at 00240af0\nData CRC 01e4cb65 != calculated CRC ed5f8089 for node at 00240af0\n\n```\nThe system is usable, I can move around, I even copied the contents in search of which program outputs this error.\n\nI have found that the camera uses two processes videocatch and ipcamn (this is true according to other internet resources as well).\nThe ipcamn is the process outputting these errors. However upon disassembling or looking at the strings contained in it or the .so files on the system I cannot find anything related to the error above.\n\nI'd like to trace the error to its cause and see if it's fixable.\nAny ideas?\n\n```\n# cat /proc/cpuinfo\nsystem type             : Ralink SoC\nprocessor               : 0\ncpu model               : MIPS 24K V4.12\nBogoMIPS                : 239.61\nwait instruction        : yes\nmicrosecond timers      : yes\ntlb_entries             : 32\nextra interrupt vector  : yes\nhardware watchpoint     : yes\nASEs implemented        : mips16 dsp\nVCED exceptions         : not available\nVCEI exceptions         : not available\n\n```\nI also tried to rule out HW problems by copying the binaries over to a Debian MIPS system in QEMU, but I cannot run the executables on MIPS nor on MIPSEL:\n\n```\nuser@debian-mips:~/mnt/bin$ ./ipcamn \n-bash: ./ipcamn: cannot execute binary file\n\n```\n```\nroot@debian-mipsel:/home/user/mnt/bin# ./ipcamn \nbash: ./ipcamn: No such file or directory\n\n```\n```\nroot@debian-mipsel:/home/user/mnt/bin# file ipcamn \nipcamn: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-II version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped\n\n\n```\nThe file exists and is executable.\n\n",
