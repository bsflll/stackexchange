  "content": "I have a firmware in bin format belongs to Cypress CY7C638xx based gadget.\nThis chip is Low Speed USB Peripheral Controller containing a 8-bit MCU.\n\nI would like to analyse that firmware to reverse it. I could not find any disassembler for that target. \n\nI am planning to dissassemble byte by byte using instruction set. I know it is very tedious and cumborsome work and prone to errors.\n\nIs there another better way?\n\n",
