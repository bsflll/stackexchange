  "content": "I used to have a Logitech G700 mouse that used a wireless proprietary usb receiver. I was using the Logitech setpoint software to customize the mouse's acceleration, macros, and other things. The mouse started double clicking and I had to get a replacement from Logitech but they only the G700s (the G700 was discontinued) so they sent me that mouse. The problem is that the G700s does not work with the setpoint software despite being almost the same as the G700.\n\nInstead, it uses the Logitech Gaming Software which is terrible and lacks many options that are found in the setpoint software. So I want to be able to use my G700s with the setpoint software. I've tried changing the vendor id and product id in regedit but it has no effect and it resets every time the mouse is restarted.\n\nThere's no file that contains a list of compatible devices that can be edited. I think the list of compatible devices is written directly into the software. I opened the setpoint.exe file in IDA Pro and searched for the string G700 and found a line that had it. It was in unicode. How can I edit this line or block of lines to work with the G700s?\n\n",

The setpoint software seems to detect the mouse directly, and without looking at the drivers installed. I still have the old mouse, but the double clicking issue is hardware related, not software.

I usually canibalise old mouses for these they are mostly interchangeable. if you do not have spare micro switch then change the bad one with middle button",

If not then it could be bad capacitors or in worse  case bad IC. Nowdays mostly SMD parts are used and they do not last that much but I do not encourage you to change them find someone with experience or you can permanently damage the PCB if you do not know what you doing.",

The MCU;must support USB your mouse is using I bet USB 2.0 FS or HS. sadly there are not that many MCU;s usable for this with are suited for home made devices.

Then you will need to write OS for both chips one will serve as USB Host for mouse and second will serve as USB client for PC. you need to interconnect them by some connection (like serial port do not be confused serial link on MCUs can operate even on 30MHz unlike 115200Hz limit on PC,or use any other interface) then just forwars the packets between PC an mouse ... only thing that will change is the USB id. Set the USB for PC as VID PID of old mouse and VID PID of host USB to any",
