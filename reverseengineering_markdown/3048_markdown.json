  "content": "According to IDA the file I'm inspecting has imagebase 0x400000. The first data I can see starts at 0x401000 but the program reads some data which is at 00400174.\n\nWhen I put a data access breakpoint there, it breaks in ntdll!RtlpImageDirectoryEntryToData32 which probably means that there is some process data (using Windows 7). Where can I find some information as to what exactly is there stored?\n\nFrom the call stack it looks like there should be some resource data as there is\nFindResource among other things.\n\n```\nChildEBP RetAddr  \n0012f998 7c910385 ntdll!RtlpImageDirectoryEntryToData32+0xf\n0012f9b8 7c9118c0 ntdll!RtlImageDirectoryEntryToData+0x57\n0012fa84 7c911db7 ntdll!LdrpSearchResourceSection_U+0x34\n0012faa0 7c80ad8b ntdll!LdrFindResource_U+0x18\n0012faf4 7e419dbb kernel32!FindResourceExW+0x64\n0012fb18 7e42c924 user32!LoadStringOrError+0x31\n0012fb3c 00404bcd user32!LoadStringA+0x1c\n\n```\n",
