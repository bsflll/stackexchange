  "content": "Is it possible to somehow re-compile/reconstruct Inno Setup file and use existing CompiledCode.bin ? I dont have the source of CompiledCode.bin and writing from scratch is not an option.\n\nBasically what I am trying to do is open up a setup.exe that was made via InnoSetup and edit a few text files inside, then recompile/reconstruct. I dont need to touch the Pascal script at all just change a few lines in a .txt file.\n\n",
