  "content": "I am working on adding a processor to Ghidra (I have no idea what I'm doing, just working my way through based off the documentation).\n\nI've seen SleighDevTools mentioned in the 9.1 release as being \"support of processor module development\", which sounds like it would be helpful to me. However, I can't find any documentation on what it does or how to use it. All, I've found is the source code for it in the Ghidra repo (no readme), and a single mention of it on reddit.\n\nIs there documentation on SleighDevTools? \nIf so, where is it? \nIf not, are there any good resources for processor development besides the official Ghidra docs?\n\nThank you!\n\n",

It can be found at <ghidra install dir>/Extensions/Eclipse/GhidraSleighEditor/, and has some documentation in the GhidraSleighEditor_README.html in that folder.\n\nAs for your question on good documentation besides the Ghidra docs:\n\n",
