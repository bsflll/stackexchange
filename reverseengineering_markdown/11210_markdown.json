  "content": "I'm trying to find a WndProc from explorer.exe that is handling these messages, I've found with Spy++:\n\n```\n<000001> 00000000000B01C8 P message:0xC02B [Registered:\"SHELLHOOK\"] wParam:00000025 lParam:000F0184\n<000002> 00000000000B01C8 P message:0xC02B [Registered:\"SHELLHOOK\"] wParam:00008006 lParam:000F0184\n\n```\nI'm trying to prevent explorer.exe from flashing the task bar button, it's ruining my Windows 10 experience. In Windows 10 the flashing task bar buttons appear in all desktops, and it's just maddening when focusing on a work on another virtual desktop. Not a feature I want. The above messages are sent to Task switcher in explorer.exe, if I can prevent them being handled I can beat this.\n\nI've wealth of knowledge about the WndProc which I want to see, and modify from Spy++, following windows are Property Inspector of Spy++ (64 bit version):\n\n(Note: the 32bit version of Spy++ does not show Window Proc at all, just (Unavailable)(Unicode)\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in x64dbg I have the thread open:\n\n\n\nBut I just can't figure out how can I find the Window Proc in x64dbg?\n\n",

I cooked a script to alloc a page in process memory of calc.exe and assembled a detour using the script language and fetched the actual WndProc.\n\nA screenshot below:\n\n\n\nThe debuggee must be in a paused state.\n\nThe script allocates memory in the debuggee's address space using alloc; after tabbing once the status bar should show the newly allocated address.\nAlso the variables $lastalloc $result should hold the newly allocated memory address; if you do d address a bunch of 00 00 should stare at you.\n\nThat is it; now you have Wndproc in a paper and you have returned to the original state.\n\nThis  is a detour (making an intentional bypass in the code flow of debuggee to do some extra work and return back to the place where bypass was done as if nothing was done to continue the original flow).\n\nUse bp to set a breakpoint in the wndproc you have on paper.\n\n",
