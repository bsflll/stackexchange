  "content": "I'm analyzing a crash dump BSOD on a windows box where I suspect some malware is doing something with the MSRs but it doesn't look like any of them are available via the wrmsr and rdmsr commands. Is there any other way I can extract them? I did some quick searching and didn't see anything useful. \n\nThanks\n\n",

But you could create a driver that registers a system bug-check callback (via KeRegisterBugCheckReasonCallback()) and dumps the MSRs of interest when called.\n\n",
