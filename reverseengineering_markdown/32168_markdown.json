  "content": "I'm trying to figure out how this old game is (de)compressing files, but I don't have much knowledge about file compression.\nI tried running the game from a debug tool to see if I could spot something in the assembly, but that's way over my head..Also tried Ghidra but didn't bring me any closer. I can pinpoint roughly in the gmae code where it's reading file headers and starting allocating memory/decompressing, but what actually happens is a mystery.\n\nThe smallest compressed file is just 5kb, I uploaded it here: https://ufile.io/scibn9hp\n\nThe game is from 1996. Can anyone point me in the right direction for learning this stuff? Should I try understanding the program, or is it possible to understand the compression by just messing with the file?\n\n",
