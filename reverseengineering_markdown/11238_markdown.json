  "content": "I want to detect all the variables live at any instruction/address in a binary. By variable, I refer to both global as well as function local variables. In other words, given a Linux ELF and a virtual address, is there any means to know programmatically what all are the variables (in terms of memory locations) live at that point?\n\nIDA Pro seems to detect the memory locations of probable variables in a procedure.  Does IDA expose any API to collect such information?\n\nI plan to use DynamoRIO to dynamically monitor the program at run-time. A call-ret pair should mark the beginning and ending of a function. Once I encounter a call, I monitor all the read-write accesses on stack locations referenced either by %ebp or %esp. The problem is tail-calls where compiler optimizes a call substituting by jmp, thereby detection of function virtually impossible.\n\n",

      "content": "I don't think that it is possible.\n\nLet's assume the following C code:\n\n```\nint f1(int p1, int p2)\n{\n    int l1, l2, l3;\n    /* some code */\n    l1 = l1 + l2; // here is our virtual address\n    return l1;\n}\n\nint f2(int p3, int p4)\n{\n    int l4, l5, l6;\n    return f1(p3, p4);\n}\n\nint f3(int p5, p6)\n{\n    int l7, l8;\n    return f2(p5, p6) + f1(p6, p5);\n}\n\n```\nObviously the set of local variables in whole the stack of this thread will be different when calling f3, f2 and f1.\n\nFor example when f3 calls f2 f2's locals are on stack. after call to f2 when f3 calls f1 obviously the whole threads stack is different and f2 locals are not alive and it is impossible to restore the full stack layout of callers without knowing the full execution sequence and stack trace.\n\nDetermining global variables, however, is simpler - they always alive and can be retrieved by iteration on all data and bss like elf segments with, for example, following simple code:\n\n```\nimport idautils\nimport idc\nseg_list = [\".bss\", \".data\"] #insert your segment names here\nseg_addrs = []\nfor seg in Segments():\n    if idc.SegName(seg) in seg_list:\n        seg_addrs.append(seg)\n\nfor seg in seg_addrs:  \n    start = SegStart(seg)\n    end = SegEnd(seg)\n    for ea in idautils.Heads(start, end):\n        gen_xrefs = XrefsTo(ea, 0)\n        for xx in gen_xrefs:\n            print hex(ea), hex(xx.frm)\n\n```\nEverything which Ida recognizes as referenced will be printed out.\nThe accuracy of these results, however, is questionable and depends on accuracy of IDA analysis.\n\nFunction local variables and stack layout can be retrieved by getting the stack frame structure, with usage of the following APIs:\n\n```\nGetFrame(ea)         #Get ID of function frame structure\nGetFrameLvarSize(ea) #Get size of local variables in function frame\nGetFrameRegsSize(ea) #Get size of saved registers in function frame\nGetFrameArgsSize(ea) #Get size of arguments in function frame which are purged upon return\nGetFrameSize(ea)     #Get full size of function frame\n\n```\nThe frame structure may be observed with the following IDAPython APIs from idc module:\n\n```\nGetMemberId(sid, member_offset)\nGetStrucPrevOff(sid, offset)\nGetStrucNextOff(sid, offset)\nGetFirstMember(sid)\nGetLastMember(sid)\nGetMemberOffset(sid, member_name)\nGetMemberName(sid, member_offset)\nGetMemberComment(sid, member_offset, repeatable)\nGetMemberSize(sid, member_offset)\nGetMemberFlag(sid, member_offset)\nGetMemberStrId(sid, member_offset)\nIsUnion(sid)\n\n```\nHope it helps.\n\n",

There's just too many ways for local variables to get generated anywhere on the stack to reliably determine every possible location for a particular variable.
