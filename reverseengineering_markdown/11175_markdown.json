  "content": "I have read that HBGary's FastDump Pro (FDPro) can capture kernel dumps and include the page file contents.\n\nAlthough I'm not sure if the tool is still available commercially (it's not listed on the countertack.com webpage), I'd like to know whether the file format created by FastDump Pro is compatible with WinDbg or if I need other tools to analyze it (HBGary/Countertack tools).\n\nIf they are compatible, I see some benefit in having the page file contents included in the dump, since that would e.g. give the possibility of debugging a .NET application from a kernel dump, which is usually not possible since parts of the of the virtual memory have been paged out.\n\n",
