      "content": "Android APKs are signed to ensure the developer (holder of the private key) is the only person who can update the application. When the apk is signed, much like that of a jar file, hashes are taken of all the files.\n\nWhat is likely happening is that you are modifying a file and not resigning the application - this will cause the package manager to reset due to hash mismatches when checking the signatures.\n\n",
