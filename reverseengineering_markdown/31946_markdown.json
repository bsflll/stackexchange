  "content": "I have a USB device from a vendor (TRENDnet) that has the exact same chipset as a QNAP device with an available firmware patching tool.\n\nIt's my belief that this firmware patching tool should work perfectly fine with my TRENDnet device.\n\nHowever, when I run the firmware patching tool, it reports that it cannot find a suitable device and exits.\n\nI believe the firmware patching tool is looking for specific USB VIDs and PIDs to detect\nvalid USB devices. I've extracted from the drivers that these are the valid VID/PID combinations.\n\n```\nVID_2ECA - PID_C101\nVID_2ECA - PID_C102\nVID_0B95 - PID_2790\nVID_0B95 - PID_2791\nVID_1C04 - PID_0015\nVID_1C04 - PID_0016\n\n```\nI would like to see if it's possible to inject additional PID/VID values into the tool to allow my device to be detected and have the firmware upgraded.\n\nI've tried searching for the various VID/PID combos in a hex editor to no avail, and have also tried to decompile the app using IDA Free with no success (mainly because I have no idea what I am doing).\n\nCan someone either look at the file or offer some advice of what to do look for/try next?\n\nThe firmware patching tool can be downloaded from this link.\n\nThe tool is named aqusbupdate.exe and it reads in QNAP_QNA-UC5G1T_FW_3.1.6.bin when passed in as an argument.\n\n",
