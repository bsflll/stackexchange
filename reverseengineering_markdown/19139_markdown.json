  "content": "I'm familiar with finding a player base pointer as-well as other values in games, and finding offsets and such.\nAnd I have applied that to some of my own code in the past.\n\nBut does this practice apply to instances of any class?\n\nHere's an example program.\n\n```\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass A {\npublic:\n    int i = 0;\n    virtual void doThing() {\n        i++;\n        cout << i << endl;\n    }\n\n};\n\nint main()\n{\n    A* a = new A();\n    while (1)\n    {\n        a->doThing();\n        Sleep(6000);\n    }\n    system(\"pause\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\nI used Cheat engine to find the address of the variable i in A::doThing. Then I used the option to find what writes to that address. From there I found what appeared to be an offset, did a pointer scan and found that example.exe+0x001A2EC was a static pointer and the value held by i was at offset 0x4.\n\nWould example.exe+0x001A2EC be considered the pointer to the instance of class A? \n\nWhat I'm trying to do is basically make a copy of the target program's pointer to the instance of class A, then access it's V-Table in my own code which is to be injected into the process.\n\nThis is how I was trying to achieve this.\n\n```\nDWORD Base = (DWORD)GetModuleHandle(0);\nA* a = (A*)(Base + 0x1A2EC);\nvoid** vtable = *(void***)a;\n\n```\nIf there's something wrong with my understanding or methodology please do point out what i am doing wrong, or suggest some other way which I can get a copy of the pointer.\n\n",

      "content": "I'll start with a few minor corrections and clarifications, just to make sure we're using the right terms and exact definitions.\n\nFirst of all, i is not a variable of method A::doThing. It is a member of the A class.\n\nDoing this gives you the address of method A::doThing is located. Specifically, the address at which A::i is modified within that method.\n\nI would assume you found the offset of A at which i is located, but I'm not 100% I understand what you mean by \"did a pointer scan\". I assume you subtracted the offset of i from the address found at the first stage (\"I used Cheat engine to find the address of the variable i\") to get the address of the object itself, then searched for pointers to that address.\n\nTo be more accurate, example.exe+0x001A2EC would be an address of a variable of type A * (or pointer to an A instance), and it's value will be the value returned by new A();, i.e. an instance of class A, as you expect. Reading it's value will point you to where that instance of A is currently in memory.\n\nHowever several assumptions you have may change between releases or even for different compiled versions of the same code base.\n\nThe most obvious one in your example code, is the fact you're using the exetuable's image base to access the main thread's stack. This is likely to break depending on how/where the stack is allocated for your process, and is likely to be unreliable even if executed several times in succession, depending on OS and configuration.\n\nEven if you somehow address that, there are multiple other potential complications and slight changes that could make your life harder. To name a few:\n\nI hope this did not discourage you from pursuing your goal, but encouraged you to gain a better understanding of the internals and intricate world of dynamic patching.\n\nAs a side note I'll include a warning about anti-cheat detection tools in a lot of games could make these endeavors quite expensive (account bans, etc).\n\n",

Also, i don't quite understand how this differs from finding a static pointer to a player class in games as I've done before.  (Just to clarify also i don't intend on getting accounts banned anytime soon, anything I've done with games has just been for the purpose of learning, and done using insecure servers.)",
