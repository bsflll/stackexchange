  "content": "I'm running a 64-bit MS Windows 7 with all updates installed. About 1 or 2 weeks ago I've noticed that whenever I restart the OS, the virtual memory pages (of whatever process), corresponding to system libraries like ntdll.dll and kernel32.dll are slightly different. \n\nI'm not talking about the base address of the loaded modules, because I know that changes due to ASLR. I'm talking about the actual contents of the loaded modules, which as far as I know was not affected by ASLR implementations on Windows.\n\nTo illustrate what I mean, let me show you the following screenshot that compares 2 binary instances of ntdll.dll captured before (top-half) and after (bottom-halt) one OS restart:\n\n\nThe picture shows just a small part of ntdll.dll and therefore just a few differences. However, there are more. The size of these DLLs don't change, only some bytes at particular locations.\n\nI obtained the 2 binary instances which are compared in the previous picture using Process Hacker like so:\n\nQuestion 1: What is causing these bytes to change? \n\nQuestion 2: What do these changing bytes represent in the code of the DLLs? \n\n",

Anything that's not relative to the base (be it global variables or calls or whatever) needs to be adjusted if the image base changes.\n\nPE files can have a relocation table for that. Can, as in standard .exe files usually don't have it, as it was not necessary until ASLR (random base addresses for modules) came along.\n\nFor DLLs the base address is likely to change as it depends on what other files are already loaded so they almost always have a base relocation table that says \"If the base address differs from XYZ, add the delta to the following locations\".\n\nIf you are curios how that base relocation table looks like, I'll recommend checking out the following:\n\n",
