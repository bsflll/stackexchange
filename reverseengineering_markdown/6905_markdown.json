  "content": "Microsoft documentation gives WinMain() as the entry point for a Windows program, but unlike DllMain() it seems to be a pure fiction arranged by the compiler-provided startup code.\n\nI've looked at the output of a few Win32 compilers (32-bit and 64-bit) and in all cases the information passed to WinMain() was synthesised by the startup code and not based on any parameters passed to the entry point by the Windows loader. Also, all the samples I analysed - and all the examples I remember seeing on the 'net - used ExitProcess() even though a simple return from the entry point seems to have exactly the same effect.\n\nDoes anyone know of any documentation - official or otherwise - regarding the game rules for PE32(+) entry points?\n\n",

      "content": "No, Microsoft's documentation doesn't give WinMain() as the entry point for a Windows program.\n\nFrom the WinMain() documentation to which you linked above (emphasis mine) - \"WinMain entry point [is] the user-provided entry point for a graphical Windows-based application... Depending on the programming framework, the call to the WinMain function can be preceded and followed by additional activities specific to that framework.\"\n\nIn other words, if you're building a native application, your compiler will likely build your executable file such that its framework initialization code is executed before your WinMain() function.\n\nYes, from the Microsoft PE and COFF Specification, the AddressOfEntryPoint field in the PE header is defined as \"For program images, this is the starting address.\" It's this field that will typically point to the framework initialization code described above.\n\nNote that despite AddressOfEntryPoint being the starting address of the program, the code at that address will be executed after TLS callback functions (also documented in the PE/COFF documentation) if they exist, and after statically loaded DLLs' DllMain() functions.\n\nAs explained here by @igor-skochinsky, \"the registers at the entry point of PE file do not have defined values.\" However, as he points out, EAX often points to the AddressOfEntryPoint and EBX often points to the PEB.\n\nYou may want to refer to @Ange's Initial values documentation to find other unofficial register values at entry point.\n\n",

It seems that much of what we know about things going on under the hood (post-Pietrek/Schulman) we know only because of his excellent work... The reminder regarding TLS callbacks will be useful for people dealing with unknown packers and similar stuff.",

      "content": "What do you mean by real PE entry point?\n\nI think you are confused with WinMain and AddressOfEntryPoint.\n\nWinMain is not the AddressOfEntryPoint they are different things.\n\nAddressOfEntryPoint\n\nAddressOfEntryPoint has no parameters it is simply the starting address of the executable. (except on Windows Vista+ maybe, I have seen that the PEB address is passed as a parameter by kernel32.BaseThreadInitThunk)\n\nYou are right. A simple RET from entry point would be enough to exit the process. But I guess that way you have to keep the stack balanced.\n\nHave a look at Microsoft Portable Executable and Common Object File Format\n\nPE File Format\n\n",

          "text": "Clarification: for DllMain(), the user-visible contract realised by compiler startup code is exactly the same as that for the real DLL entry point that is called by Windows, which is what's documented under DllMain() on MSDN. For WinMain() that may have been the case in 16-bit Windows but in 32-bit/64-bit Windows it is definitely not the case. I'm interested in finding out what's really going on at the process entry point, whether there are any dependable (documented) invariants or not, and whether there are any contracts that the entry point code needs to adhere to.",
