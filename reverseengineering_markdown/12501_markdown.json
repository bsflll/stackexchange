  "content": "First, I wasn't sure if I should post this on the Lego Stack Exchange site or here, and I decided this site had more to do with the question (I hope I don't get bad rep for this). OK, my friends and I have Lego NXT sumo bot competions for fun. Basically, you build a robot that waits five seconds and competes against a robot to stay on a board. We normally focus on the mechanical side to win against other robots (find them and push them off the board), but I had the idea to try a software attack. My idea was too:\n\nI have tried testing the NXT Bluetooth for vulnerabilities (I have knowledge of Windows/Linux exploitation and debugging) and I can't find anything. The main problem is that the NXT firmware handles Bluetooth connections, in other words you connect the devices with a pass code before running the program that requires Bluetooth. So, my questions are:\n\nUpdate\nFirst, thanks for all of the ideas and answers. Secondly, several of the answers note about the legality of what I am trying to do. Yes, it is legal where I live. Third, I talked with main guy and judge of the competition and he said that he would love to see a software attack like this. \n\nWhere I'm at now\nI have Kali Linux and the mac address has been found. I also found a paper here\non the control protocols. The main dilemma I am still facing is the fact that a Bluetooth passcode has to be entered on the device I intend to connect to. Any updates will be posted here!\n\n",

      "content": "Two primary concerns: If your competition is with a formal organization/people who are \"friends\" but you never drank beer together, then for starters you want to see if this is even legal in your country. In the ole' US-of-A as this could be in violation of the CFAA, but I'm not a lawyer. Also, would this disqualify you from the (informal) competition? \n\nSecond, think about it: the following (cheeky) attack is notoriously hard to defend against and would require you and your friends changing your pairing codes immediately before AND after each match IN PRIVATE, which is a pain.\n\nWith that aside, there are quite a few ways to compromise the enemy team with features, not bugs :D Why go through the trouble of fuzzing the NXT's bluetooth stack and seeing if it has a JTAG port for you to debug it when you can do it the easy way?\nFor instance, before the match starts (if they already have their NXT on and are in range) you can pair to it, browse its saved connections and control their NXT, their robot AND yours! Or just directly pair to their robot. However, you need the pairing code!\n\nTo perform this attack, you absolutely need a device that you can sniff (high-speed) bluetooth traffic with. A software defined radio like hackRF comes highly recommended because its one of the only bluetooth devices I know that can capture high speed bluetooth data packets. These are the steps I would take to exploit an enemy team's lego NXT or robot:\n\nFor Steps 1-4, try it out on your own devices first, NOT theirs. Its always best to have a \"dry\" run (steps 1-4) before the \"live\" run (against their NXT/robot in step 5).\n\nArmed with the enemy team's pairing codes, knowledge on how to send custom LCP commands via SDR and/or bluesnarf, in the next round you should be able to cheat quite a few different ways:\n\n",

      "content": "I don't know which version of NXT you are using, since I'm not experienced with 3.0, but if you have a 2.0 brick you are able to install a custom firmware which would allow you to code in different languages.\n\nThere are two main cfw, one allows you to program in java and the other one in C.\n\nFrom here I would suggest you to install RobotC because it's quite powerful; while you can run standard lego binaries (the ones created with the block ide) you have the power of C.\n\nFrom there, you should read the RobotC docs and learn the API used for bluetooth, and from there, try to implement a public exploit (if exists) or develop your own.\n\nMy opinion is that it would require lots of time and probably the bluetooth protocol is secure (not in the way it is not safe (cause it isn't and traffic can be sniffed), but I think it's difficult to achieve code execution on the remote lego)\n\nAlso, take a look at stack smash vulnerabilities.\n\nEDIT: Also consider using those technics in a competition may be ilegal, and in your country it can be ilegal also to search for vulnerabilities.\n\n",
