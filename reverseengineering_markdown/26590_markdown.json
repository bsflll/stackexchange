      "content": "The main built-in way I see to do this is to use gdbserver --multi without attaching to a process at that time. Then, you connect with target extended-remote in gdb, and then run the attach <pid> in gdb.\n\nYou could also instead use a wrapper on the debugee to not start gdbserver until a connection is made:\n\n```\n$ socat tcp-l:<port>,reuseaddr,fork exec:\"gdbserver --once --attach <pid>\"\n\n```\nStatically compiled builds of socat can be made by you or often found online.\n\n",
