  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1817/is-there-any-disassembler-to-rival-ida-pro",
  "content": "Is there any disassembler (not only a live debugger) second to IDA in capabilities? IDA is wonderful, and somewhat amazing in how robust and useful it is for reversing. However, it is quite expensive to properly license. Is there any viable alternative, or does IDA hold the monopoly on this market?\n\nI don't expect an alternative to be as good as IDA, just looking for other options that may be more affordable, and useful enough.\n\nEDIT: Preferrably, multi-platform support should exist, though that's optional. MIPS, ARM, x86, and x86-64 would be nice, but a disassembler that handles any one of those is a good option to know about.\n\n",

However, for casual disassembly and even some decompiling Hopper seems a good choice for anyone not willing to shell out hundreds of bucks for IDA Pro. If you want a free ride, radare2 is probably the next in line, but it takes some getting used to.\n\nHaving gotten my first IDA Pro Standard license as a student I have to admit the price point is steep, but it's worth every penny. When I began to work professionally with RCE-related things I upgraded to the \"normal\" license first and later upgraded to IDA Pro Advanced to get the x64 support.\n\nAlso keep in mind there is a freeware version of IDA with license restrictions (but suitable for hobbyists or students) and restrictions of the capabilities.\n\n",
