I want this FCG to include API calls as well, so function x of class y will be a node, and if that function calls something like WriteConsole, I want that node to connect to WriteConsole API node (preferably with a distinctive coloring).\n\nBasically I want to generate something similar to the following, but for .NET executables:\n\n\n\n",
