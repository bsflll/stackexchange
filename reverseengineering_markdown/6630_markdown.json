  "content": "Is it possible to make the .data section of an ELF file executable?\n\nI've tried to make the .data section executable by changing the flags of the .data section, but it simply doesn't work.\nIs it not possible by system design? I'm looking for a method other than dynamically modifying permissions with mprotect.\n\nThanks.\n\n",
