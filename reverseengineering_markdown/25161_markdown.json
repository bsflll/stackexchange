  "content": "I found an address of a function from the game AssaultCube, and the address is 0045BCA0. In IDA, I disassembled ac_client.exe as a portable executable and tried to search for that address in the subview window with no results. This address is definitely in the actual game. How would I make IDA include more subview addresses so I can find that function address?\n\nCan't Find Address\n\n\n\n",
