  "content": "I want to find an address of a symbol (e.g strcpy) inside a binary using radare2. I tried to use the f command to list all flags which are recognized by r2 but the list is enormous and it's not comfortable to find the address of a specific symbol that way.  \n\nWhat is the best way, if there's any, to do so.\n\n",

      "content": "The f command is used to list all the flags from the selected flagspace. By default all the available flagspaces are selected. In order to select the 'symbols' flagspace and list only the flags inside it, use:\n\n```\n[0x004049a0]> fs symbols\n[0x004049a0]> f\n0x00402a00 261 main\n0x004049a0 41 entry0\n0x0061e600 8 obj.__bss_start\n0x00413c8c 9 sym._fini\n0x0061e610 4 obj.optind\n0x004022b8 26 sym._init\n0x0061e620 8 obj.program_invocation_name\n0x0061e600 0 loc.__bss_start\n0x0061f368 0 loc._end\n0x00412960 38 sym._obstack_memory_used\n0x0061e5f8 8 obj.obstack_alloc_failed_handler\n0x00412780 17 sym._obstack_begin\n0x0061e640 8 obj.stderr\n0x004128f0 106 sym._obstack_free\n0x004128c0 48 sym._obstack_allocated_p\n0x0061e618 8 obj.optarg\n0x004127a0 21 sym._obstack_begin_1\n0x004127c0 245 sym._obstack_newchunk\n0x0061e608 8 obj.stdout\n\n```\nHowever, my preferred way to list all the symbols is to use the i command which actually uses 'rabin2' (man rabin2) to retrieve information about the binary. Use i? to get help about the command.\n\nIn order to list all the symbols run is.\nIf you want to \"grep\" for a specific symbol use radare's internal grep ~:\n\n```\n[0x004049a0]> is~strcpy\nvaddr=0x004023c0 paddr=0x000023c0 ord=013 fwd=NONE sz=16 bind=GLOBAL type=FUNC name=imp.strcpy\n\n```\nAnd if you want only the address, use:\n\n```\n[0x004049a0]> is~strcpy[1]\n0x004023c0\n\n```\nMore information about flags and flagspaces can be found here\nMore information about symbols can be found here\n\n",
