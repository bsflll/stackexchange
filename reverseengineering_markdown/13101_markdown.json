  "content": "I'm using IDA Pro 6.9 with some PowerPC disassembly. The code sets up r13 to a value, say 0x10000, then offsets that register to load and store memory in that region. r13 is never modified again in the code, it is only used for loading/storing data by offsetting.\n\n```\ne_stb     r7, -0x56E2(r13)\n\n```\nI'm hoping there is a way to tell IDA the value of r13 so that it will automatically generate a reference to the correct memory location so that I get something like:\n\n```\ne_stb     r7, -0x56E2(r13) # Named_Location\n\n```\nAs well as the value at that location when I hover with the mouse.\n\nUpdate:\nIgor Skochinsky gave what is the correct answer but didn't fix my specific problem. \n\nThe answer seems to have worked anywhere r13 is used in an add instruction, e_add16i r31, r13, -0x2DF2 # unk_4000ADE2 but is not working for direct relative load/store instructions, e_stb r3, -0x2E08(r13) (no variable name, offset in red).\n\nThis might be a bug in IDA.\n\n",

However, when I set this value and force a reanalysis IDA doesn't update the instructions, it shows the e_stb     r7, -0x56E2(r13) as before, no changes. Also, if it helps, the offset, -0X56E2 is red which seems to indicate IDA is trying to do something with it.  Have any other ideas? I'll mark your answer accepted as this does seem the right way, just something isn't working for me.",

      "content": "Regarding the potential bug in IDA: \n\nFirst of all, you can add references yourself with idaapi.add_cref and idaapi.add_dref IDAPython APIs. This may be done with relatively simple script like this:\n\n```\nimport idaapi\nimport idautils\nimport idc\n\npredefined_r13 = YOUR_R13_VALUE\n\nfor h in idautils.Heads():\n    dis = idc.GetDisasm(h) #probably there is another way to do it and parsing textual assembly is not the best option\n    pos = dis.find (\"(r13)\")\n    if pos != -1: #we have your register here\n          splitted = dis[:pos].split() \n          lastarg = splitted[-1]\n          lastarg_numeric = int(lastarg, 16)\n          addr = predefined_r13 + lastarg_numeric\n          idaapi.add_dref(h, addr, idc.dr_O)\n\n```\nOf course this script should be extended:\nthe expression with r13 may be more complicated,the type of data reference may be different and it may be the code reference at all, and the problem is already solved for part of the cases as it is wrote in the answer by @Igor Skochinsky, but the general idea is illustrated pretty well.\n\nIn addition (if you want to override the work of disassembler) you can install your own disassembler module hook as @Rolf Rolles did in this article which will recompute all these things (you'll need to override idaapi.IDP_Hooks.custom_emu ), but adding data references is probably easier way to achieve your goal.\n\n",
