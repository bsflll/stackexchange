      "content": "This indicates the offset within the function.\n\nIf you wish to reference an instruction in an executable binary, the most basic and straight-forward method would be using it's full address. However especially with ASLR enabled, different versions, RVA vs file offsets and other nuances it may be more useful to reference an instruction relative to the function start address.\n\nIn the case of CRYPTSP.CryptDuplicateHash+0C, we can easily see the address is at offset 0x0C within the CryptDuplicateHash function inside a module called CRYPTSP.\n\n",
