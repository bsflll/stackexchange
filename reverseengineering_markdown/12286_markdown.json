  "content": "I am analysing an embedded system running QNX on armle, uname -a identifies it as:\n\n```\nQNX mmx 6.5.0 2012/06/20-13:49:13EDT nVidia_Tegra2(T20)_Devlite_Boards armle\n\n```\nFirmware updates come with a file called metainfo2.txt which always ends with a signature block, eg:\n\n```\n[Signature]\nsignature1 = \"a73e111de512e09bad2dc08eff685a38\"\nsignature2 = \"4fc032192a20fd1e242ad64af5b509a7\"\nsignature3 = \"6a7432f754aff0d6b74a7ec2072cbb11\"\nsignature4 = \"e91f68f569508b77712d1869edd6d0b9\"\nsignature5 = \"923eb77ba815dba8e44d5e09412cdf2e\"\nsignature6 = \"830518f3b38d48df892a3a0c65cc67f1\"\nsignature7 = \"09e5e0f5f06ce0376d032ab21051510f\"\nsignature8 = \"3dab7f75fcdf54a96d8aa7f3c617f76d\"\n\n```\nThis looks like it's a RSA encryption and is used to determine if the file contents were changed. I think it's a hash of a particular section of the file: MetafileChecksum = \"ec5afd6459c3579ebed8841cc41fe17bb61b814d\"\n\nI found a folder with public keys which has a subfolder name MetainfoKey and contains likely the public key, a 288 byte file:\n\n```\nC0 F3 89 EE C7 B6 6C 9D C7 36 50 8F F8 8A EB 1F\nB1 13 94 2E AD 02 08 14 D0 8D 29 E8 68 F1 4B 20\n86 BC D7 DD CC BA 75 59 F9 99 E7 6D 24 61 96 60\nBB E1 74 34 DA 59 98 80 87 F2 A9 9C D4 65 B1 FF\n42 35 22 B7 8C B0 DE 46 3A 66 96 13 D3 56 DF A9\nE8 6E 0E 2E 0B 6D AB 5D E8 91 31 C5 A0 72 7A EA\nB1 76 72 78 AB 10 1D CD 9C 3C FC 10 26 70 5C 1D\nAB 3B F5 3B F5 0A FA FB 3F 52 DA 2C EB 0B EE 57\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 03\n83 0A CD 65 56 FC 2F B4 7B 1B 67 43 12 E3 4E 7A\n0A AD 1E DF BA 7E B2 79 D9 51 3A DB 10 16 61 48\n13 1B BA 9C 85 2A B7 01 91 49 16 65 62 94 61 6B\nB1 A9 B8 F8 46 2E BC 20 6D E5 7F 53 AF EF 00 00\n53 AB 8E 4F 63 29 BF 00 B0 ED 45 E8 E9 20 67 8E\nF6 7A F8 BC CB 7B 4D CF 88 01 59 BB CB F1 B1 04\nD4 A1 C0 57 70 AA D7 38 E8 BD 9A 28 4E 94 99 5C\nB7 96 49 28 5A C4 04 9C 6B 57 8F C5 4F 74 6A C9\n\n```\nMy objective is to be able to change metainfo2.txt and a possible method could be to replace the public key with a new one but I need to understand how the signature section is used to verify the file contents. I am looking for answer or pointers on how to achieve this...\n\n",

The 0x1ffff...00 is padding.

To change the data signed by these keys, you'd need to generate your own 1024 bit RSA key replace the c0... key with your own public key, change the data, replace the hash in the data above and sign that data using your private key. \n\n",

EE 57).  Which when combined with the public exponent (e = 00 00 .. 00 03) in the next 32 bytes of the file yields us the RSA public key (n, e).  Applying that to the data in your [Signature] block yields:\n\n```\n1ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff\nfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff\nfffffffffffffffffff003021300906052b0e03021a050004145e3246e50a4dad079a61f99fa3297c01d802e038\n\n```\nA standard ASN.1 signature structure containing the SHA1 hash 5e3246e50a4dad079a61f99fa3297c01d802e038.\n\nYou'll find that's the SHA1 hash of metainfo2.txt after you've added the MetafileChecksum but before appending the [Signature] block.\n\nAlso, you may be left wondering what the remaining 128 bytes (83 0A .. 6A C9) in the key file represent?  Well, if you decrypt these using the same public key, you'll get:\n\n```\n1ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff\nfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff\nfffffffffffffffffff003021300906052b0e03021a05000414c9b809bea9c9d13a87f7ef2212d9d03281da7020\n\n```\nAgain a ASN.1 signature structure containing the SHA1 hash c9b809bea9c9d13a87f7ef2212d9d03281da7020.  And you'll find that's the SHA1 of first 128+32=160 bytes of the key file containing the public key (n, e).\n\nUnfortunately none of this gets us any close to being able to sign metainfo2.txt files, as we don't know the private key exponent (d).  But if you are replacing the keys with your own, at least you now know how to fully populate the MetainfoKey file, and also how to sign a metainfo2.txt with your own private key.\n\n",
