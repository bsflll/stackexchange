  "content": "I'm writing a plugin for IDA and I need to get the line number of an instruction in the main view when someone clicks on that instruction or somewhere in the view. I noticed that there is GetLineNumber(ea) but it only gives me the line number in the source files, not the line num of the disassembled code.\n\n",

I would use the ea, but the ea is not in a 1:1 relationship with the lines.  EDIT: basically I need it because I have to sync the view with another custom view I create. Are there alternatives to do that?",

      "text": "my view keeps annotations for some lines of the code so the line num would be perfect since, as I said, the ea is not 1:1 with the lines (more lines may have the same ea). after having digged through the idapython source I started to suspect that IDA would not keep track of that info... I will find a way to sync with the ea. Thanks anyway.",
