  "content": "Given the following short assembly snippet:\n\n```\nshr   rax, 3\nadc   rax, 0\n\n```\nI worked this out a bit:\n\nSo looking at the bits,\n\n```\n        128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1 \n        8    7   6   5   4   3   2   1\n        ------------------------------\n        1    1   1   1   1   CF  X   X\nCF=1 |  0    0   0   1   1   1   1   1  ; shr 3\n\n```\nSo if we div 8 and add the CF the most correct function is something like this,\n\n```\ndef f(x):\n  return x//8  + int( (x//4) % 2 )\n\n```\nWhen would that be useful. Quickly testing it, I can see that I am right. \n\n```\nrax = 0  -> 0\nrax = 1  -> 0\nrax = 2  -> 0\nrax = 3  -> 0\n\nrax = 4  -> 1\nrax = 7  -> 1\nrax = 8  -> 1\nrax = 11 -> 1\n\nrax = 12 -> 2\nrax = 13 -> 2\nrax = 14 -> 2\nrax = 15 -> 2\nrax = 16 -> 2\nrax = 17 -> 2\nrax = 18 -> 2\nrax = 19 -> 2\n\n...\n\nrax = 20 -> 3\nrax = 28 -> 4\n\n```\nDecompilation with Radare is also not useful here,\n\n```\nint64_t entry0 (void) {\n    rax >>= 3;\n    __asm (\"adc rax, 0\");\n}\n\n```\nMy questions is, therefore, although I do understand the immediate impact these instructions have on the operand register, what is the higher level meaning of this instruction sequence?\n\nThis is riddle 0x09 from the XCHG RAX, RAX book.\n\n",
