  "content": "I am learning radare2. Is there a way to demangle c++ functions during disassembling? For example in gdb\n\n```\nset print asm-demangle\n\n```\nchanges \n\n```\ncallq 0x400a30 <_ZNSo3putEc@plt>\n\n```\nto\n\n```\ncallq 0x400a30 <_std::ostream::put(char)@plt>\n\n```\nedit:\nI had radare2 0.9.6 which comes with Ubuntu's synaptic package manager. I reinstalled it from https://github.com/radare/radare2. Now I see the asm.demangle variable after entering Ve, it is set to true, but names are still mangled.\n\n",

You can grep through the output for all the vars that have the pattern demangle with\n\n```\n\n[0x00001d52]> e??~demangle\n        asm.demangle: Show demangled symbols in disasm\n        bin.demangle: Import demangled symbols from RBin\n            bin.lang: Language for bin.demangle\n[0x00001d52]>\n\n```\nRadare2 needs to be told to load the demangle informations at startup, so you can set bin.demangle to true, and reopen the file:\n\n```\n e bin.demangle = true\n oo \n\n```\nLast but not least, you can provide a symbol name in its mangled form on a case by case basis, using the command iD:\n\n```\n[0x7c810705]> iD cxx _ZNSo3putEc\nstd::ostream::put\n[0x7c810705]>\n\n```\nBy the way, a tip instead of asking a question here and waiting forever:\nradare2 is self documented, so you can begin by typing ? to get help, and then append ? to each command, like a?, or pd? and so onâ€¦\n\n",
