  "content": "my Problem is, i have bought a Huion Kamvas 22 Plus pen display for drawing and painting.\n\nOn my old Wacom tablet i had some hardware buttons and could map functions/setting of the driver to these hardware buttons.\n\nThe new Huion Monitor doesnt have any Hardware Buttons! Thats ok , i just use keyboard shortcuts anyways ...\n\nBut theres one problem,\n\nthe huion driver window has a function called \"switch screen\". with that i can switch the mouse output from the Pen to another monitor (in a multi monitor setup). This cant be mapped to any keyboard shortcut though , just (eventual) hardware buttons which come with the huion displays. As i mentioned, my model(the Kamvas 22 plus) doesnt have any buttons though.\n\nNow i want to\n\nA)\n\nfind the specific function/argument in a file called \"TabletDriverCore.exe\" or any of its loaded dlls\n\nand B)\n\nrun this function(+ correct arguments) from the command line / autohotkey / whatever\n\nis that possible and how would i achieve that ?\n\n",

          "text": "Hello, thanx . Yes its most probably that exe.its easy to see in process explorer lighting up on switch screen (now mapped to one of the pen buttons)  and if i kill the exe the pen and the switch screen  dont work anymore.  But i think this is above my head, i think i could manage to write a dll (would be my first), if i knew the correct function and parameters. but debugging isanother thing of its own where one needs to be confident and trained i guess. ill try my best though, do you recommend any easy to use and understand debugger?",

You need to attach the debugger to the process, try to find any references (strings or anything else) for the functionality you are trying to trace, and start from there to trace back until you reach to the function header and be able to see the pushed parameters. It's indeed a bit tricky, there are no way that simplifies such task (at least to my knowledge).",
