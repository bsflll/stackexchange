  "content": "I am trying to unpack a clear spot firmware update\n\nThe firmware I am trying to reverse can be found on the download page of the vendor\nI have used the fwtools to unpack the firmware as described on this page.\n\nAfter I did this, I managed to get a \"kernel.bin\" and a \"rootfs.bin\".\nNow I want to include a new/additional certificate to this modem and make some edits on the administrator page that is within this modem (a Wimax one).\n\nSo I checked the rootfs file using the file tool. And I got the following output:\n\n```\nrootfs.bin: Linux Compressed ROM File System data, little endian size 4280320 version #2 sorted_dirs CRC 0xbf224100, edition 16777728, 268441607 blocks, 1325400384 files\n\n```\nThis was no to little help so I gave binwalk a try and I got this:\n\n```\n  DECIMAL         HEX             DESCRIPTION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0               0x0             CramFS filesystem, little endian size 4280320 version #2 sorted_dirs CRC 0xbf224100, edition 16777728, 268441607 blocks, 1325400384 files\n8               0x8             Squashfs filesystem, big endian, version 2.1, size: 4276396 bytes, 1028 inodes, blocksize: 65536 bytes, created: Fri Jun 22 23:02:36 2012\n\n```\nBut for doing the entire firmware file I got the following output.\n\n```\n    root@bt:/pentest/reverse-engineering/binwalk# ./binwalk -m /pentest/reverse-engineering/binwalk/magic.binwalk /root/fwtools_20100826c/bin.linux/imw.bin\n\nDECIMAL         HEX             DESCRIPTION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n855032          0xD0BF8         CramFS filesystem, little endian size 4280320 version #2 sorted_dirs CRC 0xbf224100, edition 16777728, 268441607 blocks, 1325400384 files\n855040          0xD0C00         Squashfs filesystem, big endian, version 2.1, size: 4276396 bytes, 1028 inodes, blocksize: 65536 bytes, created: Fri Jun 22 23:02:36 20\n\n```\nAs this did stoke me as odd I didn't continue. I don't know how to unpack the firmware. I think I have tried about everything I know you can do manually, firmware mod fit, fwtools, the whole lot!\n\nCan someone shed some light on my issue and tell me how to continue?\n\n",

      "content": "The CramFS image is a false positive; I doubt there would be over 1 billion files in a 5MB firmware image.\n\nIt looks like your binwalk signatures are a bit old; here is the output from mine (running the latest from the trunk):\n\n```\nDECIMAL     HEX         DESCRIPTION\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n14944       0x3A60      LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x6D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes \n855040      0xD0C00     Squashfs filesystem, big endian, version 2.1, size: 4276396 bytes, 1028 inodes, blocksize: 65536 bytes, created: Fri Jun 22 23:02:36 2012\n\n```\nThe LZMA image is the Linux kernel and can be decompressed using p7zip or a similar utility:\n\n```\n$ p7zip -d 3A60.7z\n\n7-Zip (A) 9.20  Copyright (c) 1999-2010 Igor Pavlov  2010-11-18\np7zip Version 9.20 (locale=en_US.UTF-8,Utf16=on,HugeFiles=on,1 CPU)\n\nProcessing archive: 3A60.7z\n\nExtracting  3A60\n\nEverything is Ok\n\nSize:       3072188\nCompressed: 5120472\n\n```\nYou won't be able to mount the SquashFS image, it is non-standard, likely \"hacked up\" to support LZMA compression. Unfortunately, I couldn't quickly find a version of unsquashfs that would extract the image; your best bet is to put in a GPL request with the company (I didn't see any GPL info on their downloads page), or to find a similar firmware which does have a GPL code release.\n\n",
