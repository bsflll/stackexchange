In order :    - I start my virual machine   - I attach IDA with winDBG to start kernel mode debbugging   - I place comments and wanna save them for next session My problem is that I only have a temporary database and I can't save it because it's only a live work session.  Any idea how to solve that ?",

When I wanna reload my work, I begin to load the virtual machine snapshot then I attach IDA to my virtual machine with windbg and finally I can load my IDC file using the script file option.\n\nThank you very much for you answer, it really was helpful !\n\n",
