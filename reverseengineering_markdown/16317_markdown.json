  "content": "I was reading about BIOS and I saw this:\n\nAs you can see, it tells that the BIOS has 2 types to check the booting process. It says when the BIOS finds a warm boot (value 1234h) it will skip the POST routines remaining, however if the BIOS finds a cold boot, the remaining POST routines will be run.\n\nNow, supposing that I have a password in the startup (user password set in the BIOS) of the system and a hard disk.\n\nWhen I power up the computer, this means that the BIOS will read for a cold boot and will run the remaining POST routines, and of course will ask for the user's and hard disk's password. But when I reboot the system from the operating system (in this case, a Linux distribution), why doesn't the BIOS requests for the hard disk's password? Does this means that the BIOS is reading now a warm boot?\n\n",

      "content": "Your quote is about the old legacy BIOS (16-bit). Nowadays most BIOSes implement UEFI-compliant firmware, which works in a pretty different way. The Opal specification published by TCG, describes how the UEFI firmware interacts with self-encrypting harddrives.\nHowever, it seems your scenario is not really BIOS-related. According to ArchLinux wiki on the topic :\n\nSo it's probably the drive itself, and not the BIOS/firmware, which is caching the password on warm reboot.\n\nOther references:\n\n",
