  "content": "I need to reverse a RS485 protocol in order to extract some values for further usage. Unfortunately only these few messages are available at the moment. They repeat continuosly. Only in special situations longer messages (>100 bytes) appear. I assume there must be included some sort of checksum somewhere (column K???) or how would the system detect sending failures? \n\nI could implement the possible checksum in a static way for these simple messages but for \"unkown\" new messages it would be easier to calculate the checksum live. I tried some online checksum calculators, but without any success. \n\nAny good idea about this protocol? Thanks.\n\n```\n\n(H gives the actual data length)\n\n A  B  C  D  E    F  G  H  I  J  K  L \n02 00 01 01 01   8C 8C 8E CC 8C 95 03 (original HEX message)   \n02 00 01 01 01   00 00 02 40 00 19 03 (HEX with applied XOR 8C)  \n\nHEX messages to master with already applied XOR:  (messages end with 03)\n02 00 01 01 01   00 00 02 40 00 19 03    \n02 00 02 06 00   00 00 05 00 00 00 00 00 5F 03  \n02 00 03 06 00   00 00 05 00 00 00 00 00 5F 03  \nHEX messages to slaves with already applied XOR:  (messages end with 03 03!)\n02 03 00 06 00   00 00 07 00 00 40 00 00 00 00 1D 03 03  \n02 02 00 06 00   00 00 07 00 00 40 00 00 00 00 1D 03 03   \n\nThese are the only simple messages that are available at the moment :-/\n\nA=preamble (not a unique character)  \nB=destination  \nC=sender  \nF=key for XOR  \nH=data length  \nK=?????
