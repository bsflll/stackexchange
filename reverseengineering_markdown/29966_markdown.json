  "content": "While reversing a Sena Bluetooth Headset i noticed that the programming port of the internal chip is routed out to 6 additional undocumented Pins inside of the Micro-USB connector. Whats the best method for connecting to that without opening up the headset each time?\n\n\n\nAdded a sketch of the location of the pins\n\n\nAddendum: With some lighting around inside i noticed that the connectors are on a step at the back (upper red line shows the location of those 6 pins)\n\n\n",
