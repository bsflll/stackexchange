  "content": "I found a difficulty in using Ghidra's Function ID as following:\n\nFirst of all, this would be some kind of testing the capability of the Function ID. For this reason I have a test binary file and I would try to rename as many functions as possible and later once more use this binary file and get the functions names back automatically. These are the steps:\n\nand hope to get the populated function names back in the new instance of the binary file but it is not the case and all functions are labeled originally such as FUN_xxxxxxxx.\n\nAny help can be helpful and welcomed.\n\nCheers.\n\n",
