I'm guessing \"no\" since they don't usually post it, but I'm not aware of any open source firmware, except for things like Tomato, though that's more like an OS for a wifi unit, so I'm just trying to make sure I understand the question better.",

I think the guys behind the /dev/ttyS0 blog also tried opening a forum a couple months ago but it wasn't very active and apparently has been closed down.\n\nI guess the problem is that the area is somewhat nebulous and trying to cover everything won't really work. However, there are numerous forums that specialize in a specific type of firmware, manufacturer, or even just one product, and some of them are pretty big on their own. Here's a few examples that come to mind:\n\n",

Are you looking to trade notes about specific firmwares, a place to trade tips and tricks when reversing low-level code, or just a place to show off your accomplishments?\n\nI think the Hex-Rays forum would be a good place to start for a tips and tricks forum. It's currently not what you want, but it has the right people browsing the forum already -- which is generally the hardest part of creating an online resource like this. I don't know how amenable Hex-Rays is to posting complete write-ups and disassemblies of commercial firmwares.\n\nFor a place to show off your accomplishments, I believe that this StackExchange is appropriate (or /r/ReverseEngineering)!\n\n",
