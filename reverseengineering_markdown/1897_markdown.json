      "content": "A 'side-channel attack' define any technique that will consider unintended and/or indirect information channels to reach his goal. It has been first defined in smart-card cryptography to describe attacks which are using unintentional information leak from the embedded chip on the card and that can be used in retrieval of keys and data. For example, it may be used by monitoring:\n\nIf you're more interested in learning how to leverage this information then I'd suggest to start by reading Power Analysis Attacks. Don't get 'scared' away by the fact that the book is about smart cards. Most of the information also applies 1-to-1 on 'normal' (SoC) embedded devices.\n\nForgot to mention there's an open source platform called OpenSCA and some open source hardware called FOBOS (Flexible Open-source BOard for Side-channel) for which I can't seem to find a proper link from home.\n\nSpeaking about the application of side-channel attacks in software reverse engineering now, it is more or less any attacks that will rely on using unintended or indirect information leakage. The best recent example is this post from Jonathan Salwan describing how he guessed the password of a crackme just by counting the number of instructions executed on various inputs with Pin.\n\nMore broadly, this technique has been used since long in software reverse-engineering without naming it, or could have improved many analysis. The basic idea is to first consider that if a piece of software is too obscure to understand it quickly, we can consider it as a black-box and think about using a side-channels technique to guess the enclosed data through a guided trial and error technique.\n\nThe list of side-channels available in software reverse-engineering is much longer than the one we have in hardware. Because it enclose the previous list and add some new channels such as (non exhaustive list):\n\nThis list is far from being exhaustive, but basically tools such as Valgrind VM or others can be used to perform such analysis and quickly deduce information about the behavior of a given program, thus speeding up the reverse-engineering.\n\nTrying to build a software which will be resistant to such attacks will borrow also a lot from the smart-card industry. But, not only. Here are a few tricks, I could think of (but far from being complete about all we can find).\n\nThe instruction count is extremely efficient to detect which branch has been taken in code like this:\n\n```\nif (value)\n   ret = foo();\nelse \n   ret = bar();\n\n```\nWith foo() and bar() having different instruction count.\n\nThis can be defeated by executing foo() and bar() whatever value is and deciding afterward what is the value of ret.\n\n```\ntmp_foo = foo();\ntmp_bar = bar();\nif (value)\n  ret = tmp_foo;\nelse\n  ret = tmp_bar;\n\n```\nThis technique render your program much more difficult to guess from a side-channel attack, but also much less efficient. One has to find a proper trade-off.\n\nTiming attacks are extremely easy to perform and difficult to workaround because sleep() cannot be an option (too easy to detect in a code and, anyway you cannot assume a specific speed for the processor). The programmer has to identify the execution time of each branch of his program and to balance each branch with extra non-useful operations which are of the same computational power than the ones from the other branchs. The point being to render each branch indistinguishable from the others only based on the execution time.\n\nAnother way to dilute the side-channel is to massively multi-thread your program. Imagine that each branch of your program is executed in a separate thread, and one variable tell in which thread the current program really is (if possible in a cryptic manner). Then side-channel analysis will be much more difficult to perform.\n\nSide-channel attacks has been widely under-estimated for software reverse-engineering, it can drastically speed-up the reverse of many programs. But, in the same time, obfuscation techniques exists and have to be developed specifically targeting software reverse-engineering. So, don't be surprised if you see more and more novelties related to this field.\n\n",
