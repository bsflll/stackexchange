  "content": "I am writing a script in IDA Pro. I noticed that when I rename functions with \"n\" in the disassembly view, that same function is not being renamed in the decompilation. \n\nI have never noticed this before. Is this normal operating behavior? If so, how can you automatically transfer the names from the disassembly view to the decompilation view? \n\n(I have notice this also happens when I rename functions with a script). \n\n",
