  "content": "I am bring a .EXE, a .PDB, and a source code .C file into my computer and attempting to look at my program in Ollydbg.\n\nI am compiling C programs on one machine (XP Vm actually) and running them in Ollydbg 2.01 in Windows 7 on another machine.  I want to look at Release code, so I set the compile and link options as described in link.  And so I have a 'prog.exe' and 'prog.pdb' in Win7 where Ollydbg is.  I can launch prog.exe in Ollydbg and I see the labels for main() and my other functions, and can go to them with the CTRL+G \"Enter Expression to Follow\" dialog.\n\nBut I like to also see the associated source code line, to be able to see it below the code in the CPU window, and to be able to double-click and open the source code .C file.\n\nBut unless I recreate the entire same directory path in my Win7 (Olly) computer Olly can't get at this source code (even though it sees the label names for code blocks).  I've spent some time looking through the settings in both Visual Studio (6 for me) to try not have absolute paths, and Olly to change where it looks.  Any ideas?\n\n",
