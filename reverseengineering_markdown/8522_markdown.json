  "content": "I'm in the process of \"enhancing\" an Android application that comes with a huge compiled .so file. After patching about 200 bytes in the database, i'd like to attach to the running app, apply all these patches to the loaded shared library, continue the app, and debug my changes; then detach from the app and undo the changes again.\n\nCan IDA do this, or is there a plugin to do this?\n\nI know i can write back all my changes to the .so file and restart the app, but i don't want to do this at the moment (for various reasons, one being i suspect the app does a checksum on the library when it's first loaded in memory.\n\nI also know i can patch single bytes interactively in memory while the debugger is attached, but my changes are a bit too extensive to want me enter them over and over again with each debug session.\n\n",
