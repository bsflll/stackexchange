  "content": "I'm new with frida and came to this problem.\n\nI have dll that I want to reverse engeneer(there are no debug symbols). Specifically I want to dump some data from a function. So I have this big function and here is the fragment of it:\n\n\n\nHere you can see that some string(pf4) is moved to edx, but more important thing comes after that. You can see that sub_575FD30\nfunction is called couple of times. \n\nThe most interesting thing for me is the eax register after the call. So what I want to do is to dump value of eax after the call of this function.\n\nI can't consider dumping something from sub_575FD30 function because that function is called from many other places and I specifically want to dump eax after calling it in this specific example.\n\nMy question is how can I acheive it using frida? Should I hardcode the instruction address(address of push eax) and get value of eax? Is it the correct way or is there some better way to achieve it? Any direction of how to achieve it and script example would be appriciated.\n\n",
