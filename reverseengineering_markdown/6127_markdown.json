  "content": "I want to send gdb command (like \"backtrace\", \"b *0xAAAAAAA\", \"i b\", ...) from IDA debugger to gdbserver over gdb remote debugging and receive result and print it to output view of IDA, can I do it? Anyone have tried it before? \n\nI found that function \"SendDbgCommand\" in IDA help \n\nBut when i tried it, in idc script or idapython script, it didn't work!\n\nmore detail: \n\nas normal remote debugging session and everything is alright\n\nnow, i want to use other gdb commands (like above) beside operators provided by ida GUI\n\nAnyone can help me please? Thank you so much! \n\n",

      "content": "The commands you're trying to use are implemented in the GDB executable, not gdbserver. The gdbserver implements the Remote Serial Protocol, and IDA is using that to send commands (read/write registers/memory, set breakpoints etc.) and get results.\n\nSince IDA is not using the GDB program itself, it cannot process its commands. You need to use IDA commands to control the executable and retrieve the information.\n\nThe \"GDB\" commandline at the bottom allows you to send the so-called \"monitor commands\" which allow the remote stub to implement various functionality not covered by the protocol. For example, VMWare's GDB stub supports \"r\" command to get details about some registers.\n\n",
