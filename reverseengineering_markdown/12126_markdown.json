  "content": "I have thousands of Linux malware samples in ELF format. And I am thinking to use dynamic analysis (say, PIN) to obtain an execution trace of each malware sample.\n\nHowever, I am afraid such activity would crash my computer. So am I asking, how to dynamically analysis malware samples safely?\n\nI know somehow I need to run it in a VM, but isn't it possible that the VM can be crashed as well? Should I reinstall the VM at that time? basically What's the best practice to do so? \n\nThank you a lot. \n\n",

The guest OS or the environment inside the VM can be crashed though. In the event that it happens, you don't have to reinstall VM. Just follow SnakeByte instructions.\n\n",
