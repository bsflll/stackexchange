  "content": "I'm trying to remove SSL pinning with Android device.\n\nI've tried different techniques like hooking the app with Objection, re-pinning with Frida, using the SSLUnpinning app from the Xposed repo, etc. but nothing seemed to work.\n\nThe library used is React (RNPinningSsl), below the decription:\nhttps://github.com/nlt2390/react-native-pinning-ssl/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/reactlibrary/RNPinningSsl.java\n\nThe only thing left for me to do is write a custom javascript and start it with frida. Unfortunately I'm not very good at this and I wanted to ask if you can help me do it.\n\nThank you very much to anyone who will help me.\n\n",
