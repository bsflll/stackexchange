  "content": "I am having a obfuscated JS file and I want to deobfuscate it (and not beautify it). I have seen answer to a similar question here and I tried de-obfuscating a the file using online version of JSUnpack and JSDetox. However, I am still not able to deobfuscate it. The JS file is not a malware but it is used to inject ads into web-page. So, any analyser analysing the file won't find anything malicious. The problem is that the JS stores (hex) strings in string array and using it to concatenate the code. JSDetox atleast decodes the string array in the beginning of the file. However, the readability is not improved anyway as the whole code makes use of the string array. If anyone wants to take a look at the file they can find it here.\n\nAny kind of help would be appreciated! Thanks.\n\nEdit: I have also tried Malzilla now because I found a similar technique here. However, the script probably has some errors which is tolerated by Chrome. However, when I click \"Run Script\" in Malzilla, I get a message saying \"Script cannot be compiled\". I tried to debug script using the \"Debug Script\" button, the window highlights some line saying \"InterYeildOptions is not defined\" and I don't know what to do about it. :-/\n\n",

End result is here\n\nPython to replace the var:\n\n```\n#Replace.py //probably not optimized, so dont be too harsh on me\n_0x4b6a=[copy-pasteValueDecodedFromScript]\nwith open('EncodedScript.js') as fp:\n    for line in fp:\n        for i in range(0,608):\n            line = line.replace(\"_0x4b6a[\"+str(i)+\"]\", _0x4b6a[i])      \n        print line\n\n```\n",
