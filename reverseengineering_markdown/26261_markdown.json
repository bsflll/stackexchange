  "content": "While doing my first code auditing as a novice vulnerability resarchers I managed to stumble upon\nmy first free() in my target.\nI managed to find a candiate location where I can control this value and thus trick my target to free any address.\n\nGiven I can turn this free() to an infoleak, how do I proceed from here with getting code execution?\n\nShould I read Malloc-Demaleficarum and follow one of houses in order to trick malloc into returning my fake chunk? (i can call this free many times once i defeated ASLR).\n\nAny hints and advice will be very welcome, I'm looking for the methodolodgy rather than a full step-by-step solution.\n\n",
