  "content": "I'm looking for a good front-end to GDB and looks like Hopper is a good alternative. Unfortunately, I wasted several hours but still couldn't make it working with gdbserver. Here are the steps I'm following:\n\nNote that, I actually need to attach the GDB, I can't run the program using GDB for several reasons.\n\nI am stuck at this point. Basically I can't select the hopper-gdb-server-v3 in the Hopper itself. I cannot see any documentation in its webpage.\n\nCan anyone help me with this?\n\n",

If i remember correct the gdb connection could be configured under Window->Open Debugger Selector.\n\nAnyway how about giving idapro or radare2 a try. Both are also able to connect to a gdbserver instance.\n\n",
