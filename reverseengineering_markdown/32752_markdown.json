  "content": "On my own self-learning R.E. Starting with understanding ELF and hopefully whats going on with every byte.\n\nI build 2 simple binaries: 1 with a variable and 1 without. For some reason, the one without is larger. Why is that?\n\n```\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 u root 15632 Feb 19 21:30 main\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 u root 15624 Feb 19 21:30 a\n\n```\na.c\n\n```\nint main() {\n    char a;\n}\n\n```\nmain.c\n\n```\nint main() {}\n\n```\nMakefile\n\n```\nCC=gcc\nFLAGS=-O0 -fverbose-asm -no-pie\n\nall: main a\n\nmain: main.c\n    $(CC) $(FLAGS) -o $@ $^ \n\na: a.c\n    $(CC) $(FLAGS) -o $@ $^ \n\n```\n",

I know Ghidra will let you do a simple difference comparison between two binaries, which may be helpful. There are likely other tools that could also do this.",
