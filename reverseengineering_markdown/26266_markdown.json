      "content": "What you're asking for is not compatible with the way debugging works on x86. It has limited debugging facilities; you can set hardware breakpoints on read or write access to up to four memory locations, and you can set software or hardware breakpoints when executing particular address. There's nothing in the x86 debug interface that allows you to tell the processor to stop executing when a register obtains a particular value. What you've done with single-stepping is the closest you'll get with the x86 debug interface. If you want something with better performance, look into writing a plugin for a dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI) framework such as Intel PIN or DynamoRIO.\n\n",
