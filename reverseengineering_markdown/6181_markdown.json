  "content": "I have rebuilt the iat table of a UPX packed to the point where there are no invalid thunks (All \"Yes\"), I then fix the dump though when I open the final fixed executable in impRec I get invalid thunks which I originally sorted alongside some new invalid thunks. I'm getting the same results with multiple versions of UPX, this is the final hurdle for me in fully unpacking the packed executables, where am I going wrong. \n\n",
