  "content": "I recently observed this bug (error), when I upgraded gcc/g++ from version 9.x to 11.x.\n\n\n\nBasically, Ida fails to parse debug information. I don't get this error when I compile with gcc 9.x. Note that, I get this error when I compile any kind (not specific to source code) of code with -g flag.\n\n",
