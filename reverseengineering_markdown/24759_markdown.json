  "content": "My question is, when i dont use any breakpoint it show the message saying \"You made it, now keygen me!\", but when i put a breakpoint in the main, or any other place it will show a message about __libc_start_main, and will not show the message saying \"You made it, now keygen me!\", why this happens because of the breakpoint?\n\n\n\n",
