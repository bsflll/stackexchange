  "content": "I came across some unusual strings in some embedded SH2A code I'm analyzing....\n\n11 53 54 00 53 55 4E 44 41 59 00 4F 46 00 2E 4F 56 45 4D 42 45 52\n .  S  T  .  S  U  N  D  A  Y  .  O  F  .  .  O  V  E  M  B  E  R\n\nWhich I realized is just \"1st sunday of November\" if you subtract 0x20 from each byte, effectively removing the control characters from ASCII. But they're still using a full 8 bits per character (not that subtracting the control characters is enough to drop a bit anyway) so I'm left wondering why they would do it and whether it's something homegrown or just obscure.\n\n",
