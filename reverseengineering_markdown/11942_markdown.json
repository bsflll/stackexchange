      "content": "This is because you're not passing the -q flag to radare2:\n\n```\n$ r2 -h | grep -- -q\n-q           quiet mode (no prompt) and quit after -i\n\n```\nThe -c flag will execute a command in radare2, and then land you in the radare shell, but since you're redirecting stdout to a file, you can't see this. But if you hit q (as in quit) and Enter, radare2 will exit.\n\nThis is the command that you should use: r2 -q -c 'pi $s' ./a.out > out.txt if you want radare2 to dump the entire binary, then exit. \n\n",
