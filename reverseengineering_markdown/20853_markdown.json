  "content": "Is there a way to get all ordinals of the local types view with the ida python api?\n\ni have tried to get all ordinals for structs with: [ida_struct.get_struc(id).ordinal for _, id, _ in Structs()]. This also works for enums if you replace Structs() with Enums() but this is not complete. Some structs are just in the local types view and i dont know how to get this ordinals. \n\n",
