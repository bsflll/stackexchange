I would have expected that there would be documentation pages for common DLLs, or at least all of Microsoft's DLLs, but mostly when I Google for information about DLLs there are a lot of How to fix your missing VCRUNTIME140.dll or such.\n\nIs there really no great way of getting information about DLLs asides from looking at them yourself or happening to find answers or references at various places online?\n\n",

      "content": "I'm sorry to have to correct you, but VCRUNTIME140.dll is for example no known DLL (checked on Windows 7). \"Known DLLs\" is in fact a term that refers to a well-defined subset and the NT object manager is exactly the way to find out about which ones are known DLLs.\n\nBut that's likely not what you're asking. Instead you might want to try out the Dependency Walker or a similar tool to find out what functions are exported by certain DLLs. Then look up these functions on MSDN to find out what they're doing.\n\nBut if that is seriously where you are coming from, you may want to start by grabbing a book on Win32 API programming or read some tutorials. Either way reverse engineering should follow the engineering part. Which is to say that the engineering expertise is a prerequisite. In your case that means intimate knowledge of lots of aspects of Windows already as a prerequisite.\n\nAnyway, DLLs have gotten messy/orderly depending on whom you ask. There are so-called API sets which Windows uses since Windows 7 (IIRC) to group functions.\n\nCheck out these two resources regarding API sets:\n\nHope this helps a bit to get you started, but quite honestly if you don't already have an excellent working knowledge of Windows programming and architecture you might want to postpone picking up Windows targets for reverse engineering.\n\nActual known DLLs on a Windows 7. You can see (and export) such a list yourself using a tool like this one.\n\n```\n\\KnownDlls [Directory]\n    advapi32.dll [Section]\n    api-ms-win-downlevel-advapi32-l1-1-0.dll [Section]\n    api-ms-win-downlevel-normaliz-l1-1-0.dll [Section]\n    api-ms-win-downlevel-ole32-l1-1-0.dll [Section]\n    api-ms-win-downlevel-shlwapi-l1-1-0.dll [Section]\n    api-ms-win-downlevel-user32-l1-1-0.dll [Section]\n    api-ms-win-downlevel-version-l1-1-0.dll [Section]\n    CFGMGR32.dll [Section]\n    clbcatq.dll [Section]\n    COMCTL32.dll [Section]\n    COMDLG32.dll [Section]\n    CRYPT32.dll [Section]\n    DEVOBJ.dll [Section]\n    difxapi.dll [Section]\n    gdi32.dll [Section]\n    IERTUTIL.dll [Section]\n    IMAGEHLP.dll [Section]\n    IMM32.dll [Section]\n    kernel32.dll [Section]\n    KERNELBASE.dll [Section]\n    KnownDllPath [SymbolicLink] -> C:\\Windows\\system32\n    LPK.dll [Section]\n    MSASN1.dll [Section]\n    MSCTF.dll [Section]\n    MSVCRT.dll [Section]\n    NORMALIZ.dll [Section]\n    NSI.dll [Section]\n    ntdll.dll [Section]\n    ole32.dll [Section]\n    OLEAUT32.dll [Section]\n    profapi.dll [Section]\n    PSAPI.DLL [Section]\n    rpcrt4.dll [Section]\n    sechost.dll [Section]\n    Setupapi.dll [Section]\n    SHELL32.dll [Section]\n    SHLWAPI.dll [Section]\n    URLMON.dll [Section]\n    user32.dll [Section]\n    USERENV.dll [Section]\n    USP10.dll [Section]\n    WININET.dll [Section]\n    WINTRUST.dll [Section]\n    WLDAP32.dll [Section]\n    WS2_32.dll [Section]\n\\KnownDlls32 [Directory]\n    advapi32.dll [Section]\n    api-ms-win-downlevel-advapi32-l1-1-0.dll [Section]\n    api-ms-win-downlevel-normaliz-l1-1-0.dll [Section]\n    api-ms-win-downlevel-ole32-l1-1-0.dll [Section]\n    api-ms-win-downlevel-shlwapi-l1-1-0.dll [Section]\n    api-ms-win-downlevel-user32-l1-1-0.dll [Section]\n    api-ms-win-downlevel-version-l1-1-0.dll [Section]\n    CFGMGR32.dll [Section]\n    clbcatq.dll [Section]\n    COMCTL32.dll [Section]\n    COMDLG32.dll [Section]\n    CRYPT32.dll [Section]\n    CRYPTBASE.dll [Section]\n    DEVOBJ.dll [Section]\n    difxapi.dll [Section]\n    gdi32.dll [Section]\n    IERTUTIL.dll [Section]\n    IMAGEHLP.dll [Section]\n    IMM32.dll [Section]\n    kernel32.dll [Section]\n    KERNELBASE.dll [Section]\n    KnownDllPath [SymbolicLink] -> C:\\Windows\\syswow64\n    LPK.dll [Section]\n    MSASN1.dll [Section]\n    MSCTF.dll [Section]\n    MSVCRT.dll [Section]\n    NORMALIZ.dll [Section]\n    NSI.dll [Section]\n    ntdll.dll [Section]\n    ole32.dll [Section]\n    OLEAUT32.dll [Section]\n    profapi.dll [Section]\n    PSAPI.DLL [Section]\n    rpcrt4.dll [Section]\n    sechost.dll [Section]\n    Setupapi.dll [Section]\n    SHELL32.dll [Section]\n    SHLWAPI.dll [Section]\n    SspiCli.dll [Section]\n    URLMON.dll [Section]\n    user32.dll [Section]\n    USERENV.dll [Section]\n    USP10.dll [Section]\n    WININET.dll [Section]\n    WINTRUST.dll [Section]\n    WLDAP32.dll [Section]\n    WS2_32.dll [Section]\n\n```\n",
