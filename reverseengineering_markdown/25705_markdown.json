  "content": "Hello,\n\nI am having an exe file that I am trying to deobfuscate and debug using dnspy. The exe file was written in C# and obfuscated with unknown deobfuscate according to de4dot! I tried to all my known methods to procced but still I was not able to fully deobfusticated it.\n\nI tried to analysie the file with exeinfope to check which obfustactor was used but I only got [obfus/crypted].\n\nMicrosoft Visual C# / Basic.NET / MS Visual Basic 2005 [ Obfus/Crypted- StrongName set ]  - EP Token : 06000080 ,\nOverlay : 403900... Nothing discovered\n\n\n\nOpening the file in dnspy but the code wasn't readable, especially the methods and the functions name are in unicode form.\n\n\n\nThanks...\n\nWhile looking through the code, I found that all \"delegate\" calls are referred to a function which takes an intger but I couldn't find any obvious return from this function, what I do think it returns the function and method name but... HOW!!\n\n\n\n\n",
