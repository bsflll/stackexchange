  "content": "I have reversed a program I found running on my computer, written in VB.NET using Microsoft Visual Studio.\n\nI'm pretty sure it is a keylogger. Now since I'm a very careful user, I'm 100% sure I did not download that. I believe it was planted by someone who had access to my computer.\n\nIs there a way I can identify who wrote it? (Computer name maybe, VS username, etc?)\nAdvanced methods would be appreciated as well in case whoever wrote it found a way around the obvious ones.\n\n",
