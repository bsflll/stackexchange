  "content": "I am currently trying to reverse engineer some game files. I have found the exact location of each graphic element, but now I am stuck trying to convert their data to \"readable\" rgb code. They use 16 bit long Hex values (0xC306 or 110000110000 converts to R:0 G:219 B:24)\n\nThe file is written in little endian. Could someone tell me how they convert it?\n\n",
