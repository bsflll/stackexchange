  "content": "I'm trying to find the audio file type of this file (extension wtj) around 8 minutes). I extracted it from a music box.\n\nI've tried many things:\n\nThe files size are between 11MB to 46 MB for something like 16 minutes and between 5MB to 18MB for the short version (8 minutes). So I guess that it is compressed. I don't think it is encrypted because in the hex version, the starting sequence is repeated 41 times (unless the encryption key length is a multiple of the starting sequence).\n\nNow I am stuck. Do you have any idea where I can dig?\n\n",
