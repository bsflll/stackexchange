Just go to Costura.AssemblyLoader to check how it is done. below is a extract from a simple example using Costura.Fody.\n\n```\nAssembly executingAssembly = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();\nif (fullName.EndsWith(\".compressed\"))\n{\n    using (Stream manifestResourceStream = executingAssembly.GetManifestResourceStream(fullName))\n    {\n        using (DeflateStream deflateStream = new DeflateStream(manifestResourceStream, CompressionMode.Decompress))\n        {\n            MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream();\n            AssemblyLoader.CopyTo(deflateStream, memoryStream);\n            memoryStream.Position = 0L;\n            return memoryStream;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\nYou could modify this code to save decompressed assemblies to disk by adding a line File.WriteAllBytes(fullName.Replace(\".compressed\", \"\"), memoryStream.ToArray()); or just extract dlls resources and decompress externally via python or anything else that can do deflate.\n\n",
