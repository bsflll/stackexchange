  "content": "Lately I've been inspecting a key generator program in IDA Pro. I believe the thread here discusses a similar key generator. Therefore, it may be referred to for certain details. The key generator takes a device serial number as input and generates a 32 byte (character) master key along with a OTPAUTH URI of the form in the link aforementioned.\n\nSince the key changes every second, so does the OTPAUTH URI. I wonder how is the server supposed to verify a TOTP once a client enters it under this situation?\n\nEdit:\nSo now there are some new questions:\n\nVulnerability: Isn't the server susceptible to creating TOTPs of the future and saving them in a repository by an adversary? While I'm writing this section 1476946414 seconds have passed since epoch. Assume creating a TOTP for the time equivalent to 1476947000 seconds passed from epoch. The keygen may be modified such that 1476947000 is passed to srand() instead of time(NULL). Presumably there will also be enough time to derive the TOTP from the OTPAUTH URI.\n\nPatching using IDA Pro 6.8:\n\nSo I thought its better to continue in a hands on fashion. Scrolling through the disassembly, I changed the call to time(NULL) to a mov instruction, assigning my favorite time to eax. In order to check my patch I ran the original keygen on the favorite time. The results were equivalent. Three things still bother me:\n\nSwitching to Linux:\n\nHere is the Final Problem:\nThe key generator program is used to produce device specific keys. There is a weakness in how these keys are generated which should be exploited to generate valid one-time codes for any device.\n\n",

What should a client do to authenticate to the server, assuming the server will simply generate one TOTP having no database? I want to know why on earth should the server care about a clients authentication, holding a bunch of master keys? Shouldn't the client sort out the way to properly authenticate to the server once the rules are on ground?",

      "content": "The server must be aware of previously generated keys to provide usability. Either by generating previous keys on the fly (I can imagine an algorithm that tries t-0 and if that fails t-1 and if that fails t-2 for a predefined range to allow users to input a value some time after moving to the next.\n\nOtherwise the entire generate-insert-send-validate process is limited to a short window. Accepting more than one valid key at a time is acceptable because the range remains short, values are still hard to predict, brute-forcing remains impossible (this can be further mitigated by limiting the accepted key's range after several incorrect attempts). \n\nWithout reverse engineering the entire key generation algorithm and actual generation process it is impossible to know. You'll need to reverse engineer the function calling rand() and build a simulator for the key generation process.\n\nIf what you described is the entire process, You're left with figuring out how are those rand() values are joined together (are they concatenated? xored to each other? How is the final value encoded?)\n\nEDIT: Answer additional question presented under 'Vulnerability'\n\nIt is, but as I mentioned in this answer in response to you're first question that does not necessarily happens. The validation code can generate the TOTP keys it considered reasonable/potential every time it needs to execute a validation.\n\nAdditionally, this requires an adversary to hack gain access to that secure storage however if an adversary gained access to that secure storage to steal the TOTP keys, he might as well steal the master key used to generate those keys and gain the ability to generate TOTP keys as he wishes. For this reason storing the keys in the same place the master key is stored does not increase risk.\n\nObviously, the server has the ability to generate keys in order to validate them, and must be made sure to be trustworthy for the mechanism to function securely. This is a common requirement for most cryptographic protocols that certain points are to be trusted. After all, in order for the server to validate the user, it is reasonable to assume the server is protected.\n\nOne could consider some kind of asymmetric key protocol instead of a symmetric key. However since this protocol is designed to validate a user by the server, it becomes moot whenever the server becomes untrusted.\n\nIf an adversary hacks into a server to generate future keys, once this is detected replacing the master key (and all future TOTP keys accordingly) is a requirement.\n\nThe keygen and the server carry out the same basic process. Once as a way to provide proof of knowledge (the keygen), and one to verify it (server).\n\nThe keygen is able to execute perform validations and the server is able to crete proofs, but that shouldn't happen (although it might, and that can ge risky and expose the protocol to vulnerabilities). \n\nI'm not really sure what's the question here. I don't think any SSH functionality is directly related to the key generation, but I might be wrong.\n\nWindows and Linux implement srand and rand differently. Specifically, they're using different constants or a different number of iterations and combinations between iterations. The basic block for common rand functions is this:\n\n```\nint myrand(void) {\n    next = next * 1103515245 + 12345;\n    return((unsigned)(next/65536) % 32768);\n}\n\n```\nWhere 1103515245 and 12345 are two constant values that often change between implementations.\n\nThis is glibc's version. You can see it's more complicated. Reverse engineering the specific implementation is probably the safest way. \n\n",
