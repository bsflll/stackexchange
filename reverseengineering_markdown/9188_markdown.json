  "content": "Ive tried to attach to some windows store app. It seems like there is no way\nsince when OllyDebugger stopped reacting, showing the 'Loading .udd data' message. If I re-launch olly, it reacts the same way. The only difference is that it may be different .udd file... What to do further I do not know.\n   I pointed out the correct .UDD directory(which is the same where my ollydbg saved).\n\n",
