  "content": "I am trying to hack a code in binary .so library. But, when I open .so library with IDA the library has only one function and no strings and there is bad_offset before every address. However, when I open the library in hex editor I can see the name of the functions. I think the program modify itself at runtime but I am not sure.\n\nHere is the code of the function that shows in IDA:\n\n```\n        ADR             R12, 0x1FE8\n        ADD             R12, R12, #0x12000\n        LDR             PC, [R12,#0xF68]! \n\n```\n",

This snippet just jumps to a pointer loaded from memory (most likely a GOT entry):\n\n```\n    ADR             R12, 0x1FE8           ;R12=0x1FE8  \n    ADD             R12, R12, #0x12000    ; R12 +=0x12000->R12=0x13FE8\n    LDR             PC, [R12,#0xF68]!     ; PC= *(R12+0xF68)=*(0x14F50)\n\n```\nthis is a typical code for a PLT stub entry. You will need to check what is present at that address in the binary and see where it finally jumps.\n\n",

Or step through the code in a simulator.\n\n",
