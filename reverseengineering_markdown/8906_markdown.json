  "content": "On my keyboard, there's a button that opens Windows 7 calculator when pressed. How would you capture what's calling/opening it?\n\nBecause it's a Logitech keyboard, common sense would say it's via SetPoint software/service, so I would normally start by observing those in Process Monitor. But because I'm doing this as a hands-on reversing exercise rather than merely reprogramming a keyboard button, I'd like to approach it as if I didn't have background knowledge of SetPoint or third-party keyboard software. \n\nIs there a way I could trace/capture the behind-the-scenes activity from keypress to calc.exe opening?\n\n",
