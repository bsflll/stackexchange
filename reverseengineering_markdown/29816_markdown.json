  "content": "In radare2, I can search and grep e.g. / needle ~:0 2>/dev/null.  How I can I do that in a loop for multiple needles? E.g. something like for n in needle1 needle2 needle3; do / $n ~:0 2>/dev/null; done.\n\n(The 2>d/dev/null is to quiet the play-by-play messages as radare2 searches; I couldn't find an option to do so)\n\n",
