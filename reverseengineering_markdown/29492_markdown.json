  "content": "So, I have a function with the prototype according to GDB:\n\n```\n{std::string (std::string)} 0x56027729e545\n     <function(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >)>\n\n```\nand I would like to pass a string into it using GDB. To attempt this, I've used the following GDB commands to create a new string on the heap.\n\n```\nset $mystr = (std::string*) malloc(sizeof(std::string))\ncall $mystr->basic_string()\ncall $mystr->assign(\"foobar\")\ncall (std::string) function(*$mystr)\n\n```\nIn the last line, I am getting the error\n\nAny ideas?\n\nUnfortunately, I can't modify the code to fix this.\n\n",
