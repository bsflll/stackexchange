  "content": "Lately I've bought a localisation tag (Apple AirTag alike). When I click a button on my cell phone, the device plays a chiptune-like ringtone. The ringtone is configurable using the app and stored on the tag itself – I confirmed that by comparing firmware dumps before and after changing the ringtone.\n\nTo dump the firmware, I connected to the chip SWD interface. The chip is NRF52820 Nordic Semiconductor Bluetooth SoC. I used STLinkV2 together with OpenOCD to dump its memory – manually 256 kB starting from 0.\n\nMy goal is to patch this ringtone and upload back to the device, but it surprisingly doesn't work. There is a reddit post describing the chiptune binary format – that's why I know which parts I can edit. So basically:\n\n```\ndump1:\naddress a: somedata_1\naddress b: somedata_2\naddress c: chiptune_data\naddress d: somedata_1\naddress e: somedata_2\naddress f: chiptune_data\n\ndump2:\naddress a: altered_somedata_1\naddress b: altered_somedata_2\naddress c: altered_chiptune_data\naddress d: altered_somedata_1\naddress e: altered_somedata_2\naddress f: altered_chiptune_data\n\n```\nIt looks like there is no way that the old ringtone is on the device anymore(at least in its plain form), yet it plays it.\n\n",
