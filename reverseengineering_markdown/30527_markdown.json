  "content": "I am trying to reverse engineer a license key for some software, the company that made it went out of business. In doing so, if you didn't already have the key their $50,000 machines become paperweights.\n\nThe key to unlock their driver takes information and exports it, then you send it to the company which they send back a different .xuk file which you import and it unlocks the driver.\n\nI have both the before and after .xuk files and can open them in a hex editor, but I don't know how to read it.\n\n",

This is equivalent to learning a language by just looking at some pages from a book with unknown content. A more realistic way is to disassemble the program theat reads and processes those files. Even if this code is obfuscated and equipped with anti-reverseengineering techniques it will be much more simple to reverse the code than just the files.",
