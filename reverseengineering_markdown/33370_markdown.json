  "content": "I'm analyzing multiple files in a single ghidra project. There are a few DLLs that only export via ordinal. I would like to be able to rename the exported functions as I identify what they do, to make it easier to see what is going on in other locations that call these functions. This works fine within a single DLL, but seems to break external program name references across the file boundary.\n\nI created a MWE that creates these conditions at https://github.com/balloon-bin/ordinal-mwe. Running make builds the example if you have the x86_64-w64-mingw32 toolchain, but the binaries are included too.\n\nThis is my approach so far:\n\nIs there a way to achieve a rename that is visible across all files in the project?\n\n",
