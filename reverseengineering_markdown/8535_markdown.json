  "content": "I'm reverse engineering a binary that has very generic, standard xor+math encryption on every string. I've written IDAPython to find each one(they're used in a generic way) and decrypt them, then add the decrypted string as a comment / try to rename the variable. \n\nThis doesn't tell IDA that offsets to these blocks is actually a string, though. For example, it won't show up in idautils.Strings(necessary for plugins/the rest of my script library...), the strings view, etc.\n\nI guess it wasn't clear: Strings are stored in encrypted blocks statically. They are only decrypted during runtime but are otherwise used just like normal string references.\n\nI could replace the encrypted blocks with their decrypted result in the IDB, but that is less than ideal as it creates an IDB that isn't 1:1 to the file statically.\n\nIs there a way to tell IDA to identify an address as a string with a specific value? \n\n",

This would allow you to define a new type of string and provide the algorithm to use for \"printing\" it. \n\nIt's not clear that creating a new type would cause entries to show up in the strings menu, if not I'm sure you could use the names window with its filtering to have an alternative.\n\nFor more details search the idaapi for data_format_t, and check out bytes.hpp. However, I think the first link will put you on the right track.\n\n",

Maybe iterate every xref to the original block and tell it it's some custom offset to the new section string?",
