  "content": "(I made a topic but I was ask'd to re-made it)\n\nHi! I have a program and when I want to decompile/dissamble it finish and when I inspect the code everywhere where should be some filenames there are .(xxxxxxx) \n\nA string example: \n\n```\nstring[] strArrays = new string[] { .(724934127), .(724937998), .(724937298), .(724933662), .(724933645), .(724936743), .(724933692), .(724933676), .(724933726), .(724933696), .(724933746), .(724933730), .(724933791), .(724937480), .(724933761), .(724933821), .(724933805), .(724933840), .(724933839), .(724933887), .(724933868), .(724931357), .(724931342), .(724931388), .(724931368), .(724931363), .(724931415), .(724937065), .(724931448), .(724931434), .(724931482), .(724931469), .(724931517), .(724931499), .(724938544), .(724931547), .(724931531), .(724931582), .(724931567), .(724938934), .(724931101), .(724938572), .(724931078), .(724931127), .(724940776), .(724937657), .(724931160), .(724940554), .(724938456), .(724936855), .(724931149), .(724931186), .(724936788), .(724931227), .(724937236), .(724931203), .(724931249), .(724931247), .(724931293), .(724931275), .(724931323), .(724931305), .(724931303), .(724930838), .(724930873), .(724930869), .(724930853), .(724930902), .(724930885), .(724930932), .(724930918), .(724930962), .(724930945), .(724931005), .(724930985), .(724930983), .(724931016), .(724931011), .(724931070), .(724931054), .(724930579)\n\n```\nThere should be something like:\n\n```\nstring[] array = new string[]{filename.dll, cheat.dll, hack_name, and so on...};\n\n```\nHow I can make it \"readable\" ? Thanks!\n\n(Sorry if I did break somehow the rules :/)\n\n",

It also looks like that some names of properties/classes are obfuscated into some kind of unicode/other-non-readable representation, and your \".(724942833)\" is actually \"some_unreadable_symbol.some_probably_other_unreadable_symbol(724942833)\".\n\nUnreadable symbols should lead to classes and methods which will allow to understand what exactly happens there.\nIn order to make this mess readable you should rename these methods/classes into readable form. Did you try de4dot ? According to its features list it should solve this problem instantly.\n\n",
