  "content": "I'm new to the science of reverse engineering. I recently downloaded immunity debugger 1.85 32bit Assembler-Level Debugger. My host machine is Windows 7 64 bit. I have python 2.7 installed as 32 bit image and MSVCR90.dll in pythons install directory. Whenever I execute the pycommands I get a MSCVR90.dll runtime error R6034. Does this debugger work on 64 bit host? If so what can I do to correct this runtime error? \n\nYour advice is really appreciated... \n\n",
