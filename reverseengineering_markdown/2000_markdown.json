  "content": "I'm trying to extract menus and other stuff from a New Executable (NE), i.e. the ones from Windows' 16-bit times. The tools I find (e. g. ResourceTuner) work for PEs only.\n\nAny idea for tools to facilitate the resource extraction? Could be several steps too, e.g.  one program extracting the raw resources, one displaying them in a proper form.\n\n",
