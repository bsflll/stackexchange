  "content": "I have a ELF file, which is a partial firmware of a navigation module(my BMW idrive CCC), I need to decompile the elf file. \n\nI tried Reko Decompiler which said it does not support SH4 and Snowman plugin on IDA and but looks like it does not detect the SH4 architecture cause it brought some push and pop instruction in C code, which besides the fact that it is considered cheating for a decompiler!, SH4 architecture has register block that does not need push and pop while calling routines, it actually does not have such thing.\n\nAt the following picture, the floating window at right shows the correct assembly code, unassembelied out of my ELF file. at the center however you see some incorrect assembly that snowman derived from ELF file which is totaly different! comparing with the correct one.\n\n\nSo the decompiler MUST support architecture.\nI need a good Decompiler that can support SH4 architecture and ELF files.\n\n",
