  "content": "I am currently working on both a plugin and an ida-python script that export fairly big JSON files.\n\nI just noticed, that both will at times cut off the output files with no error message. Sometimes they will cut off at 8192 Characters and sometimes at roughly 220000 Characters. What is of particular interest to me is the fact that the files are constructed differently.\n\nIn the C++ Plugin I open a filepointer and construct the JSON-Data while cycling through my sample like this:\n\n```\nFILE *fp;\nfp = qfopen(\"C:\\\\output.json\" ,\"w\");\nqfprintf(fp,\"{\\\"filename\\\": \\\"%s\\\", \\\"functions\\\":[ \", filename);\n\n```\nIn the Python Script I construct a (big) dictionary and use \n\n```\nfn=GetInputFile()+'.json'\nf=open(fn,'w')\nf.write(json.dumps(jsonfunc))\n\n```\nOf course I will need my output file intact, but I can't find any help googling. Still I feel like I'm missing something really trivial.\n\nBest regards\n\nEdit: Fixed by using \n\n```\nqflush(fp) //<-within the workloop\nqfclose(fp)\n\n```\nand for the python script respectively:\n\n```\nf.close()\n\n```\n",
