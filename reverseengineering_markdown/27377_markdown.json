  "content": "I'm using IDA to poke around in an old video game and noticed there are lots of calls to the printf function:\n\n\n\nI can see in another function that dword_5CE914 is a bitmask comprising various startup arguments (e.g. debug, nofullscreen, etc). As you may have guessed, 0x4000000 is the value that indicates the debug switch was present; despite enabling this, there is no visible debug output.\n\nAs someone new to software programming, I assume that during the game's development the printf calls would have been outputting to a debugger/console window which were disabled for production.\n\nMy question is: how can I view the output now that there is no debugger window?\n\nMy current thought process would be to:\n\nDoes that sound like a plausible approach, or can someone recommend a better way?\n\n",

      "content": "The approach you outlined seems plausible; I'd probably do something similar to that if I were approaching this problem. If printf is being called via function pointer -- say, it's an import from another .DLL -- you could simply overwrite its IAT entry with the one in your DLL. Otherwise, I'd go with hooking printf directly, and passing the arguments onto vfprintf in my DLL.\n\n",
