  "content": "Should I be able to extract shellcode from a basic (tested and working) Win7-64 message box app and place the extracted shellcode into a tested and working assembly language encoder/decoder and expect it to work? (Assembling & linking for windows instead of linking for linux)\n\nI have tested a simple XOR encoder/decoder on linux with success using the steps listed below. \nIn short, I have a WORKING XOR encoder/decoder system and I tried using win764 message box shellcode with my encode/decode sytem.(I know this seems obvious I can't run shellcode from linux to windows but there is more to it)\n\nI simply replaced the extracted shellcode from the Win7 message box into my encode/decode system. Assembled with nasm -fwin64 then linked with golink on windows to get an exe and it crashes every time. (Tested steps without encoder and assemble/link/execute work perfectly)\n\nThis is the Linux XOR encode/decode method that works great.\n\nNow, I use a simple XOR encoder with python to XOR the HelloWorld shellcode.\n\n1.python XOREncoder.py\n\nXORed HelloWorld shellcode formated for nasm output:\n\n```\n          0x41,0xb4,0xf4,0xe2,0x9b,0x6a,0x1a,0xab,0xe2,0x23,0x6d,0xe2,0x23,0x50,0xe2,0x29,0x68,0x88,0xa5,0xaf,0xe2,0x9b,0x6a,0xe2,0x29,0x6a,0x96,0xe2,0x9b,0x55,0xa5,0xaf,0x42,0x77,0x55,0x55,0x55,0xe2,0xcf,0xc6,0xc6,0xc5,0x8a,0xfd,0xc5,0xd8,0xc6,0xce,0x8a,0xa0\n\n```\nNOW, here is the issue on Windows 7 64\n\nI found a great example of a WIN 7 64 bit messagebox.nasm that just pops a message box here. So naturally I wanted to test my XOR decoder. So I tried to assemble and link my decoder for windows like this.\n\nI tested this using these steps described in the link:\n\nGREAT! messageBox64bit.exe pops the message box. Now the ISSUE.\n\nEDIT1:\n\nCrashes in windbg on the XOR function:\n\n```\nAccess violation - code c0000005 (first chance)\nFirst chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.\nThis exception may be expected and handled.\nxordecoder2+0x1009:\n00000000`00401009 8037aa          xor     byte ptr [rdi],0AAh ds:00000000`00401018=e7\n0:000> t\nds:00000000`00401018=e7\n0:000> t\n\n```\nEdit2. Following the advice from Igor below, I edited the EXE to have the .text section writeable. Apparently the .text section is not writeable for a windows EXE. Error changed to this now:\n\n```\n    (1f08.1af0): Unknown exception - code c0000096 (first chance)\n    (1f08.1af0): Unknown exception - code c0000096 (!!! second chance !!!)\n    *** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for C:\\data_section_xorencoder7.exe\n    data_section_xorencoder7+0x1016:\n    00000000`00401016 e7ff            out     0FFh,eax\n\n```\nEDIT\nNasm code.

This was solved in this answer.\n\nThe 2nd is that you did not copy correctly the bytes or lost some of them in other way. Your shellcode has 260 bytes, but if I compile the example for the link that you've provided then I get 262. I run them by a short python script to xor them and after that I get this:\n\n```\ndb 0xe2, 0x29, 0x46, 0x82, 0xe2, 0x29, 0x4e, 0x5a, 0xcf, 0xe6, 0x21, 0x8e, 0x8f, 0xca, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xe7, 0x21, 0xce, 0x8e, 0xb2, 0xe7, 0x21, 0xce, 0x8e, 0x8a, 0xe7, 0x21, 0x8e, 0x8e, 0xe7, 0x21, 0xd6, 0x8e, 0x8a, 0xe7, 0x21, 0x8e, 0x8e, 0xe7, 0x21, 0xce, 0x8e, 0x8a, 0x10, 0x24, 0xe4, 0xa4, 0x46, 0xe6, 0x23, 0x4b, 0x42, 0xc2, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0x41, 0x9e, 0xf3, 0x55, 0x7a, 0x10, 0x2, 0x8, 0xe7, 0x16, 0xe2, 0x23, 0x6b, 0x42, 0xfc, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xe2, 0x23, 0x69, 0xe7, 0x9b, 0x63, 0x41, 0x94, 0xeb, 0xf2, 0x41, 0x82, 0xf0, 0xe2, 0x9b, 0x63, 0x55, 0x79, 0x10, 0xda, 0x67, 0x95, 0x87, 0xe6, 0x23, 0x53, 0x42, 0x9d, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xe2, 0x9b, 0x63, 0x55, 0x7a, 0x42, 0x6d, 0x55, 0x55, 0x55, 0xdf, 0xd9, 0xcf, 0xd8, 0x99, 0x98, 0x84, 0xce, 0xc6, 0xc6, 0xaa, 0x42, 0x79, 0x55, 0x55, 0x55, 0xfe, 0xc2, 0xc3, 0xd9, 0x8a, 0xc3, 0xd9, 0x8a, 0xcc, 0xdf, 0xc4, 0x8b, 0xaa, 0x42, 0x17, 0x55, 0x55, 0x55, 0x9a, 0xd2, 0xce, 0xcf, 0xcb, 0xce, 0xc8, 0xcf, 0xcf, 0xcc, 0xaa, 0xe3, 0x23, 0x67, 0xcd, 0xeb, 0x21, 0xef, 0x96, 0xcd, 0xef, 0x21, 0x1e, 0xaf, 0x22, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xef, 0xab, 0x44, 0xcd, 0xef, 0x21, 0xfc, 0xb2, 0xcd, 0xeb, 0x21, 0xf4, 0x8a, 0xee, 0xab, 0x41, 0xcd, 0x49, 0x95, 0xeb, 0x55, 0x60, 0xcd, 0xe8, 0x21, 0x9e, 0x39, 0xee, 0xab, 0x44, 0x9b, 0x55, 0x9b, 0x6a, 0x56, 0x6, 0x2e, 0x6a, 0xde, 0xad, 0x6b, 0x65, 0xa7, 0xab, 0x6d, 0x41, 0x5e, 0x93, 0x7d, 0xdf, 0x77, 0xcd, 0xeb, 0x21, 0xf4, 0x8e, 0xee, 0xab, 0x41, 0x9b, 0x63, 0xcc, 0xcd, 0xe8, 0x21, 0xa6, 0xf9, 0xcd, 0xeb, 0x21, 0xf4, 0xb6, 0xee, 0xab, 0x41, 0xcd, 0x21, 0xae, 0x21, 0xee, 0xab, 0x42, 0x69\n\n```\nAfter you do this the result is\n\n\n\nFull code:\n\n```\nbits 64\nsection .text\nglobal start\n\nstart:\n        jmp find_address\n\ndecoder:\n        pop rdi\n        xor rcx, rcx\n        add cx, 262\ndecode:\n        xor byte [rdi],0xAA\n        inc rdi\n        loop decode\n\n        jmp short encoded_shellcode\n\nfind_address:\n        call decoder\n\n\nencoded_shellcode: \n       db 0xe2, 0x29, 0x46, 0x82, 0xe2, 0x29, 0x4e, 0x5a, 0xcf, 0xe6, 0x21, 0x8e, 0x8f, 0xca, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xe7, 0x21, 0xce, 0x8e, 0xb2, 0xe7, 0x21, 0xce, 0x8e, 0x8a, 0xe7, 0x21, 0x8e, 0x8e, 0xe7, 0x21, 0xd6, 0x8e, 0x8a, 0xe7, 0x21, 0x8e, 0x8e, 0xe7, 0x21, 0xce, 0x8e, 0x8a, 0x10, 0x24, 0xe4, 0xa4, 0x46, 0xe6, 0x23, 0x4b, 0x42, 0xc2, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0x41, 0x9e, 0xf3, 0x55, 0x7a, 0x10, 0x2, 0x8, 0xe7, 0x16, 0xe2, 0x23, 0x6b, 0x42, 0xfc, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xe2, 0x23, 0x69, 0xe7, 0x9b, 0x63, 0x41, 0x94, 0xeb, 0xf2, 0x41, 0x82, 0xf0, 0xe2, 0x9b, 0x63, 0x55, 0x79, 0x10, 0xda, 0x67, 0x95, 0x87, 0xe6, 0x23, 0x53, 0x42, 0x9d, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xe2, 0x9b, 0x63, 0x55, 0x7a, 0x42, 0x6d, 0x55, 0x55, 0x55, 0xdf, 0xd9, 0xcf, 0xd8, 0x99, 0x98, 0x84, 0xce, 0xc6, 0xc6, 0xaa, 0x42, 0x79, 0x55, 0x55, 0x55, 0xfe, 0xc2, 0xc3, 0xd9, 0x8a, 0xc3, 0xd9, 0x8a, 0xcc, 0xdf, 0xc4, 0x8b, 0xaa, 0x42, 0x17, 0x55, 0x55, 0x55, 0x9a, 0xd2, 0xce, 0xcf, 0xcb, 0xce, 0xc8, 0xcf, 0xcf, 0xcc, 0xaa, 0xe3, 0x23, 0x67, 0xcd, 0xeb, 0x21, 0xef, 0x96, 0xcd, 0xef, 0x21, 0x1e, 0xaf, 0x22, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xef, 0xab, 0x44, 0xcd, 0xef, 0x21, 0xfc, 0xb2, 0xcd, 0xeb, 0x21, 0xf4, 0x8a, 0xee, 0xab, 0x41, 0xcd, 0x49, 0x95, 0xeb, 0x55, 0x60, 0xcd, 0xe8, 0x21, 0x9e, 0x39, 0xee, 0xab, 0x44, 0x9b, 0x55, 0x9b, 0x6a, 0x56, 0x6, 0x2e, 0x6a, 0xde, 0xad, 0x6b, 0x65, 0xa7, 0xab, 0x6d, 0x41, 0x5e, 0x93, 0x7d, 0xdf, 0x77, 0xcd, 0xeb, 0x21, 0xf4, 0x8e, 0xee, 0xab, 0x41, 0x9b, 0x63, 0xcc, 0xcd, 0xe8, 0x21, 0xa6, 0xf9, 0xcd, 0xeb, 0x21, 0xf4, 0xb6, 0xee, 0xab, 0x41, 0xcd, 0x21, 0xae, 0x21, 0xee, 0xab, 0x42, 0x69\n\n```\n",
