  "content": "Perhaps I am misunderstanding how this works, but to my knowledge ELF binaries can either have NX protections for the stack, or not. What I am assuming is that there is a place in the binary that spells this out, but I'm not sure exactly where this information is stored. \n\nHow do you figure out the page permissions for an ELF binary from a disassembly? \n\n",

      "content": "The ELF binaries have in them headers named \"program headers\". When the kernel loads up a binary into memory, it only cares about 3 types of headers. PT_LOAD indicating whether or not the content corresponding to the header needs to be loaded into memory, PT_GNU_STACK indicating whether or not the stack needs to be made executable and PT_INTERP for determining the interpreter used to execute the binary.\n\nSo yes, the kernel sets the stack as non-executable or executable depending on whether or not a program header is present in the ELF. The ELF process can later use mmap/mmap2/mprotect libc/system calls to give executable privileges to specific pages in memory.\n\n",
