  "content": "There is an elf x64 file, the pseudocode of IDA Pro 7.6 shows that a constant is 0xFFFFFFFD, but in fact it is \"3\" in the source code, how can I change it to show \"3\" in the pseudocode. As shown in the following figure.\n\n\n\n",

That option will show you \"-3\" for the constant you have selected. None of them will show you \"3\", because all of the numbers are negative. You are mistaken about the contents of the source code.\n\n",
