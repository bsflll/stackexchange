  "content": "I was reversing ( new to the reversing world of course) being using Ghidra for this. I get a C++ function AppChat::__Status::setDescription(ErrorCode param_1). Within this function, there's a variable puVar1 declared as undefined8 *. However, I need to change the data type of puVar1 to a different type like char to better format its usage in the code. I mean for example, the variable *pcVar3; which the decompiler defines as char is presenting the string as expected in the code. but the variable puVar is not.\n\nHere is the relevant code:\n\n```\nvoid AppChat::__Status::setDescription(ErrorCode param_1)\n\n{\n  undefined8 *puVar1;\n  undefined8 *in_x8;\n  undefined8 uVar2;\n  char *pcVar3;\n  undefined8 uVar4;\n  undefined8 uVar5;\n  \n  switch(param_1) {\n  case 0x26ac:\n    *(undefined *)in_x8 = 0x1a;\n    *(undefined8 *)((long)in_x8 + 6) = 0x726f727265206e77;\n    *(undefined8 *)((long)in_x8 + 1) = 0x206e776f6e6b6e55;\n    *(undefined *)((long)in_x8 + 0xe) = 0;\n    break;\n  case 0x26ad:\n    puVar1 = (undefined8 *)operator.new(0x40);\n    in_x8[1] = 0x36;\n    *in_x8 = 0x41;\n    in_x8[2] = puVar1;\n    *(undefined8 *)((long)puVar1 + 0x2e) = 0x746e65696c437461;\n    puVar1[3] = 0x54202e6465727567;\n    puVar1[2] = 0x69666e6f6320746f;\n    puVar1[5] = 0x7461684320707574;\n    puVar1[4] = 0x6573206f74207972;\n    puVar1[1] = 0x6e207369206e6f69;\n    *puVar1 = 0x746163696c707041;\n    *(undefined *)((long)puVar1 + 0x36) = 0;\n    break;\n  case 0x26ae:\n    *(undefined *)in_x8 = 0x1e;\n    in_x8[1] = 0x74756f656d697420;\n    *(undefined8 *)((long)in_x8 + 1) = 0x2074736575716552;\n    *(undefined *)(in_x8 + 2) = 0;\n    break;\n  case 0x26af:\n    puVar1 = (undefined8 *)operator.new(0x30);\n    in_x8[2] = puVar1;\n    *(undefined4 *)((long)puVar1 + 0x1f) = 0x74737269;\n    in_x8[1] = 0x23;\n    *in_x8 = 0x31;\n    puVar1[1] = 0x70202c6465746365;\n    *puVar1 = 0x6e6e6f6320746f4e;\n    puVar1[3] = 0x6966207463656e6e;\n    puVar1[2] = 0x6f6320657361656c;\n    *(undefined *)((long)puVar1 + 0x23) = 0;\n    break;\n  case 0x26b0:\n    puVar1 = (undefined8 *)operator.new(0x20);\n    pcVar3 = \"Network connection error\";\n    goto LAB_003191e8;\n  case 0x26b1:\n    puVar1 = (undefined8 *)operator.new(0x20);\n    in_x8[2] = puVar1;\n    in_x8[1] = 0x17;\n    *in_x8 = 0x21;\n    *(undefined8 *)((long)puVar1 + 0xf) = 0x656c696620656874;\n    puVar1[1] = 0x74206e65706f2074;\n    *puVar1 = 0x6f6e20646c756f43;\n    *(undefined *)((long)puVar1 + 0x17) = 0;\n    break;\n  default:\n    if (param_1 == 0x1f7) {\n      *(undefined *)in_x8 = 0x26;\n      *(undefined4 *)(in_x8 + 2) = 0x454c4241;\n      *(undefined8 *)((long)in_x8 + 9) = 0x414c494156414e55;\n      *(undefined8 *)((long)in_x8 + 1) = 0x2045434956524553;\n      *(undefined *)((long)in_x8 + 0x14) = 0;\n      return;\n    }\n    if (param_1 != 0x4b3) {\n      *(undefined2 *)in_x8 = 0;\n      return;\n    }\n    puVar1 = (undefined8 *)operator.new(0x20);\n    pcVar3 = \"The file size is too big\";\nLAB_003191e8:\n    uVar2 = *(undefined8 *)((long)pcVar3 + 0x10);\n    uVar5 = *(undefined8 *)((long)pcVar3 + 8);\n    uVar4 = *(undefined8 *)pcVar3;\n    in_x8[2] = puVar1;\n    in_x8[1] = 0x18;\n    *in_x8 = 0x21;\n    puVar1[2] = uVar2;\n    puVar1[1] = uVar5;\n    *puVar1 = uVar4;\n    *(undefined *)(puVar1 + 3) = 0;\n  }\n  return;\n}\n\n```\nso far I tried to select the variable puVar1 in the ghidra decompiler then right clicked I choose retype variable and set data type as  char * but it creates as new variable and changes the data held in pVar1 to pVar2 with undefined8\n\n\n\n\n\nso I am doing slightly something wrong as I believe. the variable pcVar3 holds the string data as readable like for example Network connection error. but the variable puVar1 is not held in a format such that the data can be read. like for example it holds 0x746163696c707041 and if changed to character it reads as tacilppA which is reverse order of the string as expected. this has to do with little endianness I am new to this reversing on the platform. so my question is how can I re adjust the variable as it seem in the code as char array? is data type change needed?\n\n",
