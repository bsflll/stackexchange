  "content": "I am using the Patch Program option of IDA Pro to edit the assembly of a binary at runtime.\n\nWhen I enter the following instruction:\n\n```\nmov rax, [rsp + 0x48]\n\n```\nI get an \"Invalid operand\" error from IDA Pro. I tried changing the above instruction to different variants as shown below:\n\n```\nmov rax, [rsp + 48h]\nmov rax, [rsp + 48]\n\n```\nHowever, it still gives me an error.\n\nThis is a valid assembly instruction. I can edit the assembly in other softwares like x64_dbg and it works with the above disassembly.\n\n",
