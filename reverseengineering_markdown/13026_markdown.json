  "content": "I've been given the task of writing a functional clone for an executable since we don't have the source code.\n\nNone of the .NET tools at my disposable recognise it and loading the thing into a text editor, I see the telltale:\n\n```\nMZ...This program cannot be run in DOS mode.\n\n```\nFurther down I see:\n\n```\nMicrosoft Visual C++ Runtime Library\n\n```\nAnd further on still:\n\n```\nMultiByteToWideChar\n\n```\nLeading me to conclude it is a C/C++ executable. So far so good.\n\nWithout wasting days trying to find a disassembler, is there anything that could help me glean any further information from this type of executable? I already know about Sysinternals Strings application. I've also found something that can dump the assembly code (for all the good this does me!).\n\n",
