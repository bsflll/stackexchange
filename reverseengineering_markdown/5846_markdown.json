  "content": "While poking around at the headers and such from my new Simple.TV DVR, I found it downloading a file named rssflash_1035_201311211539.update00.bin. I ran binwalk to look for anything obvious, but it came up blank. I suspect it might be encrypted (?).  Any thoughts about what I could do next to get more information about this?\n\nThe download link to the file, in case anyone else is interested: \n[redacted]\n\nThanks!\n\n",
