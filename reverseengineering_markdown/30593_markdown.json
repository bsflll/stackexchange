  "content": "I'd like to know how to change stdin multiple times for the given binary for debugging purposes.\nI know I can launch the application with\n\n```\nr2 -r profile.r2 -d binary\n\n```\nWhere, inside the profile.r2 file I have\n\n```\nprogram=binary\nstdin=./path/to/some/file\n\n```\nBut I'd like to know how, if at all possible, to switch stdin so that I can supply multiple different inputs during a single debugging session\n\nWill I have to use r2pipe and its interface or is there a simpler way of achieving this in radare2?\nIf not possible in radare2, how would I go about doing this with gdb?\n\nThanks for any help on this.\n\n",

The next call to read will block until more data is available in the pipe, allowing us to supply a different input all while debugging in a single session.\n\nNOTE: The pipes are prone to breaking so recreating them might be necessary.\n\n",
