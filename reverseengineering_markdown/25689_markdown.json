  "content": "I am trying to understand why if I do fetch() 4 times on the active web page, after the fifth fetch server returns response that I am a \"robot\"\nI am using google chrome\nI go the following link: tickets selling site (might not open in non US countries). From the 'network' tab I 'copy as fetch' that very first request and paste it to the console and execute it\n\n\n\n\n\nafter doing so 5 times, I start receiving \"robots\" response\n\nThis is a good response:\n\n\nthis is a \"robot\" response:\n\n\nAnd after that all requests made by the site itself return the same \"robots\" response everytime. But refreshing the page/opening new page, resets everything and I can send those requests again.\n\nMy question is: how can I understand what happens when I open browser page? What happens that the server starts returning good responses again after I refresh the page?\n\nI was trying to drop cookies, but this didnt help.\n\nThe code I use to send request:\n\n```\nfetch(\"https://ticketswestinw.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetEventInfo?ticketCode=GS%3ATWC%3AEARN20%3AEARN0807%3A&linkID=twcorp&shopperContext=&pc=&caller=&appCode=&groupCode=ARNBSB&cgc=&dataAccId=883&locale=en_US&siteId=ev_twcorp\", {\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"accept\": \"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9\",\n    \"accept-language\": \"en-US,en;q=0.9\",\n    \"cache-control\": \"max-age=0\",\n    \"sec-fetch-dest\": \"document\",\n    \"sec-fetch-mode\": \"navigate\",\n    \"sec-fetch-site\": \"same-origin\",\n    \"sec-fetch-user\": \"?1\",\n    \"upgrade-insecure-requests\": \"1\"\n  },\n  \"referrer\": \"https://ticketswestinw.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetEventInfo?ticketCode=GS%3ATWC%3AEARN20%3AEARN0807%3A&linkID=twcorp&shopperContext=&pc=&caller=&appCode=&groupCode=ARNBSB&cgc=&dataAccId=883&locale=en_US&siteId=ev_twcorp\",\n  \"referrerPolicy\": \"no-referrer-when-downgrade\",\n  \"body\": null,\n  \"method\": \"GET\",\n  \"mode\": \"cors\",\n  \"credentials\": \"include\"\n}).then(x => x.text().then(y => console.log(y)));\n\n```\n",
