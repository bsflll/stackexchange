  "content": "It's a very interesting file format may greatly satisfies binary archaeologists. sample file\n\nThis file format was created in 90s to archive customer created AutoCAD components library like window, door and column. The first line is in plain text xxxx DWG library 1.0, it has been removed from the sample file to avoid any problem. The company xxx already gone, not sure if anyone still hold the trademark though. Lots of my father's design documents depends on it.\n\nThis file format has a companion index/reference file which is a simple dBase III. The working platform is DOS/Windows.\n\nI spent 2 days tried to understand the format. While still far from the full picture here are what I've got:\n\nProgress The python lzw seems to be relatively recent. So I looked into older LZW implementation in last century. So I found the lzw module of libtiff, and it's python implementation. (have to use the bitarray module inside of it: ver 0.35 instead of the most recent ver). I tried this python library with the brute force method (thanks to @Attila), the blob is indeed decode-able from 28h (based: \"AS LZW\"). And most importantly, the decoded starts with \"AC10\", AutoCAD DWG format! However, it only decoded around 30% of the blob.\n\nProgress 2 Tried lzw from golang, with the decoding configuration order:LSB and litWid: 2, decoded around 3x more data. Will report more result tomorrow.\n\nProgress 3 The dwg decoded with python LibTiff LZW is a valid AutoCAD DWG. AutoCAD 2014 reported the one decoded from golang LZW invalid. Now I guess the rest part of the blob is image thumbnail of the vector. Will decode all 50 blobs and report back.\n\nThe blobs decoded with the libtiff lzw (lzw.py) are not valid although they have correct header \"AC10\". \n\nI looked carefully into the lzw.py inside of pylibtiff, and found the first two lines:\n\nSo I modified my codes to use tif_lzw to decode the blob. No luck. This time, I read the code carefully, line by line. \n\nAt the first glance, the file has two more Python wrapper methods Py_decode and Py_encode. Then I noticed the disabled methods LZWDecodeCompat for Old-style LZW codes. It's kind of interesting. So I modified the module, enabled LZWDecodeCompat and use it in the Py_decode method. the tif_lzw.decode method requires an extra parameter size. Naturally I used m1 (for the first blob, i used 0x4c07). The decoded result have \"AC10\" header, and opened successfully in AutoCAD(mac ver) but show nothing. AutoCAD says it's a Trusted DWG and contains 1 block which I couldn't find. So I spent a good few hours installed Windows and AutoCAD. bingo! there is a column drawing! There are still remaining questions. e.g. still not able to find the right size for tif_lzw.decode method call.\n\nprogress decoded all 50 binaries with:\n\n```\nstruct FILE {\n\n    char banner[26];\n    char f1[2];\n    FSkip(4); //char sp[4];\n\n    local int count = 0;\n    local int pos;\n    local char sp[36];\n    local char SP[36];\n    Memset(SP, 0, 36);\n\n    while(true){\n        pos = FTell();\n        ReadBytes(sp, pos, 36);\n\n        if(Memcmp(sp, SP, 36) == 0){\n            break;\n        }\n        count ++;\n        FSeek(pos);\n\n        struct {\n            char name[32];\n            DWORD loc;\n        } index;\n    }\n\n\n    FSkip(36); //char sp2[36];\n    struct Binary(int len){\n            char banner[11];\n            WORD size;\n            FSkip(7);//char sp[7];\n            char m3[2]; // CRC16?\n            char m4[2]; // always AA 08\n            FSkip(16);\n            char lzw[len];\n    };\n\n    local int i;\n\n    for(i = 1; i < count; i++){\n        Binary b(index[i].loc - index[i-1].loc - 40);\n    }\n\n    if(count>0){\n        Binary b(FileSize() - index[i-1].loc - 40);\n    }\n} file;\n\n```\n",

I think given the bits and pieces of information there is no answer unless you get lucky and someone happens to know this particular file format.\n\nIf we assume that the file format has indeed something to do with DWG, we can learn a lot by looking into old or new specifications (Google-search for OpenDesign_Specification_for_.dwg_files.pdf) for DWG and finding out about their used file format. Of particular interest are the data types (see \"BIT CODES AND DATA DEFINITIONS\" and \"Compression\" of the linked paper) and algorithms. For example in the mentioned section we find:\n\nThis is pretty valuable information and helps you confirm findings.\n\nAlso interesting, assuming that this holds for your case:\n\nBricsCAD and others provide SDKs and libraries (and products) which they claim understand also old DWG formats.\n\nBut back to investigating the format yourself.\n\nYou'll want to get handy with a tool such as 010 Editor that allows you to create a template and literally develop your understanding of the file format this way.\n\nNow, you have deprived us of vital information by stating that the first line is text but not giving a length or anyway an idea how you come to the conclusion that it's plain text.\n\nThere are for example 50 occurrences of AS LZW 1.0 in the file. Still, I count more occurrences of the mysterious ASCII numbers at the beginning. Possible that this counts some markers as well that aren't in need of the AS LZW 1.0 bit.\n\nAlso those decimals start out at 2. Why?\n\nI'm also unable to follow your description, to be honest. If the first part are file names and they are separated by 00, then why are there so many occurrences of 00 in that part?\n\nArchStar explains the AS LZW 1.0 of course. It's probably a variation on the \"normal\" LZW then. LZW could of course also stand for something unrelated, like the author's initials or their name for something.\n\nConcerning the update about CEL/FLIC files. If we assume that the information here is correct, we should see something useful here. But it looks like gibberish indeed.\n\n\n\nSo I agree, likely no FLIC file. Still, keep in mind that DWG comes from the same creator. This may not be a coincidence.\n\nUpdate concerning the findings about the LZW data. From Wikipedia (here):\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n",
