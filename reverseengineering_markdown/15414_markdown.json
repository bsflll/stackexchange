  "content": "I have a number of protobuf files but no .proto schema file!\n\ncat myfile.pbuf | protoc --decode_raw > outputfile.txt\n\nUsing the above command, I was able to decode the file into a somewhat readable protobuf format (Thanks):\n\n```\n1: 1\n2: \"\"\n2 {\n  1: 0x40133f7ced916873\n  2: 0x3ff70e5604189375\n  3: 0xbfd23d70a3d70a3d\n  4: 0x3fb999999999999a\n}\n2 {\n  1: 0x4022e7ef9db22d0e\n  2: 0x4006ed916872b021\n  3: 0xbfe1cac083126e98\n  4: 0x3fc999999999999a\n}\n2 {\n  1: 0x402bdcac083126e9\n  2: 0x40111374bc6a7efa\n  3: 0xbfe9fbe76c8b4396\n  4: 0x3fd3333333333333\n}\n2 {\n  1: 0x40324147ae147ae1\n  2: 0x401696872b020c4a\n  3: 0xbff0e147ae147ae1\n  4: 0x3fd999999999999a\n}\n...\n\n```\nI know without the schema I cannot know the meaning of these values, but I am wondering if there is anything else I can do to deduce what this strangeness is!  The protobuf documentation seems to indicate that numerical data is served in 2 or 4 byte chunks, which I could easily convert to ints or floats.\n\nMy data does not fit into this format, but I know it to be numerical data!  I've never seen a protobuf file with the hex x notation, and there are 16 bytes (way too many for a single number!).\n\nWhat datatype might this be, is it possible to decode and further without the schema, and are the 1, 2, 3, 4 useful or significant?\n\n",
