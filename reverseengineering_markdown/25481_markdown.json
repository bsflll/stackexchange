  "content": "First off, I need to clear out that I'm a total noob on this, and I have tried reading and understanding documentation about this assembly stuff on the internet, but almost all I found, was meant for advanced people who knew about this.\n\nSo, what I have tried so far, is something like \"movaps XMM6, 9999999\" (from the original instruction \"movaps XMM6,XMM1\"), but it won't work when I try to create a Cheat Engine Table, it tells me\n\nI'm sorry if I'm not specific enough, I would appreciate someone to further explain me how registers like these work, and how to exchange values between those and maybe other variables?\nI did read the thread about sending a integer into an XMM using another register, but I didn't catch a thing out of that, so I wrote this thread. I'm looking forward to learning about this...\n\n",
