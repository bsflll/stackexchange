Note that, in my opinion, the learning curve of r2 is pretty steep and it'll take some time to get use to it.\n\nInstallation\nItâ€™s recommended to use the current git version of radare2.\nSimply run:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/radare/radare2.git\ncd radare2\n./sys/install.sh\n\n```\nYou'll need to perform several more steps in order to sign radare and make it ready to debug applications without the need of root permissions.  \n\nBeginners guides \n\nThis should be enough in order to learn the basics of radare.  \n\nUser Interface\nradare2 has a powerful command line visual modes to help you go through the program and super useful while debugging. This is how the Visual Graph Mode looks like:   \n\n \n\nThe official graphic user interface of radare2 is called Cutter (originally named Iaito). Cutter is built on top of Qt and C++.\n\n\n\n",
