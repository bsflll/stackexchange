  "content": "I want to publish a crash dump on the Internet for other people to learn from the dump. Usually I take dumps with .dump /ma which is fine.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit concerned about personal data included in the dump and I'd like to remove it. The WinDbg help file specifies the r and R flags.\n\nR (this part is clear for me):\n\nr (I don't fully understand how that protects privacy of other applications):\n\nWhich options should I use to re-dump to get a dump without personal information? Are there any other switches I should activate?\n\nAssumptions:\n\nUpdate\n\nI'm especially interested in removing the process environment block so that !peb does not show all the system information.\n\n",
