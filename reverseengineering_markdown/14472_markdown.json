  "content": "I'm a beginner at this and I'm following tutorials but I am kind of stuck.\n\nI found a function that accesses all characters X position in game. I found this using Cheat Engine and here's how it looks:\n\nAll these addresses are X positions of characters in game.\n\nI looked up this function in IDA and the functions looks like this:\n\n```\ndouble __thiscall sub_427380(int this)\n{\n  return *(float *)(this + 80);\n}\n\n```\nSo I managed to hook this function and read the values in C++.\n\nHere's the code: \n\n```\ndouble hookedFunction(int i)\n{\n    float f = *(float *)(i + 80);\n    return originalFunction(i);\n}\n\n```\nThis works but when I try to read values from other offsets that I found using the \"Dissect Data/Structures\" function in Cheat Engine I'm stuck.\n\nHere's the structure from one of the addresses I found in Cheat Engine:\n\n\n\nWhen I subtract 80 from the address and I create a new data structure in Cheat Engine it looks like this: \n\nSo here's where I need help. How do I read the string at offset 0040 and the 4 bytes at offset 003C in my hooked function.\n\nI tried doing stuff like:\n\n```\nDWORD d = *(DWORD *)(i + 0x3C);\n\n```\nBut whatever I try I can't get the right values. \n\n",
