For instance, I want to get the original data structure or math function for this code (e.g sin or cos or array in math kernel)\n\nFor instance:\n\n```\ndo\n      {\n        v18 = (__m128i)_mm_cmpneqps(\n                         _mm_unpacklo_ps(\n                           _mm_unpacklo_ps((__m128)*(_DWORD *)(v17 + 160), (__m128)*(_DWORD *)(v17 + 240)),\n                           _mm_unpacklo_ps((__m128)*(_DWORD *)(v17 + 200), (__m128)*(_DWORD *)(v17 + 280))),\n                         0LL);\n        v16 += 8LL;\n        v19 = _mm_sub_epi32(\n                0LL,\n                (__m128i)_mm_cmpneqps(\n                           _mm_unpacklo_ps(\n                             _mm_unpacklo_ps((__m128)*(_DWORD *)v17, (__m128)*(_DWORD *)(v17 + 80)),\n                             _mm_unpacklo_ps((__m128)*(_DWORD *)(v17 + 40), (__m128)*(_DWORD *)(v17 + 120))),\n                           0LL));\n        v17 += 320LL;\n        v15 = _mm_add_epi32(_mm_add_epi32(v15, v19), _mm_sub_epi32(0LL, v18));\n      }\n      while ( v16 < v14 );\n\n```\nThis was created by libmmd.dll 11.1\n\n",
