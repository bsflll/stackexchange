  "content": "IDA Pro allows plugins to receive notifications for a number of events. These are defined in the hook_type_t enumeration inside loader.hpp in the SDK from what I saw. If I subscribe to HT_IDB events, I have a host of options for notifications I can subscribe to (event_code_t in idp.hpp).\n\nNow, if I wanted to patch up collabREate by Chris Eagle to support anterior and posterior comments - how would I go about that?\n\ncolleabREate is a very useful piece of software, but in real collaboration scenarios these issues turn out to be real shortcomings.\n\nIn short: how can I receive notifications to events in my plugin which Hex-Rays doesn't make available through the SDK as of yet?\n\n",

It is simply the case that some events do not trigger notifications and hence can not be responded to.  This is not the fault of collabREate, but rather, a built-in limitation of IDA.\n\n",
