  "content": "I have the following constructor decompiled by Ghidra, i.e. Game. I know some of the functions, which are part of that constructor. And thus I have created my interpretation of that structure. But I don't know in what exact order those functions were there originally.\n\nSo, is my interpretation correct or / and there should be a different approach to disassembling structures like this?\n\nDecompiled Game constructor / class:\n\n```\nGame * __thiscall gladius::Game::Game(Game *this)\n\n{\n  *(undefined8 *)this = 0;\n  *(undefined8 *)(this + 8) = 0;\n  *(undefined8 *)(this + 0x10) = 0;\n  *(undefined8 *)(this + 0x18) = 0;\n  *(undefined8 *)(this + 0x20) = 0;\n  *(undefined8 *)(this + 0x28) = 0;\n  *(undefined8 *)(this + 0x30) = 0;\n  *(undefined8 *)(this + 0x38) = 0;\n  *(undefined8 *)(this + 0x40) = 0;\n  *(undefined8 *)(this + 0x48) = 0;\n  *(undefined8 *)(this + 0x50) = 0;\n  return this;\n}\n\n```\nMy version, game.h:\n\n```\nnamespace gladius {\n    struct Game {\n        //virtual int __thiscall main(gladius::Game* thisptr, int param_1, char** param_2, char** param_3);\n\n        using GameConstructor = Game * (__fastcall*) (Game* thisptr);\n        GameConstructor gameConstructor;\n\n        using GameMain = __int64(__fastcall*) (gladius::Game* thisptr, int param_1, char** param_2, char** param_3);\n        GameMain gamemain;\n\n        using Initialize = void(__fastcall*) (gladius::Game* thisptr, int a2, char** a3, char** a4);\n        Initialize initialize;\n\n        using Quit = void(__fastcall*) (gladius::Game* thisptr);\n        Quit quit;\n\n        DWORD_PTR* guiObjPtr = 0;\n\n        DWORD_PTR* unknownPtrA = 0;\n\n        DWORD_PTR* unknownPtrB = 0;\n\n        DWORD_PTR* unknownPtrC = 0;\n\n        DWORD_PTR* unknownPtrD = 0;\n\n        DWORD_PTR* unknownPtrE = 0;\n\n        DWORD_PTR* unknownPtrF = 0;\n    };\n\n```\nThe game.cpp looks like this:\n\n```\n#include \"game.h\"\n\nnamespace gladius {\n    static std::array<Game, 1> functions = { {\n            // Steam\n                Game{\n\n            (Game::GameConstructor)(AddressHelper::getInstance().GetBaseAddress() + 0x331b0 / (2 * sizeof(DWORD))),\n\n            //  (Game::GameMain)0x140039ea0,            \n            (Game::GameMain)(AddressHelper::getInstance().GetBaseAddress() + 0x39EA0 / (2 * sizeof(DWORD))),\n            \n            //(Game::Initialize)0x140033e20,\n            (Game::Initialize)(AddressHelper::getInstance().GetBaseAddress() + 0x33E20 / (2 * sizeof(DWORD))),\n\n            //(Game::Quit)0x14003a0e0\n            (Game::Quit)(AddressHelper::getInstance().GetBaseAddress() + 0x3A0E0 / (2 * sizeof(DWORD)))\n         }\n\n    } };\n\n    Game& get()\n    {\n        return functions[0];\n    }\n}\n\n```\nAs per discussion in comments, how to change the above game.h and game.cpp files to make a proper constructor for my Game structure?\n\nThe way I do it now is:\n\n```\n    gladius::Game gameObj;\n\n    gladius::Game::Game(gameObj);\n\n```\nAnd the element of that object can be accessed this way: gameObj.guiObjPtr\n\nBut apparently gladius::Game* thisptr1 = &gameObj;\n\nis not equivalent to gladius::Game* thisptr, which is passed to the hooked function.\n\nI.e. thisptr is initialised properly with all of the addresses and thisptr1 is not accepted by the member functions.\n\nAnd that is strange considering that the way the hooked function is called is simply this:\n\n```\n  Game local_68 [96];\n  \n  gladius::Game::Game(local_68);\n  iVar1 = gladius::Game::main(local_68,param_1,param_2,param_3);\n\n```\nWhere local_68 is essentially the new gameObj. It is passed to main as a pointer somehow and that part I don't understand.\n\nAnd the way how the hooked function signature looks like this:\n\n```\n__int64 __fastcall gamemainHooked(gladius::Game* thisptr, int param_1, char** param_2, char** param_3)\n    \n\n```\n",

If there were virtual functions, you would see the VTable being installed, from which you could learn about the virtual functions, but there are none in this case. So neither you, nor anybody else, can learn anything about the class member functions from this example, least of all the order in which they were defined in the original source code (though that knowledge is immaterial and won't help you with any reverse engineering-related endeavors).",
