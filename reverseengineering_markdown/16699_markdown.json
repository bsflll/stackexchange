  "content": "I have recently been debugging a binary and at a point I started to decompile a function. One of the lines of the decompiled file is this:\n\n```\nv14 = (int (__cdecl *)(signed int))sub_8048FB6(1);\n\n```\nI have been told it is a function pointer but I have no clue to what function it is pointing to. I will appreciate if someone breaks this absolutely vague string to me into pieces with elaboration.\n\n",

          "text": "Thanks for the clear response. What I understood from it is that the return value of the sub_8048FB6(1) call actually provides the address of the function which the function pointer is supposed to point to. Some of the function's arguments are located on the stack while others may be in registers and finally the input output type for the function is determined. What I still don't know is that where in the binary am I supposed to find the function's actual code?",
