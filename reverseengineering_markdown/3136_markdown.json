Presumably, IDA Pro scans only for code segments; there aren't any in this DLL.\n\nMy own tool reports this\n\n```\n...\nNumberOfRvaAndSizes         00000010\n   2.

Google for a Windows resource editor if you want to know what it contains (a cursory glance with a basic hex editor shows 'the usual': a VERSION_INFO block, some strings, EVNT tables, and a rather nice PNG image).\n\n(Edit) http://pedump.me/cfebba297b36cbb7c52c5ff592f6f0fe/ lists its contents in a basic yet very comprehensive overview. It agrees with me: the \"disasm\" view says: \"invalid VA 0x400000\".\n\n",
