  "content": "I have a OCX control which is loaded in Internet Explorer (used to show stream from IP camera). To see live video I have to properly connect to server etc. using methods of created object. The best idea will be to monitor which methods are called from IE. Is there any possibility to monitor these calls and parameters with for example plug-in for IE or some API monitor program?\n\n\n\n\n",

You can then see the order in which IE calls them and the arguments that are passed.\n\n",
