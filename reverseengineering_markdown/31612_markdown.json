  "content": "I have a qemu instance running a custom Linux distribution, within which I'd like to debug an (already running) application. I have already embedded a gdbserver inside (and have a root shell available), so I can start it with --attach <pid>. I also have extracted and analyzed the binary I am interested in and have an .idb file for it. However, when I connect to the remote GDB through IDA (via Debugger > Attach to process, and then selecting 0 - the running process), it completely ignores everything in the database. No functions, no comments, nothing. ASLR is disabled, but if somehow still needed, I can provide /proc/<pid>/maps. The question is, how do I inform IDA that the app it's looking at is the same as the database?\n\nIf it matters, I'm running IDA Pro 7.5 on Windows\n\n",
