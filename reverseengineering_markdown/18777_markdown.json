  "content": "I am trying to debug remotly an ELF from my windows 10 (the ELF runs on my ubuntu 32 bit vm) (the ELF is from pwnable.kr - unlink).\nBecause the exploit is via gets() I try to pass input through the \"debugger options\" in IDA:\n\n\n\n(I also tried doing it without the \"parameters\").\n\nanyway this is the the exception I get when I get to \"gets\" function. \n\n\n\nI tried to understand from the internet how people usually use remote debugging with IDA and use the process' stdin. \n\nBTW: this is how it runs: \n\n```\nshahar@ubuntu:~/Desktop$ ./linux_server unlink\nIDA Linux 32-bit remote debug server(ST) v1.15. Hex-Rays (c) 2004-2012\nListening on port #23946...\n=========================================================\n[1] Accepting connection from 192.168.188.1...\nhere is stack address leak: 0xbfdfdc04\nhere is heap address leak: 0x9085410\nnow that you have leaks, get shell!\n\n```\nThanks a lot for your help! :-)\n\nEDIT: \n\nThis is where the error is raised:\n\n\n\n",
