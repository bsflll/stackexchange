          "text": "Hmm, but this does not explain why rootfs has been mounted as read-write in the first place but writing fails as it's also rw in your /proc/mounts. Some filesystems such as squashfs are only read-only but yaffs2 is not. Such situations when something is mounted as rw but writing fails also happens when using NFS or CIFS but it's not used in your case. Linux also automatically remounts disks to read-only when errors are found. Can you post output of dmesg | grep -e mount -e roots -e read?",
