  "content": "For reverse calculation of CRC checksums, there is a pretty nice tool – CRC reveng.\n\nI was looking for, and have not found, a similar tool that can do the same for non CRC checksums. For example, using Xor, Sum, bit-shift action for the single bits or nibbles to get the given checksum.\n\nDoes anyone know about such a tool that can do this job?\n\nIn my case I have just 5 nibbles of data that are calculated into 1 nibble of checksum, but there is an algorithm behind which I was not able to reverse by myself. And I have a large set of data that can be used to accept or refuse proposed algorithms.\n\n",
