  "content": "I decided that I need to understand this more thoroughly, so am working in parallel with two resources: one more modern and one original from @Aleph1.\n\nIn the essay, there is a basic code snippet, called example1.c, thus:\n\n```\nvoid function(int a, int b, int c) { \n    char buffer1[5];\n    char buffer2[10];\n}\nvoid main() { \n    function(1,2,3);\n}\n\n```\nIn the illustrated disassembly of that, once complied obvs, thus:\n\n```\npushl %ebp\nmovl %esp,%ebp\nsubl $20,%esp\n\n```\nwhere $20 is the size due to word size, as the 5 char buffer takes 8 bytes (2 words) and the 10 char buffer takes 12 bytes (3 words). So far so simple. This makes perfect sense to me.\n\nWhile playing along on Ubuntu 12.04 - 32bit version [chosen due to the other parallel disassembly blog post] - the same disassembly comes out as:\n\n```\npush   %ebp\nmov    %esp,%ebp\nsub    $0xc,%esp\n\n```\nwhere $0xc is 12 in decimal. What is the reason for this discrepancy, assuming that I've copied the code properly. It's not really holding up my progress, but I feel that I should be able to understand why my code is subtracting by 12 bytes, and the example by 20. My best guess is that it's down to the architecture of the OS that I'm using in some way, but would like someone with more experience to validate this or tell me why.\n\nUpdate\n\nI was comparing apples with oranges, which I've just realised. The code from Aleph1's essay where it talks about the subl $20 came from the -S (assembly) output from gcc, and is discussing the prolog whereas the code I took the sub 0xc came from within gdb and running disassemble main.\n\nI have run gcc -S to produce example1.s - but that produces a different result again, although I suspect it's down to Johan's comment about gcc options, which happen to be gcc -g -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -S -o example1.s example1.c. Looking in the prolog, the result that I get here is subl %16 (which in dec is 22).\n\nIt has simply raised more questions! :D\n\nUpdate 2\n\nDump of assembler code within gdb is:\n\n```\n 0x080483bc <+0>:   push   %ebp\n 0x080483bd <+1>:   mov    %esp,%ebp\n 0x080483bf <+3>:   sub    $0xc,%esp\n\n```\nIs that why we see $0xc (12 in decimal) because it's showing as <+3> (i.e. +3 words, 12 bytes)?\n\n",

That way the compiler cannot reason about use of them and try to optimize stuff but I'm not 100% it works here. Quick edit: Apparently gdb defaults to -O0 when nothing is specified.",
