  "content": "As I understand, the BIOS code/bitstream that held in the ROM should be generic (work alongside with multiple CPU types or ISAs). In addition, I saw mentions in the web that claim to have the possibility to dump it's code (and to 'disassemble' it).\n\nSo, in which language, instruction set or machine code is it written? Doesn't it need any kind of processor to perform its operations? If so I guess that it will use the external CPU, then how does it knows the specific instruction set of the employed one?\n\nMaybe it has an internal processor?\n\n",

Typically, it's a combination of C and assembly language.\n\nYes, the processor is what runs the BIOS code.\n\nCorrect.\n\nIt doesn't. That's why when you purchase a motherboard, you need to make sure to buy one compatible with the CPU you plan to use with it. See, for example, ASUS's motherboard list. They have motherboards meant for Intel CPUs, motherboards meant for AMD CPUs, etc. And if you drill into the specs for a given motherboard, you'll see which specific CPUs it's meant to work with:\n\n\n\n",
