  "content": "I am trying to understand the usage of calls to CC_MD5 in an iOS application.\n\nFrom Apple's man page I can see that when it is called it requires 3 arguments:\n\n```\nextern unsigned char *\nCC_MD5(const void *data, CC_LONG len, unsigned char *md);\n\n```\nwhere *md is a pointer to where the result will be stored and is also what will be returned.\n\nWhen CC_MD5 is called I would like to be able to log the input data and the resulting hash and have tried using the following script with Frida, including different ways of printing the data at the return pointer:\n\n```\nInterceptor.attach(Module.findExportByName(\"/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib\", \"CC_MD5\"), {\n  onEnter: function(args) {\n    console.log(\"[+] CC_MD5 called with *data: \" + Memory.readCString(args[0], parseInt(args[1], 16)));\n    console.log(\"[+]                    *len:  \" + parseInt(args[1], 16));\n    console.log(\"[+]                    *md:   \" + args[2]);\n  },\n  onLeave: function(retval) {\n    console.log(\"[+] Resulting hash: \" + Memory.readCString(ptr(retval),16));\n    console.log(\"[+] Resulting hash: \" + retval.readByteArray(16));\n    console.log(\"[+] Resulting hash: \" + retval.readCString(16));\n  }\n});\n\n```\nI understand that it will not always be printable text that is passed to the function as the input data however am having problems actually reading the resulting hash.  Below is an example of the output I am getting:\n\n```\n[+] CC_MD5 called with *data: MGCopyAnswerProductVersion\n[+]                    *len:  26\n[+]                    *md:   0x16f6d61f0\n[+] Returning *md: 0x16f6d61f0\n[+] Resulting hash: ��]vU\n�)��\n[+] Resulting hash: [object ArrayBuffer]\n[+] Resulting hash: ��]vU\n�)��\n\n```\nI don't know if I have misunderstood how CC_MD5 is called or what I should be able to do with Frida?\n\n",

Do you know if it is possible to format the output not to include the offset and ascii representation? I came across your comment here which I thought would help but the outpout is comepletely blank trying that.",

      "content": "The main problem of your code is that you expect the md parameter to be a string. In C the unsigned char * is not an indicator for a string. Instead it is often for storing binary data.\n\nIn this case md is also just a pointer where the MD5 functions stores it's 16 byte of binary data.\nIf you want to print the content you have to encode it e.g. hexadecimal or base64.\n\nFor printing binary data you can use Frida's hexdump method.\n\nAlternatively you can convert the binary data yourself to a hexadezimal string and format it based on your preferences:\n\n```\nvar a = retval.readByteArray(16)\nvar b = new Uint8Array(a);\nvar str = \"\";\n\nfor(var i = 0; i < b.length; i++) {\n    str += (b[i].toString(16) + \" \");\n}\nconsole.log(\"[+] Resulting hash: \" + str);\n\n```\nSource of the code snippet\n\n",
