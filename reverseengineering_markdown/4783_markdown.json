  "content": "I modified the byte-code of a third party Java desktop application's .class file (and repacked the .jar), only to see that during runtime, my change made no difference, unless my change caused a crash somehow. The most simple experiment I did was to use a hex editor and simply replace a letter in a text string in the .class file. Runtime (of course, after restarting the Java application), the text was still the original text.\n\nHere's an example of the original byte-code:\n\n```\nldc \"Some text.\"\n\n```\nUsing a hex editor, I changed the string, and looked again in the byte-code editor:\n\n```\nldc \"Xome text.\"\n\n```\nThe decompiled code also shows the modified string. There are no more references to the original string in the .class file. Despite this change, the displayed text at runtime is \"Some text.\" rather than \"Xome text.\".\n\nIs there anything I need to take into consideration, e.g. some sort of cache (outside the scope of the application) that must be cleared? I tried to delete the \"Temporary Internet Files\" in the Java console, to no avail.\n\nThank you for any assistance you can provide! :)\n\nRemoved: The decompiled code and modified files for the real-world application I was experimenting on, due to their questionable nature (didn't really help anyone anyway).\n\n",

      "content": "Firstly, I would mention that instead of using a general purpose hex editor, a dedicated class editor would be much better. There are plenty of them. \n\nYou tried editing the class file and to your surprise the changes you made were not reflected. At that point you should be pretty much sure that there must be some other tricks such as generating the strings dynamically, encryption, obfuscation etc.The class files could also be loaded from some other locations such as a cache which you do not expect.\n\nOne way to get information about which classes are loaded is to use the following command line switch while starting java.\n\n```\njava -verbose:class -jar <Your jar file>\n\n```\nThis way the jvm will notify you when classes are loaded and from which locations. Using this you can know if there is some sort of hidden cache from which it loads class files.\n\nAfter this option fails, i.e. when you are sure that there is no such hidden cache, you can almost be sure that there is encryption involved or the strings are generated \ndynamically. Decompiling would help, but of course if there is no obfuscation to hinder decompiling. If everything else fails, you may try inspecting the bytecode of the classfiles as a last resort.\n\n",
