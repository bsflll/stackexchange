  "content": "I'm trying to reverse a bigger structure used in an old game. Obviously I didn't know all fields when I created the structure type, and now I want to edit in some new fields / change pure byte gaps into meaningful fields.\n\nThis, for example, is a structure of a GuiButton which I know by now, but it's just a gap yet:\n\n\nI don't find any way to edit the field of the structure. Do I have to completely delete the existing structure and create a new one?\n\n\n",
