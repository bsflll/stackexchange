  "content": "I am excited to begin learning assembly. I intend to learn it to guarantee security assurances when writing code for cryptography. One of the skills I wish to gain are reverse engineering.\n\nThis is a way to test if I understand the disassembly of code. I came up with a technique to check if my reverse engineered code is correct.\n\nYou all heard of competitive programming websites such as LeetCode where you can submit code and an online judge checks if thr code is correct.\n\nWhat I can do is download someone else's solution in a high level language such as C or Rust. I can compile that to machine code.\n\nNext I can try reverse engineering the machine code back to the source code language and submit that solution to the online judge. If all test cases pass then I reverse engineered correctly.\n\nPlease let me know what educational flaws are in this approach.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
