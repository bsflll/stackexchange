  "content": "According to this article there is feature shifted pointers\n\nI have pointer that points very far\n\n```\n*(_DWORD *)(myPointer + 0x10A33C)\n*(_DWORD *)(myPointer + 0x10A340)\n*(_DWORD *)(myPointer + 0x10A344)\n\n```\nif i go to Create new struct type... ida offers this struct with gap of 1,090,364 bytes.\n\n```\nstruct struct_myPointer\n{\n  _BYTE gap0[1090364];\n  _DWORD One;\n  _DWORD Two\n  _DWORD Three\n};\n\n```\nThis works great now in pseudocode it shows\n\n```\nmyPointer->One = ...\nmyPointer->Two = ...\nmyPointer->Three = ...\n\n```\nHowever i wanted to learn approach with shifted pointers so i created following struct without gap.\n\n```\nstruct struct_myPointer\n{\n  _DWORD One;\n  _DWORD Two\n  _DWORD Three\n};\n\n```\nand inside pseudocode i changed Set lvar type... (hotkey Y) to\n\n```\n_BYTE *__shifted(struct_myPointer,1090364) myPointer\n\n```\nor\n\n```\nint *__shifted(struct_myPointer,1090364) myPointer\n\n```\nboth give same result in pseudocode it shows variable as\n\n```\nADJ(myPointer)[0x21467].one = ...\nADJ(myPointer)[0x21467].two = ...\nADJ(myPointer)[0x21468].three = ...\n\n```\nwhat's that square brackets [0x21467] how do i remove it entirely, no matter what offset used inSet lvar type... ida still shows the square brackets.\n\nsay i use _BYTE *__shifted(struct_myPointer,1) myPointer then ida shows [0x10A33] which is close to original offset.\n\nWhat exactly is number in the square brackets and how to remove entirely remove square brackets using shifted pointers approach?\n\n",
