  "content": "This seems like the best place listed to ask (apologies if it's not) but I'm extremely curious:  Glicko and Glicko-2 are ratings algorithms designed for chess (as an improvement to the Elo rating system) to assess a player's strength at a game of skill. I've been reading about it the past couple of days and I noticed that the algorithms can only accept 3 outcomes: wins, losses, and draws. As such, the variable in the formulas that represent the match's outcome can only be a 1, 1/2, or 0. Would it be at all possible to reverse-engineer or modify the equations to accept outcomes beyond this range - like a \"crushing\" victory or loss?  I'm hazarding towards \"no\" because even if it were possible to include a \"1.5\" result, in turn a \"-0.5\" result would also have to exist and I'm imagining negative numbers would break the HELL out of these algorithms.\n\n",

      "content": "I'm basing this answer on the Wikipedia pages about Elo and Glicko. When you say the variable in the formulas that represent the match's outcome have to be a 1, 1/2, or 0, that depends on where you see the match outcome. The expected match outcome in Elo, for instance, is computed using the logistic curve function which has a range between 0 and 1, so the expected outcome in that system can never be a 1.5 or a -0.5. This looks like it is also true in Glicko. Not the same formula exactly, but one which is based on the logistic curve with the output range between 0 and 1.\n\nThe Wikipedia article on Elo also points out that there are multiple ways to interpret the expected outcome.\n\nSay there was a \"crushing loss\" with a value of 1.5. You would never be able to have the system predict that it would be a crushing loss with anything more than a 66% chance because that is the maximum output of the logistic curve formula.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n",
