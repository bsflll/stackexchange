  "content": "In IDAPython, we can get segments with idautils.Segments().However, the result doesn't cover the whole input file, and the the first segment is \".init\". My question is, how to get other things in the input file, like elf header, or other sections, like \".dynsym\"?\nIn most elf files, the elf header can be located with address 0x400000. But what if the address changed? Can I read it directly from the binary file?\n\n",
