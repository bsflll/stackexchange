  "content": "Consider the following disassembly:\n\n```\nmov     dword ptr [rbp+430h+var_458], 690068h   ; L'i' + L'h'\nmov     dword ptr [rbp+430h+var_458+4], 2E0064h ; L'.' + L'd'\nmov     dword ptr [rbp+430h+var_458+8], 6C0064h ; L'l' + L'd'\nmov     dword ptr [rbp+430h+var_458+0Ch], 6Ch   ; 'l'\n; -> L\"hid.dll\"\n\n```\nThis is structurally similar to the disassembly from this question, except that the characters are wchar_t instead of char and moved dword-wise instead of byte-wise. The comment on the last mov was automatically added by IDA, I had to add the others myself.\n\nThe 6Ch in the last mov line could also be treated with R to change the representation to what's currently shown in the comment.\n\nNot so with the other lines. R has no effect there, although IDA has no trouble deciphering a dword-wise copy of char-based strings as evidenced in this blog article (example from there: 70747468h -> 'ptth' -> \"http\").\n\nI know of the stackstrings plugin, but cannot use it due to its dependency on Python 2.x!\n\nIs there a configuration setting (similar to string types and data carousel) to teach IDA the ability to use R in these cases to make better sense of those wchar_t-based stack strings?\n\nIDA Pro version: latest (7.7.220218)\n\n",
