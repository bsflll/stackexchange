  "content": "During the analysis of a piece of code,  I have seen that a process is created in a suspended state. The process had one thread. Then they are changing the start address of that thread. After doing that,  the thread is started with ResumeThread(). Later, it closes the handle to the process using CloseHandle(). \n\nSo, my question would be : Is it possible that the thread with the manipulated start address is still running after we close the handle to the corresponding process? Is the thread still running although the process to which it belongs is closed because of the changed starting address or will the thread also closed  automatically after CloseHandle(processhandle) ? \n\nBest regards, \n\n",
