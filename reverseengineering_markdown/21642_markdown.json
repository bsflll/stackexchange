  "content": "Not sure if this is the right place so please point me to the right place if needed.\n\nI have an input of a VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) number with 17 characters, each character is either an uppercase letter or number.\n\nThe input is then encoded into 24 signed integers, the integers go from -128 to +127. \n\nThere doesn't seem to be any direct linear relationship between the two.\n\nDoes anyone know what this encoding might be? Or, how I should go about trying to reverse engineering it? \n\nAn example is:\nInput: 1D8HB58D04F177301\nOutput:-2|-72|-11|-2|18|100|-69|15|93|120|15|-97|-35|52|85|-114|53|-123|-1|-101|-38|125|-100|113\n\nI have access to a dataset mapping the inputs to outputs and also a tool that converts an encoding (24 integers) into a VIN\n\nInexperienced with this so any help is greatly appreciated! \n\n",
