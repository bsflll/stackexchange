  "content": "I am a new student in the field of cybersecurity.\n\nI would like to learn more about how virtualization used by software such as CodeVirtualizer and VMProtect works, and ideally to be able to virtualize part of my code in VB.NET. However, I do not understand how they operate, and I find it hard to find resources about it. So, I ask myself the following questions:\n\nIt may be difficult to answer every detail of each of my questions; I imagine that the domain is complex. Nevertheless, if some elements of answers could be brought, it would help me a lot to better understand :)\n\n",
