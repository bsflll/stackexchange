  "content": "Receipts from McDonald's in the UK include a code that allows you to complete an online survey as shown in the attached image (in the green box):\n\n\n\nAfter gathering and comparing several receipts I have deduced that the codes use a base 25 alphanumeric system consisting of the following characters:\n\n```\nC M 7 W D 6 N 4 R H  F  9  Z  L  3  X  K  Q  G  V  P  B  T  J  Y\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n\n```\n25 would therefore be MC, 26 MM, 27 M7, etc.\n\nThe code for this receipt is 7MXW-NLH4-ZQ3K and can be broken down as follows:\n\nI have noticed that the last number (i.e. what I assume is the purchase date/time) increases with time when comparing receipts.\n\nFor example, another code's last 6 characters are H4F6XN (90,784,756) and the order was placed on 2022-12-27 19:10:05, just over a day before. A quick comparison:\n\nDividing the difference of seconds by the difference of the 6 character number:\n\n```\n92,986 ÷ 38,735 = 2.4 (approx.)\n\n```\nIt would therefore seem that the number increases by 1 every 2.4 seconds. The result of 60 ÷ 25 also happens to be 2.4 which means 1/25th of a minute can be represented by a character from the base 25 system.\n\nFollowing the assumption of the number increasing by 1 every 2.4 seconds it seems that the first datetime (or \"epoch\") is approximately 2016-02-01 00:00:00.\n\nTherefore to decipher the final value of H4ZQ3K in the first receipt:\n\n...but note how the predicted timestamp is incorrect - off by 12.6 seconds (the other receipt comes out at 2022-12-27 19:10:14.4 - 9.4 seconds ahead).\n\nI'm stumped as to what's causing the error - does anyone have any ideas?\n\nSome more codes for reference (note how the predicted timestamp is never more or less than 60 seconds):\n\nPython functions for encoding/decoding:\n\n```\nCHARS = \"CM7WD6N4RHF9ZL3XKQGVPBTJY\"\nBASE = len(CHARS)\n\ndef encode(num):\n    encoded = \"\"\n    while num >= BASE:\n        encoded = CHARS[num % BASE] + encoded\n        num //= BASE\n    return CHARS[num] + encoded\n\ndef decode(encoded):\n    num = 0\n    for x, c in enumerate(encoded):\n        exp = len(encoded) - x - 1\n        num += (BASE**exp) * CHARS.find(c)\n    return num\n\n```\n",

Does the survey website validate and reject codes if you change the last letter to ‘correct’ the timestamp? None of your examples change the minute, only the seconds, and an order number and time to the nearest minute would be enough to identify a given order.",

It still took me a while to figure out, but by sorting the data by the \"order number\" column I eventually noticed some characters repeated every 25 orders. It was pretty trivial to fill in the blanks from there.",

As you've got there numbers that overflow end up as even too so the doubled digits will only end up even, meaning that you could swap the trailing 3 for a 7 and the checksum wouldn't change. But glad you've solved it!",
