  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/11892/copy-pasting-sections-of-code-or-hex-in-ollydbg",
  "content": "Is it possible to somehow copy/paste sections of data in the hex dump, or lines of code in the code (top left in CPU window disassembly window)?\n\nExample: cloning a function, and then making some changes.  Another example, copying a section of code that puts arguments on the stack and then calls a function like opening a messagebox, i.e. copying some 4-5 lines.  \n\nI can double click in the code (disassembly) window in the \"command\" column to open the \"assemble\" dialog, copy the text (such as CALL 004026F8), then close it (without changing this instruction) then go to some NOP's or 0's or something, double clicking (\"command\" column again) to open the assembly dialog again and pasting it in.  This is ok for one or two instructions, but it would be nice if I could just select several lines and copy/paste them at once.  Or if I could do it in the hex dump window by copying just bytes instead of lines of code.  \n\nI see the \"binary copy\" and \"binary paste\" in the hex dump window but they only do it for one byte, not a selected region.\n\nI see in some videos people noting down addresses and running a separate hex editor program just to do this type of operation.  \n\nBy the way, by selecting a region of data in the hex dump, one can right-click \"Open in separate dump window\" to open a window containing just this, and then write this selected data out to a file link.  And one can bring in .bin files (not by File-Open but by drag and dropping them in) to a window also.  But I can't see how to copy more than one byte at a time between them.\n\nI'm almost embarrassed to ask this question, but I like Olly and want to be a \"power-user\".\n\n",
