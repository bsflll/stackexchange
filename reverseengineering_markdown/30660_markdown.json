  "content": "I'm reverse engineering an ARM64 binary and I came across the following instruction\n\n```\n48 05 48 4A    eor w8, w10, w8, lsr #1\n\n```\nI looked up the definition of ARM64's eor instruction here: https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0473/m/arm-and-thumb-instructions/eor\n\nUnfortunately, the information in that documentation doesn't directly address the optional lsr #1 part of the instruction.\n\nI understand this instruction would generally perform a Bitwise Exclusive OR between registers w10 and w8, storing the result in register w8. What I'm unsure about is the Logical Shift Right portion. Does this shift occur on the result of the EOR, or does it first shift one of the registers and then perform the EOR?\n\nAlso, if anyone can recommend a good tool for testing this I would be appreciative.\n\nThank you.\n\n",

This is pulled out separately in the documentation as this Operand2 feature applies to multiple different instructions, not just EOR.\n\n",
