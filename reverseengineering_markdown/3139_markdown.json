  "content": "The Thread Local Storage (TLS) contains static or global values for a thread. Those values can be very important to find reliable references to memory structures when the memory locations are not static.\n\nI would like to get the Thread Local Storage of another process.\n\nThe TLS should be at [FS:0x2C] in the Thread Information Block (TIB). Though I quite don't understand how the FS register works. I guess I have to find the TIB Base address first? I think I can find it in the Thread Context I can get with WINAPI GetThreadContext, but I am a little bit overwhelmed.\n\n",
