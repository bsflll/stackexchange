      "content": "There is an H8 port of GNU binutils (the target is called 'h8300' I believe) which includes objdump. It seems it's even available in Debian in the package binutils-h8300-hms (might be outdated).\n\nAlternative GNU-based toolchains for many Renesas processors (including H8) are provided by KPIT (free but requires registration). I think they've been contributing to mainline too but not sure how's their progress there.\n\nJust for reference, here's how to use objdump to disassemble a raw binary:\n\n```\nobjdump -m h8300 -b binary -D myfile.bin\n\n```\nRenesas offers their own commercial compiler/assembler/simulator (and I think a disassembler too) suite called High-performance Embedded Workshop (HEW) but I couldn't find out how much it costs. There is a downloadable evaluation version, however.\n\nFor a quick look at some hex you can also try the Online Disassembler, it has a couple of H8 variants.\n\n",
