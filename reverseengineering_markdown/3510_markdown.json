  "content": "i am analysing a crash, the crash occurs in a function that its always on use, if set a break point in this function always stop the program.\n\nWhen the crash occurs, overwrite mm3 register, i want when overwrite mm3 with my values use the breakpoint.\n\nthe original estate of mm3 register its 0:0:e3cb:f144, when crash its aaaa:aa00:0:0.\n\nwhen try this :\n\n```\nbp abpatch \".if @mm3  = aaaa:aa00:0:0  {} .else {gc}\" \n\n```\nerror, i cant use \":\" on bp\n\nif try this:\n\n```\nbp abpatch \".if @mm3  = aaaaaa000:0  {} .else {gc}\"\n\n```\nor\n\n```\nbp abpatch \".if (@mm3 & 0x0`ffffffff) = 0x0`aaaaaa0000  {} .else {gc}\" \n\n```\nProgram crash and dont stop.\n\ncommonly i analyse the crash with -4 at the address that function crash, but now this function is always running on the program.\n\nI put aaaa for easy location.\n\nI think too need stop just before mm3 have got this values, but i don't know :( \n\nHow I can put a break point on a mm3 register??\nany other solution for this ??\n\nAny help or suggestion? . Thank you in advanced.\n\nRegards\n\n",
