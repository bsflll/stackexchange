  "content": "for a C/C++ program compiled on windows using the x86 architecture, what is the best way to find the main function within disassembled code?\n\nI've found various answers to questions similar to this, but they're answering questions that are far more specific to the OPs use-case. Is there any standard or go-to method for locating the main function when looking at disassembled code?\n\nNOTE: I'm new to disassembly / reverse engineering. If I'm saying something that doesn't quite make sense, all clarification is much appreciated!\n\n",
