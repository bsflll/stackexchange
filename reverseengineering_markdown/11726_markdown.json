  "content": "I am trying to write some code to figure out a CRC on the following byte sequence for an AI algorithm class project, and would like to seek some suggestions from this forum.  \n\nFor example, the following bytes patterns are provided:\n\n```\n\n0f81265b6341\n0f80265b63eb\n0f83265b634a\n0f89265b636d\n\n0f81265b6269\n0f83265b6262\n0f80265b62c3\n0f89265b6245\n\n0f81265b594c\n0f83265b5947\n0f80265b59e6\n\n0f81265b5A34\n0f83265b5A3F\n0f80265b5A9E\n0f89265b5A18\n\n```\nI am trying to make an algorithm to see which bytes are involved and also which algorithm to try to deduce the final checksum byte. The final goal is to teach a machine how to do CRC by a learning process.\n\n",

First step is not much of anything, just trying to use any known technique or brute force method, but i want to progress into something a little smarter as the project progress.",
