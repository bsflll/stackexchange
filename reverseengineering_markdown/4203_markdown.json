Freeware is preferred.  I have a free version of IDA and anything that comes with Kali Linux.  It is an ELF file that is stripped.\n\n",

      "content": "Perhaps you should try DDD. It's a GUI for GDB with lots of great features that simplify debugging for beginners & experts too. I have to warn you though, if your binary is stripped what matters most is the methodology. Most debuggers are extremely efficient if debug symbols are present (in case of an ELF, the DWARF is what you need to check). Without debug symbols all you can do is go through the code step by step, setting breakpoints at locations where the assembly code seems to be interesting. \n\nYou must know that reverse engineering is a challenge, not an easy task, and that there's no such thing as a magic tool. All the tools rely on algorithm which are not, unfortunately, flawless. Disassemblers can fail, decompilers can stumble upon patterns they can't turn into high-level code, and so on and so forth.\n\nYou have to develop a methodology which you'll have to adapt with experience. That's how you'll be able to forge good reversing skills. Meanwhile, the forum is open for questions, hopefully as precise & concise as the answers.\n\n",
