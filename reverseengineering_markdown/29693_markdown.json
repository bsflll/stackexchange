  "content": "I was trying to find if there is any free tool that allows an output similar to Lighthouse. I want to highlight the code paths taken so that I only reverse engineer the parts that are being executed. Unfortunately, Lighthouse only plugs into IDA Pro and Binary Ninja paid versions.\n\nPerhaps there is a free plugin for Ghidra or radare2/Cutter?\n\nIf such a plugin is not available, how can I go about making something like that? What would be the basic building blocks?\n\n",
