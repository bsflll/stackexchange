But I can't find any injection-related function like WriteProcessMemory at all. I suspect the reason is the malware is dynamically importing.\n\nHow can I solve these issues?\n\n",

Quite frankly I fail to see the connection between the screenshot and the question (also, text is usually better than screenshots for the kind of info you posted). Are you insinuating the values we see are hashes by which the malware resolves imports? You don't even mention the platform, but going by the tools, I'll assume Windows. Shellcode or malware can always use the loader info linked from the PEB to find already loaded DLLs and traverse their exports to resolve them. However, there are NT native APIs instead of WriteProcessMemory, too.",

      "content": "Using a debugger like x32dbg or Ollydbg, you can set a breakpoint on the LoadLibrary or LoadLibraryA functions, which are typically used by malware to dynamically import libraries. When the breakpoint is hit, the debugger will stop the execution of the program and you can see the library that is being imported.\n\nUsing the same method, you can also set a breakpoint on the GetProcAddress function, which is used to dynamically resolve the addresses of imported functions. This can help you to identify which specific functions are being called by the malware.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n",

Even hooking those relevant functions inside ntdll.dll would provide better visibility of what the software does, but even that misses plenty. As a side note, it depends a lot on the injection method, too, what you need to do in order to figure out what the malware attempts to import/call.",
