      "content": "The NPRG9x07.mbn and ENPRG9x07.mbn files are both regular ELF files, which should be recognized without problem by most disassemblers and decompilers.\n\nThe NPRG9x07.mbn file is used for regular flashing, and loads at 0x80000000, while the ENPRG9x07.mbn file is used as the emergency downloader, and loads at 0x08000000.\n\nBoth are uploaded to the device using the sahara protocol, where the upload of ENPRG9x07.mbn is handled by the bootrom, while NPRG9x07.mbn is handled by the regular bootloader: sbl1.mbn.\n\nBoth implement the same download protocol, the one which starts with the flashingtool sending \"QCOM fast download protocol host\" and the device responding with \"QCOM fast download protocol targ\".\n\n",
