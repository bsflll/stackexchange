  "content": "I'm working on a decompilation of a windows PE (with its full debug symbols in a PDB) and I'm using IDA to help with it.\n\nI want to know how I can get a list of all references to a given class member variable. When I press 'X' in a name that is a class member variable in the decompiler window it only shows xrefs to it within the actual function being decompiled. I want to see the references in all of the functions. Is that even possible without coding a script?\n\n",

To find accesses to a specific field, compare x->m against the offset of the field you want.
