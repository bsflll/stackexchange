  "content": "I've got a .NET malware sample that was transpiled to JScript using DotNet2JScript. The .NET malware assembly was serialized to binary form using BinaryFormatter and then embedded into the JScript source code. How can I transform the serialized malware assembly back to PE-file, so I can analyze it using dnSpy and similar tools? Or is there any tool that can parse metadata from serialized assemblies? Thanks!\n\n",
