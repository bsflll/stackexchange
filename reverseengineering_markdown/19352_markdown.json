  "content": "Assuming I have a syscall to open. \n\nman 2 open gives me info, that it requires 2 or 3 parameters \n\n```\nint open(const char *pathname, int flags);\nint open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);\n\n```\nSo, my code runs and In my registers I have \n\n```\n$rdi = 0x00007fffffffdb40 → \"/etc/init.d/\",\n$rsi = 0x0000000000000241,\n$rdx = 0x00000000000001c9\n\n```\nHow and which flags is it using during the call? How will the dir (or file) be opened?\n\nQuestion: Do I oversee something? Do I need to look somewhere else? Where are those bits described?\n\n",
