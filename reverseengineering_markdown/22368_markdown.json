  "content": "I am following a RE tutorial, and the guy is using Ollydbg while I use x64dbg... and I don't find all the descriptions in that Olly has, and it's quite annoying !\nThere is an example from the two programs running the same Reverseme :\n\n\n\n\nHow can I enable the same detailed descriptions in x64dbg? Is it even possible?\n\n",
