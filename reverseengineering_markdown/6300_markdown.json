  "content": "I have a inexpensive Chinese IP-Camera that runs a linux (busybox, to be precise) off a 8-MB SPI flash IC.\n\nI'm trying to get access to the device. \n\nIt has a hardware serial port, and I've gotten access to it, but the linux terminal appears to be disabled or simply turned off. Basically, I get the \"loading linux kernel\" message, and then the serial port becomes unresponsive.\n\nIs there any way to retrieve the firmware image on a device using U-Boot?\n\nU-Boot log:\n\n```\nU-Boot 2010.06-svn (Jun 16 2014 - 09:36:52)\n\nDRAM:  256 MiB\nCheck spi flash controller v350...

I've tried both ttyAMA0, ttyAMA1, tty0, and lots of other similar variables. \n\nThe processor is a HiSilicon Hi3518, which is a ARM SoC.\n\nRight now, the only thing I can think of is to hot-air the flash IC off the board and dump it that way, but that's a lot of work, and I'd rather see if there is a software option first.\n\n",

It was kinda slow but did achieve the goal.\n\nYour U-Boot does not seem to have the bbm command but fload - load binary file from a filesystem image for system boot and sf - SPI flash sub-system sounds promising, I'd suggest exploring them. You may also be able to use tftp to send the images over the network and not have to dump them using the console.\n\n",
