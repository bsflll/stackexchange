  "content": "I saw an interesting value in IDA at address 0xf8766; I want to view the value at that address.\n\nI debug an Android application with Frida, how can I put this address in Frida to watch this value?\n\nI know that I need to use Memory.readByteArray(ptr(0xXXXXX), 8), but what will be the correct address?\n\nShould I read /proc/PID/maps to see the first address and then add this address to the address that I want to see? The first address is anon:dalvik-main space (region space)\n\n",
