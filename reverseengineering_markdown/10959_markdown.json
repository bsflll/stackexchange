  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/10959/increase-idas-256-xref-limit",
  "content": "I am writing a plugin which relies on going through all xrefs to printf-like function (you can imagine how many xrefs there are). After setting number of shown xrefs to 300 IDA has rounded to 256 what seems to be the maximum. I thought it is just GUI limitiation so I tried iterating over XrefsTo() programmatically which as well yielded only 256 xrefs. After quicky skimming through config I found nothing.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea how to fix it ?\n\n",
