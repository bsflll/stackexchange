  "content": "I'm trying to use data from one ELF to build another ELF, but I can't seem to find anything that gets what I need using IDA Pro. I'm trying to build a database out of Sections, Symbols, and Cross-references. I know radare can do it, but I'm trying to get it done in IDA. I just can't seem to find many metadata exporting scripts or plugins asides from what's in IDAPython, but that doesn't seem to accomplish what I want it too.\n\n",
