      "content": "You must have been looking at the wrong representation.\n\nOpening the file with a plain graphics viewer shows that it indeed contains \"maps\", in a 2-byte-per-block format and with a fixed width of 128 bytes/64 blocks:\n\n\n\nThe first 514 bytes seem to contain some other kind of data but after that every two bytes form one single map block. You'll have to compare these word values against a running game to find out what they represent.\n\nFinding the bitmap text \"D.P. Gray 1994\" in the map leads me to believe you are looking at Nitemare 3D, and with that information you can find several map editors, such as the one at http://wolf3d.darkbb.com/t1981-nitemare-3d-mapeditor, which conveniently also tells you the same details I describe above (do note that that post is from 2011).\n\nIt took me less than 5 minutes to recognize \"the format\", and another 5 or so to google \"D.P. Gray 1994\".\n\n",
