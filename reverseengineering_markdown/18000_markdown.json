I want the simple way to get each time the hex for 1 arm instruction .  1)how can I install  rasm2  n windows that I can run rasm2 -a arm -b 32 \"add r0, r1, r2\"`    2) what is the different between keystone  and keypatch? thank you",

      "content": "For this exact purpose I highly suggest using a command line tool such as rasm2.\n\nIt is a tool that comes with the radare2 suite. One of it's basic capabilities is translating assembly instructions in various architectures to opcodes and vice versa.\nThe usage is fairly simple:\n\n```\n# rasm2 -a arm -b 32 \"add R0, R1, R2\"\n020081e0\n\n```\nHere:\n\n-a specifies the architecture.\n\n-b specifies the bits (where 16 is Thumb-1)\n\nFor more information there is plenty, such as the radare2 blog and official book.\n\n",
