  "content": "A key tool in reverse engineering is a good disassembler, so to ensure that a disassembler is performing properly, are there any good test suites available for use to test the correctness of a disassembler?  Are these architecture specific, or can they be configured to work across multiple object architectures?  A good test should include checking the more obscure architecture instructions and malformed portable execution files.\n\nHere is one specifically for i86 that I have seen.  Are there any that are modular across architectures?\n\n",

This produces kind of a holistic view of how well the system works, from instruction decoding to control flow recovery. Those benchmarks aren't free or open source though. \n\nThe GCC and clang compilers also ship with benchmarks for testing. Those might be worth investigating.\n\nAlso, Regehr's csmith project can generate arbitrary C programs for compiler testing/fuzzing. This could be useful for testing decompilers and binary analysis systems?\n\n",
