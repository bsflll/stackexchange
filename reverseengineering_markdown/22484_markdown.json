Dynamic linking using names in this case would involve lots of long string comparisons that would slow down the loading of applications using this library.\n\n```\n6153 \n?GetRecentListOfPanes@CRecentDockSiteInfo@@QEAAAEAV?$CList@PEAUHWND__@@PEAU1@@@H@Z\npublic: class CList<struct HWND__ * __ptr64,struct HWND__ * __ptr64> & __ptr64 __cdecl CRecentDockSiteInfo::GetRecentListOfPanes(int) __ptr64\n\n8718 \n?OnCancelMode@CPane@@IEAAXXZ\nprotected: void __cdecl CPane::OnCancelMode(void) __ptr64\n\n```\nYou can find lists of these in several reverse engineering tools.\ne.g. Ghidra\n\n",

Otherwise applications linked against one version will fail if run against a different version.   The MFC DLLs do not depend on windows version.  They do depend on the version of MFC that app uses though.  See en.wikipedia.org/wiki/â€¦",
