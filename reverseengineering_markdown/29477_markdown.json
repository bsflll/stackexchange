  "content": "In the Ghidra decompiler, after applying a type to a function parameter, the compiler uses that type information to provide better decompilation within the function. When that parameter is used in a function call though, the type information does not propagate. I have to manually change the function signature for the type information to carry forward.\n\nIs there any way to get Ghidra to automatically propagate the type information? I thought Commit Params/Return P or Commit Local Names would do it, but no luck. Finding it time-consuming to have to re-type a known entity in every function call it's used.\n\nExample:\n\nLooking at a Windows Kernel Driver, following the analysis steps here\n\nChanged the type of param_2 from longlong to PIRP and renamed it pIRP. Then selected Analysis -> Auto-Analyze file.sys and only selected Decompiler Parameter ID.\n\nAfter running the analysis, I'm left with this :\n\n```\nint FUN_140001a20(longlong test,PIRP pIRP)\n{\n    ... TRIMMED...\n\n        if (uVar2 == 0xc3500e68) {\n          uVar7 = FUN_140002a14(test,(longlong)pIRP,(longlong)pbVar3);\n\n```\nAnd double-clicking FUN_140002a14:\n\n```\nvoid FUN_140002a14(longlong param_1,longlong param_2,longlong param_3)\n\n```\nFor whatever reason, pIRP's type is getting cast, and the signature for the called function doesn't change. I'd have expected the longlong to become PIRP.\n\nEdit:\n\nStill working this. Since the types/names don't propagate, working a script to do it for me for a given function. Right now I'm grabbing all functions called by a given function and trying to change a known parameter's name/type.\n\nWhat I'm most confused about is in the Decompiler window, when I rename/retype a variable, it propagates through the rest of that function. But when I query the parameters for those functions, the variables are unchanged. For example, in the decompiler window, pIRP is propagated to all functions where it's used, but when I get the function signatures in the script, it still has the name as param_2.\n\nDecompiler Window:\n\n```\nuVar5 = FUN_140002a14(param_1,(longlong)pIRP,(longlong)CurrentStackLocation)\n\n```\nScript Output:\n\n```\nhelloGhidra.java> FUN_140002a14[[longlong param_1@RCX:8], [longlong param_2@RDX:8], [longlong param_3@R8:8]]\n\n```\nThis occurs even if I try Commit Params/Return P and Commit Local Names for the parameter.\n\n",

If you really want to propagate the variable names to function param names you can write a script for it.
