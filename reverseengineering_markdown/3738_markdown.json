  "content": "I'm using IDA Starter 6.5 on linux. (Debian Wheezy 32bit)\nI would like to perform batch analysis on a bunch of iOS apps with an IDAPython script.\nTo do so, I use command as such, to call text interface:\n\n```\n$ ~/.ida-6.5/idal -A -SDump.py my_app\n\n```\nHowever, it just flashed out in a sec and quited before any analysis happened.\nThe only thing I saw on the last line of IDA is:\n\nThe file is encrypted. The disassembly of it will be likely useless.\nDo you want to continue? ? -> N~o\n\nAnyone know how to make it Yes so I can use command line?\nThanks.\n\n",
