  "content": "I'd like to create a IDA FLIRT signature for the following PPC uClibc library:\n\n```\nlibuClibc-0.9.15.so: ELF 32-bit MSB shared object, PowerPC or cisco 4500, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.0.0, stripped\n\n```\nI got the FLAIR tools from hex-rays but didn't manage to create the .sig file.\nIf I understood correctly, a .pat file must be created first, from which a .sig file can be created then. I tried ./pelf.exe libuClibc-0.9.15.so, but this only returned an 'invalid input file' error.\n\nHow can I create a FLIRT signature from this library?\n\n",

      "content": "AFAIK, you can only create the .pat files from statically linked libraries using the method you describe. It appears your file is dynamically linked (that would explain the 'invalid input file' message)\n\nYou can give a try to this IDAPython plugin. A good explanation from its author can be found here\n\nGood luck!\n\n",
