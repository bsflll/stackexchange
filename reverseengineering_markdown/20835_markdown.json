  "content": "I'm trying to decompile the LUCs (customly extensioned LUAs) from both of the games but they won't decompile, they aren't encrypted and use LUA version 5.0.2 (32-bit) according to the game's code. They are headered LuaV with extra bytes of some sort. Anyone willing to help me decompile these files? If so thanks so much.\n\nhttps://zenhax.com/download/file.php?id=6262 (Vol 1)\n\nhttps://zenhax.com/download/file.php?id=6251 (Vol 2)\n\n",

I did compile a simple testing LUA of my own and use luac -l on a LUC after fixing some header bytes while using my LUA as an idea and I always get error of some sort. The smallest file I know is Hippogriff, I'm trying to decompile that one for an example on decompiling the other files. One of the games have a few plain LUA files but are missing characters yet the game still reads them fine.",
