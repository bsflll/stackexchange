  "content": "As part of exercise in RE I noticed that some string is not appear correctly in the code.  \n\nI have the following code:\n\n\nIn the orange colour the string doesn't appear correctly.\nIn the red it appear correctly.  \n\nI want that the code in the orange will be like the one in the red.  \n\nWe can see that in address 0x10751 we have:  \n\n```\npush offset word_107DE ; SourceString\n\n```\nAt the address of word_107DE (0x107DE) the string appears as:\n\n```\nword_107DE dw '\\'\naDosedevicesPr_0:\n    unicode 0, <DosDevices\\ProceHelper>, 0\n\n```\nIn 0x107DE we have an extra row:  \n\n```\nword_107DE dw '\\'  \n\n```\nHow can I fix it and merge this row to be like this:  \n\n```\naDosedevicesPr_0:\n    unicode 0, <\\DosDevices\\ProceHelper>, 0\n\n```\nAnd after this I hope to see the name of the string in the code.  \n\n",
