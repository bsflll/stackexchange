  "content": "I'm reversing an application and I know for a fact it employs CRC checks, so if I modify the code, for instance hooking something, it'll be detected. The application uses a DLL which I replaced with my custom one and I'm trying to get around the CRC checks. The symptoms are, however, puzzling me. This is what happens if I modify the code and it gets detected:\n\n\n\nHowever, it seems that the code at this address is just the start of some unrelated function:\n\n\n\nI find that a bit puzzling; I expected something like\nif (detected) RaiseException(EXCEPTION_SINGLE_STEP), and instead it simply \"crashes\" at the start of this function.\n\n",

      "content": "It simply means the application has set the trap flag (presumably as a response to your modifications).\nHowever, this doesn't necessarily have to happen via RaiseException. Instead, it could have been done like this:\n\n```\npushf\npop eax\nor eax, 100h\npush eax\npopf\n\n```\nOr by a simple variaion of that code.\n\nUpdate:\n\nNote that a single step exception is in fact a trap exception (as opposed to a fault exception). A trap is raised after the instruction executed that caused the trap, whereas a fault is raised before the instruction executes that would generate that fault.\nFor example, a page fault is raised before the instruction that references paged memory actually executes. For the same reason you have division by zero faults, you better get the exception before dividing by zero ;)\nSo the code in your application might conceptually look like this:\n\n```\npushf\npop eax\nor eax, 100h\npush eax\npopf\ncall MySub\n\n```\nAnd you get the exception at the entry of MySub, which makese sense because the exception is raised after the call executed.\nAnother possible explanation could be, that an SEH exception is raised and the TF is enabled in the cpu context upon return from the kernel.\n\n",

Regardless, I was able to discard the exception in this way:\n\n```\nLONG WINAPI VEH_Handler(struct _EXCEPTION_POINTERS *ExceptionInfo)\n{\n    printf(\"Got an exception %X at address %X  \n\", ExceptionInfo->ExceptionRecord->ExceptionCode, ExceptionInfo->ExceptionRecord->ExceptionAddress);\n\n    if (ExceptionInfo->ExceptionRecord->ExceptionCode == EXCEPTION_SINGLE_STEP)\n    {\n        printf(\"patching trap flag  \n\");\n\n        __asm PUSHF\n        __asm POP EAX\n        __asm AND EAX, 0xFEFF\n        __asm PUSH EAX\n        __asm POPF\n\n        return EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION;\n    }\n\n    return EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH;\n}\n\n```\nIt works, which I find somewhat amusing.\n\n",
