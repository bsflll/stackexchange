  "content": "I have a custom chromium browser build which has a bunch of \"native\" functions which I would like to have definitions for.\n\nApparently, these are registered as en extension using this function: Chromium.Remote.CfrRuntime.RegisterExtension(System.String,System.String,Chromium.Remote.CfrV8Handler) which I was able to find in the ChromiumFX.dll.\n\nI found this in the definition:\n\nI'm a total reverse engineering noob so don't really know what I'm doing. I found the function using dnSpy but that's about it.\n\nI tried looking into extracting the function definitions right from Chrome but apparently in the build they're using you can't do that. Or at least I couldn't find a way.\n\nIs there a somewhat easy way of achieving what I want?\n\n",
