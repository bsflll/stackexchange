  "content": "On my OWN rooted phone, I have had xposed installed, justtrustme unpinning application, and tcpdump in an attempt to capture the traffic of specific applications that are on the phone. \n\nThe specific application I am trying to decipher is using some advanced certificate pinning. I don't care about anything other than what are the requests that it sends to the API servers. \n\nI have also tried frida.re but there are just so many function calls to figure out which one is the one I am interested in.\n\nAny advice?\n\n",
