  "content": "I have a binary file for known hardware platform, but nothing more is known. \n\nWhen I load this file in IDA (with default parameters), nothing good happens - at least does not appear xrefs to readable strings.\n\nI suggest that the case in the loading parameters: the loading address and the entry point. Maybe some even.\n\nThe only solution I see in the bruteforce these parameters and re-launch auto analysis. Before that I would like to help IDA by designation some pieces of code - readable strings as strings, small common hardware patterns as code pieces.\n\nSuccess criteria - the appearance of xrefs to the strings.\n\nUnfortunately I'm newbie in IDAPython, and I'm only has learned to show to IDA strings (by MakeStr-function).\n\nHow can I change loading parameters and launch full auto-analysis in IDAPython script?\n\n",
