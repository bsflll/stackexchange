  "content": "So i wanted to see the endpoints of this android/ios app calles \"Bigo Live\".\n\nLike always, i've set up charles and started trackig.\n\nFunnily, it only shows part of the traffic. for example: If i use the apps search, i DO NOT see the search request, however, i see the users avatars being downloaded.\n\nThis seems not like some usual SSL-Pinning. There pops simply NO request up in charles (Not even a failed one!).\n\nI'd appreciate it if anybody has any idea what kind of background magic is going on there.\n\n",
