  "content": "CreateProcessAsUser is often used by Windows services in case an executable is started that the user has specified in order to run it with Medium Integrity Level to ensure privilege isolation.\n\n\n\nLooking at the signature, a hToken has to be provided. From my observation, Windows services always pick the currently logged on user that performed this action.\n\n```\nBOOL WINAPI CreateProcessAsUser(\n  _In_opt_    HANDLE                hToken,\n  _In_opt_    LPCTSTR               lpApplicationName,\n  _Inout_opt_ LPTSTR                lpCommandLine,\n  _In_opt_    LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpProcessAttributes,\n  _In_opt_    LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpThreadAttributes,\n  _In_        BOOL                  bInheritHandles,\n  _In_        DWORD                 dwCreationFlags,\n  _In_opt_    LPVOID                lpEnvironment,\n  _In_opt_    LPCTSTR               lpCurrentDirectory,\n  _In_        LPSTARTUPINFO         lpStartupInfo,\n  _Out_       LPPROCESS_INFORMATION lpProcessInformation\n);\n\n```\nQ: What mechanism determines that \"current user\"?\n\nI'm double quoting \"current user\", because it seems very vague to assume a single point of implementation. I currently assume that every function that calls CreateProcessAsUser has its own implementation of retrieving the \"current user\" in order to pass its token.\n\nI would like to understand what this logic looks like and on what criteria the hToken is selected. Since user mode process creation is performed by many Windows services, I would have to assume there is a common logic for it, but I don't see it in the stack traces (see image).\n\n",

However, given that services run in the TCB they could just as easily \"steal\" an existing token from some process or forge their own token.
