  "content": "Sometime I have to reverse engineer / disassemble some software/firmware/application, how can I keep track of the findings, the application flow I discovered and generally the details I need when I return to work on that project after some time (months)?\n\nOften I have to analyze some kind of home-made encryption system and while I work on the project I can keep all the details I need in mind but if I pause the project for some time (ex. 1 month) when I return to work on it I have to relearn at least half of the details.\n\nTo sum up: I am searching for an easy, browsable, system to keep track of details of applications I disassemble to make them useful.\n\n",
