  "content": "I have bumped into a compression format which binwalk doesn't seem able to identify. It is used in at least ZyXEL P-724 firmware images. Running file doesn't show anything.\n\nComparing the files I have, I found there seems to be a fixed-size header of around 20 bytes (checked with two files drastically different in both size and contents -- namely, HTPCode and RasCode). Poking around BootExt I can see decompression-related string, but nothing that would give away the exact algorithm.\n\nThe suspected header bytes are (bytes that differ marked out):\n\n08 00 xx xx 71 A8 1A xx 17 2A 7C 60 xx C2 02 0C 20 83 10 00\n\nA sample containing the original image, extracted ROM object, and the compressed data itself: https://yadi.sk/d/lBRqhldYjRMPf\n\n",
