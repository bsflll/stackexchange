  "content": "I am trying to evaluate a very large amount of binaries (thousands) using BinDiff, and currently I only need some instruction level statistics from  BinDiff, which can be acquired from its dumped sqlite file easily. \n\nBut my problem is that testing thousands of binaries using the GUI of IDA/BinDiff looks too time consuming..  \n\nI am wondering can I invoke plugins of IDA-Pro, in particular, BinDiff, from command line and dump its output out? Is it possible to do so?  \n\nI have some experience to use command line ida, but that only limits to execute some IDAPython scripts.  \n\nThe test is on Windows 7, with IDA-Pro 6.6 and BinDiff 4.1. \n\n",

You would still have to start IDA to generate the idb file, but as far as i know that's also possible via the command line. hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/417.shtml seems to cover this, check the -B parameter.",
