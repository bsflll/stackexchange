Most of the idioms you are citing are used by compilers to perform a precise task in a more efficient manner than what you can see in the manuals.\n\nThe best way to learn about it is to read compiler generated assembly code and/or shellcodes. They are a great source of assembly idioms.\n\nHere is a list of good readings or links to investigate all these idioms:\n\n",
