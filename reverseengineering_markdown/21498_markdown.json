      "content": "The signature for mmap is\n\n```\nvoid *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags, int fd, off_t offset); \n\n```\n4294967295 is same as -1 when treated as a signed integer.\n\nThe mmap calls actually looks like\n\n```\nmmap(\n     NULL,                                /*addr*/\n     321,                                 /*length*/\n     PROT_EXEC | PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,  /*prot*/\n     MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE,         /*flags*/\n     -1,                                  /*fd*/\n     0                                    /*offset*/\n)\n\n```\nNow as per the man pages,\n\nIt says if MAP_ANONYMOUS is specified then we may use -1 as fd which explains your question.\n\n",
