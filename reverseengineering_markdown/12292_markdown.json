  "content": "I've been working on reversing the slingbox firmware. I didn't get anywhere trying to get into a current firmware file (see my other question - appears to be encrypted), so I found a download for an older slingbox firmware at http://autoupdate.sling.com/tinybird/200.00.US.99/\nUsing http://autoupdate.sling.com/tinybird/200.00.US.99/SlingboxSoloFwV2_1_110HwV1_0_3Current.bin as a place to start I noticed with binwalk the following:\n\n```\n$ binwalk -D 'filesystem:d' SlingboxSoloFwV2_1_110HwV1_0_3Current.bin\n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2947692       0x2CFA6C        YAFFS filesystem\n2948896       0x2CFF20        YAFFS filesystem\n2948980       0x2CFF74        YAFFS filesystem\n2949096       0x2CFFE8        YAFFS filesystem\n2949244       0x2D007C        YAFFS filesystem\n2949424       0x2D0130        YAFFS filesystem\n2950196       0x2D0434        YAFFS filesystem\n2950288       0x2D0490        YAFFS filesystem\n2950412       0x2D050C        YAFFS filesystem\n2950568       0x2D05A8        YAFFS filesystem\n2950756       0x2D0664        YAFFS filesystem\n2971856       0x2D58D0        SHA256 hash constants, little endian\n3000600       0x2DC918        Base64 standard index table\n3088905       0x2F2209        Unix path: /services.sling.com/configservices/rest/v2/configuration/product\n3302671       0x32650F        HTML document header\n3302714       0x32653A        HTML document footer\n3344945       0x330A31        Unix path: /www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace\n3358301       0x333E5D        XML document, version: \"1.0\"\n3368469       0x336615        Unix path: /www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace\n3376275       0x338493        XML document, version: \"\"1.\"\n3376594       0x3385D2        Unix path: /www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\n3385025       0x33A6C1        Unix path: /www.adobe.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd\n\n```\nThis yielded 11 different files (different based on md5). I tried the unyaffs tool on each of them, but got errors for each of them:\n\n```\nCan't determine flash layout, perhaps not a yaffs2 image\n\n```\nRepeating the same binwalk command on one of the resultant files yields 11 (smaller) files, also appearing to be YAFFS. Same error as before when I try unyaffs. \n\nSo at this point I'm stuck and out of ideas. Any assistance? Thanks!\n\n",
