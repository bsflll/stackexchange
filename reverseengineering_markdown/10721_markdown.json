  "content": "In the case of static function discovery based on disassembled code, IDA is the best tool I know. What open source tools or frameworks are also able to perform function detection/analysis?\n\nI know radare2 does have some code for that, but it isn't similar to IDA's detection. The architecture is mainly x86/x86_64, but also ARM. \n\n",

      "content": "If you are used to using Ollydbg a lot, there is a plugin called Godup. I used it on a daily basis when analyzing Delphi binaries since it contains IDA signatures that can be applied to a file being analyzed in Ollydbg. I believe it is not limited on only Delphi binaries, but based on my work so far that is the area where I used it the most. It saves me quite a lot of time with its function discovery functionality.  \n\n",
