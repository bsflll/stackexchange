  "content": "I'm working on reversing a USB flash drive controller chip. I know there's a microprocessor that runs some 8051 variant, and I have the ability to run arbitrary code on it. There's lots of different 8051-like manufacturers though, and I'd like to find out the specific processor model on this specific chip. \n\nI don't think the reason is relevant, but it's because I'm interested in breaking a model-specific code protection mechanism, and I need to know the model for it.\n\nMy question is, is there some standard way to find out the model/manufacturer of the processor? Maybe a special function register that holds a vendor specific signature, or something akin to x86's CPUID. I could break the chip and look for the processor within but I'd really prefer not to do that.\n\n",
