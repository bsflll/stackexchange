How can i do using either a gdb script or angr framework?\n\n",

      "content": "Brute forcing is often not the way to go unless you know something about your input that would limit the space of what it needs to check considerably. I think you're best bet here it to understand what is going on in the machine code especially given how straightforward the disassembly looks. \n\nLet's break it down.\n\n```\nmovzx   edi, byte ptr [rbx+rdx]\nmov     rsi, [r8+rdx*8]\ncall    check_value\n\n```\nHere we can see the program is moving two values into the rsi and edi registers. They are both indexed with rdx so rdx is probably an index counter. edi is loaded with a byte so it's probably part of the password/value that is being checked. Therefore, rbx is a pointer to the password/value itself.\n\n```\ninc     rdx\nand     ecx, eax\ncmp     rdx, 3Bh\njnz     (5 instructions above)\n\n```\nIncrements the index counter, looks at the return value (eax) from check_value and clears register ecx if the return value is zero. Finally, it compares the counter to 0x3b (59 decimal) and repeats everything above it not equal to it. From this, we can gather that our secret password/value is 59 bytes and that check_value must likely return 1 (true) for every byte if the value is correct.\n\n```\ntest    cl, cl\nlea     rdi, aYouDidnTGetItM\njz      short loc_5623E\nlea     rdi, aYouGotItCorrec\ncall    _puts\n\n```\nHere we can see we are getting either one of two messages put depending on the value of cl. If ecx is zero from the loop above, cl will be zero and the jz jump will be taken leaving us with the message \"You didn't get it, much sadness :(\" but if ecx is non-zero, we get \"You got it! correct! awesome!\" which is then displayed on the console with the puts function.\n\nSo, from just breaking this down a bit we can see exactly what this function is doing. \n\nExtrapolating a bit from missing disassembly in your listing above (what sets ecx before your listing starts and what prints out the didn't-get-it-message after your listing ends), the C code for this might looks something like\n\n```\nbool passwordOkay = True;\nfor (index = 0; index != 59; ++index) {\n    byte = password[index]\n    secondVal = table[index]\n    passwordOkay &= check_value(byte, secondVal);\n}\nif (passwordOkay)\n    printf(\"You got it! correct! awesome!\");\nelse\n    printf(\"You didn't get it, much sadness :(\");\n\n```\nYou should apply the same technique within the check_value function to reverse exactly hot to defeat this checker.\n\n",
