  "content": "I want to find out the compression method used by an iOS app used for music notation to store its files. The files of its OSX counterpart are zipped files. You cannot create files in the iOS app, but you can upload them using the desktop application to the application's cloud server and from there download them to your iOS device for offline viewing. My findings so far:\n\nThe following files are actually all the same file downloaded from the server 4 times.\n\n",

The rest is high entropy.\n\nThe same content saved at different times produces a different binary file each time.\n\nFile sizes are similar in previous instances when content was different in size, indicating padding of some sort.\n\nI think this is may how IOS handles file security for some apps\n\n",
