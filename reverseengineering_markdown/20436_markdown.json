  "content": "I need some help and advice here.\nI am privately learning on how to reverse engineer\nour teachers custom file archive\nfile that have other files stored inside of them. \nfor school project.\n\nBut, I am kinda lost on where I need to start with the file.\nWhat do I look for in the file after loading it into ida-pro\nTo, be able to create my own self extracting Tool for my project.\n\nThe File format is .crackme that has been compressed with files inside of it\nfrom our teacher at school but when I double click on the file it says the file is \"archive either unknown format or damaged\".\n\nSo, yeah the file extension he gave us is not any known on the web \nhe created his own extension for us to crack it and make an extractor tool\nto get all the data from the archive his extension name is \".crackme\" \nso yeah.\n\nAny Advice, here any help to is much appreciated by me.\n\n",

      "text": "Hi and welcome to RE.SE. I'm confused based on the info you give. So assuming it's an archive (data file) why do you want to load it into IDA at all? What does the Unix file command state ... did you try the usual firmware analysis tools? Do you have access to any program that handles (reads or writes) the format, which you could reverse engineer to learn more about the format?",

Since it appears you were only given a format file, without any executable code to manipulate / process the file, IDA will prove less useful.\n\nInstead, the only tool you should require for such a task, assuming the format is indeed proprietary, is a hex-editor / reader. 010 Editor is a great one, and it has a trial version.\n\nTo eliminate the possibility of a known format, try running a couple file identification tools such as the linux file command, TrID, binwalk, etc. These will try to identify common file formats (binwalk is specifically focused on archive formats), which if provide any insights should point you in the right direction.\n\nTo reverse engineer a file format solely based on a single file content, you'll need to map out the the file's apparent structure and you don't have a lot to go with. Excluding textual and very simply file formats, this should be kinda difficult without any additional resources (more files, a program that handles the format in any way, etc).\n\nHere's a list of pointers/tips, although you'll probably find more information available online:\n\n",

They are XeNTaX and ZenHAX, respectively. Just Google those names and their forums will pop up. Each site has tutorials that discuss reverse engineering file formats, so if you really want to learn how to do this stuff, check those out. Finally, the main guy behind XeNTaX has a YouTube channel where he shows you how to reverse various file types: youtube.com/…",
