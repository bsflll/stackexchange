      "content": "1. Absence of Compression Signatures\n\nThe relevant compression formats that Binwalk detects are as follows: bzip2, lzop, lzip, lrzip, LZO, 7z, gzip, rzip, LZMA, zlib, and LZ4. Since running Binwalk against H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin returns no results even though Binwalk normally will recognize any of these compression formats is the first indicator that something other than or in addition to compression is going on.\n\nEvery tool has its limitations however, so I attempted to find byte sequences within the file header indicating the beginning of a sequence of compressed bytes manually by using the information from a zenhax.com forum post called How to recognize the compression algorithms with your eyes, looking for Bzip2, zlib, gzip, LZMA, LZMA 86 head, LZMA 86 dec, LZMA 86 dec head, LZMA efs, LZMA headerless, LZMA2 and LZMA2 headerless compression signatures in particular. Here are the first few bytes of each compression signature:\n\nThe information regarding compression in the answers to this question on SO was also helpful: How to detect type of compression used on the file? (if no file extension is specified)\n\nBy \"file header\", what I mean is the first 300 bytes or so (this question was used as a reference: RE Compressed backup file,router linux based so is it compresed with zlib? since this question, also by Vido, involved ZTE router firmware and its compression signature was found). Unfortunately, staring at a hex dump of the file did not yield any useful information.\n\n2. Evidence from Additional Sources\n\nPage 3 of a thread called ZTE zxv10 h201 on a Montenegrin forum included some relevant posts as well as this buggy python script:\n\n```\nimport re\nimport sys\nimport zlib\nimport struct\n\nime_fajla = 'H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin'\n\ndef extract_config_xml(config_bin):\n    config_xml = b''\n    for zlib_chunk in re.finditer('\\x78\\xda', config_bin):\n        zlib_chunk_start = zlib_chunk.start()\n        zlib_chunk_header = config_bin[zlib_chunk_start - 12: zlib_chunk_start]\n        xml_chunk_length, zlib_chunk_length, config_bin_length = \\\n            struct.unpack('>LLL', zlib_chunk_header)\n        if xml_chunk_length == 0x10000 or config_bin_length == 0:\n            zlib_chunk_end = zlib_chunk_start + zlib_chunk_length\n            zlib_chunk = config_bin[zlib_chunk_start: zlib_chunk_end]\n            xml_chunk = zlib.decompress(zlib_chunk)\n            assert xml_chunk_length == len(xml_chunk)\n            config_xml += xml_chunk\n    return config_xml\n\nwith open(ime_fajla, 'rb') as f:\n    print extract_config_xml(f.read())\n\n```\nFixed up it looks like this:\n\n```\n# decompress.py\nimport re\nimport sys\nimport zlib\nimport struct\n\n\nfilename = \"H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin\"\ndef extract_config_xml (filename):\n    config_xml = b''\n    for zlib_chunk in re.finditer ('\\x78\\xda', filename):\n        zlib_chunk_start, zlib_chunk.start = ()\n        zlib_chunk_header = filename[zlib_chunk_start - 12: zlib_chunk_start]\n        xml_chunk_length, zlib_chunk_length, config_bin_length, \\\n            struct.unpack ('> LLL', zlib_chunk_header)\n        if xml_chunk_length == 0x10000 or config_bin_length == 0:\n            zlib_chunk_end = zlib_chunk_start + zlib_chunk_length\n            zlib_chunk = filename[zlib_chunk_start: zlib_chunk_end]\n            xml_chunk = zlib.decompress(zlib_chunk)\n            assert xml_chunk_length == len(xml_chunk)\n            config_xml += xml_chunk\n    return config_xml\n\nwith open (filename, 'rb') as f:\n    print extract_config_xml(f.read())\n\n```\nThis script does not help in this case, mainly because it searches for the byte sequence 78 da, the zlib compression signature, which is not present in the file in question, H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin. \n\nSimilar config.bin files were quite scarce and difficult to find, but some were located and investigated. The most interesting and useful was a file called H201LV2.0.bin, shared via DropBox. Here is a diff of the headers of the two files:\n\n\n\nInterestingly, there is a 16-byte sequence both have in common at offset 0x00003214 (is this possible if the files really are encrypted? It seems odd):\n\n\n\nWhen Binwalk is run against H201LV2.0.bin it is similarly unsuccessful:\n\n```\n$ binwalk H201LV2.0.bin \n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n```\nAdditionally, there is another RE.SE post titled ZTE encrypted backup config file regarding ZTE config backups of a different product, ZTE Speedport Entry 2i, that are also suspected of being encrypted. One the config.bin files shared in a link in the comments under this question also has similar header structure to H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin but seems to be from an older firmware version. It appears that others are having difficulty with the same issue.\n\n3. Data Entropy and Entropy Analysis\n\nThere is an interesting article on compression and encryption on the SE superuser blog. Here are two points from the text:\n\nDifferentiating between compression and encryption can be attempted using statistical methods. This has been discussed in the context of firmware analysis by devttys0 in 2 articles:\n\nFrom the first article:\n\nand\n\nThese value ranges can be used as heuristics in the analysis of the file. \n\nThis is the result of using Binwalk to perform entropy analysis of H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin:\n\n```\n$ binwalk -E -J H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin \n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     ENTROPY\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1024          0x400           Rising entropy edge (0.972587)\n\n```\n\n\nAnd using ent:\n\n```\n$ ent H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin\nEntropy = 7.981641 bits per byte.\n\nOptimum compression would reduce the size\nof this 19716 byte file by 0 percent.\n\nChi square distribution for 19716 samples is 650.33, and randomly\nwould exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.\n\nArithmetic mean value of data bytes is 126.7613 (127.5 = random).\nMonte Carlo value for Pi is 3.133292757 (error 0.26 percent).\nSerial correlation coefficient is 0.039397 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).\n\n```\nSynopsis: According to the graph, entropy distribution between byte offsets (decimal) ~1000 to ~19000 is fairly uniform. This is expected with encrypted data:\n\nThe chi square distribution is 650.33 and the pi error is 0.26. The chi square value is on target for what is expected with encrypted data but the pi error value is very far off target, according to devttys0:\n\nPart of the problem is the small file size of ~20KB and low entropy in the file header, which we know is not encrypted. Excluding data known to be unencrypted from analysis will increase accuracy. Encryption looks like it begins at around offset 0x00000124, so a python script can be written to skip past the first 292 bytes and write the rest to an auxiliary file:\n\n```\n#!/usr/lib/python\n\nwith open(\"H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin\", \"rb\") as input_file:\n    with open(\"auxiliary_H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin\", \"wb\") as output_file:\n        output_file.write(input_file.read()[292:])\n\n```\nNow analysis can be performed on just the (suspected) encrypted data block without the unencrypted file header:\n\n```\n$ binwalk -E -J auxiliary_H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin \n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     ENTROPY\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0             0x0             Rising entropy edge (0.973372)\n\n```\n\n\nWith ent:\n\n```\n$ ent auxiliary_H201LV2.0_Cur_config.bin\nEntropy = 7.990521 bits per byte.\n\nOptimum compression would reduce the size\nof this 19424 byte file by 0 percent.\n\nChi square distribution for 19424 samples is 256.03, and randomly\nwould exceed this value 47.01 percent of the times.\n\nArithmetic mean value of data bytes is 128.0505 (127.5 = random).\nMonte Carlo value for Pi is 3.143651529 (error 0.07 percent).\nSerial correlation coefficient is 0.011183 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).\n\n```\nThese results are interesting: the graph indicates approximately uniform entropy throughout the file, but now the chi square distribution (256.03) and the pi approximation error (0.07%) are both within the bounds of what is expected for compressed data!\n\nWith that said, these new values are relatively close to their respective boundary conditions. That is, 256.03 is relatively close to boundary condition of 300 for the chi square distribution and 0.07% is relatively close to the boundary condition of 0.03% for pi approximation error, so it is difficult to say with confidence that the file really is encrypted or if it is compressed based on this. \n\nEvidence supporting the hypothesis that the file is encrypted is confounded by some of the results of the entropy analysis. Therefore I will venture that the file is encrypted but I cannot prove it using the methods I described here.\n\nI hope that these findings (or lack thereof) will prove useful to others performing their own investigation of this file. Perhaps a professional will be able to definitively answer this interesting question.\n\n1. More Rigorous Statistical Analysis\n\nEntropy analysis, while useful, is not enough; additional statistical methods should be employed:\n\n2. Recovering the encryption module\n\nThis speculation in the answer to ZTE encrypted backup config file may provide an avenue of investigation:\n\nIf the module within the firmware responsible for performing the encryption is found, the encryption algorithm can be reverse-engineered. I think access to the device is required for this, given the absence of easily available ZTE router firmware images.\n\n3. Ciphertext Analysis\n\nSomething I did not pursue was analysis of the (suspected) ciphertext with tools like bfcrypt or FindCrypt in order to determine the encryption algorithm employed to encrypt the file. A list of more tools can be found on fwhacking.blogspot.com.br.\n\nSpeaking of analyzing ciphertext, I though that this question on Security.SE was interesting: How to determine what type of encoding/encryption has been used?, especially the answer.\n\nquick update: \n\nthese encryption libraries are dynamically linked to the cspd MIPS ELF binary:\n\n```\n$ readelf --dyn-syms cspd | grep AES\n   484: 0053ab50  1248 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    8 AES_set_encrypt_key\n   630: 0053b9d0  1600 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    8 AES_decrypt\n  1187: 0050d470   552 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    8 DecryByAES\n  1527: 0053b390  1600 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    8 AES_encrypt\n  1535: 0053b030   864 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    8 AES_set_decrypt_key\n\n```\nas are these compression libraries:\n\n```\n$ readelf --dyn-syms cspd | grep compress\n    92: 0053c110   208 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    8 uncompress\n  1064: 0053c010   216 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    8 compress2\n\n```\nuncompress and compress2 are associated with zlib.\n\n",
