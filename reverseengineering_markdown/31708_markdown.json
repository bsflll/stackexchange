      "text": "Found GND? Try to trace back the connection from the header to the CPU. Sometimes there is no (continuous) connection and a e.g. a resistor is missing. Also check voltages under different conditions (like during boot) and also on other components. NAND at least seems to be 3V. There is of course still the possibility that it is not the serial header or not connected ... There are other marked testpoints and lots of unmarked ones. But it is lots of work to figure out if and where there is a serial connection in this case.",
