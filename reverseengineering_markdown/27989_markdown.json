  "content": "I am trying to modify the main function for a specific decompiled .exe. More specifically, I want to remove the reference to GUI from that .exe file, so that GUI doesn't get initialised on the startup and also make a call to a different function, which normally gets called from the subsequent GUI dialog.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n__int64 __fastcall gladius::Game::main(gladius::Game *this, int a2, char **a3, char **a4)\n{\n  gladius::Game *v4; // rbx@1\n\n  v4 = this;\n  gladius::Game::initialize(this, a2, a3, a4);\n  proxy::gui::GUI::run(*((proxy::gui::GUI **)v4 + 5));\n  gladius::Game::quit(v4);\n  return 0i64;\n}\n\n```\ncalled from the entry point to this program:\n\n```\nint main(int param_1,char **param_2,char **param_3)\n\n{\n  int iVar1;\n  Game local_68 [96];\n  \n  gladius::Game::Game(local_68);\n  iVar1 = gladius::Game::main(local_68,param_1,param_2,param_3);\n  gladius::Game::~Game(local_68);\n  return iVar1;\n}\n\n```\nI want to change this to something like this:\n\n```\n\n__int64 __fastcall gladius::Game::main(gladius::Game *this, int a2, char **a3, char **a4)\n{\n  gladius::Game *v4; // rbx@1\n\n  v4 = this;\n  gladius::Game::initialize(a2, a3, a4);\n  gladius::world::World::create();\n  gladius::Game::quit(v4);\n  return 0i64;\n}\n\n```\nWill call to the gladius::Game::main be possible from say proxy DLL in this case? Or as it is a main function it won't be called properly?\n\n",
