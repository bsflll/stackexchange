  "content": "I read the documentation of headleass analyzer. It is used to perform analysis on existing binaries. I know that -postscript flag allows to enter the analysis script. I have a java script which works fine. But, I want to use python 3 for the analysis. I want to run that like:\n\n```\n./analyzeHeadless ghidra-project-directory -import binary-file -postscript yourpythonscript\n\n```\nIs it possible to run python script for the analysis? Also, is there any documentation available to do that?\n\n",

      "content": "I turns out that the python script can be used with headless analyzer script.\n\nUsing the following command I can run it, just like the java file:\n\n```\n./analyzeHeadless ghidra-project-directory -import binary-file -postscript yourpythonscript\n\n```\nApparently all the classes defined for java can be used directly in the python script.\n\nParticular class can be imported with from import statements, for example in java looks like:\n\n```\nimport ghidra.program.model.listing.Variable;\n\n```\nAnd using python:\n\n```\nfrom ghidra.program.model.listing import Variable;\n\n```\nTo import the variable class. The variable class can be imported just like java (see the import statement above). But, then you have to use the whole path name to access it. For example:\n\n```\nsomething = ghidra.program.model.listing.Variable()\n\n```\nSo, in conclusion, the same script can be written using python by importing the classes without any issue. Hope this helps someone.\n\n",
