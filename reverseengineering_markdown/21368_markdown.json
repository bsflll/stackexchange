      "content": "The ds means \"data segment\" register in x86 architecture, while ss states for \"stack segment\" register. You would probably want to read link for more comprehensive description. When you see\n\n```\nmov ds:[address], 0xAA,\n\n```\nit means \"move 0xAA to address address in data segment\", that is segment pointed by the current value of ds register. Similarly with every other segment register.\n\nIn x64 architecture segment registers are ignored.\n\n",
