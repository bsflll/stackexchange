  "content": "I have an absolute address that I want to scroll the Disassembly to in order to see which instructions are at that address. I understand that I can scroll by hand, or I can edit RIP. But the former may be slow and the latter is intrusive, I don't want to edit the state of the process. Is there a command for this?\n\nI've found Ctrl+Shift+G, but this is \"Go to offset\", it doesn't accept absolute addresses.\n\n",
