  "content": "I have a game (Crysis 2) and the developers exported each DLL to be loaded separately by the main executable instead of merging all of them. Instead of having 9 instance of IDA open everytime and switching between tabs I wanted to load all the modules together as if they were 1 executable. I looked at this :\n\nhttp://www.hexblog.com/?p=6\n\nand when I tried the script it had a syntax error, which I later fixed. Once I \"fixed\" it (by merely commenting the function call out) I tried running the script again and ended up with this :\n\n\n\nIt then loads the segment but doesn't load strings, imports etc. because as the error stated the main structure in the PE file format was not found..\n\nDoes anyone have any solutions to this or any alternative ways of loading all the DLLs in one database?\n\n",
