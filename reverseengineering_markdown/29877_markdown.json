  "content": "I am learning by doing some cracking in files that i made in C. One of this files is this:\n\nfile.c:\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n        char s[15] = \"disassemba\";\n        int x;\n        x=555;\n        printf(\"%d\",x);\n\n        if (x == 2000) {\n                printf(\"You win\");\n        } else {\n                printf(\"You lose\");\n        }\n}\n\n```\nSo i compile with: gcc file.c -o file\n\nopen the file with radare: r2 -w file\n\nThe commands i use is the following, in radare2, in order:\n\n```\naaa\ns main\nV\n\n```\nin visual mode, i need modify the line of code where sets x=555 to x=2000. So i navigate in visual mode to:\n\n\n\nAnd i hit shift+a, but when i try insert\n\n```\nmov dword [var_4h], 0x7D0\n\n```\nthe file is not patched (no changes in asm code).\n\nany hint?\n\nnote:Preferably in some easy way where i can write the code in asm and not in machine code.\n\n",
