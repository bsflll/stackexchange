  "content": "I'm trying to reverse engineer a binary file using GDB and objdump. I can execute the binary in my linux shell, however the file seems to be changed in a way that it can't be debugged / reverse engineered.\n\nThe file utility shows the following information:\n\n```\nmybinary: ERROR: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, invalid version (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs)error reading (Invalid argument)\n\n```\nI get the follwing error in GDB:    \n\n```\ngdb ./mybinary\nmybinary: not in executable format: File format not recognized\n\n```\nand a similar error from objdump:\n\n```\nobjdump -S -l -C -F -t -w ./mybinary\nobjdump: ./mybinary: File format not recognized\n\n```\nreadelf shows this at the end of the output:\n\n```\nreadelf -h ./mybinary\nreadelf: Error: Unable to seek to 0xffffff60e9000000 for string table\nreadelf: Error: Section 8 has invalid sh_entsize 6c2f343662696c2f (expected 18)\nreadelf: Error: Section 23 has invalid sh_entsize 0 (expected 10)\nreadelf: Error: no .dynamic section in the dynamic segment\n\n```\nWhat can I do to debug / reverse engineer this binary?\n\nEdit: gdb and objdump show these error messages, because the elf header of the binary was corrupted on purpose. Still don't know how to fix elf headers or debug this file.\n\n",
