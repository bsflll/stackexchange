Microcode basic blocks do not necessarily match the basics block in the disassembly, because during optimization steps the microcode basic blocks may be split, merged, added, or removed.\n\nYou can see some samples of microcode in Ilfak's whitepaper on the decompiler or in some of the old blog posts: 1 2 (block number is the first number on the line).\n\n",
