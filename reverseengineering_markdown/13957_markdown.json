  "content": "When decompiling an apk with apktool, the classes.dex file is decompiled into folders smali_classes#, and sorted their respective packages. I recognize some of the files, as they are mentioned in AndroidManifest.xml, but some classes and packages are named with one or two letters (Like aa, az, b, etc.).\n\nI don't think that this is obfuscation, because if someone was to obfuscate the code, they would probably apply it to every class.\n\nAre these strangely named classes just some sort of reference made by the Android compiler, or could it indeed be obfuscated code? They don't seem to be references, as some of the single letter files are generally not too short.\n\n",

      "content": "I'd still say these are obfuscated classes, probably not written by the author of the apk himself, but some 3rd-party library.\n\nThe provider of the 3rd-party library wants to protect their own implementation, so they provide a few unobfuscated class/method names to the world, and obfuscate their internal code. When someone else builds an apk, they'll include that library in their .dex file, so even if the app programmer doesn't obfuscate their classes, the classes that come from the 3rd party library are still obfuscated.\n\nFor example, this is the listing of the files that Oracle's oraclepki.jar contains (not that I assume your app uses an oracle database, but that's an example I had handy):\n\n```\n$ unzip -l oraclepki.jar\nArchive:  oraclepki.jar\n  Length      Date    Time    Name\n---------  ---------- -----   ----\n      233  2012-12-06 00:33   META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\n     2272  2012-12-06 00:33   a.class\n     8479  2012-12-06 00:33   KeyStoreTest.class\n      242  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/BadPaddingException.class\n     6160  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/a.class\n     5575  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/b.class\n      717  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/c.class\n     5561  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/Cipher.class\n     1360  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/CipherSpi.class\n     9102  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/d.class\n      926  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/DESSecretKey.class\n     2395  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/e.class\n      827  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/DESedeSecretKey.class\n     2663  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/FileLocker.class\n      248  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/IllegalBlockSizeException.class\n      495  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/IvParameterSpec.class\n     1367  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/NZNative.class\n      245  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/NoSuchPaddingException.class\n     5529  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/OracleCRL.class\n     1094  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/OracleCertExtension.class\n     2385  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/f.class\n     9041  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/g.class\n      592  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/h.class\n     6513  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/i.class\n     1212  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/j.class\n      634  2012-12-06 00:33   oracle/security/pki/k.class\n\n```\nClasses like Cipher, NZNative etc. are supposed to be callable from the outside, but Oracle doesn't want you to know what a.class, b.class etc. are doing.\n\nIf someone built an app that somehow connects to an oracle database using the wallet feature, they'd have to include these classes into the app's classes.dex, so this is what you'd see in apktool as well.\n\n",
