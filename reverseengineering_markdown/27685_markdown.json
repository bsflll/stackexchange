  "content": "I've recently tried to decompile a .exe to .py source code. It partly went well as the majority of the .pyc got translated into python code but partly also failed. Like the following part:\n\n```\n--- This code section failed: ---\n\n L. 128       0_2  SETUP_LOOP        13710  'to 13710'\n              4_0  COME_FROM         13706  '13706'\n                4  LOAD_FAST                'self'\n                6  LOAD_ATTR                _Worker__abort\n                8  LOAD_CONST               True\n               10  COMPARE_OP               !=\n            12_14  POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE 13708  'to 13708'\n\n```\nNow my questions are:\n\nThanks for reading\n\n",
