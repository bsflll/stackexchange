  "content": "As a preface, I do not have any experience in reverse engineering. I am an application developer, so this field is way out of my area of expertise. My end goal is to create a web page out of this information but this is the first hurdle I faced: getting the required data in the first place.\n\nI am currently trying to identify the nature of a file that I have suspicions might be encrypted and/or compressed (I'm still trying to learn the tell-tales of a file being encrypted/compressed). Since this is way above what I can do at the moment, it would be great if someone can help out or at least provide some guidance.\n\nThis is an example file (do let me know if you'd like some more examples):\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1vwt4G55E-TaGvuWM86L6S-7Sbd2o0gOp/view?usp=sharing\n\nSo far, here's what I know and attempted:\n\nAny help/guidance would be appreciated.\n\n",

In order to continue investigating, you need to understand which program is using the file - and in what purpose, and continue with a reverse engineering process, usually based on static disassembler like IDA PRO or the free Ghidra.\n\n",
