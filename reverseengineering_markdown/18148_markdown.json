  "content": "I downloaded radare 2.5 for windows. I am trying to debug a binary on windows with radare and have tried the following:\n\n```\nradare2 -d a.exe\nfork_and_ptraceme/CreateProcess: The request is not supported.\nw32_dbg_maps/w32_OpenProcess: The parameter is incorrect.\n[w] Cannot open 'dbg://a.exe' for writing.\n\n```\nI also tried to use gdbserver and use radare to connect remotely. It connects but it gets stuck and I am not able to give it any commands or see anything.\n\nI am going to try windbg remote as well, however, I am starting to wonder, do I need to install another set of libraries or another type of debugger, or do some additional configuration to make debugging work with radare2. Any suggestions?\n\n",

The link is to the 32-bit application, but you need to open the directory and download the 64-bit radare2 version.\nJust encountered this issue myself.\n\n",
