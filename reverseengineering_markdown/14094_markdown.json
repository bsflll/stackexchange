  "content": "I am trying to become familiar with IDA by reversing a .bin file that I have compiled myself. The code is written in cpp and the open source code can be found here: https://github.com/openxc/vi-firmware\n\nTaking a look at the Makefile and linker files (in vi-firmware/src and vi-firmware/src/platform/lpc17xx/), you can see the Flash and RAM locations are called out in the comments. The microcontroller uses an LPC17xx (http://vi.openxcplatform.com/electrical/design/microcontroller.html) with and ARM 7 architecture.\n\nTherefore, when I load IDA, I select Binary file and set the Processor to ARM and Processor Options to ARM 7. \n\nIn the next menu I configure the RAM and ROM according to the comments in vi-firmware/src/platform/lpc17xx/LPC17xx-bootloader.ld and then, after pressing OK, get  the dialogue box telling me to \"Please move to what you think is an entry point\".\n\nI move 64KB (0x10000) into Flash (ROM) and hit 'C' to try to auto-analyse. Only a few lines translate to assembly.\n\nIs there anything else I can do here? I've combed the datasheet for the uC but haven't been able to find anything of use.\n\n",

          "text": "@Kal because the file you pointed us at said so. \"Flash\" memory apparently is RX, i.e. read and execute, so no write. ROM = read-only memory, so it makes sense that flash = ROM. As for the size: IDA barfs at you when you specify a wrong (default?) size, so I just tried the same value as the RAM and it worked. As for the graph - I really only did what you see in the GIF. Define unknown bytes with C, make a function with P, press Space, done. e.g.: 0x132E0",
