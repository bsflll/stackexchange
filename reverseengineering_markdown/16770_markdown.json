I wanna know if there is a table or some kind of place where the other dll functions reside. Let's say I wanna hook Advapi32!CryptEncrypt function in Kernel Mode. How can this be done?\n\n",

      "content": "It feels like there are two questions here. 1) Finding addresses of system DLLs and 2) Hooking a specific function in the discovered DLL. I'll answer the first question, since it is the title of this post.\n\nTo find the address of all DLLs, call one of the following functions from your own custom application:\n\nEnumProcessModules:\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682631(v=vs.85).aspx\n\nEnumProcessModulesEx: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682633(v=vs.85).aspx\n\nThe tradeoff here is that EnumProcessModules only fetches modules of the same bit-ness (ie if calling from a 64-bit program, only 64-bit modules are fetched)\n\nEnumProcessModulesEx gives more control and allows fetching all modules, but is a bit trickier to use.\n\nYou can then check the module base address to see if is in user mode space or kernel mode space. Unfortunately this can vary depending on how the target program was compiled. 32-bit programs are generally kernel mode from 0x80000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF, and 64-bit programs are generally kernel mode from 0xFFFF0800'00000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF'FFFFFFFF. Additional information can be found below:\n\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366912(v=vs.85).aspx and https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366778(v=vs.85).aspx\n\n",
