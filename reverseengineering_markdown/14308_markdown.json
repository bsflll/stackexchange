  "content": "I'm trying to edit a Japanese Configuration executable using Resource Hacker and I just want to translate the UI stuff to English. There are also a few English text that I was able to find and successfully edit. \n\nMy problem is that before the hex editor can properly display Kanji, I need a table for it (.tbl). \n\nGoogle only leads me to translating Japanese NES games which doesn't apply to what I'm trying to do.\n\nAlso, the Japanese characters on the UI of the .exe file I'm trying to edit even if I have already installed the Japanese Language Pack -- I still need to set the Region > Format to Japan before the characters are properly displayed.\n\nI really hope someone can help me with this. :-/\n\n",
