  "content": "I have stackoverflow in MIPS arch (without ASLR/canary)\n\nIn Ida I see that the buffer that has the overflow located in SP+200\n\nIn the beginning if function I can see the stack size because I see the command\n\n```\naddiu $sp, -4000\n\n```\nSo I guess the stack frame on this function is 4000\n\nIf I want to override the PC register (when the function is return) , should I need to write to buffer 4000 (stack frame) -200(location of buffer in stack) ? Because the address is decrement is stack?\n\n",
