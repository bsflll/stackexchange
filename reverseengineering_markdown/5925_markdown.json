  "content": "I have this kind of code:\n\n\n\nI have reversed the struct entirely, and when I try to cast to ClientGame*, instead of:\n\n```\nif(mainStruct->something & 2)\n\n```\nI see:\n\n\n\nThe offsets 0x364, 0x370, and 0x374 are also reversed and each one has the size that IDA wants (0x374 is a db, 0x364 and 0x370 are dd)\n\nIs there any way to fix it? Thanks!\n\n",
