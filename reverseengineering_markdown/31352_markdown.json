  "content": "I was reversing an apk. the code detects whether the apk is running on a rooted device or not. if it is rooted or an emulator it will stop and close out. so this is the snippet code which I think it was obfuscated with DexGuard not really sure if it is.\n\n```\nv0_4 = (int)(((Integer)((Class)withOrigin.read(((char)(-1 - Long.compare(ExpandableListView.getPackedPositionForChild(0, 0), 0L))), 476 - View.combineMeasuredStates(0, 0), 18 - Long.compare(Process.getElapsedCpuTime(), 0L))).getMethod(\"RemoteActionCompatParcelizer\", Context.class, Integer.TYPE).invoke(null, v0_3, ((int)1))));\n\n```\nso the method RemoteActionCompatParcelizer is the method determining whether rooted or not I believe. as such the withOrigin.read intercepted with frida returns o.a so tried to with jadx-gui find the package o.a as the method RemoteActionCompatParcelizer is apparently defined in this package but not found in the tree o and there are a bunch of other classes in it.\n\nso what next steps can I take to solve these obfuscations?\n\n",
