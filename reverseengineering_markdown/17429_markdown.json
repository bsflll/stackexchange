      "content": "It means a byte array.\n\nIn the Java descriptor syntax, a [ at the beginning means an array. There's a one letter code for each primitive type - B = Byte, C = Char, S = Short, Z = Boolean, I = Int, J = Long, F = Float, and D = Double. Object types are represented by L, followed by the classname, followed by a semicolon.\n\nSo for example, a String[][][] would have the descriptor [[[Ljava/lang/String;.\n\n",
