  "content": "I downloaded firmware from 4MB spi flash in HDMI extender (more info here). It contains following sections:\n\n```\n0x00000000 – 0x00024e03 – SMEDIA02 …….456789ABCDEF (encoded – some strings suggesting bootloader)\n0x00080000 – 0x0016ee5d – SMEDIA02 …….456789ABCDEF (encoded – probably the main firmware)\n0x00250000 – 0x00250200 – some zeroes with some data\n0x00257e00 – FAT with webroot\n0x00367e00 – FAT with config\n0x003e0000 – MAC + 2 unknown bytes\n\n```\nI'm interested in first two sections. The first one seems to be a bootloader and the second one the main firmware. There are some other unknown parts in the firmware which might be some kind of a key.\n\nCan someone please help decode those first two sections? \n\n",
