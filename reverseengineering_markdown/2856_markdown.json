  "content": "I need and advice on how to start an analysis, connect with debugger to a process that is already debugging itself. Are there any tools/plugins/techniques that might help during the analysis?\n\nUPDATE\nIf I connect to the parent process with a debugger then I'll be able to see the Debug events that are being processed. How can I see/monitor what is going on in the child (debug-gee) process?\n\n",

Here I take the assumption that the self-debugging is implemented based on Windows Debug APIs. So, here are my findings:\n\nIn \"debugger\" process: \n\nIn \"debug-gee\" process:\n\nHope this will help.\nYour comments are more than welcome.  \n\n",
