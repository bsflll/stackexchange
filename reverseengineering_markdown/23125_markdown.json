  "content": "I've seen multiple posts about the subject, but mine is a little bit more specific about what I want to achieve.\n\nI have many times situations where Hex-Rays decompiler outputs 16 lines of code and I know this is a call to a inline structure function.\n\nSo the first step, I convert those 16 lines of code to a structure (i.e Matrix) which makes it a little bit more clear to understand what's happening\n\nThen I'm stuck where I want to make it show as 1 line, which will call to the underline inline structure function Identity().\n\nSo those 16 lines of code:\n\n\n\nWould show as s_mtx.Identity() or maybe Identity(s_mtx)\n\nIs that even possible doing it within HexRays decompiler? Maybe some script I can write to do that?\n\nThis gets really tedious when you have a function with many matrix multiplications, vectors etc...\n\nMaybe @IgorSkochinsky?\n\nThanks a lot in advance!\n\n",
