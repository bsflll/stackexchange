Let's try to decode them.\n\n>>>x = [a.decode('base64') for a in using]\n'2', '105', '78', '82', '73', '68', '79', '98', '88', '67', '68', '83', '19', '17', '16', '22']\n\nSo they decode to string representations of some numbers. Not sure if this means anything, we need to see how they're used.\n\n2) The BZ sequence hints at Bzip2. We can try to decompress it as such:\n\n```\n>>> import bz2\n>>> bz2.decompress(secret)\n'base64'\n\n```\nAnd we're back to square one.\n\n",

The strange thing about the EXE program that I don't understand is when I using debugger like Olly or Immunity it does not show the strings that the program is using like: \"please enter the password\" or \"wrong password\". I thing that is somehow encrypted so the strings cannot be seen, and this is what give me a hard time to RE this program. Can you suggest how to decrypt the content of the program?",
