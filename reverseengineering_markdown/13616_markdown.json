  "content": "I have been trying to use binwalk on a very large dump file without much success so far. Everytime I tried to use it, it produces very large zip file that fill the disk until I reach a disk full error (using Linux).\n\nI am trying to understand what I did wrong, so here is a simple scenario hopefully to understand what I am doing wrong.\n\nSteps:\n\n```\n$ dd if=/dev/zero of=head bs=1 count=512\n$ dd if=/dev/zero of=tail bs=1 count=512\n$ wget https://github.com/devttys0/binwalk/archive/master.zip\n$ cat head binwalk-master.zip tail > full\n$ binwalk -z -C demo -D 'zip archive:zip:unzip %e' full\n\n```\nCould someone please let me know why I am seeing the following:\n\n```\n$ find demo\ndemo\ndemo/_full.extracted\ndemo/_full.extracted/483BD.zip\ndemo/_full.extracted/200.zip\n\n```\nWhere is this file coming from ? Is there any reason to keep it around ?\n\n```\n$ unzip -l demo/_full.extracted/483BD.zip \nArchive:  demo/_full.extracted/483BD.zip\n5be61ad220a42e7b2c7e912024fda5edd84b4843\nerror [demo/_full.extracted/483BD.zip]:  missing 295357 bytes in zipfile\n  (attempting to process anyway)\nerror [demo/_full.extracted/483BD.zip]:  attempt to seek before beginning of zipfile\n  (please check that you have transferred or created the zipfile in the\n  appropriate BINARY mode and that you have compiled UnZip properly)\n\n```\nBonus question: is there a way to really extract only the zip file (removing the tail stuff):\n\n```\n$ crc32 binwalk-master.zip demo/_full.extracted/200.zip \n8ce4d36c    binwalk-master.zip\n81923fef    demo/_full.extracted/200.zip\n$ ls -al binwalk-master.zip demo/_full.extracted/200.zip \n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 295419 Sep 29 08:54 binwalk-master.zip\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 295931 Sep 29 09:02 demo/_full.extracted/200.zip\n\n```\n",
