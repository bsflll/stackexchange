  "content": "I'm trying to reverse engineer.NET binary with dnspy. I have a decryption routine that is used to display useful strings. It takes one integer value as a parameter and uses it in the decryption process, I wrote a script to decrypt one string per value.\n\nThis routine is called many times. I want to retrieve all integer values passed to this function to decrypt all strings.\n\nHow to automate this process using python for example?\n\n",
