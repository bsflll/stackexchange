I compiled the C# code and ran it in the VirtualKD-2.8 directory. the first problem is gone but the virtual box said:\n\nAgain I start googleing... the problem is for VBox > 3.1, it force signed dll loading in windows. so I signed the DLL by a self generated sign ( and of curse I added it to my trust list ). now the virtualbox braks with\n\nso I used a globally trusted sign to do the job but I got a FATAL error from vbox...\n\n",

      "content": "As I think, someone else might have this problem, I have to answer my own question...\n\nFirst. please read the question carefully ( it is long but worst it ).\nThen...\n\nAs Virtual Box only accepts signed DLLs so you have to sign the \nVBoxKD64.dll and/or VBoxKD.dll. it is not easy to find a trust sign so avast guys make a pre-signed virtual-kd available for download here\n\nNow we have another problem. Virtual Box will not load DLLs that are not owned by NT SERVICE\\TrustedInstaller so we have to add Virtual-KD directory to it's kingdom. ( read this if you have no ida about what I say )\n\nAlso it is a good description in the avast package named Install.txt.\n\n",
