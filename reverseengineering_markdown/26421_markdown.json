  "content": "i am really glad i found this great site and wanted to ask from your expertise regarding the following issue:\n\ni have been doing malware analysis and researching for a few years, and i want to learn something new; a new tool to deepen my understanding while utilizing it for mundane tasks.\n\ni want to learn modern dynamic instrumentation. i searched the web and literacy and found a couple of suggestions: dynamorio, pin/pintools, frida(familiar with already), lief, triton, angr and manticore.\n\ni need the \"tool\" to have a lowest overhead(i know it depends also on the way i implement the scripts), and it will mainly be used for reverse engineering, pe research and mostly for exploit development.\n\nwhat should i learn in order to gain the benefits for what i mentioned? i didn't specify architecture as i will be using it on windows,linux,arm and mips (if there are other tools or better ones, i would really love to learn from your input to improve myself and gain new skills).\n\non a side note, i know that dynamorio is being used on winafl and other fork, but it seems quite old, so i was wondering if there's something newer with lower overheads for vulnerability research/malware analysis purposes.\n\non a side note, i tried to check several conferences for notes and talks regarding the issue, but i saw that every year there seems to be something new, and a few months later something newer, so i am wondering, what is the current \"cool toy\" of 2020?\n\nwould love to learn from your inputs and study what you mentioned to improve my knowledge base. thank you very much\n\n",
