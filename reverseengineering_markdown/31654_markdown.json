  "content": "I'm developing a python script for IDA Pro that analyzes 32 bit PE files containing an anti-disassembly technique, the problem is that the function that contains the technique isn't being listed in the list of functions using idautils.Functions().\n\nTo solve the problem I tried to add the function to the list with:\n\n```\nsegm = idaapi.get_segm_by_name(\".text\")\n    start = segm.start_ea\n    end = segm.end_ea\n    while start < end:\n        start = idaapi.find_not_func(start, 1)\n        ida_funcs.add_func(start)\n\n```\nWhen the start value is the address of the beginning of the function the ida_funcs.add_func method returns false, meaning that the address can't be added as a function, despite that in the GUI of IDA the function becomes listed.\n\nThis is the screenshot of the function containing the technique in the IDA GUI:\n\n\nDo you know what can I do in order to have the script working? Thank you in advance.\n\n",
