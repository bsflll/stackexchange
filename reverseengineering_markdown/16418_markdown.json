      "content": "OllyDbg has stopped the execution at ntdll!RtlUserThreadStart, what seems like almost the \"System Breakpoint\" which is the location where the operating system uses to break so the debugger can do its work -- but not exactly there.\nThe address which you are in is inside NTDLL and you have nothing to be afraid of being there.  \n\nI believe that there's a bug (or a configuration which I'm not aware of) in OllyDbg in which the program breaks in RtlUserThreadStart although your settings is set to first break on program's entry.   RtlUserThreadStart is kind of every thread's entrypoint so I wonder maybe Olly hits this-not-exactly System Breakpoint even though it is not configured to do so.  \n\nBoth OllyDbg v2 and x64dbg doesn't have this problem and they would break on program's entrypoint as expected, unless you configure it elsewhere.\n\nFor example, here's the program as it loaded on Ollydbg version 2:  \n\n\n\nAnd here's how it looks like when it configure to break on System Breakpoint:  \n\n\n\nYou can configure it by using Alt+O >> Debugging >> Start and check \"System Breakpoint\" under \"When starting application, make first pause at\".\n\nAs you can see, the program broke on a different address which is considered as the System Breakpoint.  \n\nx64dbg also breaks in this address:  \n\n\n\nYou can configure x64dbg inital breakpoints in Options >> Preferences >> Events.  \n\nAnyway, in your case, pressing F9 or Run in OllyDbg v1 will take you to the program's entrypoint.  \n\nI highly recommend to use x64dbg which is an active open-source project, unlike Ollydbg which is absolutely outdated.  \n\nHere are some resources:\n\n",
