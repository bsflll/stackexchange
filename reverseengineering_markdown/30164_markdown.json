  "content": "In a ctf there was a rev PE challenge where it appeared in the deassembly as if the programm was calling functions from the ADVAPI32 but instead called some different code because the import table was modified. I can't quite figure out what was getting called instead.\nA Binaryninja line where the ADVAPI function appears to be called:\n\n```\nCreateServiceA(&var_20, 0, 0, 0x18, 0xf0000000)\n\n```\nThe Import information I got from PEBear:\n\nCall Via: 81D8,\nName: CreateServiceA,\nOrdinal: -,\nOriginal Thunk: 4E908,\nThunk: 8360,\nHint: DAB9\n\nAs I understood it the \"Original Thunk\" is the RVA where the \"Hint\" is located? But I don't really understand the rest.\n\nMy Question: What do the Thunks and the Hint mean, what exactly gets called and what was originally being called?\n\n",

They used a tool (github.com/d35ha/CallObfuscator) to obfuscate the IAT of the PE and load in the correct functions at runtime right before the main function. Should I delete my question or attempt to answer it? I don't think anyone cares about the answer.",
