  "content": "I am working on a highly obfuscated driver that is virtualized. In an attempt to work on this driver I asked a question about some python scripts which turned out not to be effective at all so I decided to delete that question and ask my question directly by explaining all the details so maybe I can find a better solution for my problem.\n\nDriver size is about 3mb and it is packed and when it's loaded on memory it gets around 6mb which shows how much garbage code is actually there, it used anti static analysis methods like jumping to different locations by register, calling API functions using push and ret instructions and getting API addresses using brute force and many more methods that I am not aware.\n\nNow when I am using windbg to analyze the driver I tried the ta instruction which was suggested in the previous question about python script, even 6 hours was not enough to get to that address. As a result I thought about the ideas below but I am not sure if they are working or if there is any open source tool for these ideas so I would really appreciate it if anyone can give me a solution to this problem.\n\nTldr; Working on a virtualized and heavily mutated driver with tons of fake calls that hide all import functions and getting addresses using brute forcing memory I need a way to find all those functions.\n\n",
