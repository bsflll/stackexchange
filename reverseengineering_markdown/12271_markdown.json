In your example, the two source samples will generate different machine code.\n\nEdit: using the sample code provided by @tathanhdinh below, MSVC generates the two vtables as follows:\n\n```\n;   COMDAT ??_7B@@6B@\nCONST   SEGMENT\n??_7B@@6B@ DD   FLAT:??_R4B@@6B@            ; B::`vftable'\n    DD  FLAT:?bust@B@@UAEXXZ\n    DD  FLAT:?test@B@@UAEXXZ\nCONST   ENDS\n;   COMDAT ??_7A@@6B@\nCONST   SEGMENT\n??_7A@@6B@ DD   FLAT:??_R4A@@6B@            ; A::`vftable'\n    DD  FLAT:?test@A@@UAEXXZ\n    DD  FLAT:?bust@A@@UAEXXZ\nCONST   ENDS\n\n```\nNote that the order of the member function pointers in the two vtables differs. As I mentioned, the order in which virtual functions matters in at least one compiler.\n\n",

      "content": "Since I do not think the order of virtual functions in source could affect their order in machine code, I try to give a counter example. The main idea is first to give a layout for the vtable of a base class\n\n```\nstruct A\n{\n  void virtual test() {};\n  void virtual replay() {};\n}\n\n```\nthen using two classes which inherit A, but with different order of virtual functions:\n\n```\nstruct B : public A\n{\n  void virtual test() {};\n  void virtual replay() {};\n}\n\nstruct C : public A\n{\n  void virtual replay() {};\n  void virtual test() {};\n}\n\n```\nIf the order of virtual functions in B and C affects their machine code order, then their pointers in corresponding vtables should be different. But the following generated machine code (I have used clang as the compiler) shows that they are not:\n\n```\n.rodata:0804888C ; vtable for B\n.rodata:0804888C _ZTV1B db    0                   ; DATA XREF: B::B(void)+1Co\n ...\n.rodata:08048894 dd offset _ZN1B4testEv           ; B::test(void)\n.rodata:08048898 dd offset _ZN1B6replayEv         ; B::replay(void)\n ...\n ... \n.rodata:08048904 ; vtable for C\n.rodata:08048904 _ZTV1C db    0                   ; DATA XREF: C::C(void)+1Co\n ...\n.rodata:0804890C dd offset _ZN1C4testEv           ; C::test(void)\n.rodata:08048910 dd offset _ZN1C6replayEv         ; C::replay(void)\n\n```\nThe order of virtual functions in B and C are indeed the same (and respects one in A).\n\n",
