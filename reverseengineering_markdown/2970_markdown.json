  "content": "So I have some encrypted data in this executable. IDA couldn't do much with it, so it defined it as arrays. Now I know how to decrypt this data, and it has some encrypted code. I could of course, put the encrypted data into some separate file, run the decryption on it, and then let IDA process it, but then it looses connection to the original executable.\n\nIs it possible to replace the encrypted data 1:1 with the decrypted one, so I can let IDA process it, in the context of the executable?\n\n",
