  "content": "I need to make reverse engineering of one android app.\nIn this app I found class with name Im2MessageNative, this class contains a lot of native methods.\nFor example:\n\n```\nstatic native long createMessageWrite(int i);\n\n```\nI tried to find an implementation of the method using the Ida Pro. To do this, I opened a tab with strings, then search for phrase \"createMessageWrite\", next I opened memory address and found this:\n\n```\n.rodata:00B29B29 aCreatemessagew DCB \"createMessageWrite\",0\n.rodata:00B29B29                                         ; DATA XREF: \n.data:00DDC4CC↓o\n.rodata:00B29B29                                         ; .data:00DDC4D8↓o\n\n```\nI was looking for a \"aCreatemessagew\", but could not find any function.\n\nHow to find the implementation of this native method?\n\n",
