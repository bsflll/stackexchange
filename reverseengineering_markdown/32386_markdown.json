  "content": "I'm considering reverse-engineering a 1994-era embedded system which CPU is a Mitsubishi M37702S1AFP with external 128k Ã— 8 EPROM that I know how to read.\n\nThe CPU has 16-bit registers A, B (data), X, Y (indexes), Stack, Direct Page Register, Processor Status; a 24-bit PC; and an 8-bit Data bank register DT.\n\n\n\nI have located the instruction set here. Is this compatible with a better known CPU?\n\nIs there any (free) tool that could help? Like an extension for Ghidra, which reportedly does not support this instruction set out of the box?\n\nUpdate: I'm now wondering how far the CPU can be from the 65(C)816 of SNES fame.\n\n",
