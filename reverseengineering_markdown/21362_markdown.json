  "content": "I'm learning the reverse, and I'm trying to reverse a stripped binary (flag: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, stripped). I manage to go to the entry address that points to the _start function. But impossible to know where is libc_start_main (for locate main).\n\n_start: https://ibb.co/nDpQyvv\n\nsub_44a770: https://ibb.co/dK74pG5\n\nsub_44a560: https://ibb.co/7S76m7t\n\nAll your advice is good, if you have articles on the subject, I'm interested. Thank you\n\n",
