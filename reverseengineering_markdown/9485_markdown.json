  "content": "I've encountered this function, which accepts a pointer to what I believe is a custom C struct. I came to this conclusion based on subsequent access to it.\n\n```\narg_0= dword ptr  4   ;struct passed in\n\npush    ebx\npush    ebp\nmov     ebp, [esp+8+arg_0]  ; store pointer of struct in ebp\npush    esi\npush    edi\nxor     ebx, ebx\n\n```\nand, not too far from above, I see it being populated:\n\n```\nmov     [ebp+0D4h], bl\nmov     [ebp+0F4h], bl\nmov     [ebp+114h], bl\nxor     eax, eax\nmov     [ebp+0B8h], eax\nmov     [ebp+0BCh], eax\nmov     [ebp+0C0h], eax\n\n```\nI do not know the size of the structure, but I've seen [ebp+0f14h]. Therefore, I've defined a custom IDA sturct of size 0xF14. Now I'm having trouble with applying this custom structure to this pointer. I've tried Alt+Q then selecting my own custom struct, but it is not working. The  output window says Command \"DeclareStructVar\" failed\n\nMy custom struct:\n\n```\n00000000 custom_sturct   struc ; (sizeof=0xF14)\n00000000                 db ? ; undefined\n00000001                 db ? ; undefined\n00000002                 db ? ; undefined\n[...same stuff...]\n00000F11                 db ? ; undefined\n00000F12                 db ? ; undefined\n00000F13 field_F13       db ?\n00000F14 custom_sturct   ends\n00000F14\n\n```\nI'm using IDA Pro 6.3\n\n",

A different menu will appear which will allow you to select a register (choose ebp) and a structure (choose custom_struct) and it will convert each offset from ebp within the selection to an offset of custom_struct. This works best in the linear view.",

A pop up dialog called \"Structure offsets\" will appear, where you can supply the register and structure it points to, and you'll see all references IDA recognized using it.\n\nLets take the following code snippet taken from calc.exe for example:\n\n\n\nAfter selecting the relevant code and hitting T IDA automatically identified we're setting the ECX register, suggests possible valid structures to the left and the offsets and the selected structure's values.\n\n\n\nAfter assigning a valid structure, the code looks like this:\n\n\n\nPlease notice the following caveats/remarks:\n\nThose caveats are at least partially mitigated by third party tools like Autostruct\n\n",
