  "content": "I am an Android app developer, and recently I encountered a problem with in-app purchase. I discovered that in some apps, in-app purchases can be done for free using this application.\n\nI know this app generates free cards but the proportion of free cards being generated is very high.\n\nHow do I analyze the .apk file? What basic steps should I follow to reverse engineer the .apk and get an idea of the application logic?\n\n",

However it is much easier to read. Here's a link:\n\nhttps://www.decompiler.com/\n\nIf you want to be able to edit the APK and recompile, use \"ApkTool\" and edit the SMALI code. You'll need to jar sign the APK and use zipalign before reinstalling the APK to your phone.\n\nYou can also use IDA Pro to help analyze the code, however I don't know anything about IDA Pro.\n\n",
