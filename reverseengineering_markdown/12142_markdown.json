  "content": "SysTracer from SysReveal.com (not from www.blueproject.ro) seems to be a very nice tool for live monitoring your system and check what executable files do at your system. I saw some videos on YouTube where sys-admins used it to show e.g. how Ransomware works. In this video on YouTube ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm5TbBKeFvU ) by the well known company \"Trend Micro\", they mentioned (at 0:56) the website SysReveal.com, where you can download SysTracer. The website is on Google's SafeBrowsing blacklist and the tool \"SysTracer\" hits 8 (.zip) or 9 (.exe) of 55 at Virustotal.\n\nI would appreciate it, if you check this tool NOR share your thoughts about it.\n\nImage of SysTracer\n\n\n",
