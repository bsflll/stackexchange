  "content": "I have compiled this program with gcc\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\nconst char* message = \"Outside defined\";\nint a = 1337;\nint b = 10;\nint c = 9;\nint d = 8;\nint e = 7;\nint main () {return 0;}\n\n```\nWhen I objdump -t, I am able to recover the global variable names:\n\n```\n0000000000004020 g     O .data  0000000000000004              e\n0000000000004018 g     O .data  0000000000000004              c\n0000000000004010 g     O .data  0000000000000004              a\n\n```\nMy question is, is it possible to retrieve the values for the respective global variables too by the objdump? Is it possible without running/debugging the program at all?\n\n",
