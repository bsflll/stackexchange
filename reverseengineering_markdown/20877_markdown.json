But for the common case of patching instructions there are options:\n\nThere is a PR that is currently being worked on at https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/pull/1505 that aims to implement binary patching\n\nIf building a custom fork is too much effort for a quick patch, another easier option is to use a script like https://github.com/schlafwandler/ghidra_SavePatch\n\n",
