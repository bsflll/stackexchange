  "content": "How can i save/reuse/preserve Radare2 metadata (BPs, comments, flags..) of a debug session for a new debug session? I restart the debugger alot and preserving environment would be very helpful.\n\nI start with r2 -d binary -r myenv.rr2 -i myscript.r2s, create some flags, comments and such and then exit with q. ood usually is not enough (weird errors about fds and such. I quit completely most of the time). But if i try to load my project (Po) its asks me to restart the session and then i'm in a wrong context/process or something.\n\n```\n[0x7f7d020fb2c0]> Po myproject\nClose current session? (Y/n) \nWARNING: module's base addr + delta is not a valid address\n[0x7f8baef752c0]> dc\nnative-singlestep: No such process\nStepping failed!\n\n```\n",

I think using git is a great idea, and I like how Pd can tell what happened in a project over time.\n\nProjects are saved under the directory pointed by the dir.projects configuration variable.\n\nAlso, the original question is quite old, and even trying Po will result in a deprecation warning these days.\n\n",
