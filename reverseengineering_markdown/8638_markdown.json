  "content": "I am trying to iterate all the C statement (could be very coarse-grained, it's fine) in IDA-Pro recovered assembly program. \n\nSuppose I only consider these statements:\n\n```\nState :: =\n  | if-else cond;\n  | loop;\n  | assignment;\n  | function call\n  | return\n  | {s1; s2; s3 ...}\n\n```\nAnd after some quick search, I know that there are some (third-party) plugins that can help to identify some C control-flow structure, and I list some of them below:\n\nif-else cond  :   N/A\n\nloop  : link1 link2 link3\n\nSo my questions are:\n\nIdeally it should look like this as this is essentially used in source code analysis... (sorry for this pseudo code, I just want to clarify)\n\n```\nlet aux s =\n    match s with\n    | If e1 b1 b2 -> analyze e1 b1 b2\n    | Loop e1 e2 e3 b1 -> analyze e1 e2 e3 b1\n    | Assign v1 v2 -> analyze v1 v2 \n    | States sl -> List.iter analyze sl\n    | ...  in\nList.iter aux statement_list\n...\n\n```\n",
