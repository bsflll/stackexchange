  "content": "I was in charge of analyze and reverse engineering the old unknown EXE for past few month. The binary works on MS-DOS for NEC-PC98 (retro PC), old (20years more ago), nobody knows how it's made.\n\nI done the job and knew the binary had been generated by unknown vendor's basic compiler. The binary has interesting technique; well-designed VM, partial relocated overlaying like a DLL, data-section-compression and self melting. It highly impressed me. So I'd like to know the compiler generates the binary.  \n\nFor now I guess that the vendor may be Microsoft. I'd try to use QuickBasic's compiler (BC.EXEQB.EXE) and would generate small binary but unfortunately I'm not owner the old toolchain.\n\nSo I'd love to ask someone a favor, if you have any Microsoft's Basic Compiler then goto dig your garage and put an old binary generated by such a compiler on me. I'll see it and want to identify the compiler and vendor.\n\nThe binary has following characteristics:\n\nthe EXE address map:\n\n```\n00000: MZ HEADER\n00200: module1-header\n00230: module1-code\n00xxx: module1-data (compressed)\n       : (repeats by module-N)\nyyyyy: native libraries \nzzzzz: startup code\nZZZZZ: relocation table (for calling a library)\n\n```\nBC.EXE, Microsoft PDS, is one of interested products for me.\nPlease compile a simple code like this:  \n\n\nX = 0.5 * 100.0\nPRINT X\nFOR I=0 TO 16 \n    PRINT \"Hello, World\"\nNEXT I\n\n\nand I would appreciate it if you send me an output executable.\n\n",
