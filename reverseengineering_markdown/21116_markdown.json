  "content": "I have a Panasonic air conditioner that has a header on the mainboard that various optional (expensive) addon communications modules can connect into eg wifi\n\nThe unit is a Panasonic Split system from the CU/CSZ20TKR range (however this connector is common across many of the panasonic series)\n\nI am wanting to see if I can connect to this port and control it over serial or similar once I determine what protocol it is using. RS232?, RS485?\nI have been trying to determine what protocol this port uses to communicate with the addon modules that can be plugged into it and what the correct connections are. Once I have determined the correct pins and protocol I should be able to write a script that will do the communication. \n\nI have done some research and probing with multimeter (I don't have an oscilloscope currently) and located a circuit diagram for the header on the mainboard,\n\nWhat i have determined so far:\n\n\n\nSome of the modules available to plug into this port are:\n\n",

The two signals with the 10K pullups could be an I2C bus but the PAW-SERVER doc implies they are a distinct transmit and receive.  Maybe you'll be lucky and those, or the one with no components will see some \"is anything there\" polling during startup.",
