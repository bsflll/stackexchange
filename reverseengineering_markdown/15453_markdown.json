I tried to write equivalent code in C, where second_string is r13, return_string is r14, value_holder is r15, and atoi_res is r12(d).\n\n```\nint ebx = 0;\n\natoi_res = 4;\n\nwhile(1){\n    ((int *)second_string)[ebx] ^= 0xf799b659;\n    *value_holder = ((int *)second_string)[ebx];\n    ((int *)return_string)[ebx] = ((int *)second_string)[ebx];\n\n    ebx = atoi_res;\n    if(strlen(second_string) > 8) break;\n}   \n\n```\nThis does not seem right to me: \n\nI can post more of the disassembly if needed. Thanks for any help.\n\n",

      "content": "This is just taking a cstring pointed to by r13, xoring a dword at a time with the value 0xf799b659 and storing in the memory pointed to by r14. \n\nI think your confusion is in what the lea instruction does. It simply loads the address of the memory instead of the memory value itself. In this case, it is just being used as a fast add operation. Compilers will often use it for simple addition or multiplication which is faster than an add/mul/etc instruction. In the case of lea r12, [rbx + 4], this is doing just r12 = rbx + 4; there is no memory access at all. rbx is being used as a current byte index into the strings and r12 is being used as the next byte index.\n\n",
