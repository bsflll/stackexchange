      "content": "I am unsure what you mean by \"solving\" this, but the meaning of the code is rather obvious and even more so in the screenshot you provided. Simplified version:\n\n```\ncall $+5\nadd [esp], 5\nret\nxor eax, eax\nret\n\n```\nAnd with annotations:\n\n```\n_main:\n  call $+5     ; call address of next instruction, placing return address on stack (esp)\n  add [esp], 5 ; add 5 bytes to the return address\n  ret          ; return to the address from the stack ... which happens to be\n  xor eax, eax ; ... this instruction\n  ret          ; return for good from _main ...\n\n```\nSo what this does is to return 0 as a 32-bit value from _main.\n\nGiven the (decompiled) condition:\n\n```\nif ((cVar1 = func_0x8b4c55a0(), cVar1 == -0xe) || 1)\n\n```\n... this doesn't change a thing, however, as the || 1 will ensure that this condition is always true and cVar1 doesn't subsequently get used.\n\nSo as far as you provide context, this is pure distraction.\n\n",
