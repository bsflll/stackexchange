  "content": "I have several Solaris 2.6 era drivers I would like to reverse engineer.\n\nI have a Sparc disassembler which provides some info but it isn't maintained anymore so I think it may not give me all the information possible.\n\nThe drivers are for an Sbus graphics accelerator I own. Namely the ZX aka Leo one of the early 3d accelerators.\n\nSo what are some ways I can go about reverse engineering this driver? I can disassemble it but I am not sure what to make of the output. I also have Solaris of course so perhaps there are things I can do there as well.\n\nThe final goal is to have enough information to design a driver for an Operating System. There are drivers for NetBSD, although incomplete as the hardware documentation that does exist (isn't free to access) does not have the Window ID encoding as it is missing. Also, since the hardware uses an Sbus interface on a double wide mezzanine card, it would be impractical to use it on anything but a SparcStation or early UltraSparc machine.\n\n",

In this case, the programmers very thoughtfully left intact all the symbols and debug output. This should help you in your work :)\n\nDepending on situation, you may skip straight to the helpfully-named functions like leo_blit_sync_start or leo_init_ramdac. I personally prefer the first way, top-down, but to each his own.\n\nEDIT: one rather simple thing you can do is to patch the leo_debug variable at the start of .data section to 5 or so. That should produce a lot of debug output about the operations the driver is performing.\n\n",
