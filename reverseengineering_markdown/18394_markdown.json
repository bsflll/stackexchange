      "content": "eax + 0x1c is a pointer to bytes, and the value of the byte at that address is put into the register eax where the byte value is “zero-extended” (hence the movzx), so that e.g. a byte 0xdf would become a dword 0x000000df, so not sign-extended. So in C: eax = (unsigned int) b[0x1c], where unsigned char *b is the pointer stored in var_4, say. \n\n",
