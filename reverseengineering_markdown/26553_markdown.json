  "content": "I have found a stack buffer overflow.\n\nCurrently, this is the situation:\n\nI am able to override the return address and jump to PLT sections.\n\nMy problem is that I can only copy data until the return address because of the null byte, therefore I can not jump to my shellcode in the stack. The binary starts in 0x00090000, so it is a problem to perform ROP gadget, since I can copy only one address until the return address.\n\nAlso, my binary contains a call to system that I can jump to, but in this case I need to put the address of the string argument in R0, and this is not possible due to the ASLR. I am also able to override 4 registers.\n\nDoes anyone have an idea how to bypass the ASLR here without leaking an address? Current architecture: ARM.\n\n",

      "content": "Well if you are not able to leak any of the addresses you cannot really use ROP, but because ARM is little-endian, you can actually override the last few bytes of the return-address. You end up with a relative jump in the binary. Unfortunately you can only perform one jump.\n\n```\nReturn Address before:                     0x1122334455667788\nReturn Address overridden:                 0x112233445566????\nReturn Address overridden (case string):   0x11223344556600??\n\n```\nAs you described your problem the bufferoverflow is triggered by a string that is NULL-terminated, so that lowers the possible jump-locations but maybe you are lucky and find a good location. like\n\n```\ncall rax   (there surely is an equivalent instruction on ARM, but idk)\n\n```\nMaybe there are references to the shellcode on the stack or in some registers an you can perform a indirect branch to that pointer and execute the shellcode on the stack.\n\n",

I hope you find at least one of these useful.\n\nNote that for a more general answer, certain primitives can be used to gain code execution without bypassing ASLR although that really depends in the scenario (and you usually have to be extremely lucky).\n\n",
