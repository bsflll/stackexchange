  "content": "I'm writing a plugin which is available at all times (PLUGIN_FIX flag).\nHowever, I also need to be notified when a database is created or opened, as if I would handle the moment when init() is called on plugins without the PLUGIN_FIX flag.\n\nI looked into the IDA 7.0 SDK, but I only found idb_event::closebase, and I need the exact opposite. idb_event::savebase also doesn't really match.\n\nI logged all events in the SDK ever raised by IDA (causing IDA to run slower than my grandma â˜º), and only dug out idb_event::kernel_config_loaded which happens around the moment I want to catch. However, it also triggers at other times (like when simply clicking the \"Open\" button), so it's not a match too.\n\nAm I missing something here? Such an event seems quite important to me, so I'm a bit surprised there's nothing \"obvious\" for it.\n\n",
