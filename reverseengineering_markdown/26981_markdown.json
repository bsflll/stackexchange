      "text": "Most likely the program simply checks the list of running processes ans identifies Charles by the name of it's executable. Alternatively the program may check the proxy configuration and if it refers to a proxy on localhost it terminates itself. Third option would be to connect to the proxy and execute certain functions that allows to identify the proxy (e.g. error messages).",
