  "content": "Host and target are both Windows 7 x64.\nThe session goes well, but sometimes after 15-20 minutes the target freezes (like a break point was hit), but WinDbg reports that the debuggee is running and it can not take commands. Also, when I attempt to break into the target (ctrl + break)  I am told that I can't communicate with the target:\n\nIf I am quick to catch the moment, the first errors are different: Win32 error 0n23 and Win32 error 0n121. I looked around for this error, but I could not find something related to WinDbg.\n\nThe only way I can resume my session is to shut down the target by pressing it's power button.\n\nAt first I thought this has something to do with the target entering stand by, but I modified the power options so it should never enter in a sleep state and I started to actively use it. \n\nI thought this was my driver's fault (although it just iterates through some LIST_ENTRYs and displays some addresses with DbgPrint) so I restarted the target and never loaded my driver. \n\nI noticed that right before this happens the target display goes black for a moment. Any place where I should start looking?\n\n",
