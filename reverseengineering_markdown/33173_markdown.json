  "content": "I'm currently reverse-engineering a game, and I need useful register notations after function args renaming. Like that:\n\n```\nlea rsi, [var_10h]                    ; const char *s                 <-- I NEED THIS\nmov edx, 4                            ; std::size_t count             <-- I NEED THIS\nmov rdi, r12                          ; file_compressorst& fc_obj     <-- I NEED THIS\ncall sym file_compressorst::write_file(void*, long) ; file_compressorst::write_file_2\n\n```\nUnfortunately, I can achieve this only executing aaaa two times: before args renaming and after. And even in that case:\n\nI found out that aaaa command is actually a macro for:\n\n```\naa\naf@@@i\naf@ entry0\naf@@@s\nafva@@@F\naac\naar\navrr\naf @@ method.*\nafva@@@F\naaft\naanr\n/azs\naap\ne anal.types.constraint = true\n\n```\nI tried every command listed above separately in case it helps to get the desired result. But none of that worked. And docs are not as helpful as I want.\n\nWhat am I not seeing that I need to see?\nCould someone help me with that?\n\nVersions:\n\n```\nradare2 5.9.3 0 @ linux-x86-64\nbirth: git.5.9.3 2024-07-17__21:49:23\ncommit: 5.9.3\noptions: gpl release -O? cs:5 cl:2 make\n\n```\n",
