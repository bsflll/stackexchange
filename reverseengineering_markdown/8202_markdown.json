  "content": "CTB-Locker is a currently active ransomware that encrypts files to lock users out.\n\nHere are a few links about this malware:\n\nIs there a complete analysis about the encryption used by CTB-Locker, and some hints about possible cryptanalysis based on some weaknesses of this cryptographic scheme that can be used to recover the encrypted files.\n\nThe idea would be to produce a (free) tool similar to decryptcryptolocker.com, that can perform the decryption for users.\n\n",
