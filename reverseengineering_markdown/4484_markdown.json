  "content": "I am trying to alter a jnz in IDA but it wont allow me. It says:\n\n```\nCannot Reach Destination From current location\n\n```\nAny reason for this problem ?\n\nEdit:\nThe Program is Trying to CreateFileA.\nIt Then makes a cmp between eax and 0FFFFFFFFh( i am guessing it returns -1 if file doesnt exist ).\nMore Information jnz     short FileExist ; Jump if Not Zero (ZF=0) Changing that to jmp short FileExist\n\nEdit 2: \nSo I changed the hex code for the jmp and it works but when i do it by assembly it doesnt , still yet to find out why.\n\n",

There is another jnz (opcode 0x0f 0x85) that has a longer parameter, but if your current instruction is the 0x75, you have only 2 bytes, and you don't have space for the longer one. See, for example, mathemainzel.info/files/x86asmref.html#jne",
