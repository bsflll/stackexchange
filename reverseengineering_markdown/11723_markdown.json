  "content": "I'm writing a plugin for IDA PRO with IDAPython and I need to make a dump of the full disassembled code with offsets.\n\nI know I can export a html file and then parse it but I cannot call the GenerateFile function with the GENFLG_GENHTML flag from the script since that function only works from the gui \n\n```\nidc.GenerateFile(OFILE_LST, idc.GetInputFile()+'.html', 0, idc.BADADDR, GENFLG_GENHTML)\n\n```\n(when I run the plugin it gives me unhandled exception but if I write the same instruction from the IDA command line it works).\n\nI can extract the .asm file but it is not useful to me because it does not contain the offsets. Are there any solutions?\n\n",
