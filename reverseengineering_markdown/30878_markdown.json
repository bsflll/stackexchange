  "content": "I have a question about reversing a tutorial which shows how to reverse engineering shellcode. My question is simple:\n\nIn figure 4, we see at (7) TEX.ProcessEnvironmentBlock: is this a comment, or was IDA able to figure this out?\nWhen I reverse engineer the same payload, I see\n\n```\nedx, fs:[eax, 30h]\n\n```\nAnd at (8) I see:\n\n```\nedx, [edx, 0Ch]\n\n```\nis my IDA set up not correct? I heard about hard coded vtable values(?) which have an integer identifier. Not sure if I am mixing up things at the moment, but is that what we are looking at?\n\n",

To do the same yourself, place your cursor over the memory operand (i.e., [eax+30h]) and press T to bring up the list of possible structures to apply.\n\nTwo more notes. IDA knows about many structures, but you might have to do a few things before you're able to select them from the T window as described above. If you don't see the structure you want in that window:\n\n",
