  "content": "I have an Infineon Tricore ELF file. I have a HEX file that has been patched with minor changes and new code appended (e.g. the hex from the ELF was exported and then had changes made to it manually effectively via a hex editor).\n\nHow can I \"replace\" the hex within the ELF file but not lose all the other metadata in the elf file for processing?\n\nIs there any way to import a HEX into an existing ELF project and have it override the binary it has already extracted?\n\nI'm sure a tool could be written to do this, I'm just trying to save time and see if there is any existing functionality to do this. I am fairly inexperienced with Ghidra.\n\nThe goal is to get all the function names/variables annotated in the new modified HEX file.\n\n",
