  "content": "I want to find objects within a large C++ codebase that have a function that writes to 16 bytes offset off a pointer stored in an instance variable.\n\nSo for example given the code has:\n\n```\nMyClass object1 = new MyClass(pointer1);\nobject1.dereferenceAndWrite16BytesOffMyPointer(); // This would dereference the instance's pointer and write to 16 bytes past that pointer\n\n```\nI would want to detect the object1 and its targeted dereferenceAndWrite16BytesOffMyPointer function.\n\nI tried using manual inspection of mov and other instructions with 0x16 offsets via objdump but this is difficult and time consuming. Is there a better approach?\n\n",
