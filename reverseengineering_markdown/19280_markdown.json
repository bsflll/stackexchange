  "content": "I'm looking at the OLK files created by Outlook for Mac, and these appear to be the date fields, but I cannot figure out what kind of binary dates they are.\n\nThere are 2 values in one file (reversed from LE):\n\n```\nDATE1: 41 C0 A0 72 E7 F5 F6 A9\nDATE2: 41 C0 A0 72 E9 2B 82 BA\n\n```\nOne of these apparently decodes to Thu, 06 Sep 2018 00:34:23 -0400, but I can't figure out how. \n\nThese don't appear to be any of the Windows FileTime or OLE formats, and it isn't any of the Mac formats that I've seen before.\n\nHere's another example:\n\n```\n41 BB 67 A9 0A 00 00 00 --> 7/28/2015 12:11:54 UTC\n\n```\nAny help greatly appreciated.\n\n",
