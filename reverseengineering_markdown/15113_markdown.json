  "content": "I can't figure out how to see more than the [CPU - main thread, module  ]\nin the CPU window.\n\nSometimes when I jump to an address the title changes just to [CPU - main thread]\nand now I can see all of the memory in the program (including the PE header)\n\nFor comparison:\n[CPU - main thread]\n\n\n[CPU - main thread, module  ]\n\n\n\nHow do I switch between these two? When I press \"view threads\" it only shows me one executing thread, when I click it, it shows me the [CPU - main thread, module] which is not what I want.\n\nStrange.\n\n",
