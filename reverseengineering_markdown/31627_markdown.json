  "content": "I have some experience reverse engineering ELF files using tools like GDB, radare2, and Ghidra, but I am new to Windows debugging. There are quite a few different debuggers out there for Windows and family, and I was hoping that someone could give me a comparison of them, explaining the similarities and differences, which ones are outdated / obsolete, which are most popular, which are more well suited to certain tasks, etc.\n\nSpecifically, the Windows debuggers I have heard of and am most interested to learn more about are:\n\nIf there are any other debuggers that I didn't mention above that you feel should be part of the comparison, please feel free to include it in your answer.\n\n",

Basically x32dbg is an alternative to ollydbg that is still maintained and x64dbg is the 64-bit version of the same thing (which ollydbg doesn't have). For the tasks I need to perform, they are more than enough. In my opinion ollydbg should no longer be used because it is outdated for almost ten years - except e.g. used in an emulated win95/98.",
