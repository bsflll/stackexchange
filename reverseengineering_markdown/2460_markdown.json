  "content": "I am trying to modify RadASM so that Ctrl+W will close the tab, instead of Ctrl+F4, and also make it so that if you middle mouse click the tab, it will close. The context menu for a tab is just a copy of the \"Windows\" menu bar item. The problem is, I can not figure out which library or even function is used to create menu bars and its items. I can not find any relevant strings in OllyDBG, and I've tried making breakpoints for just about every call I thought it might be, but I can't get anything.\n\nCan anybody point me in the right direction? I couldn't locate the function in RadASM for determining which hotkeys/shortcuts do what either.\n\nI know all about code caves and injecting DLLs, so adding a function like the middle mouse click shouldn't be impossible; I just need to know where to start since I'm quite new to reverse engineering.\n\n",

      "content": "To change Ctrl+F4 to Ctrl+W you can use a resource editor such as Resource Hacker.\n\nOpen RadASM.exe in the resource editor, modify the accelerators, and save your changes. \n\nAssuming you're using Resource Hacker, you'd change\n\n```\nVK_F4, 47001, NOINVERT, CONTROL, VIRTKEY\n\n```\nto\n\n```\nVK_W, 47001, NOINVERT, CONTROL, VIRTKEY\n\n```\nThen press the Compile Script button, and save the changed file.\n\n\n\nAs for handling a middle-click on the tab, I used Spy++ to find the Window Procedure for the tab window. For RadASM 2.2.1.6 it's at virtual address 004061D4:\n\n\n\nThe function at that address is the DialogProc callback function for the SysTabControl32 window. You can patch that function in RadASM.exe to monitor for and act on the uMsg value WM_MBUTTONDOWN.\n\n",
