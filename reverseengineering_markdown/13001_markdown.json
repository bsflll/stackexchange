  "content": "I read in the IDA Pro Book that \n\nNow I was wondering what would happen if the header file is from a library version older than the one used by the target binary (or vice versa). The closest I could find was this SO answer:\n\nDoes anyone have experience with using .til files although the version does not exactly match? In the best case, I guess, the .til file should work fine. But what could happen in the worst case, i.e. if any of the above mentioned three things change?\n\nIs there any chance I can detect when the application of a slightly wrong .til file causes problems?\n\n",
