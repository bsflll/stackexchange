  "content": "Immunity Debugger offers a feature called PyPlugin. However there is not enough documentation on it. The help for immdbg says this :\n\nIn reality when the F4 key is pressed, nothing special happens. F4 is actually the shortcut to Run to selection. Further there is no PyPlugin icon located at the main toolbar. The PyPlugins directory under Immunity Debugger directory is also empty, so no examples to look.\n\nMy question is what is a PyPlugin ? Are there any ready made PyPlugins to refer as an example ?\n\nNote : I am only talking about PyPlugins, not PyCommands\n\n",
