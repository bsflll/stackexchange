      "content": "It depends on what do you exactly mean by opcode (not in all possible targets it starts with the start of the instruction, and it can be placed weirdly enough in it). Sometimes, however, simple binary searching (Search-->Sequence of bytes, or Alt B) is enough, and if you check \"Find all occurrences\" in the search  dialog IDA will open a window with, correspondingly, all occurrences. You also can try text search with the command mnemonics, such as searching for \"ADD\" in the main IDA window in same manner.\n\nIf this is not enough, you'll probably need to write IDC or IDAPython script that does one of the following things:\n\n",

Space is needed to deal with byte order in the search string.\n\n",
