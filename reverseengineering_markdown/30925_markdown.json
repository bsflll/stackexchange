  "content": "When decompiling an exe file, I have defined two structs struct A and struct B that are of the same structure. They appeared under different contexts, thus I assumed that they were different structs. However, as the contexts merge, I realize that these are in fact the same struct.\n\nNow I would like to get rid of struct B and replace all its occurance with struct A. Is it possible to do that without manually changing everything?\n\nI know that I can define struct B as containing just one struct A as its member, but this feels less optimal and creates unnecessary syntax in decompiled code.\n\n",
