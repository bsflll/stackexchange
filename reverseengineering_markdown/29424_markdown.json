  "content": "I am new to reverse engineering and want to analyze my own exe/dll files. I took a look at nasm and masm and so far I have the feeling that this is unnecessary for me to learn in detail because it really differs from what I see in the disassembled code (for example in IDA Free).\n\nWhat kind of assembly is disassembled code of an exe or DLL?\n\n",
