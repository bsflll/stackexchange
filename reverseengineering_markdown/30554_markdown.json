  "content": "The Android app I am looking at uses React Native with the Hermes JS Engine. This generates a index.android.bundle binary that contains Hermes JS bytecode.\n\nI was able to disassemble the binary file using hbctool and came across a function that I would like to learn more about e.g. getSecretData\n\n```\nCreateClosure           Reg8:1, Reg8:1, UInt16:9784\nPutById                 Reg8:2, Reg8:1, UInt8:3, UInt16:25656\n; Oper[3]: String(25656) 'getSecretData'\n\n```\nThis function doesn't appear in any of the *.so files placed in the APK lib folder as I checked with a simple nm command:\n\n```\nfor FILE in *.so; do nm -D $FILE | grep secret; done\n\n```\nUsing frida to list all the Java classes just lists the ones I already have access to via the classes.dex file:\n\n```\nJava.enumerateLoadedClasses({\n    onMatch: function(className) {\n        console.log(className);\n    },\n    onComplete: function() {}\n});\n\n```\nThere is talk of a \"show source\" directive that has been added to Hermes compiler so I am not sure if this is something that can be injected in.\n\nAny help on how I can explore further will be greatly appreciated.\n\n",
