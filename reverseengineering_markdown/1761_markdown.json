It will allow You to dump memory to file for further analysis\n\nSecond: then You'll need Volatility Toolkit to analyze dump file and extract info, binaries, DLLs and more from there. \n\nFor great sample: of using Volatility - have a look on Andre DiMino's blog post about Cridex\n\n",

      "content": "As others have mentioned the first thing you should do is dump the memory with MoonSols. This will allow you to do  memory analysis using Volatility later. When it comes to malware analysis I find IDA the most useful. In order for it be useful you will need a process dump and a way to rebuild the import table. If the malware can spread to other processes I would create a dummy process, dump it then rebuild the import table. If for example the malware injects into iexplore.exe, open up Ollydbg change the debugging options events to System Breakpoint, open up iexplore.exe, then search for memory of RWX (described here). Check the contents of the memory, if it contains your memory malware dump the process and then rebuild the import table. If you need to manually rebuild the import table you can use the following script. If the process does not spread you could attach to the process via a debugger. \n\nDisclaimer: I am the author of those links. \n\n",

      "content": "Moonsols is a great option, but I've noticed that there is no longer an option to purchase it and it makes me wonder if support has been stopped.\n\nIn my opinion, the best way to get started is with win32dd, win64dd, or mdd.  Another option that is more automated is DumpIt (created by the maker of Moonsols).  I prefer mdd for most tasks, but I have not tested it on 64bit systems.  \n\nDepending on what you're looking for, I tend to use file carvers like Scalpel to pick out everything that is recognizable.  Volatility is nice too, but personally I think learning how to recognize the file structures in a hex editor and carving them out will lead you to a better understanding of the dumped memory and what you're actually looking at.\n\nEDIT: \n\nThe newest version of scalpel is available in Backtrack r3, I just pulled it from there. As with the others, I have older copies that I use and they work just fine. DumpIt is still available at the MoonSols site and works great for 32 or 64bit, give it a shot: moonsols.com/2011/07/18/moonsols-dumpit-goes-mainstream \n\n",
