Then, they store each datum where it would have been.  The effect is the same, it's just fewer instructions.\n\n",

The disassembler tries to visualize the local variables and the stack frame in this way. The +20h is the size of the stack frame and the Format keyword means the offset of the Format parameter (-20h). Since it is a parameter, which will be passed to a function, it is placed at the top of the stack. It would be the same, if the function allocated only 18h stack frame and pushed the parameter values to the stack.\n\n\nBecause the stack pointer should not be modified in this way and this form is only 1 instruction and not 2.\n\n",
