  "content": "I'm trying to reverse engineer the mssql database behind an ERP.\n\nI was planning to export the database as a sql file before and after I do a modification in the ERP to be able to diff the files. But my files are huge. About 8 GB for the development environment, it would be a lot more for the production one.\n\nI was wondering if there's a better way. Maybe with snapshots or maybe I could enable a log with all SQL queries. Or maybe I could sniff the data on the network.\n\nI'm using Sql Server 2005.\n\n",

I can guess but I was thinking it could be easier if I could do something like a snapshot, then do an operation in the ERP (like creating an order for a customer) and then be able to know which data changed since the snapshot (a bit like when we use diff with source code).",
