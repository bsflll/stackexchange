  "content": "I am having some troubles with my learning of Assembly and reverse engineering. Specifically, I am learning about Global vs Local variables. For Global variables I have managed to get insights in assembly that they are stored in memory address. For Local variables I expect them to be stored on stack (theory), but my simple C code below, when being disassembled in Ghidra, does not show anything in main function.\n\nC CODE:\n\n```\nvoid main()\n{\n    int x = 1;\n    int y = 2;\n    x = x + y;\n}\n\n```\nGHIDRA OUTPUT:\n\n\n\nWhy can't I see anything in my Ghidra? It looks like an empty function to me, but clearly there should be some local variable declaration and then addition performed afterwards.\n\nI really apologize for opening threads here often, but this is the only source where I can get help for such things. On Reddit they do not allow posting questions and referred me here.\n\nEDIT - 25.09.2019:\n\nAs per suggestion I have added some code to my existing C Code to see if it will show up now in Assembly:\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    int x = 1;\n    int y = 2;\n\n    x = x + y;\n\n    printf(\"Rezultat = %d  \n\", x);\n\n}\n\n```\nFor this I had to set entry point back to CRT initialize, otherwise I could not use stdio Library. This is now the result of main function in Ghidra:\n\n\n\nNow I am able to see the PUSH instruction and the value 0x03. This is probably the resulting value of addition 1 + 2, but I again can't nowhere see where are the local variables initialized nor where the arithmetic operation is performed.\n\n",
