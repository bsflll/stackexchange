  "content": "Is there any command in OllyScript that can fetch me table shown in Memory Map window of OllyDbg. (Memory window comes up when you click on \"M\" icon.) It shows address, size, Owner, Section, Contains, Type, Access, Initial, and Mapped as. But I only need Address, Size, Owner, contains. So even if I can somehow get these details it would be fine. \n\n",
