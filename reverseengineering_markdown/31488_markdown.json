  "content": "Example: I have an old digital organizer, a Royal DS 2260.\n\nI want to find out what SoC it uses. Numbers marked on the PCB are just repeats of the model number or don't lead to anything, and I don't want to decap the IC as that would be destructive (and there might not even be any useful markings on the silicon anyway).\n\nAre there any good resources I'm missing? I know of all the datasheets, but sometimes that doesn't help.\n\nIdeally, I could use some of the \"clues\" I picked up by taking the thing apart: An SOC that has an RTC, raw LCD controller, external SRAM bus, etc.\n\nThe problem is that I have no idea of the state of embedded controllers for LCD electronics from the 90s to the early 2000s.\n\n",

      "content": "To identify the System-on-a-Chip (SoC) used in the Royal DS 2260 digital organizer, you can start by examining the device's printed circuit board (PCB) for any markings or labels that could indicate the manufacturer or model of the SoC. If no markings are present, you can also try cross-referencing the specifications and features of the device, such as an RTC, raw LCD controller, and external SRAM bus, with known SoCs of the time period.\n\nIf this information is not available on the PCB, you can try using various online resources such as datasheet databases, forums, and forums focused on reverse engineering and vintage electronics. You can also try reaching out to communities dedicated to vintage digital organizers or other relevant fields to see if they have any information on the Royal DS 2260.\n\nIn some cases, RE'ing the firmware or software of the device can also provide information about the SoC used, such as the processor architecture or peripheral interfaces. However, this can be a more advanced and time-consuming approach, and may require specialized knowledge and tools.\n\nI would recommend the following steps to identify the SOC used in your Royal DS 2260 digital organizer:\n\nyou can use the following resources:\n\n",
