  "content": "Some compilers will add useless bytes in functions or in between functions. In the below block of code at 0040117C we can see the \"align\" keyword that was inserted by IDA.   \n\n```\n.text:00401176                 mov     eax, [edx+4]\n.text:00401179                 call    eax\n.text:0040117B\n.text:0040117B locret_40117B:                          ; CODE XREF: sub_401160+Dj\n.text:0040117B                 retn\n.text:0040117B sub_401160      endp\n.text:0040117B\n.text:0040117B ; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n.text:0040117C                 align 10h\n.text:00401180\n.text:00401180 ; =============== S U B R O U T I N E =======================================\n.text:00401180\n.text:00401180 ; Attributes: bp-based frame\n.text:00401180\n.text:00401180 ; int __stdcall sub_401180(void *Src)\n\n```\nIf we were to view this in hex mode in this example we would see \"CC CC ..\". With other compilers we might see \"90 90 ..\". The obvious hint of what this is being used for is the \"align\" keyword. \n\nQuestion: how can I tell if a specific byte at an address is marked as align in IDAPython? Example code would be appreciated. \n\nI have found a couple of functions and data types such as FF_ALIGN and idaapi.is_align_insn(ea that looked positive but I have yet to figure out a working example or results that confirm yes or no. I would prefer to rely on IDA types or functions rather than use string parsing for the keyword \"align\". \n\n",
