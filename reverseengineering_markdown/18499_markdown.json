  "content": "I'm trying to set up kernel debugging on a physical hardware/desktop to test the new WinDbg Preview. Here's the steps:\n\nSo I'm wondering if I was doing something wrong, and if anyone else dealt with the same issue?\n\nPS. I'm just trying to avoid wasting 2+ hrs for such a reset in the future.\n\nEDIT: I was able to replace an HDD in this test PC with an SSD, then reinstall Windows 10 from scratch, and repeat the steps I described above. When I enabled kernel network debugging, that PC started booting visibly slower (about 2 minutes vs. original 15-20 sec.)\n\nAfter that as soon as I connected an Ethernet cable from that test PC to my Windows 10 laptop with WinDbg Preview waiting for connection, the booting process never completed. WinDbg Preview never connected to that remote PC either.\n\nAfter a while I disconnected the Ethernet cable and forced the reboot by holding down the power button. This time the boot process froze up after about 2-3 minutes of seeing the spinning dots. Here's the exact screen:\n\n\n\nThen when I force-rebooted it again, it showed:\n\n\n\nthen:\n\n\n\nand eventually:\n\n\n\n(Luckily this time I created a restore point before doing the tests above. Restore points were off by default in Windows 10. So after clicking \"Advanced options\" I was able to restore from a restore point.)\n\nThe C:\\Windows\\System32\\LogFiles\\Srt\\SrtTrail.txt file mentioned in the screenshot above contains the following:\n\n```\nStartup Repair diagnosis and repair log\n---------------------------\nNumber of repair attempts: 1\n\nSession details\n---------------------------\nSystem Disk = \\Device\\Harddisk0\nWindows directory = C:\\Windows\nAutoChk Run = 0\nNumber of root causes = 1\n\nTest Performed: \n---------------------------\nName: Check for updates\nResult: Completed successfully.

Also, I typically turn off the graphical boot logo (sos yes) to see what gets loaded. I'd also recommend to enable /bootdebug - at least temporarily - until you figure out what's wrong (it's not strictly needed for ordinary kernel mode debugging, though).",

What I remember though is that I switched away from using COM port for kernel debugging because it makes the process slow af. That connection is also very unstable. Thus, if I can (sometimes it's impossible if you have to debug real hardware device) but if you don't have to, I always set it up in a VM via the new WinDbg Next and its \"Net\" connection type. The experience is so much better than the old school COM port.",

      "content": "You need to use the correct ethernet cable. If you are connecting target directly to your debugger host you need to use a cross over cable, not a regular ethernet cable. Alternately if you don't have a crossover a cable using a switch/hub is required to connect the devices. I'd check TCP/IP communication is working between devices prior to enabling debugging if possible.\n\nSimply you should check:\n\nIn addition on host debugger machine you will need to allow traffic through Windows firewall (or any other 3rd party firewalls installed)\n\n",
