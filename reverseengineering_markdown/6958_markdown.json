In general, during development stage you need to take into account 64 bit target, so that the appropriate APIs and types are used. In addition, there are some peculiarities that must be taken care of when targeting the above OSs. You need to consult MSDN for this. As to the question, you do not need to see the whole tree as wow64 layer is sufficient to understand what APIs are used. Take into account that you will not see APIs that are resolved during runtime.",

It's not offline method, and it doesn't show you any tree, but it has a great advantage that you can see what your application really tries to load and in what order.",
