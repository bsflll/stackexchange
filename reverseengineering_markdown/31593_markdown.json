  "content": "I am creating a digital forensic tool that gets all data of user from different platforms. I successfully have done extraction for Teams website but I am unable to do so for the desktop app. So far, I know that the cookies are stored in Local/Microsoft/Teams folder. The file has no extension although it is an SQLite3 database. It shows all the cookies but these are in encrypted form. Is there any way I can get the actual decrypted cookies?\n\nThe server is not encrypting instead the client desktop app is. The Microsoft API use plain cookies. And I can not use the encrypted ones in browser as that will not start session.\n\nI think they are encrypted because they are under the column \"encrypted value\".\n\n\n\nI have found a library that decrypts cookies stored by chrome and other browsers. I think we can decrypt the MS Teams cookies if we have the keys for it using the following code\n\n```\nimport browser_cookie3\n\nc = browser_cookie3.chrome(cookie_file=r\"C:\\Users\\Farhan Ahmed\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\MicrosoftTeams_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\LocalCache\\Microsoft\\MSTeams\\EBWebView\\Default\\Network\\Cookies\",\n                            key_file=\"Key file\")\n\nfor cookie in c:\n    print(cookie.name, end=\" \")\n    print(cookie.value)\n\n```\nThe code does not work for now and give some errors. I am checking why that is happening.\n\nI will appreciate if someone shares a better way of doing it.\n\n",

What makes you think that the client (and thus your tool) would have access to the key to decrypt the data - wouldn't this defeat the purpose of encryption in the first place?",
