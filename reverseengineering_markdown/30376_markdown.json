  "content": "Here is my problem:\n\nI am trying to access to a ssl pinned request sent by an action I am doing on an iPhone. The action I am making sends two requests:\n\nI can't find the process sending this second request. I tried:\n\n```\nBuilding URL request with URL: %@\nHeaders\n       User Agent: %@\n\n```\nso I can't see the details of the request, and still don't know from where it is sent.\n\nDoes someone knows what I could do in order to, at least, find the process sending my second \"background\" request ? Thanks a loooot\n\n",
