  "content": "Can anyone suggest a free and preferably open source software tool that can reconstruct / build / generate a control-flow graph from a set of x86 execution traces of the same program?\n\nI found an interesting paper on this topic. However, I could not find their implementation.\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks! \n\n",

      "content": "I am sorry for this self-advertisement, but I am developing a tool here. My final goal is to recover the original control flow graph of virtualized binaries. But at a step of this, for visualization purpose, I have implemented a functionality to reconstruct the CFG of binaries from traces. The main implementation of this reconstrution is in the file src/lib/cap/graph.cpp, it has no problem in performance in constructing the basic block graph from traces of about 100K instructions (I have tested on obfuscated binaries whose traces are about 300K instructions). You can see several pdf files in the folders demo and results, I have generated them from execution traces.\n\nIf you are interested in, I am more than happy to answer any further question.\n\n",

The protobuf is used for the communication between the instrumentation tool (Pin) and the concolic execution engine, but the engine is not fully published because it is not flexible enough and its performance is quite bad now. So I have changed the CMake file so that it can be built without protobuf, which errors do you get in building this code?",
