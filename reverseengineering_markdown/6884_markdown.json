  "content": "So I want to track when a certain file is loaded into an Win32 app. That's way I put a break-point on 'CreateFile' which compares the first parameter with the target file name, but the problem is that it is a case-sensitive comparison. How to do it non-sensitive?\n\nHere is the break-point condition on 'CreateFileA':\n\n```\nGetString(DbgDword(esp + 0x4), -1, ASCSTR_C)  == \"D:\\\\3K-MILLENNIUM\\\\3K-MILLENNIUM\\\\USER_LAW.TXT\"\n\n```\nAny ideas?\n\n",
