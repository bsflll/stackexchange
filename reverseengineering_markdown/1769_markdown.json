  "content": "While we all know what fun reverse engineering of code can be, I am wondering what legitimate industries, besides the anti-X industry, reverse engineer code? While this may sometimes be needed in many technical roles, I am speaking more of jobs where this is a primary responsibility. I suspect there are very few jobs where reverse engineering is a necessary skill, or few that would be admitted to, but don't know that for certain. Yes, it is of course always a complementary skill!\n\n",

I can't tell you how many times IDA has saved my ass during development, where I have some linker error that is driving me insane, and I just open the offending objects in the disassembler and all becomes clear.  Similarly for things that I would swear are \"compiler errors\" which turn out to be my fault.  And that experience also helps me debug my software much better.",

I remember having to reverse other packers when PECompact was in development over a decade ago, as I couldn't figure out how in the world they packed so tight.

I know this isn't the biggest thing reversing is used for, but making software that is compatible with proprietary file formats or protocols is very important, fairly common, and explicitly protected by law in some countries.\n\nOften, a developer can use reversing as a \"complementary skill\", but in many cases it would make sense for this to be someone's job. For example, when using clean-room techniques, or if the file format or protocol is excessively complex.\n\n",
