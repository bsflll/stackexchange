  "content": "During RCE of a piece of code, I have found this:\n\n```\n    loc_40244F:\n    mov eax, [ebx+20h]\n    add ebx, 14h\n    test eax, eax\n    jnz loc_402397\n\n```\nWhat I know is that ebx points to the import directory structure of the considered PE file.\n\nBut when I look at it, I see the following:\n\n```\n     Import Directory\n     +0 DWORD   OriginalFirstThunk; \n      4 DWORD   TimeDateStamp;\n      8 DWORD   ForwarderChain; \n      c DWORD   Name;\n     10 DWORD   FirstThunk;\n\n```\nSo, to which location is the [ebx+20h] expression pointing ?\nI hope somebody can help me.\n\nbest regards,\n\n",
