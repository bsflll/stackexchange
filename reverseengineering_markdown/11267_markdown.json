      "content": "The IAT is the Import Address Table. It's an an array of pointers to statically-imported API function addresses. The IAT entries gets populated at runtime.\n\nThe format of the IAT is typically as follows, with all functions from a particular DLL grouped together, with a null-pointer separating each DLL's list of function addresses:\n\n<pointer to DLL #1's function A>, <pointer to DLL #1's function B>, <pointer to DLL #1's function C>, 0x00000000, <pointer to DLL #2's function D>, <pointer to DLL #2's function E>, ..., 0x00000000\n\nNote that this format isn't required, but it's the most common format.\n\nI highlighted each IAT function below (with mspaint), with a different color for each DLL grouping. At virtual address 0x0049380C we see the function addresses 0x735FE9D0, 0x73654AC0, etc. You can tell that they're likely from the same DLL because:\n\n\n\nThe DWORD at 0x00493850 (after the null-pointer at 0x0049384C) is 0x1000176E, so you can look up that address in your debugger and see if there's DLL code loaded at that address. If not, 0x0049384C would mark the end of the IAT. If so, 0x00493854 would mark the end of the IAT since the data at 0x00493858 is the beginning of an ASCII string and clearly not a valid function pointer.\n\n",
