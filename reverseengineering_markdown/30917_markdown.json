  "content": "I am trying to reverse a portion of a game, that game loads a DLL file called \"ddraw.dll\".\nMost of the DLL file functions don't appear by their names but appear by their addresses\n\nfor example:\n\n```\n; The function address '67415A6A' but no name\nddraw.67415A6A\n\n```\nSo, I have known that can download the PDB symbols file for the \"ddraw.dll\" file to make all their functions appear by their names instead of their addresses.\nAnd that is what I did, I have downloaded the symbols for \"ddraw.dll\" using the command symdownload/downloadsym and download it to the path \"x64dbg\\x32\\symbols\", then I reopen the debugger again to see what happened but nothing happened, all functions still appear by their addresses.\nI tried to use symload/loadsym command to load \"ddraw.dll\" symbols but it always gives me \"invalid module\" although, I have written the command correctly symload path\\game.exe, path\\symbols\\ddraw.pdb,0 or 1.\n\nHow do I solve that problem?\n\n",
