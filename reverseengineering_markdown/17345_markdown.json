      "content": "Compiling your source code file like this also involves a call to the linker - remember that the \"gcc\" program is only the compiler front end program, which calls the preprocessor, compiler passes, assembler, and linker as required.\n\nYou can obtain the object file \"app.o\" using the \"-c\" compiler option like this:\n\n```\ngcc -nostdlib -c app.c -o app.o\n\n```\nUsing \"-c\", the compiler is instructed to stop after generating the object file, so that the linker is not invoked. To generate an executable ELF file, you then have to invoke the linker separately\n(app.o is the default output file name, so the \"-o app.o\" parameter can be omitted).\n\n",
