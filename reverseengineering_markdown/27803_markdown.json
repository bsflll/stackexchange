  "content": "While RE an embedded device I ran into a problem - I need to patch a check in the kernel which has no sources available. Unpacking the kernel and binary-patching went smoothly. However I cannot get over repacking the vmlinux into zImage/bzImage.\n\nI extracted the kernel using extract-vmlinux (modified to show offset here):\n\n```\n$ ../../extract-vmlinux zImage > vmlinux\nFound valid magic - decompressed using unlzma (tail -c+15967 \"zImage\" | unlzma)\nHeader at: head -c15966\nCompressed at: tail -c+15967\n\n$ binwalk zImage\n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n15966         0x3E5E          LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 67108864 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n\n```\nNext, without any modifications, I wanted to recompress it back and keep the header, as to my knowledge it has the decompression code:\n\n```\n$ cat <(head -c15966 zImage) <(lzma -z < vmlinux) > zImage-repacked\n$ ls -l\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 3032080 Jun  5 22:32 zImage\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 3024065 Jun  6 00:04 zImage-repacked\n\n$ binwalk zImage-repacked\n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n15966         0x3E5E          LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: -1 bytes\n\n```\nThe image came ~8k short, which didn't worry me (as my compression might have been more aggressive). However the image is now broken:\n\n```\n$ ../../extract-vmlinux zImage-repacked > /dev/null\nextract-vmlinux: Cannot find vmlinux.\n\n```\nI also found that the extract-linux script pipes everything after the offset to unlzma but there's 9441 bytes of something which unlzma ignores. When removed I'm getting a pure archive which matches the size saved just after it:\n\n```\n$ tail -c+15967 zImage | head -c-9441 | unlzma > /dev/null ; echo $?\n0\n$ tail -c+15967 zImage | head -c-9441 | unlzma | wc --bytes\n13871216\n$ tail -c+15967 zImage | head -c-9437 | tail -c4 | od -i --endian=little\n0000000    13871216\n0000004\n\n```\nI know the classical wisdom is \"you have to recompile\" but we're on RE - this is not possible ;)\nHow can I approach re-packing of the modified vmlinux back to LZMA-zImage?\n\n",
