I suggest you to read all the links provided and update the question if you still have doubts.\n\nFrom Wikipedia\n\nSince it is a software running on some sort of hardware, it can be obtained in various ways: by either dumping the memory of the device or by downloading it from the vendor's site.\n\nOnce you have the binary file and you identify the architechture it is runs on you can use a disassembler to translate opcodes to assembly (which is a human readable rappresentation of machine language). Decompilers can be used to ease the process\n\nIn order to edit these images you just need an hexadecimal editor: programs such as IDA and radare2 can accomplish such task.\n\nIf you want to run the said firmware, you need an environment that supports the architechture on which it was running (an emulator or a virtual machine).\n\n",

Note windows drivers are rather intricate, there are three main types of drivers, bus driver, filter driver, function driver, and others that I forget at the moment. The company is rather free to implement the driver architecture how they feel so long as it correctly sockets the windows supplied driver if that is how it works. There could be several drivers and one of them actually implements the feature you wish to change. If that feature actually interacts with hardware you will need to know the hardware as well.",
