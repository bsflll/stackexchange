      "content": "I am not sure if I understood correctly, but if you mean calling the exported function from the binary which just got injected the DLL, then do this:\n\n```\nauto hLib = GetModuleHandleA(\"your_library.dll\");\nauto fn = GetProcAddress(hLib, \"exported_function_name\");\n\n// supposing your function is declared as:\n// extern \"C\" __declspec(dllexport) int __cdecl fn() { ... }\n((int(__cdecl*)(void)) fn)();\n\n```\nYou might have to check which calling convention your compiler used for the function, though (if you didn't specify any).\n\nEdit: since you want to call the function from the injector rather than the injected binary, you should do something like this:\n\nAlso, be aware that games usually have anti-cheat systems, and they detect this kind of behaviour (it's quite common).\n\nBut apart from all of this: you could inject your DLL with VirtualAllocEx -> WriteProcessMemory -> LoadLibrary | CreateRemoteThread, and have Windows call your DLL's DllMain instead of you doing it yourself.\n\n",

Use VirtualAllocEx to allocate memory in the remote process, WriteProcessMemory to write the DLL filename to that buffer, then CreateRemoteThread with the address of the LoadLibrary function, and passing the address of the buffer.  Windows will create a thread which loads the DLL and runs your code.",
