  "content": "I have recently started using plugins for OllyDbg 1.10. Thanks to this site, I have an idea of the capabilities of the plugins for OllyDbg. \n\nAs I have only a very basic idea of how plugins work, I was wondering, do plugins interfere with each other? For example, if I use multiple plugins that deals with the same anti-debugging techniques, is it possible that they may conflict with each other and mess with what I would ideally want, which is to hide my debugger? Thanks!\n\n",

Generally you should only keep plugins that you use. \n\nThe best anti-debugging plugins for Ollydbg as of now are ScyllaHide for user-mode and TitanHide for kernel mode. Both of them are open source and well maintained.\n\n",
