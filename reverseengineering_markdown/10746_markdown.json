Indeed, I have got a copy of intel's Architecture manual but it does not exactly answer my question. It even explains the instructions in the strict way.

      "content": "Lets go over the instruction piece by piece:\n\nmovqword ptr ds:[rax+18],r8\n\nThis is the opcode part of the instruction. It describes the base operation the CPU is required to perform. mov is an opcode instructing a CPU to copy data from the second operand to the first operand. The first operand on the mov instruction is a target operand, and the second is the source.\n\nmovqword ptrds:[rax+18],r8\n\nThis second operand is the most complex part of this instruction, so I've split it to several pieces and I'll go over each individually.\n\nThis part is the first part of the first operand. Operands are objects such as addresses or registers on which operations are performed. qword indicates this operand describes an address of quad-word size, in Intel's x86 family of processors this means 8 bytes (a word is 2 bytes long). ptr indicates the value of the operand should be treated as an address.\n\nIn our case, this means assigning the value in the second operand to the 8 bytes starting at the address pointed to by the remaining of the first operand (ds:[rax+18]).\n\nmov qword ptrds:[rax+18],r8\n\nThe colon is optional, and if present it follows the segment register to use when accessing data addresses. This is called memory segmentation. Segment registers were first created to allow accessing memory addresses wider than the size of registers in 16bit processors and became redundant in 32 and 64-bit processors outside of real-mode, which is the mode most CPUs start at before they're switched to protected-mode (32bit) or long-mode (64bit).\n\nExcept for specific-meaning special segment registers (such as fs in 32bit windows, and gs in Linux and 64-bit windows), this can be widely ignored if not operating in 16bit modes.\n\nmov qword ptr ds:[rax+18],r8\n\nThe brackets are coupled with the previously discussed ptr keyword and are used to highlight the address is being dereferenced before the operation is performed. All values inside the brackets should be added together to calculate the target address.\n\nIn our case, this means rax + 18. This means rax probably points to a structure, a class, an array or some other complex memory object, and we're accessing the member at offset 18 of that memory structure. As there isn't any prefix or postfix indicating the number's base, I'll assume it's in hex.\n\nThis means rax could be an array of qwords, and this instruction is accessing the forth (index 3) element of that array (since 18h=24=8*3).\n\nrax could be a structure of four qwords, such as a three-dimensional point in time defined as the following:\n\n```\nstruct _point\n{\n    long x;\n    long y;\n    long z;\n    long t;\n};\n\n```\nprobably accessing the t member.\n\nIt is important to note that for certain optimization reasons (into which I won't dive here), rax is not necessarily pointing the beginning of a structure, and could be already pointing to an offset within the structure, adding 18 to that offset instead.\n\nmov qword ptr ds:[rax+18],r8\n\nCommas are simply operand separators, indicating the first operand has ended and the second is about to begin.\n\nmov qword ptr ds:[rax+18],r8\n\nCompared to the first operand, the second one is a piece of cake. This simply means the value currently in register r8 is the source value, and what will be assigned to the address rax+18.\n\n",
