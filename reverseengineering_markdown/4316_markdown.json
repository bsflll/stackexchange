(e.g. I'd like to know the object size or virtual function table size).\n\nI am particularly interested in GNU C++ (G++) from Android NDK for ARM.\n\n",

You can also inspect the rtti.h file from GCC.\n\nFor a trimmed-down, data-only representation of these classes, check my Recon 2012 presentation (start at slide 27 or so).\n\n",

(char**)ptypeinfo[2] : 0) {\n        //DLOG(\"tinfo: %p\",ptypeinfo);\n        //DLOG(\"class: _Z%s   meta: _Z%s\",ptypeinfo[1], ((char***)ptypeinfo[0])[-1][1]);\n        //DLOG(\"meta : _Z%s\",((char***)ptypeinfo[0])[-1][1]);\n        classchain = strrealloccat(strrealloccat(classchain, ptypeinfo[1]), \"  _Z\");\n    }\n    DLOG(\"inheritance chain: %s\",classchain);\n    free(classchain);\n\n```\nwhere strrealloccat() is defined as:\n\n```\nchar* strrealloccat(char* buffer0, char *addition)\n{\n    char* buffer = realloc(buffer0, (buffer0 ? strlen(buffer0) : 0) + strlen(addition) + sizeof(char));\n    if (!buffer) {\n    return buffer;\n    }\n    if(!buffer0) {\n    *buffer = 0;\n    }\n    return strcat(buffer, addition);\n}\n\n```\n_Z4hopeN4this5helpsE\n\n",
