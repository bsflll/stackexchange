  "content": "I have a shared object (from a Debian package) and its debug library (from the associated debug package). If I disassemble the SO with objdump -d I only see (what I believe to be) the exported symbols. I would like to be able to see also the other symbols that are described in the debug library. Is there any way to do that?\n\n(in a sense I would like to \"merge back\" the data that was stripped during compilation)\n\n",
