  "content": "I want to run twitter app behind a proxy so i decompiled the app \nto read the source code.I have noticed that it is using this code \n\nto pin the certificate.\nI patched the code to ignore pinning.But it is still not working.\nSo I run it in androbug debugger to see the source of the problem.After some digging around I have noticed that the runtime library libcore.net.http calls another trust manger than the one I have modified. And this library is not in the apk file. So what are my options now ?\n\n",
