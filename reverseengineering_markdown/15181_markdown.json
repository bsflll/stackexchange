  "content": "I am struggling with a stripped binary, and I would like to visualize the main() function with the VVV command (ascii-art CFG representation).\n\nUsually, the steps are the following:\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, my crackme is stripped (including the main() function). I can see the address of the main() function thanks to the first argument of the __libc_start_main() function. But, I always end-up with the following error message:\n\n```\n      Not in a function. Type 'df' to define it here\n\n--press any key--\n\n```\nHow can I work around this problem. For example, I first tried to add my own symbols on the binary to mark the start of the main() function, but I miserably failed... Any idea ?\n\nEDIT\n\nHere is my attempt to add a flag to the binary:\n\n```\n#> r2 ./ch23.bin \n[0x000083b8]> aaa\n[x] Analyze all flags starting with sym. and entry0 (aa)\n[ ] \n[aav: using from to 0x8000 0x8e64\nUsing vmin 0x8000 and vmax 0x10880\naav: using from to 0x8000 0x8e64\nUsing vmin 0x8000 and vmax 0x10880\n[x] Analyze len bytes of instructions for references (aar)\n[x] Analyze function calls (aac)\n[ ] [*] Use -AA or aaaa to perform additional experimental analysis.\n[x] Constructing a function name for fcn.* and sym.func.* functions (aan))\n[0x000083b8]> pdf\n            ;-- section_end..plt:\n            ;-- section..text:\n/ (fcn) entry0 44\n|   entry0 ();\n|           ; UNKNOWN XREF from 0x00008018 (unk)\n|           ; UNKNOWN XREF from 0x00008c18 (unk)\n|           0x000083b8      00b0a0e3       mov fp, 0                   ; [14] va=0x000083b8 pa=0x000003b8 sz=800 vsz=800 rwx=--r-x .text\n|           0x000083bc      00e0a0e3       mov lr, 0\n|           0x000083c0      04109de4       pop {r1}\n|           0x000083c4      0d20a0e1       mov r2, sp\n|           0x000083c8      04202de5       str r2, [sp, -4]!\n|           0x000083cc      04002de5       str r0, [sp, -4]!\n|           0x000083d0      10c09fe5       ldr ip, [0x000083e8]        ; [0x83e8:4]=0x8664\n|           0x000083d4      04c02de5       str ip, [sp, -4]!\n|           0x000083d8      0c009fe5       ldr r0, [0x000083ec]        ; [0x83ec:4]=0x8470\n|           0x000083dc      0c309fe5       ldr r3, [0x000083f0]        ; [0x83f0:4]=0x8668\n\\           0x000083e0      e5ffffeb       bl sym.imp.__libc_start_main; int __libc_start_main(func main, int argc, char **ubp_av, func init, func fini, func rtld_fini, void *stack_end);\n[0x000083b8]> f main @ 0x8470\n[0x000083b8]> s main\n[0x00008470]> VVV\n... miserable fail ...\n\n```\n",
