  "content": "I have IDA Pro 6.6, and I'm trying to trace read/write access to some address. \n\nAccording to the documentation it is possible, and there are \"nice\" menu options under Debugger->Tracing menu: \"Add write trace\", \"Add read/write trace\", \"Add execution trace\". \n\nI would be happy to try these, but no matter what I've tried all the mentioned menu options are disabled (grayed out). What do I need to do in order to be able to use these options?\n\n",
