  "content": "Basically I just would like to modify the following code: https://github.com/SideChannelMarvels/Tracer/tree/master/TracerPIN\n(based on Intel PIN) in order to be able to modify the content of some registers at a given PC.\nFor this I just inserted the following callback at line 418 of Tracer.cpp, when the PC is 0x808104f (as a simple test):\n\n```\nif (ceip == 0x808104f) {  \n    string* dis = new string(INS_Disassemble(ins));  \n    INS_InsertPredicatedCall(ins, IPOINT_BEFORE, (AFUNPTR)changeReg,  \n        IARG_INST_PTR,  \n        IARG_CONTEXT,   \n        IARG_PTR, dis,   \n        IARG_UINT32, INS_Size(ins), IARG_END);  \n}\n\n```\nand finally here is my function changeReg():\n\n```\nVOID changeReg (ADDRINT ip, CONTEXT *ctxt, string *disass, INT32 size){  \n    UINT32 edx_new_value = 0x00000ccc;  \n    UINT32 edx_value;  \n    //set the registers  \n    PIN_SetContextReg(ctxt, REG_EDX, edx_new_value);  \n    edx_value = PIN_GetContextReg(ctxt, REG_EDX);  \n    printf(\"EDX = %08x   \n\", edx_value);  \n}\n\n```\nand when I trace my program with my modified TracerPIN:\n\n```\nroot@VirtualBox:/media/shared/E/tracerPin/test/x86#Tracer -o test_modif_register.txt -- ./testapp\n[*] Trace file test_modif_register.txt opened for writing...\nEDX = 00000ccc\nroot@VirtualBox:/media/shared/E/tracerPin/test/x86#\n\n```\nAccording to the printf(), it looks like my register has been correctly modified to 0xccc, however when I checked the .txt trace, the register EDX is still left unmodified (0x0000137), and my modification is never taken into account in the trace... any idea ?:  \n\n```\n[I]      1016       0x8081049    and edx, 0x1fff                        81 e2 ff 1f 00 00\n[I]      1017       0x808104f    mov dword ptr [0x8086ae4], 0x4f0       c7 05 e4 6a 08 08 f0 04 00 00\n[W]      1017       0x808104f    0x8086ae4 size= 4 value=        0x000004f0  \n[I]      1018       0x8081059    mov dword ptr [0x8086ac0], edx         89 15 c0 6a 08 08\n[W]      1018       0x8081059    0x8086ac0 size= 4 value=        0x00000137  \n[I]      1019       0x808105f    mov dword ptr [0x8086db0], ecx         89 0d b0 6d 08 08\n[W]      1019       0x808105f    0x8086db0 size= 4 value=        0xa5879af8\n[I]      1020       0x8081065    lea ecx, ptr [edi-0x4]                 8d 4f fc\n\n```\n",
