  "content": "I am searching for an algorithm and/or snippet of code that provides a one-pass algorithm over a steady datastream that can detect a valid sequence of bytecode or opcode. \n\nThere are no PE32, ELF, or Mach0 header information available to assist; so that means, none of the following entry-point, offset, segment, nor section information are on hand. \n\nI'd like to think that ARM is harder than Intel.\n\nGoogle isn't turning up much, so I figured that I must be using wrong terminology here.\n\n",

      "content": "First of all, ARM is much easier than Intel because it has fixed instruction length, (if I remember right) requires instructions to be aligned by 2 or 4 and has limited capabilities for arbitrary code self-modification because of its Harvard architecture.\n\nI'd like to say that there is no such an algorithm, and in general case such an algorithm is impossible, for example because of possible self-modification of the code and using exceptions and traps in a regular code flow, so the only general way to achieve the desired result is an emulation.\n\nThe rest of the answer depends on more exact definition of required algorithm, target architecture and validity of the sequence.\n\n",

Unless you know something else about the data stream, such as it is base 64 encoded, etc. \n\nOne thing you could do is see if there is an excessive amount of NOP bytes (0x90, x86) but if one really wanted to, they could find ways to do the equivalent of NOP with different op codes. \n\n",
