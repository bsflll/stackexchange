I get an error when constructing the DWARFProgram.\n\nThe constructor prints the following and then throws a NullPointerException:\n\n```\nElf symbol table section .dynsym linked to string table section .dynstr\nElf symbol table section .symtab linked to string table section .strtab\nElf relocation table section .rel.dyn linked to symbol table section .dynsym affecting PT_LOAD\nReading DWARF debug string table\n\n```\nMy code (using Jython):\n\n```\nmonitor = ConsoleTaskMonitor()\nprogram = ghidraProject.openProgram('/', programName, False)\nbinfile = File(programDir + programName)\noptions = DWARFImportOptions()\nsectionProvider = ElfSectionProvider(binfile)\ndwarfProg = DWARFProgram(program, options, monitor, sectionProvider)\n\n```\nScreenshot of console:\n\n\n",
