  "content": "Given a disassembly line in IDA Pro such as\n\n```\n.text:0040255B      call    sub_407C10\n\n```\nAm I right to assume that analyzing the belonging address using\n\n```\nidautils.XrefsFrom(0x0040255B)\n\n```\nalways returns an xref of type 'Code_Far_Call' (xref.type 16) or 'Code_Near_Call' (xref.type 17)\nand not\nan xref of type \"Code_Near_Jump\" or \"Code_Far_Jump\"?\n\nIn other words, can function call destination addresses always be identified by checking if the xref.type is of type 16 or 17 and then taking the value in xref.to?\n\nOf course in addition to the Call/Jump xref, the above statement always returns an xref of type 21 (the ordinary control flow).\n\nA list of possible xref types can be found here: https://code.google.com/p/idapython/source/browse/trunk/python/idautils.py\n\nWhat is the difference between a Code_Far_Call xref and a Code_Near_Call xref anyway?\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n",

      "content": "This depends a bit on your compiler, Actually, as you seem to be using a 32 bit OS, i wouldn't expect any far calls.\n\nNear calls and Far calls are relicts from 16-bit area, where a call within the same 64 kbyte segment, that only changes IP, but not CS, was named a near call, and a call to anywhere in the address space, that changes CS and IP, was named a far call. Correspondingly, there were two different instructions ret and retf to return from the subroutine, that would pop just IP, or CS and IP from the stack.\n\nWith the introduction of protected mode, and 32 bit segments, management of segment registers became the responsibility of the operating system, and user mode programs stopped fiddling with them. So you shouldn't see any far calls, or retf instructions, anymore - unless you're disassembling the parts of the operating system that handle task switching, possibly.\n\nYou might see the occasional jump to a function, however (ref type 19), depending on your compiler. If the compiler optimizes tail recursion, it will replace the last \"call self / ret\" instruction with a \"jmp self\" instruction, and if parameter types match, it might replace a \"call someotherfunction / ret\" with \"jmp someotherfunction\" as well. I've seen this a lot in ARM code, and 64 bit Intel code, but can't remember seeing it in 32 bit compiled Intel code at the moment. However, i haven't worked with 32 bit Intel assembly much, recently, so there might be some newer compilers that do this without me noticing.\n\n",
