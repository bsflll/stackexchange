  "content": "Is it possible changing few bytes for converting an elf binary from PIE to No-PIE (ELF)?\nI know that in the header if e_type is:\n - 3 then the program is PIE\n - 2 then the program is No-PIE\n\nSo I tried to change that byte and in fact readelf -h shows me:\n\n```\nELF Header:\n  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \n  Class:                             ELF64\n  Data:                              2's complement, little endian\n  Version:                           1 (current)\n  OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V\n  ABI Version:                       0\n  Type:                              EXEC (Executable file)\n  Machine:                           Advanced Micro Devices X86-64\n  Version:                           0x1\n  Entry point address:               0x630\n  Start of program headers:          64 (bytes into file)\n  Start of section headers:          6576 (bytes into file)\n  Flags:                             0x0\n  Size of this header:               64 (bytes)\n  Size of program headers:           56 (bytes)\n  Number of program headers:         9\n  Size of section headers:           64 (bytes)\n  Number of section headers:         29\n  Section header string table index: 28\n\n```\nThen I changed the e_entry from 0x630 to 0x400630.\n\nreadelf -h output:\n\n```\nELF Header:\n  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \n  Class:                             ELF64\n  Data:                              2's complement, little endian\n  Version:                           1 (current)\n  OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V\n  ABI Version:                       0\n  Type:                              EXEC (Executable file)\n  Machine:                           Advanced Micro Devices X86-64\n  Version:                           0x1\n  Entry point address:               0x400630\n  Start of program headers:          64 (bytes into file)\n  Start of section headers:          6576 (bytes into file)\n  Flags:                             0x0\n  Size of this header:               64 (bytes)\n  Size of program headers:           56 (bytes)\n  Number of program headers:         9\n  Size of section headers:           64 (bytes)\n  Number of section headers:         29\n  Section header string table index: 28\n\n```\nHowever if I try to launch the program it crashes.\n\n```\n$ strace ./elf-patched.exe \nexecve(\"./elf-patched.exe\", [\"./elf-patched.exe\"], 0x7ffe0c2b88c0 /* 66 vars */) = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)\n+++ killed by SIGSEGV +++\n[1]    7239 segmentation fault (core dumped)  strace ./elf-patched.exe\n\n```\nWhat other bytes should I change (If it's possible with few modifications) ?\n\n",
