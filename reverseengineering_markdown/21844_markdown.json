  "content": "When I was reversing some well known Android chat applications (I can not disclose which specific ones, but all of them where owned by companies with 1 billion+ capital and have hundreds of millions of accounts), I saw an interesting feature in C++ code.\n\nThese applications read uninitialized data and sent it to their web service.\n\nIn pseudocode, they do the following job:\n\n```\nstatic constexpr const size_t uninitialized_data_size = 1024;\nauto uninitialized_data = malloc(uninitialized_data_size);\nHttpPost(\"http://my-url.com\", uninitialized_data, uninitialized_data_size);\n\n```\nOf course, we can think that it is just a bug... But when multiple huge companies do the same thing, I'm starting to think: why?\n\nDoes anyone have idea what information uninitialized data can supply to security team? Is it just repeated error made by accident, or they extract some useful information from uninitialized data that they send to their server on regular basis?\n\n",

At least on application startup, uninitialized data has more or less predictable values; as longer application runs, as more random data is here. However, it is question if malloc can return memory used by Java before that; I have no idea how does Java handles memory in low level. Most of code runs via Java, so Java memory is less predictable than C++ one in such application.",

      "content": "I have not 100% idea how do they use this information, but what I suspect from information supplied by other participants of this conversation and also information from Internet:\n\nLets imagine following code:\n\n```\nvoid MarkHeap()\n{\n    static const char *ones = \"11....1\"; // String that contains 1024 ones\n    auto some_data = malloc(1024);\n    memcpy(some_data, ones, 1024);\n    free(some_data);\n}\n\nsize_t CheckMarkHeap()\n{\n    auto some_data = malloc(100);\n    size_t ones_count = 0;\n    for(size_t i = 0; i < 100; ++i)\n        if(some_data[i] == '1')\n            ++ones_count;\n    free(some_data);\n    return ones_count;\n}\n\nMarkHeap();\nauto ones_count = CheckMarkHeap()\n\n```\nHere we can expect that very often ones_count will equal to 100! We can now use this strategy to check (with some probability) if CheckMarkHeap is called soon after MarkHeap.\n\nIn situation where CheckMarkHeap calculates any kind of security token, we can afraid that anyone will try to use our own shared library to bypass our protection; in case of Android, we can extract shared library from APK and try to interpret it with Android emulator or any embedded ARM emulation library like unicorn. If we implemented MarkHeap in another shared library that doesn't draw attacker attention and somehow call it before CheckMarkHeap, we have a good chance to detect that our security library is loaded from unusual context.\n\nOf course, we can not ban immediately for that, because any random events may affect ones_count. However, if ones_count is not 100 in more than 60% of calls, we can make any soft penalty to suspicious account (for example, ask for phone verification, SafetyNet verification, show CAPTCHA more often, send account to human moderation, etc).\n\n",

      "content": "The exact behavior would depend on the implementation details of the memory manager behind malloc(). But it is a common case that memory managers would reuse memory blocks previously released with free(). If malloc() recycles a memory block which is not zeroed (for example using memset()) before being released, the block will generally contain buffer content remaining from previously executed functions inside the process.\n\nGiven that the memory manager does not initialize blocks upon allocation and release, the implications of this pseudocode is that it will repeatedly take random memory samples (of 1k size) within the process' memory address space, which will occasionally catch some data remained from the workings of previously executed code.\n\n",

I think, it should be possible to extract valuable information (like hashes that were not properly cleaned up by password-managers and other credentials) from there, in respect to the large user-base and th computational power these companies have available.\n\nLet's do some calculations (unfortunately in code tags, becuase RE-Ex does not have MathJax):\n\nLet...\n\nThe amount of different positions the window can have is given by n - m + 1.\n\nThe amount of positions, which will fully include a sequence of size l is m - l + 1.\n\nTherefore the probability, that a random chosen search window will include our sequence is \n\np = (m - l + 1)/(n - m + 1)\n\nWe will assume,\n\nThis gives us a probability of p = (1024 - 16 + 1)/(4e9 - 1024 + 1) ~= 2.5225e-7.\n\nLet's do some more assumptions: Suppose the messenger has 1.5 billion users (like WhatsApp has). Let's also suppose the code sends the data twice a day and one thousandth of the users have an unreserved MD5 hash somewhere in memory.\n\nThat gives us a total size of 1.5e9 / 1000 * 2 = 3e6 samples to evaluate each day.\n\nWe will approximate the expected numbers of useful hashes with the normal distribution: \n\nsigma = sqrt(3e9*2.5225e-7*(1-2.5225e-7)) ~= 27.50909 (so the approx. should yield good results) \n\nmy = 3e9*2.5525e-7 ~= 756.75\n\nSo the company will get with an certainty of 99.73% between 701 and 812 (my-2*sigma, my+2*sigma) usable hashes each day.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not certain how java handles memory and how plausible (and effective) this scenario is. Nor do I have used any wellfounded values - I just plugged in some pseudo-logic numbers. I give also no guarantee for the corecctness of my calculations (I never really liked statistics).\n\nNontheless: Feel free to play around with the values and correct me if I did some miscalculations.\n\n",
