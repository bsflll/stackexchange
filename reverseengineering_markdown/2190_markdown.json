  "content": "IDAPython is great plugin in IDA. It is so handy to write small script to decode, decrypt or fix (patch) a binary in IDA.  I can just write, load and run a script, and can use print for the usual shotgun debugging. But when I develop a bigger IDAPython script, I need a way to debug it. \n\nI have searched and found that I can debug IDAPython with WingIDE but I want to find another that doesn't require WingIDE. Is there another way to debug IDAPython scripts?\n\n",

      "content": "As far as i know there's no way to debug python inside IDA.\n\nThere are, however, a few python tools you could use to debug your own code.\nbut it will essentially require you to develop your own python IDE/debugger utilities around the built-in python debugging tools.\n\nI'm listing the possible methods by order of complexity (simplest first):\n\nCompiling and running your own python code from python\nThe more basic approach is using the python compile built-in function to compile python code into bytecode, executing that with eval or exec (also built-in functions). compile returns an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) object you can further manipulate/investigate.\n\nUsing The python debugger (from python)\nIf you want more advanced debugging abilities, python has it's own built-in python debugger module called pdb. You only need to tell pdb what python code to execute, and it'll spawn a debugger interface similar to gdb, the command line debugger lets you set conditional breakpoints, manipulate and analyze python code, and use most of the usual debugging tools.\n\nUsing the python debugging framework\nthe python debugger is built on top of python's bdb (basic debugger), it is a class implementing debugging functionality and can be used from within IDA's python command line. If you're going to use the bdb you'll have to create your own tools and UI around these utilities.\n\nEdit:\nI saw WingIDE only now. since OP didn't specify what exactly is the issue using WingIDE, I hope at least one of the methods will be relevant.\n\n",
