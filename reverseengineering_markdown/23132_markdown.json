  "content": "When I try to open an executable (in this case exploit exercises protostar stack0), then the following message appears in a pop-up box:\n\nFailed to open and attach to process: execv() failed: No such file or directory.\n\nand I am unable to open any files because of this.\n\nTerminal output:\n\n```\nosboxes@osboxes:~/tools/edb-debugger/build$ ./edb --run ~/proto/bin/stack0 \nIcon theme \"elementary\" not found.\nStarting edb version: 1.1.0\nPlease Report Bugs & Requests At: https://github.com/eteran/edb-debugger/issues\nRunning Terminal:  \"/usr/bin/xterm\"\nTerminal Args:  (\"-title\", \"edb output\", \"-hold\", \"-e\", \"sh\", \"-c\", \"tty > /tmp/edb_temp_file_787768528_7578;trap \\\"\\\" INT QUIT TSTP;exec<&-; exec>&-;while :; do sleep 3600; done\")\nTerminal process has TTY:  \"/dev/pts/5\"\ncomparing versions: [4352] [4352]\n\n```\nAt first I installed edb using apt-get. This problem occurred. Then I uninstalled and installed it manually from the source code (and fixed the segmentation fault issue by changing the plugins directory). The problem remains. It doesn't matter if I use --run or try to open it from the GUI.\n\nI'm using Lubuntu. Linux 5.3.0-18. It's a VM downloaded from OSBoxes. \n\n",

I didn't even notice it, because radare2 and gdb were able to execute it.\n\nAfter reading stackoverflow 1 and stackoverflow 2, it seems that the problem is that my 64 bit system can't handle the 32 bit executable.\n\nAfter running the following command, I got the executable to work.\nsudo apt-get install lib32z1\n\nAnd also edb started working.\n\nEdit: Another reason why it might not work for you is that you have not marked it as executable. In that case:\n\nchmod +x filename\n\n",
