  "content": "Im hoping to understand the way a auto diagnostics tool is reporting data over usb.\nI've made a usb capture to look for changes according to known changes to the input it measures.\nThe measurement is of throttle position, and is reported from 0.000000% to 100.000000% (6 decimal shown)\n\n```\nHere as a full packet, throttle 100%\n    41 05 2B C0 FF 15 01 00 AA 00 00 00 00 00 FF 15\n    16 00 01 AA 00 00 00 00 01 08 11 00 05 61 C6 00\n    6D C3 67 52 4C 49 2D FF 00 00 00 00 55 00 F2\n\n```\nHere is a sequence of packets, only showing the last line which changes, along with the times in a row that same packet was recieved\n\n```\nThrottle ~50%\n6D C3 67 52 4C 49 2D 7F 00 00 00 00 55 00 72 x3\n6C C3 67 52 4C 49 2D 7F 00 00 00 00 55 00 73 x3\n6D C3 67 52 4C 49 2D 7F 00 00 00 00 55 00 72 x5\n6C C3 67 52 4C 49 2D 7F 00 00 00 00 55 00 73 x1\n\nThrottle 100%\n6C C3 67 52 4C 49 2D FF 00 00 00 00 55 00 F3 x2\n6D C3 67 52 4C 49 2D FF 00 00 00 00 55 00 F2 x4\n6C C3 67 52 4C 49 2D FF 00 00 00 00 55 00 F3 x3\n6D C3 67 52 4C 49 2D FF 00 00 00 00 55 00 F2 x3\n\nThrottle 0%\n6D C3 67 52 4C 49 2D 00 00 00 00 00 55 00 F1 x2\n6C C3 67 52 4C 49 2D 00 00 00 00 00 55 00 F2 x1\n6D C3 67 52 4C 49 2D 00 00 00 00 00 55 00 F1 x1\n6C C3 67 52 4C 49 2D 00 00 00 00 00 55 00 F2 x1\n6D C3 67 52 4C 49 2D 00 00 00 00 00 55 00 F1 x3\n6C C3 67 52 4C 49 2D 00 00 00 00 00 55 00 F2 x1\n\n```\nSo initially I noticed the 8th byte and thought it might correlate to a ADC reading of 0 - 255 that is then displayed as 0 - 100%. But then i found in the logs that it saves percentage readings to 6 decimal places with _TYPE=\"FLOAT\" .\n\nIve also noticed that within a group of similar packets that correlate to the same throttle position, there is an alternating pattern of changes to the first and last byte (for that line)\n\nIve also noticed that the packets are nearly all the same, except for what seem like small differences but which must make larger differences to the stored data than seems.\n\nSo can anyone see how it might be stored ?\n\n",
