  "content": "I'm trying to reverse-engineer the file format of a game's save files. The game is written in Unity, thus .NET, so it was possible to view an approximated code with RedGate Reflector.\n\nRight now I know the format is a header, followed by a Deflated stream of map data, which is created with ICSharpZipLib.\n\nThe header is composed of two strings, prefixed by a byte with their length. The first string is just a format specifier, the second is a version identifier. After those strings, there is a byte denoting if the contents are compressed or not (but that's hardcoded into the game to always compress).\n\n```\n<byte flen> <byte[flen] format> <byte vlen> <byte[vlen] version> <byte compress> <data>\n\n```\nThe game reads the file like this:\n\nMy trouble is reading the contents, I've written a simple C# program that mimics the game's behaviour, using the exact same library version, but I get a \"Unexpected EOF\". Editing the file to remove the non-compressed header and opening it with other command-line inflate utilities also results in that error. The file is guaranteed valid, since the game can open it without problem.\n\nBelow are two example files. The game in question is called Atmosphir, and can be downloaded here.\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!f5QFHJ6T!55LvsPFaaAp7Y-ZS3GbLPHg8Ohh-p-5M0AR_Hb7jd1c\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!C5xxEapL!ZZ9Tg2kjQetr9KXmfBn5rBc5c5BZ1UUXeqSLJvfJiyQ\n\n",
