  "content": "I would like to create an execution trace of a binary. To be precise, I would like to record every executed assembly instruction, together with possible memory accesses. By memory accesses I mean reading from, or writing to, memory. For these accesses I would like to record where the instruction reads from (resp. writes to) and what value it reads (resp. what value it writes).\n\nIf possible, I would prefer a solution which works on Windows and Linux, as well as for different kinds of CPUs.\n\nThe performance does not matter for the moment, i.e. a debugger script would be okay. \n\nI tried several things, but I did not manage to get what I wanted:\n\nFor the moment, PANDA seems to be the most promising choice (see comment of PANDA author here). Yet, I don't know PANDA and thus cannot tell how complex the creation of a suitable PANDA plugin will get.\n\nAs my goal seems not very exotic to me, I figured there must exist something already or there must be an easy way. For example, some lines of debugger script code, a PIN tool (yet Intel only), or a qemu argument or the like. Does it?\n\n",

      "content": "I know that this question was asked some time ago, but here comes the solution working on Windows. \n\nNote: See the last section of this answer to get the solution for other systems and architectures.\n\nOllyDbg2 is the tool that can be used for logging every single assembly instruction along with memory reads and writes. A short guide how to log it is presented below:\n\nOf course, if you don't want Olly to log all string instructions or code in system DLLs, you may just select two relevant boxes. Additionally, you may choose smaller trace buffer size if you want to dump the log to a file.\n\nThat's it! You may now open and analyse the file (it will be probably huge nonetheless).\n\nThe small excerpt of such a file is presented below (it shows only modified registers and doesn't enter system DLLs):\n\n```\nmain  <ModuleEntryPoint>          JMP SHORT 00401012\nmain  00401012                    MOV EAX,[DWORD DS:4F61EF]               [004F61EF]=0                EAX=00000000\nmain  00401017                    SHL EAX,2\nmain  0040101A                    MOV [DWORD DS:4F61F3],EAX               [004F61F3]=0\nmain  0040101F                    PUSH EDX                                [0019FF80]=0                ESP=0019FF80\nmain  00401020                    PUSH 0                                  [0019FF7C]=0                ESP=0019FF7C\nmain  00401022                    CALL <JMP.&KERNEL32.GetModuleHandleA>                               EAX=00400000, ECX=DC5CD787, ESP=0019FF80\nmain  00401027                    MOV EDX,EAX                                                         EDX=00400000\nmain  00401029                    CALL 004E7210                                                       ESP=0019FF7C\nmain  004E7210                    MOV EAX,EDX\nmain  004E7212                    CMP [BYTE DS:4F61E0],0                  [004F61E0]=00\nmain  004E7219                    JNE SHORT 004E7240\nmain  004E721B                    CMP [BYTE DS:4F61E1],0                  [004F61E1]=00\nmain  004E7222                    JE SHORT 004E7238\nmain  004E7238                    MOV ECX,[DWORD DS:57D7D4]               [0057D7D4]=ollydbg.0061B108 ECX=0061B108\nmain  004E723E                    MOV [DWORD DS:ECX],EAX                  [0061B108]=0\nmain  004E7240                    MOV EAX,[DWORD DS:57D7D8]               [0057D7D8]=ollydbg.0061B131 EAX=0061B131\nmain  004E7245                    MOV [BYTE DS:EAX],1                     [0061B131]=00\n\n```\nDOSBox Debugger will log everything you want when you are analysing DOS executable.\n\nSeveral lines of resulting file are given below:\n\n```\n01A2:00004654  mov  ax,si                                              8B C6                 EAX:0000002A EBX:0000002A ECX:00000A00 EDX:00000000 ESI:00000004 EDI:00000004 EBP:0000FFE2 ESP:0000FFDE DS:26EF ES:A000 FS:0000 GS:0000 SS:26EF CF:1 ZF:0 SF:1 OF:0 AF:1 PF:1 IF:1 TF:0 VM:0 FLG:00007293 CR0:00000000\n01A2:00004656  mov  dx,000E                                            BA 0E 00              EAX:00000004 EBX:0000002A ECX:00000A00 EDX:00000000 ESI:00000004 EDI:00000004 EBP:0000FFE2 ESP:0000FFDE DS:26EF ES:A000 FS:0000 GS:0000 SS:26EF CF:1 ZF:0 SF:1 OF:0 AF:1 PF:1 IF:1 TF:0 VM:0 FLG:00007293 CR0:00000000\n01A2:00004659  imul dx                                                 F7 EA                 EAX:00000004 EBX:0000002A ECX:00000A00 EDX:0000000E ESI:00000004 EDI:00000004 EBP:0000FFE2 ESP:0000FFDE DS:26EF ES:A000 FS:0000 GS:0000 SS:26EF CF:1 ZF:0 SF:1 OF:0 AF:1 PF:1 IF:1 TF:0 VM:0 FLG:00007293 CR0:00000000\n01A2:0000465B  mov  bx,ax                                              8B D8                 EAX:00000038 EBX:0000002A ECX:00000A00 EDX:00000000 ESI:00000004 EDI:00000004 EBP:0000FFE2 ESP:0000FFDE DS:26EF ES:A000 FS:0000 GS:0000 SS:26EF CF:0 ZF:0 SF:1 OF:0 AF:1 PF:1 IF:1 TF:0 VM:0 FLG:00007296 CR0:00000000\n01A2:0000465D  cmp  word [bx+56F6],0001        ds:[572E]=0000          83 BF F6 56 01        EAX:00000038 EBX:00000038 ECX:00000A00 EDX:00000000 ESI:00000004 EDI:00000004 EBP:0000FFE2 ESP:0000FFDE DS:26EF ES:A000 FS:0000 GS:0000 SS:26EF CF:0 ZF:0 SF:1 OF:0 AF:1 PF:1 IF:1 TF:0 VM:0 FLG:00007296 CR0:00000000\n01A2:00004662  jne  00004678 ($+14)            (down)                  75 14                 EAX:00000038 EBX:00000038 ECX:00000A00 EDX:00000000 ESI:00000004 EDI:00000004 EBP:0000FFE2 ESP:0000FFDE DS:26EF ES:A000 FS:0000 GS:0000 SS:26EF CF:1 ZF:0 SF:1 OF:0 AF:1 PF:1 IF:1 TF:0 VM:0 FLG:00007296 CR0:00000000\n01A2:00004678  inc  si                                                 46                    EAX:00000038 EBX:00000038 ECX:00000A00 EDX:00000000 ESI:00000004 EDI:00000004 EBP:0000FFE2 ESP:0000FFDE DS:26EF ES:A000 FS:0000 GS:0000 SS:26EF CF:1 ZF:0 SF:1 OF:0 AF:1 PF:1 IF:1 TF:0 VM:0 FLG:00007296 CR0:00000000\n\n```\nradare2 is the tool that may be used for your purpose regardless the system and architecture (complete list of them is given here).\n\nInstructions:\n\nAnd some corresponding memory accesses:\n\n\nOf course, it will be nicer to have these outputs listed in such a way as OllyDbg does, for example, but it just requires to write a script that links these two files together and displays the information in more convenient way.
