      "content": "There could be a huge number of reasons for this ranging from something as innocuous as a method pointer being a local variable to obfuscation (highly unlikely with the assembly you showed). As for how to follow it, you can either BP the call and follow it or track the frame pointer to see what it's set to.\n\n",

      "content": "call instruction with local variable suggests it may be function pointer.\nBut function pointer can be used in many cases. The simplest example is a raw\nC style function pointer.\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid func(int a) {\n    printf(\"%d  \n\", a);\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    void (*func_ptr)(int) = &func;\n    (*func_ptr)(10);\n}\n\n```\n```\nmov     dword ptr [ebp-4], offset func  ; move function pointer to stack\npush    10                              ; push 10 for first parameter\ncall    dword ptr [ebp-4]               ; call the function pointer\nadd     esp, 4\n\n```\nHow to know what happen there? Load it in a debugger. Set a breakpoint in that\nindirect call and follow its execution procedure. Judge other subroutines also.\n\n",
