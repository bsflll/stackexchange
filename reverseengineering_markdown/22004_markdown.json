You can do this online or use a simple Python module like hashlib to hash things on your own.\n\nUsing both the online program and a simple python3 script I wrote, 20030130 doesn't match any of the hashes listed (instead producing the hash 8fbaf5a8fedcebe1214b6fd23bec5db357ba4f6323630a1d59ffe86d948f0b81). There is a good chance a salt could be being used, which means the hashes would have a different word prepended that makes cracking a hash more difficult.\n\n",
