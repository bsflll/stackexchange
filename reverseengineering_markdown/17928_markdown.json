  "content": "I'm currently trying to reverse engineer a few equations used in a game, and have collected what seems to be all the relevant data.\n\nIn the example below, result speed is definitely based solely on the variables of thrust and weight. note that the game does use variables, but rounds the number\n\n```\nthrust | weight | speed\n       |        |\n   428 | 13575  | 188\n   617 | 13575  | 209\n   536 | 23850  | 152\n   995 | 35750  | 175\n   698 | 17475  | 202\n  1373 |  8575  | 278\n\n```\nIs it possible for me to use this data to find the equation through any means except brute force? I've looked around but only found things which used a single variable.There also seems to be diminishing returns on thrust, apart from the increase in weight which comes with it.\n\nNot sure how to tag this\n\nI originally asked this here (https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2727993/find-equation-based-on-multiple-sets-of-2-variables-and-results), and one of the responses suggested I bring the question here.\n\n",

If not, can you put up a download link so someone else might have a go at it? It could be easier than finding out the relationship between these numbers.",

      "text": "Just understand that depending on how realistic the game is, there are other (hidden) parts of the calculation.  For example, there is opposing aerodynamic drag in real life, which IIRC increases with the square of the velocity (e.g. 4x as much drag at 10 mph compared to 20 mph).  Aero drag would be part of the speed calculation, counteracting the thrust force, but it's not linear (obviously).  RE'ing the binary (as others have said) is the best. If not, try accounting for the aero drag, and you might get close.",

The first problem with those data is that we do not know the unit. Speed equal to 188, but what? Is it km/h or knots? Or something else a bit more imaginary for the purpose of the game?\n\nIt the game touches a bit of the reality we might want to refer to the physics. There's a thrust-to-weight ratio in aviation that might help you to deduce something from it (maybe there's some correlation between thrust, weight and speed) but to know that maybe we need to ask on Aviation?\n\n",
