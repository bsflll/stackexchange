  "content": "This is my first time asking something on SE and I'll do the best I can to provide all of the required information, but I apologize in advance if I'm not clear enough.\n\nI'm trying to reverse engineer a certain fighting game to be able to run the moves \"manually\".  What I mean by this is, say a certain power move is run by pressing S A J quickly on the keyboard, I want to be able to just jump to the method to use that move in the code without having to press the keys.\n\nso far I've tried using CheatEngine and OllyDbg to search for strings that match the move names, and also looked at what values changed before, during, and after executing the move, but neither seems to have done anything.\n\nI'm relatively new to the assembly language, but have quite a bit of experience in c++, c# and other languages.  \n\nI looked for questions similar to this one before posting it, but couldn't seem to find anything that would help.  If this has been posted before and I just missed it, sorry about that.\n\nThanks in advance for any answers.\n\n",

      "content": "Assuming this game is a bit more complex than a 8bit console game I'm afraid hooking getchar() and the likes won't do you much good.\n\nWith Windows windowed/full screen games, input is received by handling window messages, usually in a message loop.\n\nIn such cases, each window has its own message processing loop, in witch it constantly calls GetMessage() to receive events it should react to, such as key presses. GetMessage()s first parameter is a pointer to MSG structure which it populates with the next message after removing it from the queue.\nGo here for a message loop example, here for GetMessage() documentation, and finally here for the MSG structure documentation.\n\nIn that case you should place breakpoints on:\n\nAfter you've got to the message loop, you'll probably encounter a medium sized switch-case handling the different message types. That switch-case should read the MSG structure's message member for message types that belong to the keyboard. most commonly those are:\n\nOnce you've found the case handling those types, you should be pretty close to the function you're looking for. That case will most-likely do a few lines for code worth of parameter preparations and then call the function you're looking for.\n\n",
