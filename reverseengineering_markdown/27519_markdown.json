It does work on WinDbg, I made a mistake (I did !db [uc] 00000000`fffffff0 which didn't work at that time because I was on bootmgr (so it couldnt read past 4GiB). I tried it again on WinDbg with !db [uc] 00000000`ffffff00 and it worked). This however does not work on kd -kl no matter what, which is a shame because I'm more interested in my own hardware -- RwEverything is what I have to use",
