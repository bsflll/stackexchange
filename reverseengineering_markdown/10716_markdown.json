  "content": "It is understood that the labels that come in the .text section of an assembly program are representative of the address of the following instruction.\n\nIs it the same idea with the symbols we see in the .data section ? i.e. \"The label is representative of the base address of whatever follows\".\n\nDoes this apply anywhere in the program ?\n\nI'm a NOOB in assembly, learning MIPS as a part of coursework.\n\n",
