  "content": "Having recently watched/read a presentation given by Dave Kennedy at DEF CON 20 [PDF], I'd like to know how to decompile a Python script compiled with PyInstaller.\n\nIn his presentation, he is creating a basic reverse shell script in Python, and converts it to an EXE with PyInstaller.\n\nMy question is how do you take a PyInstaller created EXE and either completely, or generally, retrieve the logic/source code from the original Python script(s)?\n\n",

This includes the .pyc files (python code that is converted to bytecode). pyREtic is a tool that allows you to grab those from memory and convert it back to source.\n\nhttps://github.com/MyNameIsMeerkat/pyREtic\n\n",
