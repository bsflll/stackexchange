  "content": "I'm trying to call a function in a game that makes my character sending a message.\n\nI already called a few functions in this game but this one has a tricky parameter.\n\nThe function signature should be similar to this:\n\n```\nvoid Game::talkChannel(Otc::MessageMode mode, int channelId, const std::string& message)\n\n```\nThis is how I define it:\n\n```\ntypedef DWORD(__thiscall* _talkChannel)(DWORD localplayer, uintptr_t mode, uintptr_t channelId, const std::string& message);\n_talkChannel talkChannel;\ntalkChannel = (_talkChannel)(moduleBase + 0x79340);\n\n```\nThis is how I call it:\n\n```\ntalkChannel(LocalPlayer, 1, 0, \"test\");\n\n```\nHere's how the function looks normally:\n\n\n\nAnd this is how it looks if I call it from my dll:\n\n\n\nAs you can see it doesn't looks the same, and the result in game is my character sending this message:\n\n`ï¶test\n\nSo as I can see it will fill the message until 8 characters, and if I send more than 8 characters it won't send any message.\n\nTrying to send as a const char * made me explode my brain because it looks exactly the same as the original function call:\n\n\n\nBut nothing happens ingame, no message is sent, even the call looks identical to me in debugger...\n\nHow should I call that function with this tricky parameter?\n\nEDIT:\n\nCalling as const wchar_t* didn't work, but it's fun to see how it differs in debugger:\n\n\n\n",
