  "content": "I'm reversing an old DirectDraw game that uses DirectX 7.\n\nI have a LPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE7 g_lpDDSBack and g_lpDDSBack->BltFast is being called but this is how it is decompiled in HexRays:\n\n```\n(*(int (__stdcall **)(struct IDirectDrawSurface7Vtbl *, int, int, LPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE7, RECT *, MACRO_DDBLTFAST))((int (__stdcall **)(_DWORD, _DWORD, _DWORD, _DWORD, _DWORD, _DWORD))g_lpDDSBack->QueryInterface + 7))(\n                                      g_lpDDSBack,\n                                      x,\n                                      y,\n                                      pgf2->lpDDSrcSurface,\n                                      &pgf2->rect,\n                                      DDBLTFAST_SRCCOLORKEY);\n\n```\nFor reference, here is the interface:\n\n```\nDECLARE_INTERFACE_( IDirectDrawSurface7, IUnknown )\n{\n    /*** IUnknown methods ***/\n    STDMETHOD(QueryInterface) (THIS_ REFIID riid, LPVOID FAR * ppvObj) PURE; // 0\n    STDMETHOD_(ULONG,AddRef) (THIS)  PURE; // 1\n    STDMETHOD_(ULONG,Release) (THIS) PURE; // 2\n    /*** IDirectDrawSurface methods ***/\n    STDMETHOD(AddAttachedSurface)(THIS_ LPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE7) PURE; // 3\n    STDMETHOD(AddOverlayDirtyRect)(THIS_ LPRECT) PURE; // 4\n    STDMETHOD(Blt)(THIS_ LPRECT,LPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE7, LPRECT,DWORD, LPDDBLTFX) PURE; // 5\n    STDMETHOD(BltBatch)(THIS_ LPDDBLTBATCH, DWORD, DWORD ) PURE; // 6\n    STDMETHOD(BltFast)(THIS_ DWORD,DWORD,LPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE7, LPRECT,DWORD) PURE; // 7\n    // etc ...\n\n```\nSo from the HexRays code g_lpDDSBack->QueryInterface + 7, we can see it's calling g_lpDDSBack->BltFast. But why doesn't HexRays directly call BltFast?\n\n",

      "content": "It turned out to be a bug in IDA pro. I can't seem to edit my original question so first, I want to point out an error I made in the original question.\n\nWhen g_lpDDSBack is defined as struct IDirectDrawSurface7Vtbl *g_lpDDSBack;, then this was the output HexRays was showing:\n\n```\n(*(int (__stdcall **)(struct IDirectDrawSurface7Vtbl *, int, int, LPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE7, RECT *, MACRO_DDBLTFAST))((int (__stdcall **)(_DWORD, _DWORD, _DWORD, _DWORD, _DWORD, _DWORD))g_lpDDSBack->QueryInterface + 7))(\n                                      g_lpDDSBack,\n                                      x,\n                                      y,\n                                      pgf2->lpDDSrcSurface,\n                                      &pgf2->rect,\n                                      DDBLTFAST_SRCCOLORKEY);\n\n```\nWhen g_lpDDSBack is defined as LPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE7 g_lpDDSBack;, then this was the output HexRays was showing:\n\n```\n(*((int (__stdcall **)(int, int, int, _DWORD, int, signed int))g_lpDDSBack->lpVtbl + 7))(\n                       g_lpDDSBack,\n                       x,\n                       y,\n                       pgf2->lpDDSrcSurface,\n                       &pgf2->rect,\n                       DDBLTFAST_SRCCOLORKEY);\n\n```\nAlright, now here are the instructions to fixing the bug (g_lpDDSBack is defined as LPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE7 g_lpDDSBack;):\n\nAfter doing this, this is how it looks like in HexRays (you might have to press F5 first):\n\n```\ng_lpDDSBack->lpVtbl->BltFast(g_lpDDSBack,\n                                      x,\n                                      y,\n                                      pgf2->lpDDSrcSurface,\n                                      &pgf2->rect,\n                                      DDBLTFAST_SRCCOLORKEY);\n\n```\n",
