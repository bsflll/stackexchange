      "content": "The jar file produced by dextojar should include a class named R, which contains subclasses with resource id definitions:\n\n```\npublic final class R {\n...\n    public static final class list {\n        public static final int filename=0x7f050001;\n        public static final int type=0x7f050000;\n    }\n...\n}\n\n```\nThe (sub)class name, and variable names, correspond to the ids from the resource definitions in the apk file (res/layout/*.xml). In the above example, the R.java was autogenerated from these entries in res/layout/main.xml:\n\n```\n <TextView\n   android:id=\"@+list/type\"\n   android:layout_width=\"20dip\"\n   android:layout_height=\"20dip\"\n   android:textSize=\"16sp\"\n    />\n <TextView\n   android:id=\"@+list/filename\"\n   android:layout_width=\"0dp\"    android:layout_weight=\"1\"\n   android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n   android:textSize=\"16sp\"\n    />\n\n```\nSo, since 2131034112 equals 0x7F050000, with my R.java and main.xml, your code would set the @+list/type textview content.\n\n",
