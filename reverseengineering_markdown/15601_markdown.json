  "content": "Pseudo Code:\n\n```\n(*((void (__cdecl **)(_DWORD, _DWORD))cr->baseclass_0.Skills[1]->_vptr.TSkill + 3))(cr->baseclass_0.Skills[1], Mana);\n\n```\nIDA Assembly Code:\n\n```\n.text:0807EC41                 call    dword ptr [mana+0Ch]\n\n```\nI cannot figure to what address is the call going to, and I cannot seem to jump to that either, why is this happening? how can I solve it? I'm very newbie with IDA but I've been managing lately, and I just encountered this one and I'm clueless on what to do.\n\nA bigger view before the call:\n\n```\n.text:0807EC2B loc_807EC2B:                            ; CODE XREF: CheckMana(TCreature *,int,int,int)+EAj\n.text:0807EC2B                 mov     Delay, [ebp+Mana_0]\n.text:0807EC2E                 test    Delay, Delay\n.text:0807EC30                 jle     short loc_807EC44\n.text:0807EC32                 mov     Delay, [cr+8]\n.text:0807EC35                 mov     edx, [ebp+Mana_0]\n.text:0807EC38                 mov     mana, [Delay]\n.text:0807EC3A                 mov     [esp], Delay\n.text:0807EC3D                 mov     [esp+4], edx\n.text:0807EC41                 call    dword ptr [mana+0Ch]\n\n```\n",
