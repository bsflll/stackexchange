  "content": "I’ve a bunch of first-class German dictionaries by Duden (the main German dictionary publisher) which, sadly, use a closed proprietary data format and their dedicated Duden-Bibliothek application (Information in German).\n\nI’m usually using Goldendict on my tablet. Is there any possibility to convert my dictionaries to Stardict/Goldendict format so I can use them on my Android devices ?\n\nI’ve looked into stardict-tools but can’t convert.\n\n",
