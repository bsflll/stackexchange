  "content": "I have a script that catches say a value of 666 in the RDX register and pauses debugging. The problem is, that this value might be added to the register by other modules aside from the main application that I am debugging, for example by ntdll.dll, which is of course of no use to me.\n\nHow do I get the name of the current module that debugger is in at any given moment so I can ignore if the RDX is changed at that module?\nSomething like this:\n\n```\nidaapi.step_into()\nidaapi.wait_for_next_event(2, -1)\ncounter=GetRegValue('RDX')\nif counter==666 and (GetCurrentModuleName()!='ntdll.dll'):\n        break\n\n```\n",

Although I have to note that modinfo.name contains full path to the file, so checking it against just the filename is going to fail, you need to extract the filename from it first. Also I am not sure if this line does anything at all: ida_dbg.get_module_info(ea, modinfo)",
