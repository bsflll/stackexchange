  "content": "I have a C++ header with interfaces (classes with all methods pure virtual).\nI also have a binary which returns pointers to these interfaces.\nI debugged while running and received the virtual table addresses for these interfaces' implementation.\n\nIs there a way to tell IDA Pro that the vtable is at a certain address, and to give it the header files and to let it mark all the methods in the vtable and name them accordingly?\nThere are many interfaces and a lot of methods.\n\nI saw this: Static analysis of C++ binaries, but it doesn't answer the question of automatic naming.\n\nI'm using the freeware version 5.0.\n\n",

C++ is not part of IDA's world directly. \nThat's more in the realm of a particular language, one of many, while IDA is about assembly and byte code domains; with the exception of the HexRays decompiler plug-in, which sort of adds a C/C++ thing on top.\n\nAre you sure you can relate the actual binary address to a given C++ method, and, or vftable et al?\n\nAt any rate you will probably have to write your own plug-in, and, or scripts to do what you want.\n\n",
