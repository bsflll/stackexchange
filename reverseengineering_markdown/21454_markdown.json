  "content": "A friend asked me to make some small mod on a app.\nThe mod should be to rewrite some labels like button, textbox text into his\nlanguage, so he can better understand the app...\n\nI loaded the app to IDA 7.0 and the two dll's too which are UPX packed, but I unpacked it before loading into IDA, but I can't find any string...\n\nNothing.\nThere should be some buttons labeled with \"Diagnostic\", \"Settings\", \"About the program\" etc. But no way to figure out why I cant find all the strings...\n\nHere is the link to the files I got:\nFiles \n\nAny help would be nice.\nThank you very much.\n\n",

It looks for me like if the exe is packed or protected with some software like UPX bit I can't figure out which software is used. I also checked the exe with PEiD but it says not packed... Pic.: imgur.com/RmthSGd  After opening in IDA I get a warning msg. \"The imports segment seems to be destroyed...\" That tells me does something is really buggy.",
