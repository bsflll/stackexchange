  "content": "Inside a internet radio firmware file I found a file system, and I don't know which one it is.\n\nWhat I know:\n\nAll offsets and lengths are little endian.\n\nWhat file system could that be? I don't think that the developers built their own file system.\n\nThe firmware file is from http://update.wifiradiofrontier.com/Update.aspx?c=ir-mmi-FS2026-0500-0052&m=1122334455&v=2.6.17.EX53300-2RC3&t=Cust-File&n=2.11.12.EX65933-4RC2&f=/updates/ir-mmi-FS2026-0500-0052.2.11.12.EX65933-4RC2.isu.bin\n\nbinwalk does not detect the filesystem.\n\nThe file system I mean starts at 0x1dc1e6. I already wrote a working parser for that file system, but I'd like to know if that is a known fs type.\n\n",
