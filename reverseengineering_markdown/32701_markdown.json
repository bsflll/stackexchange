It brings me at the very end of the file as file size is 8717703 bytes (8717639 which is my uImage kernel compressed data + 64 which is my header_size = 8717703) :\n\n```\n~$ ls -la GS316EP_GS316EPP_V1.0.3.7-runtime.image\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 user user 8717703 Apr 17  2023 GS316EP_GS316EPP_V1.0.3.7-runtime.image\n\n```\nAnd uImage kernel compressed data is indeed 8717639 bytes long,I double checked by uncompressing it correctly.\n\nSo somehow, binwalk found random data in my uImage kernel compressed data, that he refered wrongly to lz4 compressed data. It's a false positive then.\n\n",
