  "content": "I'm trying to load symbols for a dll with IDA pro.\n\n```\nMy _NT_SYMBOL_PATH is SRV*c:\\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols .\n\n```\nI put DBGTOOLS = \"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Windows Kits\\\\8.1\\\\Debuggers\\x86\\\\\" in my ida.cfg \n\nI modified IDA's symsrv.dll and symsrv.yes so as to put the one of the WinDbg folder instead.\n\nThe problem is that if I load my dll, I see no symbols and get this error message : \n\n```\n\"PDB: could not process file D:\\Dangerous\\Share\\Direct2D x86\\d2d1.dll with DIA: No such interface supported\"\n\n```\nThere is no way to get symbols from the server. However, I load some symbols manually using the symbols that I can download on my msdnaa account. The problem is that I've got several different version of d2d1.dll. My symbols are for the dll present just after the OS installation. As I update my OS and then remove some specific update so as to diff dll that were changed, my symbols are not the correct one anymore. \n\nWhat did I do wrong? How could I get the correct symbols for each version? \n\n",
