  "content": "When working with embedded systems, it is often easiest to use a downloadable firmware file rather than recover the firmware from the device.\n\nMostly these are ROM images in the form of a .bin file. Sometimes, they are Motorola SREC files (often called .s19 files or .mot files). \n\nThese are easily converted into bin files using many available tools. The SREC files tend to only contain records where there is actually data/code and the gaps are filled with padding values during conversion. Padding tends to be 0x00 or 0xFF.\n\nThis can gives us a hint about the data segment of the image - it allows us to tell if the memory has been initialised with 0x00/0xFF intentionally by the compiler/assembler, or if it is just padding. Sometimes this can make identifying data structures easier.\n\nIs there anything else an SREC file can leak?\n\n",

      "content": "Correct me if I'm wrong, but since SREC is an ASCII representation of the binary data, wouldn't the corresponding binary file also \"leak\" sections of data that are padded with 0x00/0xFF?\n\nWith that said, yes, I think that in some cases SREC could expose useful information about the firmware that you wouldn't otherwise get with a binary image, assuming the vendor makes proper use of SREC's record types. Each line of text in an SREC file starts with a record code (S0, S1, S2, etc). Some example record types from Wikipedia's SREC page:\n\nClearly, an SREC file provides information about the data in each record - information which normally would not be contained in a binary file. If you see an S7/8/9 record for example, you can probably assume that the firmware's entry point is located there. Likewise, the use of S2 vs S3 can tell you if the data contains 24 bit addresses or 32 bit addresses. \n\nHow common it is to use these different SREC record types in practice though, I couldn't say. A vendor could probably just mark everything with the same record type (S1 for example), which wouldn't really give you any more information about the data than a binary file would.\n\n",
