Although, when I try to use that assembly generated code in a TASM, it doesn't build, and throw errors.\n\nIn contrast, I tried also to use IDA, and it does not seem to get the same assembly result as 1.\n\nMy questions are:\n\nBTW - The context is that I'm trying to solve an RE riddle, which I cannot post online (and I'm a pretty newbie in RE and assembly).\n\n",

Anyway, the difference is that AT&T syntax is somewhat more verbose and the source operand comes left of the comma as opposed to right of the comma with Intel's syntax.",

      "content": "DOS COM files do not have any structure or headers; they are loaded into memory by DOS as-is and are executed from the first byte, so you just need to convert hex bytes to binary to get a COM file.\n\nThe difference you see is likely caused by the processor mode setting; mov di, 400h in 16-bit mode and and mov edi, 0x400 in 32-bit mode have exactly the same opcode.\n\nIDA knows that COM files are 16-bit code and disassembles them accordingly, but ODA seems to default to 32-bit mode. To force 16-bit disassembly, select i8086 in the Mode combo box.\n\n",
