As a result, I have a huge shelf filled with data books: Intel, Atmel, Texas Instruments... etc. My instinct is to throw these all away as I assume these are online somewhere.\n\nAre these databooks of any use for (hardware) reverse engineering, or is this information guaranteed online somewhere?\n\n",
