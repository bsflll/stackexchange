  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/8017/extracting-https-packets-before-encryption",
  "content": "Say we have a Windows application, which sends some packets over HTTPS. We need to extract the content of this packets (unencrypted of course).\n\nThere is no way to get hands on server private certificate and MitM attack doesn't work (some MitM defense is used by this application). So, decryption seems to be off the table.\n\nThe only choice (I suppose) is to extract these packets from the application before they get encrypted. Application is well protected, it has no dependency on OpenSSL DLLs. However, we have a certain feeling that it uses OpenSSL (but, statically linked, may be OpenSSL source was even modified before compiling/linking).\n\nHooking a call to OpenSSL functions (like ssl_write()) is not simple, because the application's executable is packed and obfuscated. It also has a debugging protection, but a stealth debugger, which avoid this defense, is already found. So, we can debug this application. However, the code, as seen during debugging, is a complete mess (obfuscated). Even the system DLLs, being loaded by this application, are completely messed. Here is an example of how the send() function from WS2_32.dll looks like during debugging of this application. For reference, here is how it looks like from normal (unprotected) application. So, it's very hard to understand how the function arguments are passed, moreover it looks like they can be passed via different ways (not sure, but looks so according debugging experiments).\n\nThis seems to be a quite common task, since there are many Windows applications which use HTTPS and statically linked OpenSSL.\n\nHopefully somebody have such experience and can share it.\n\n",

      "content": "Since you are want to bypass HTTPS encryption, why not use Fiddler?\n\nFiddler is a web debugging proxy that auto-sets itself as the system proxy. It also offers the option to install a self-signed root certificate at the system, so HTTPS sniffing can be done.\n\nAll you have to do is start Fiddler, go to Tools -> Fiddler Optios -> HTTPS tab -> check \"Decrypt HTTPS traffic\".\nAfter that click yes in the dialogs asking if it is ok to install the root certificate as trusted and you are good to go (if I am not mistaken Fiddler also needs to be restarted for this to work).\n\nThen, all HTTPS traffic from the computer running fiddler will be available to inspect in the respective tab of the application.\n\n",
