  "content": "I am trying to reverse engineer a DLL that may contain malware. One thing I noticed is that it hides itself from the DLL LDR_MODULE list. So, when I use Ollydbg or smiler tools I do not see it and cannot dump it. \n\nI don't have the DLL file. I just have an executable file that injects the DLL into a certain process.\n\n",
