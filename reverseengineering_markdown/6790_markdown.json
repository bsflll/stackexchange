There is a good chance in this case it's either using an open source, or commercial setup. Look for strings in the target that indicate what library/system it might be using, and, or, look for relevant DLL's (like \"awesomium\", etc.) in the targets path. You might be able to find matching libs that you can use; again making some general assumptions that you are going to facilitate your mod/hack via a DLL.\n\nYou got to do more RE'ing to find out how it's doing things and the answer(s) will reveal it's self.\n\n",
