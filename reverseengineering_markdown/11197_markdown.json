  "content": "I've been working on reversing file formats from the game of star wars episode 1: the phantom menace. \n\nI have managed to extract the audio files from the .lab file in which they were contained. I cannot however play the audio files.\n\nThe files are provided at the end of the question.\n\nI managed to find some of the decompressed files in the game's cache (which do play) and so I have a selection of audio files in both compressed and uncompressed form.\n\nThe compression ratio is about 66%; i.e. the compressed file is 1/3 of the size of the uncompressed size.\n\nThis is an example of the uncompressed and compressed form of the data. (From BDm8906.wav and BDM8906.wv) \n\nThe first 32 bytes of the uncompressed file (Magic is riff) BDm8906.wav\n\n```\n52 49 46 46 DA 77 00 00 57 41 56 45 66 6D 74 20\n10 00 00 00 01 00 01 00 22 56 00 00 44 AC 00 00\n\n```\nThe first 32 bytes of the compressed file (Magic is INDYWV) BDM8906.wv\n\n```\n49 4E 44 59 57 56 22 56 00 00 10 00 00 00 01 00 \n00 00 F1 2B 00 00 00 00 00 00 B6 77 00 00 00 00\n\n```\nFrom looking a few of the compressed files I have found that:\n\nThe first 16 bytes are always the same.\nThe next 4 bytes are the size of the compressed file.\nThe next 6 bytes are always zero. \n\nHere's a more detailed look at the hexdump of the compressed file:\n\nhttps://i.sstatic.net/FDpGy.jpg\n\n(SE will not let me upload it).\n\nFrom byte 25 (start counting at 0) to the end of the file is always different. The number of bytes from here to the end of the file is the size of the compressed file indicated earlier.\n\nAttempts to decompress:\n\n1) Thorough googleing. One other guy on the lucas forums and on the xentax forums attempts to decompress it without success. It is not wavepack.\n\n2) Trying common compression algorithms on the uncompressed files. Compress, lzma, gzip do not even come close to the compression ratio reported.\n\n3) Binwalk on the binary:  \n\n```\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0             0x0             Microsoft executable, portable (PE)\n715764        0xAEBF4         YAFFS filesystem\n721564        0xB029C         YAFFS filesystem\n746196        0xB62D4         LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x64, dictionary size: 33554432 bytes, uncompressed size: 16777216 bytes\n\n```\nWhen I run binwalk on windows I get that it includes DMC (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Markov_compression)\n\n4) Dissembling the Binary and trying to find the location of the decompression code - this is quite difficult\n\nA sample (two files, one encrypted one unencrypted) can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/jvljza0v76mvl56/AAC41MenYP57dVHgAXY-DkSsa?dl=0\n\nHow can I figure out what it is using?\n\nThanks \n\nEdit\nAccording to reaper, decompressed file:\n\n22.05 sample rate\n16 bits per sample\n15323 samples\n694 ms\n\nwhatever the game does has decoded it into 15323 16 bit integers\n\n",

And if anyone is aware of other games that also use that format, I'd be interested to know!\n\n",
