  "content": "I just downloaded the binary of ScyllaHide for x64dbg. According to the instructions, I need to generate an NtApiCollection.ini file by running PDBReaderx64.exe or PDBReaderx86.exe. But I've got a long list of errors:\n\nrunning  PDBReaderx64.exe in win 7 64bit in a VM(virtualbox):\n\n```\nC:\\work\\reversetools\\ScyllaHide_2019-05-31_22-45\\Release>PDBReaderx64.exe\n\n```\nresult:\n\n```\nOS ID: 6.1.1.0.1.9.x64\nDBGHELP: No debug info for C:\\bin\\ScyllaHide_2019-05-31_22-45\\Release\\PDBReaderx\n64.exe.

Also the 3 resolved api's are having address = 0. I have no idea what went wrong as there is no information about what this PDBReaderx64.exe is doing.  Any help?\n\n",

      "content": "This is an application that used to be part of ScyllaHide. It was responsible for finding addresses of undocumented (and unexported) functions in ntdll by downloading the Microsoft symbols and finding their address there. If you are interested you can find more information about the removal at https://github.com/x64dbg/ScyllaHide/commit/6817d32581b7a420322f34e36b1a1c8c3e4b434c.\n\nPDBReader should no longer be necessary to use ScyllaHide. You can find the latest version always at https://github.com/x64dbg/ScyllaHide/releases.\n\n",

      "content": "I don't have 50 reps to comment, but PDBs are symbols. It's failing to load symsrv.dll, which tells me that you don't have the debugging tools installed? If so, you will need to install it: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools\n\nAfter doing so, it SHOULD work. I haven't used PDBReader but when symbols are needed in the debugger, it'll just download them. Not sure if it will be the same for this one. \n\n",
