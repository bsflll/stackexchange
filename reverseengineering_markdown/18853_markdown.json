  "content": "I've been working on reversing an extremely outdated piece of software that I happen to need in order to get at the information stored in some equally outdated \"database\" files. \n\nUsing x64dbg, I've patched out the validity checks for the serial / request / activation strings, and the software does successfully go through it's activation routine. \n\nThe problem is that I now need to export the correctly patched DLL in order for the software to work, but x64dbg will only \"apply\" 3/20 of the necessary patches. It will, however, export a .1337 patch file that contains all 20.\n\nWhat am I getting wrong?\n\n",

In rare cases it could be that there is a bug in converting the virtual addresses to file offsets. If you think that is the case, provide the relevant binary and patch location and open an issue at http://issues.x64dbg.com\n\n",
