  "content": "NISIS installers compress data using bizp2, lzma or zlib -- I don't know if there are others algorithms--.\n\nAt some point in the installation process one of those algorithms has to be applied to certain buffer of data. Of course, that data was readed from the disk --contained into the installer--. \n\nHow can I debug a NISIS installer in order to know where the installer files are? What I have to look for?\n\nNote: I can work with OllyDbg or IDAPro.\n\n",

      "content": "Generally speaking, you can either detect when the data is read from the file (by monitoring functions as ReadFile), or when it's being decompressed (by monitoring the decompression function once you find it). In some cases the program may read the compressed data directly and pass it to the decompression function, but in others it could read some chunk of file together with the header/metadata, parse that header, and then pass only the trailing compressed data to the decompressor. There is no single \"right way\" to figure out where exactly the compressed data is in the file.\n\nThat said, NSIS is open-source and you can just look at the source code to see how it works. There are also ready-made tools to extract files from NSIS installers.\n\n",

      "content": "Well, without reject Igor Skochinsky's answer I want to post this more landed in the fact of how to find where compressed data is.\n\nPeter Kankowski wrote:\n\n```\nBYTE buff[512];\nwhile(not end of file) {\n   ReadFile( 512 bytes into buff)\n   if(*(long*)buff == marker) {\n       // Marker found!\n   }\n   // else read another 512-byte chunk in the loop\n}\n\n```\nSo as you can see NSIS installer have some sort of marker. So, just look for the ReadFile API call, follow the program flow until the loops start again an watch for the last jump before the loop repeat it has to have a comparision around.\n\nAnd there you have the marker.\n\nIf you want read more you can visit this very useful article: Self-extracting executables, thanks to Peter for a good adn clean explanation.\n\n",
