  "content": "I set the following breakpoint: \n\n```\nbp MSPTLS!LsCreateLine 100\n\n```\nThe program crashes before the break point is hit 100 times. When I do bl after the crash, I get the following: \n\n```\n0 e 5dca4b62     0072 (0100)  0:**** MSPTLS!LsCreateLine\n\n```\nI am assuming from this information that the break point was hit 72 times before the crash.\n\nHowever, when I do bp MSPTLS!LsCreateLine 80 I am able to hit the breakpoint before the crash telling me that the break point was hit more than 72 times before the crash. Does this 72 not indicate how many times the break point was hit?\n\n",
