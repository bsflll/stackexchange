  "content": "I have a struct in IDA Pro that I want to export to a c-style struct. For example:\n\n```\n00000000 ICreateErrorInfo struc ; (sizeof=0x4, align=0x4, standard type)\n00000000                                         ; XREF: sub_73C9D0r\n00000000 lpVtbl          dd ?                    ; offset\n00000004 ICreateErrorInfo ends\n\n```\nI want to export the above to something similar to:\n\n```\ntypedef struct ICreateErrorInfo {\n    int lpVtbl;\n} ICreateErrorInfo;\n\n```\nI am also using HexRaysCodeXplorer if that helps.\n\n",

Then select the structure you want to export and in the contextual menu choose either Edit or Export to header file. It is possible to export multiple structures by holding Shift when selecting them.\n\n",
