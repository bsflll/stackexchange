  "content": "I have a DLL with a large number of functions in IDA Pro. I would like to make a script that can scan the instructions within each of the functions looking for a specific instruction. For my specific case right now, I am looking for functions that shift left (shl). I am not sure which register is being shifted so I would like to keep it versatile. I do know that it is only shifting one place in this specific case.\n\nI know python on a very basic level, and I know IDA-Python on a non-existent level. Please help me with suggestions on how to access this data inside IDA.\n\nEdit:\nI have read through this question and it says that there is no direct access to the list of functions that have been discovered by IDA.  You have to specify a starting function address.  Is there any better way to list functions?\n\n",

      "content": "Your best bet is to use IDAPython API to do this.\n\nTo iterate trough all functions you could do something like \n\n```\nfrom idautils import *\nfrom idaapi import *\n\nea = BeginEA()\nfor funcea in Functions(SegStart(ea), SegEnd(ea)):\n    functionName = GetFunctionName(funcea)\n    functionStart = \"0x%08x\"%funcea\n    functionEnd = \"0x%08x\"%FindFuncEnd(funcea)\n    # ...\n\n```\nWhen you have the start and the end of the function, you can iterate over all effective addresses inbetween and use GetMnem() to get the instruction on that address. Of course, you'd need to handle some specific cases, instruction size and all, but that's the general idea. \n\n",
