  "content": "What are the current options for binary patching which works across different versions of the binary?\n\nE.g. we created a binary patch for a specific version of a binary and want to apply that patch to another version of a binary which is slightly different to the original binary but identical in the 'area' (the function which needs to be patched)?\n\nOf course this won't work in every case, but a good-enough solution for x64 would be fine.\nAre there any tools, frameworks etc. available?\n\n",

      "content": "Version tracking in ghidra is exactly what you are looking for. Say you have two binaries with different versions. First, you need to analyze those binaries and save the analysis results (you can manually patch binary before or during this stage). Then click on version tracking symbol and create new version tracking session. Here, you can track and apply changes over from source to destination binary.\n\n\n\nPlease check their documentation in the help section, as shown in the image.\n\n\n\nPlease also checkout the complete video tutorial here.\n\n",
