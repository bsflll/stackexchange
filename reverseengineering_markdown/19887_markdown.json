      "content": "Okay, so after looking into this a bit further I came to the following conclusion. This may work for you by picking another processor model supported by the nec850 processor module. However, RH850 support in particular was only introduced in IDA 7.2.\n\nLooking further we can see in the Wikipedia article on Renesas we find out why it ended up in the nec850 processor module:\n\nThe name RH850 is actually not used in the IDA SDK 7.0 and 7.1 (this particular processor module comes with source code included as also indicated on the Hex-Rays website).\n\nAnd in the release information for IDA 7.2 we can read:\n\nSo no support prior to IDA 7.2 as I already surmised. In the IDA SDK 7.2 we can then find this:\n\n```\nstatic const char *const shnames[] =\n{\n  \"V850\",\n  \"V850E\",\n  \"V850E1\",\n  \"V850E2M\",\n  \"RH850\",\n  NULL\n};\n\nstatic const char *const lnames[] =\n{\n  FAMILY\"NEC V850\",\n  \"NEC V850E\",\n  \"NEC/Renesas V850E1/ES\",\n  \"NEC/Renesas V850E2/E2M\",\n  \"Renesas RH850\",\n  NULL\n};\n\n```\n(This should also provide the clue which possible alternative names you could try for rudimentary support using related processor models. All of those are implemented in that same nec850 processor module.)\n\n",
