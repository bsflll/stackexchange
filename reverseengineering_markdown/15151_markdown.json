  "content": "A while back, on a Linux system, I found a strange binary being executed at seemingly random times with some strange arguments, briefly appearing in ps. There was nothing to be found at the usual suspect like init.d, .bashrc and crontab. I found where the binary was located, renamed it, and put a script it its place. The script displayed and passed through all the received arguments and recorded the time and the duration of the binary execution, as well as some /proc information. I was able to figure out what called it, when, and what were the arguments. What is the name of this honeypotting, MITM technique?\n\n",
