  "content": "I am trying to run a pintool I downloaded from this link:\n\nhttps://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/kim1051/\n\nThe associated paper is here:\nhttps://www.utdallas.edu/~zxl111930/file/Rewards_NDSS10.pdf\n\nThe tool works fine with the provided example. Nevertheless, when I try running an elf-32 or 64 I get the following error:\n\n```\nE:Cannot execute file. System error: Unknown error. File name: \".\\hello\"\nE:Pin is exiting due to fatal error\n\n```\nThe code I used is a simple C hello world:\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main()\n{\n\n   printf(\"Hello, World!\");\n   return 0;\n}\n\n```\nCompiled with:\n\n```\ngcc -m32 hello.c -o hello\n\n```\nI am new to Pin, nevertheless I gathered it acts as it's own binary loader so I'm surprised this did not work.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n",

However in the downloaded zip the pintool is a dll and the pin version is for windows which is why I am confused.  >  \"in any case, this seems to be a PIN support issue and not really about RE\"     Fair enough I'll try asking on intel dev forum",
