  "content": "Last night I was extending functionality of HexRaysCodeXplorer - implemented feature to automatically rename duplicating variables. It needs some fixes to work well, but the problem I cannot cope with is - how to preserve lvar names?\n\nThis is how it works:\n\nThese names do exist only till end of current Ida session. \n\nI have read about Ida's netnodes, but I don't think it's rational to store lvar names in this container and do renaming at the start of every session. I suspect there is some native way to preserve essential information (like in this case), but I cannot find it.\n\nBecause I had to analyse c-tree, I used HexRays classes like: ctree_visitor_t, cfuncptr_t and lvar_t.\n\n",
