However, I created a plugin with a huge help from pancake, that allows just that:\n\nhttps://github.com/satk0/r2-afen-plugin\n\nInstallation is as simple as running:\n\n```\nr2pm -i r2afen\n\n```\nAfter installing, you must run radare2 with -e asm.parser=afen -e asm.pseudo=true arguments for the plugin to actually work:\n\n```\nr2 -e asm.parser=afen -e asm.pseudo=true <file>\n\n```\nThen, using this plugin, the command that renames rbp + rax - 0x1020 expression to cwd[i] would be the following:\n\n```\n> afen cmd[i] \"rbp + rax - 0x1020\"\n\n```\n",
