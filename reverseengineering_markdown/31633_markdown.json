      "content": "There are a few potential issues here:\n\nYou may not have the right window - UIApp.windows[0] just gets the first window, but the app may have multiple windows, or the first window may not contain the views you're interested in.\nThe subviews you're accessing may not exist - if the index is out of bounds, or if the window has no subviews at that level, you'll get undefined and the error you're seeing.\ncycript has some quirks with dynamically typed objects - you may need to insert .toString() or .valueOf() to force evaluation in some cases.\n\nAlternatives to cycript include:\n\nFrida - Supports Obj-C, Swift and other languages, and has a richer API and ecosystem of scripts/tools built on top of it.\nobjection - A mobile security framework built on Frida, with a simpler API focused on common mobile security tasks.\nxdb - Similar to cycript, but with a more lightweight/streamlined approach and Swift support.\nVarious other debuggers/injection tools - There are quite a few other options out there too, depending on your exact use case.\n\n",
