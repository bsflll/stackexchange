The second one, 0x400c60 is what is located in that memory location. r2 is giving you hints about the actual result might be in the comments. It also informs you that 8 byte will be used for the operation with the :8 suffix.\n\nSo it looks like that at address 0x602090 there's a 8-byte value stored that constitutes as an address 0x400c60.\n\n",
