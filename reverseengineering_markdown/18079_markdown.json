  "content": "So, I have this problem: I'm trying to do a homework which, at one point, asks us to use IDA to debug a simple program step by step. The deal is, when I load the executable in IDA, the Debugger option in the menu suddenly dissapears.\n\nWhat exactly is happening, or what am I doing wrong?\n\n",

Try new analysis from scratch to see if the menu gets restored.\n\n",
