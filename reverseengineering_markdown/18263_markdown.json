  "content": "So now we see that the Swedes are going large with their implantable chips which allow them to carry out certain kinds of transactions without using plastic.\n\nThousands of people in Sweden get microchip implants for a new way of life\n\nExcerpt:\n\nMy question is:\n\nHow do these microchips work?  Are they merely RFID units that store a single personal ID number?  Or is it something more complex, like a SIM card or Smartcard with some other kind of registration?\n\n",
