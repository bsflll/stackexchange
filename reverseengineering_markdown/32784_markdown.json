  "content": "I am writing a helper script at work for when new people start work and need help setting up respective applications - the application will write configuration files to be loaded into the various applications. I'm not looking to get a hold of anyone's credentials through this, this is to actually hash them into something else.\n\nThe hashed string will look like this and represents an empty text field:\n\n```\n00160E0F101112131415161718191A1B1C1D1E1F202122232425262728292A0042\n\n```\nIf we split this up into bytes, we will have 33 of them.\n\n```\nBytes: 00 16 0E 0F 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1A 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2A 00 42\nIndex: 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32\n\n```\nHere are the results for various inputs into the text field that returns the hash:\n\n```\n\"ABC0123\" = 07161717176363636315161718191A1B1C1D1E1F202122232425262728292A00A3\n\"ABCBBBB\" = 07161717171110131215161718191A1B1C1D1E1F202122232425262728292A005D\n\"ABCDEFGH\" = 08161717171717171707161718191A1B1C1D1E1F202122232425262728292A0066\n\"9999999999999999999999999999999\" = 1F166F6C6D6A6B686976777475727370717E7F7C7D7A7B787906070405020300B6\n\"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\" = 1A16171717171717170707070707070707171717171717171767676728292A0071\n\n```\nThe conclusion I draw from this is as follows:\n\nThe application used is from 2000 something and used internally since then. It's not super important, but I am too deep in the rabbit hole to not try and see this through at this point.\n\nThis is also my first foray into decompiling with ghidra and I have found the place in the code that represents the GUI part of where this information is put in by the user, but I can't seem to find the encoding/conversion process for certain and I can't follow it along either since C was never my language unfortunately. I saw a header called PascalString which seems to be something like what this is but I still can't figure this out.\n\n",
