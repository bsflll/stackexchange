  "content": "I am trying to teach myself some ROP programming. And I have tried\nto do some training exploits from different sites. So, right now, I have this\nlittle application where GS, safeSEH ALSR and DEP are enabled (on application level not on OS). So, when I make an attempt to exploit this application it works pretty well ( http://pastebin.com/TdDR3W0y). It just pops calc.exe. \n\nBut, on the other side, when I enable OS level DEP, then my exploit generates a segfault and crashes the application. \n\nSo, my question is what is the difference between application level DEP and OS level DEP ? Do, I have to make other/different function calls (instead to VirtualProc) when I try to circumvent DEP ?\n\n",

      "content": "Based on the hard-coded values in your code, you are not defeating ASLR at all (0x7c801ad4, 0x0012fbd0, 0x0012fbd0), and perhaps the application does not support it either (0x1003c898, 0x10086d6a), because none of those values should be constant when ASLR is working properly.  The likely reason why you are seeing segfaults is because the 0x7c801ad4 for VirtualAllocEx() probably moved between reboots, as a result of ASLR, but which is visible as a side-effect of enabling DEP and then rebooting.\n\n",
