      "content": "First of all, [esp+5Ch] is not the value of counter. The numbers next to the names of variables / arguments on stack are offsets with respect to ebp. \n\nSo [ebp-5Ch] is the value of the variable counter.\n\nAnd since the variables are accessed via esp, not rbp and there is stack aligning instruction (and esp, FFFFFFF0), I guess IDA is not sure if that instruction will change esp or not, so it won't rename [esp + offset] to an argument or variable, since esp could have different values modulo 16 (i.e. and esp, FFFFFFF0 will not change esp if esp = 11111110, but will change it when esp = 11111118) and thus different values with respect to ebp.\n\n",
