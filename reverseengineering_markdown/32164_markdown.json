  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/32164/how-to-access-the-initialized-data-in-windbg-through-offset-from-ida",
  "content": "In IDA, I see a value called dword_1C0203AB4 which doesn't have a symbol name. I want to view the value in system. My windbg is connected to the system and the driver files in system and IDA is the same. My approach is to calculate the offset and add it to the base memory.\n\n```\nstart\n.text:00000001C0001000 _text           segment para public 'CODE' use64\n.text:00000001C0001000                 assume cs:_text\n.text:00000001C0001000                 ;org 1C0001000h\n.text:00000001C0001000                 assume es:nothing, ss:nothing, ds:_data, fs:nothing, gs:nothing\n.text:00000001C0001000                 db 8 dup(0CCh)\n.text:00000001C0001008\n.text:00000001C0001008 ; =============== S U B R O U T I N E =======================================\n.text:00000001C0001008\n.text:00000001C0001008\n.text:00000001C0001008 ; __int64 __fastcall TcpNotifyBacklogChangeSend(PKSPIN_LOCK SpinLock)\n.text:00000001C0001008 TcpNotifyBacklogChangeSend proc near    ; CODE XREF: TcpNotifyTcbDelay+337↓p\n.text:00000001C0001008                                         ; DATA XREF: .pdata:ExceptionDir↓o\n...\n...\n.data:00000001C0203AB4 dword_1C0203AB4 dd 0FFFFh               ; DATA XREF: CTcpQueryTimeStamp+6↑r\n.data:00000001C0203AB4                                         ; CTcpQueryTimeStamp+51↑w ...\n.data:00000001C0203AB8 icmpPingLowWaterMark dd 1F4h            ; DATA XREF: IppInspectLocalDatagramsIn+5FED5↑r\n.data:00000001C0203ABC EQoSpPolicyAppMarkingSetting dd 0FFFFFFFEh\n.data:00000001C0203ABC                                         ; DATA XREF: EQoSUpdateAppMarkingSetting+A↑r\n.data:00000001C0203ABC                                         ; EQoSProcessGlobalSettings+35↓r ...\n.data:00000001C0203AC0 EQoSpPolicyTcpAutoTuningSetting dd 0FFFFFFFFh\n\n```\nSo the offset should be 202AB4\n\n```\nkd> lm m tcpip\n\nstart     end      module name\nfffff803'6b750000 fffff803'6ba6a000  tcpip (pdb symbols)  \n\n```\nHowever, the value is not what I want(0xFFFF) and the initial address function in IDA and windbg is not the same\n\n```\nkd> u fffff8036b750000\ntcpip!

The below command should work but it didn't subtract the real image base and the output was the same as the wrong one.\n\n```\nida_ida.inf_get_min_ea()-idc.get_screen_ea()\n\n```\n",
