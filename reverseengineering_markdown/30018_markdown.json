  "content": "I am reversing an APK and there is a signature that needs to be found.\nThe function from where the signature is generated is present in the .so file.\n\nI did small debugging. While doing it, the debugger shows all other processes, and when it is actually creating a signature, it automatically returns from the .so file to the apk and give the result in byte array format which is 92 of length, and after converting it to hex, it returns 192 hash value.\n\nFor all the input cases input length is 100 or 1000 the output hash value is 192.\n\nCan anyone help me like which encryption gives 192 hash value?\n\nI got all the information except the actual signature generation part. I can also share the assembly code if someone wants to help me.\n\n",
