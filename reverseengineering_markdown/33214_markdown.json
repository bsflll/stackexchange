  "content": "I have this mouse https://www.hp.com/gb-en/shop/product.aspx?id=6vy95aa&opt=abb&sel=acc\n\nI wonder if it is possible to reverse engineer firmware and add functionality in mouse? if yes what is the starting point(book/article etc) to do this? Its closed source but just wondering\n\nwhat is the starting point for learning hardware reverse engineering?\n\ne.g. Putting mouse to deep sleep when not in use, I guess it eats up battery even if not using\n\n",

If you happen to spot a flash chip, look up its specs and see if you can dump it and make sense of it with binwalk, for example. This question is really very open-ended, despite being about a specific device.",
