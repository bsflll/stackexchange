Perhaps you also want to state the exact Ghidra version you're using so it doesn't cause confusion in the future when others find your Q&A. I'll leave this open in case someone knows a way to work around it. PS: it would also be great if you could add more detail such as an example where you contrast the outcome from Ghidra and that from the Hex-Rays decompiler plugin. PPS: IDA is a disassembler and the decompiler Hex-Rays offers is a plugin to it.",
