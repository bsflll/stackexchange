  "content": "I'm writing a DLL for a program that needs to run in an infinite loop (with delays, of course). For example:\n\n```\nwhile (true) {\n    std::cout << \"I am running.  \n\";\n    Sleep(1000);\n}\n\n```\nI'm not sure how but no matter how I do this, the target program closes itself after a couple minutes. I know that it is not the DLL's presence because if I don't have an infinite loop and it \"completes\" (but stays in memory) it doesn't detect anything.\n\nI am using Cheat Engine to inject the DLL. It is detected both when I inject it normally and when I have the loop in a separate function and create a thread for it.\n\nIf there aren't a few easy and easy to patch ways to detect things like this, what are alternatives? I'm writing it as a DLL because I need to call functions within the process (CreateRemoteThread-ing the bases wouldn't be easy because most of them have many more than one argument).\n\n",

But with some luck, the fact that your threads would only run for a fraction of a second under this proposal, it would be much less likely for the program to detect them.\n\n",

I wrote an assembly script to handle the conventions I need and allocate & write it, then when I need to call a func I allocate & write a structure containing the convention, address, num of args, and args and pass a pointer to it as an arg to the function with CreateRemoteThread. Probably a lot harder than it has to be but it works, at least. Thanks",
