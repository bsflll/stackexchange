  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/16769/ida-create-process-flow-map-between-2-sub-routines",
  "content": "Using IDA, can I specify 2 Sub-Routines (really, it's 2 WINAPI calls) and have IDA create a \"map\" between the 2 points? I want to know all the possible branches the EIP can take from one instruction to another instruction.\n\nI am using IDA-Pro 6.0 (or 6.1).\n\nThank you.\n\nEdit - I can only use static analysis tools for this.\n\n",
