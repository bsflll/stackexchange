  "content": "I am using gdb-gef and I've searched the manual several times for the answer to this question. Sometimes I run a lot of commands and I would like to re-draw the current program state the way gef displays it when I step through the program (registers + stack + list view, etc...). Yes, I am able to get much of the same info with the info registers, info frame, etc... But I have not found a way to do this and it would be helpful.\n\n",
