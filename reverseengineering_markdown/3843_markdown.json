If you are looking at PPC code, unfortunately the PPC processor module does not support the Assemble... command on the Patch Program menu. Once you have made the changes that you want, use the File/Produce file/Create DIF file menu item to save an IDA style dif file. There is a utility here: http://idabook.com/examples/chapter_14/ida_patcher.c that may be used to apply your dif against the original binary to patch it.\n\n",

If the former, the easiest way is to upgrade to IDA 6.2 or later which includes a \"Edit/Patch/Apply patches to input file\" menu option that pushes all the changes into the original binary without the need to generate a dif file. If the latter, the easiest thing is the simply use the hex view to edit the database. In either case, IDA's PPC module is not going to do the assembly for you.",
