  "content": "I have heard countless stories on the Old Red Cracker, also known as +ORC, being the founding father of reverse engineering tutorials.\n\nI also read somewhere that he left some riddles to find his \"secret page\" and he disappeared into thin air.\n\nDid anyone really solve these riddles? Is the identity, or some of the background, of that person known?\n\n",

See http://www.home.aone.net.au/~byzantium/found/found4.html\n\nAs for +ORC himself, there's some more info at http://www.woodmann.com/crackz/Orc.htm\n\nThe last time I spoke with Fravia+ about +ORC, Fravia+ said that +ORC became obsessed with the pyramids in Egypt and went there to study them. He contracted some kind of illness while there and died rather suddenly. If I remember correctly, Fravia+ learned of +ORC's death through +ORC's son.\n\n",

But it seems that no one will ever know for sure. Certainly not if +ORC is dead now. Him having a son (which is old enough to contact Fravia+, I guess) means that he's probably older than suggseted in CrackZ's page.",
