  "content": "I am reversing a program that has a lot of internal structs in it.\n\nThe problem is that there are a lot of structs, so i can't import them manually using local types->insert.\n\nLets say i have some header files that have all the definitions of these structs (but obviously a lot of other stuff as well like defines, since its an actual header file), is there anyway i can import this in IDA?\n\nI cannot manually add structs because there are more than 1000 structs in these header files\n\n",
