  "content": "I'm trying to run an IDAPython script in IDA 7.1 on Windows 10 and it runs just fine when I run it from the Script File... command, but if when I run it from the command line it isn't working properly. My command to run it from the command line is:\n\nida64 -A -SC:\\path\\to\\script\\databaseAll.py C:\\path\\to\\ELFexecutable\\target0\n\nIf I open the file in the graphical interface first and pack the database, then it works from the command line in creating the database correctly, but otherwise it has a lot of information that's missing.\n\nAm I doing something wrong? How do you properly run a script from the command line?\n\n",
