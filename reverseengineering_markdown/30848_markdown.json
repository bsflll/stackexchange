  "content": "I have a router I'd like to virtualize in order to do some dynamic analysis.\nI could virtualize individual binaries with qemu, but I'd like to have the whole ecosystem up and running.\n\nI'll start here:\n\n```\n$ file firmware.bin\nfirmware.bin: data\n\n```\nOkay, binwalk to the rescue.\n\n```\n$ binwalk -e firmware.bin\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4755          0x1293          UBI erase count header, version: 1, EC: 0x0, VID header offset: 0x800, data offset: 0x1000\n\n```\nGreat, I've got something.\nThe UBI is a little funky, but with a little legwork, I've got two files.\n\n```\n$ file rootfs.ubfs\nrootfs.ubfs: Squashfs filesystem, little endian, version 1024.0, compressed, 7852451465615376384 bytes, 906821632 inodes, blocksize: 1024 bytes, created: Wed Mar 26 08:01:38 2092\n\n$ xxd kernel.ubfs | head\n00000000: d00d feed 0043 8904 0000 0038 0043 8598  .....C.....8.C..\n00000010: 0000 0028 0000 0011 0000 0010 0000 0000  ...(............\n00000020: 0000 006c 0043 8560 0000 0000 0000 0000  ...l.C.`........\n00000030: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 0000 0000  ................\n00000040: 0000 0003 0000 0004 0000 005c 6298 dbf6  ...........\\b...\n00000050: 0000 0003 0000 0027 0000 0000 4152 4d20  .......'....ARM\n00000060: 4f70 656e 5772 7420 4649 5420 2846 6c61  OpenWrt FIT (Fla\n00000070: 7474 656e 6564 2049 6d61 6765 2054 7265  ttened Image Tre\n00000080: 6529 0000 0000 0003 0000 0004 0000 000c  e)..............\n00000090: 0000 0001 0000 0001 696d 6167 6573 0000  ........images..\n\n```\nLooks like my version of file isn't picking up on the \"kernel.bin\" file, but\nwe can see that it's an OpenWrt FIT.\n\nI'm not quite sure where to go from here.\nkernel.bin seems to maybe be a dtb or \"Device Tree Blob\".\nI think I need all of the information stored in the dtb in order to properly virtualize.\nMy understanding is that the dtb lays out physical memory addresses and interrupt request lines\nneeded to communicate with other devices, some of which may be virtualizable by qemu.\nA dtb file can even be passed to qemu\nwith the -dtb option.\n\nAt this point, I'm still thinking I need a kernel.\nI can build one from the GPL source of the same model, but different hardware revision.\nLike usual, GPL sources aren't out for the latest firmwares / models.\n\nSo where is the kernel?\nA binwalk on kernel.bin and a strings later, I find a recognizable kernel\nstring in the kernel.bin file.\n\n```\n$ strings E4 | grep \"too many orphaned sockets\"\n6TCP: too many orphaned sockets\n\n```\nMakes sense. The 0xe4 bytes extracted are probably a decompression stub.\nThen I was able to grep on a decompressed kernel image.\n\nThis isn't a kernel image.\nThere's an openwrt FIT stub in front of the decompression stub?\nThat makes sense.\n\nSo there's a rootfs, and a dtb.\nThe kernel appears to be in embedded in the dtb.\nThe logical thing would be to figure out the OpenWrt FIT format.\nMy google-fu isn't helping much here.\n\nCan an \"OpenWrt FIT\" kernel be virtualized in qemu?\nI'm having trouble finding documentation on the format.\n\n",
