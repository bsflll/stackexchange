  "content": "I am new to reverse engineering and I was trying to debug why a 3rd party application was crashing when I m injecting my DLL in it. (There are some cases where it didn't crash)\n\nSo I was able to figure out from a set of instructions/subroutine where the application was throwing an error. There is was able to figure out that it was probably getting a null pointer for some TLS value.\n\nHere is my question w.r.t to this problem\nI want to break/notify my debugger whenever a value is getting changed at that given TLS slot.\n\nI'll add the ASM to make better sense, This is the disassembly of kernel32!TlsGetValue. I want to watch the TLS slots for the given thread. To put it in simple words I want to add watcher for GS:[0x1480]\n\nDoes anyone have any idea how to do it x64dbg?\n\n\n\n",
