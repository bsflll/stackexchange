  "content": "I understand that this question will be rather vague, but I'm unsure how to process from here.\n\nI'm trying to see how a key generator can be made.\n\nI have been toying with IDA and managed to reconstruct an application key checking functions into C up to a point that I can check if a key is valid or not. This process uses a lot of bitwise operations such as shifting and masking which leaves me wondering how I can reverse that algo.\n\nThe validation steps are as follow :\n\nSo this whole thing is rather complicated. Furthermore there is constant loss of information so writing code with exact reverse order of operations is not possible (or I don't know how).\n\nI put myself in the shoes of someone who wants to create this protection scheme. Generating serials from decoded output MUST be possible. Either this whole process is reversible, or there is a function that can act as a backdoor like thing to reverse it right away, which I strongly doubt.\n\nAny idea on things that I should look for at this point?\n\n",
