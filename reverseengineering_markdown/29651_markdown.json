  "content": "I have implemented packer of x86_64 shared library.\nBriefly, a loader is injected to a shared library, and\nthe rela.dyn entry is modified such that it points to the address of the loader. Once the loader is triggered, it decrypts the .text section and finally jump to the address of the .text section.\n\nThe mechanism works fine for x86_64 shared library.\nBut it failed on aarch64 shared library.\n\nQuestions:\n\nThe result of readelf is provided bellow.\nlibtest.so is the library before packing.\nWhile libtest_packed.so is the library after packing.\n\nhere is the result of readelf --relocs libtest.so\n\n```\nRelocation section '.rela.dyn' at offset 0x550 contains 7 entries:\n000000010df0  000000000403 R_AARCH64_RELATIV                    780\n000000010df8  000000000403 R_AARCH64_RELATIV                    738\n000000011018  000000000403 R_AARCH64_RELATIV                    11018\n000000010fc8  000300000401 R_AARCH64_GLOB_DA 0000000000000000 _ITM_deregisterTMClone + 0\n000000010fd0  000400000401 R_AARCH64_GLOB_DA 0000000000000000 __cxa_finalize@GLIBC_2.17 + 0\n000000010fd8  000500000401 R_AARCH64_GLOB_DA 0000000000000000 __gmon_start__ + 0\n000000010fe0  000700000401 R_AARCH64_GLOB_DA 0000000000000000 _ITM_registerTMCloneTa + 0\n\n```\nthe functions corresponding to the first 3 entries are:\n\n```\n0000000000000780 t frame_dummy\n0000000000000738 t __do_global_dtors_aux\n000000000011018 d __dso_handle\n\n```\nhere is the result of readelf --relocs libtest_packed.so\n\n```\nRelocation section '.rela.dyn' at offset 0x550 contains 7 entries:\n  Offset          Info           Type           Sym.

I overwrite\nthe frame_dummy pointer such that the program can jump to the .text\nsection, base on this project\n\nhttps://github.com/0xN3utr0n/Noteme/blob/master/injection.c\n\nThe mechanism of my loader is inspired by\nhttps://github.com/sebastiencs/Packer_ELF\n\n",
