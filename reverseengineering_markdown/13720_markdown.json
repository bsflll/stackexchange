  "content": "Goal:\n\n1 - To load a older version of the firmware on the device because it has features the newer version does not.\n\n2 - To set the player up as a multi-boot (U-boot). key press for original OS or my custom compiled linux OS.\n\nHardware:\n\nmp3 player based on mx23 from Freescale, mmc/SD storage 8GB, USB, 4“ LCD, UART.\n\nI have 3 of the players and as far as I can tell the hardware is the same between the players. (LCD, MMC, UART, etc)\n\nOTP eFuse sets the boot mode as SD_MBR_BOOT—SD Master Boot Record (MBR) mode.\nThey do NOT use Boot Control Block (BCB). (see question)\n\nOn one of the players I have soldered to the UART test pads and with a buffer connected to a PC serial port. \nI will call this the TEST player, and the other 2 that do not have the UART soldered I will call DONOR-1 and DONOR-2.\n\nThe TEST player has the newer firmware that I would like to replace with the older firmware. \nDONOR-1 and DONOR-2 both have an older firmware version.\n\nI also have a firware-update.SB file that is the newer version.\n\nI have 4 unique firmware.SB files all different versions. Two of them contain the feature I want.\n\nWhat I have done so far:\n\nWith a custom compiled linux, I have made an image of the original OS from the mmc using dd. Image is in 3 parts due to 3G limit of fat32. This has been done for all 3 players. I load linux using the HID recovery mode.\n\nI am able to dd the TEST image to the TEST player without any problems.\n\nIf I replace any of the SB files with the other 3 the player will not boot. The LCD back light does come on.\n\nIf I dd the whole image from the DONORs the player will not boot. The LCD back light will come on.\n\nI have decrypted the recovered SB file from the images with sbtoelf (Rockbox). I have done the same with my image that has u-boot and linux in it as a comparison.\n\nThe firmware SB files have 8 sections in them. 3 bootable and 5 clear text.\n\nMy SB file has 1 section. Bootable.\n\nI have used ‘arm_disass’ to disassemble the ELF files. My knowledge here is weak, but I dont think that the disassemble program catches when the code switches between 16bit Thumb2 instructions and 32bit ARM instructions...\n\nIn short I am not able to get any firmware to boot on the TEST device except the one that originally came from it.\n\nThe partition tables does not make sense to me.\n\nfdisk -l\n\n```\nsectors  = 512\n\n```\nTEST\n\n```\np1* 193406   15859711  7833153   1  FAT12\np2       4     126207    63102  53  OnTrack DM6 Aux\np3  189310     191357     1024   1  FAT12\np4  191358     193405     1024   1  FAT12\n\n```\nDONOR-1 is similar but not exact\n\nThe players have a FAT32 partition that is larger that 7GB when it is plugged into a computer. Shows up as a mass storage device. This is where the media lives. Notice the missing blocks.\n\nThe firmware includes the MBR_SIGMATEL_ID after the MBR signature (55AA).\n\nMBR and MBR_SIGMATEL_ID of TEST\n\nWorking with the TEST player and its good image:\n\nI have removed the MBR_SIGMATEL_ID and there is not change in the way the player boots or does not boot.\n\nI am not sure what to do next. Any suggestions?\n\nSTMP3780 “Safe Binary” u-boot linux-fslc mx23 imx233  ARMv5\n\n",
