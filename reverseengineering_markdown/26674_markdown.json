      "content": "Depending on the specific instruction set encoding, regular expressions operating on the binary itself may be flexible enough to ignore the parts which would change based on address.\n\nPiping the code through a naive disassembler and running the regular expression engine on the textual ouptut may be preferable to doing so on the binary as it's a lot easier to wire rules that ignore particular operands when they've been split out (though you would now be doing a multi-line match)\n\nSometimes it's not worth worrying about the right tool for the job, but just whipping up some code in your favorite language-of-convenience (today, probably python) to solve a one-time need.\n\nIt's also quite possible you could just do this with a text editor to find part  of the pattern and then manually check the candidates for a complete match./\n\n",

      "content": "Would disassembly, split off the instruction column, then diff, followed by manually comparing using side-by-side text editors (of the disassembled output of each) be fast and simple enough for a one off use.\n\nOtherwise you need a smart comparison that knows that registers and memory locations can be interchanged for each other as long as each is consistent throughout; resulting in the same output - and thus each section of code having an identical function, those sections would be a copy of each other.\n\nIt depends on how much code you have to check and how often you intend to do this.\n\nOne advantage of the so-called smart comparison is that it can iterate over the code, shifting by one address, and find every possible way to match; resulting in a few false positives that need to be manually identified.\n\nA disadvantage of relying on a disassembler is that it can miss (or go out of sync) and fail to disassemble a few sections of code; leaving some possible matches (or near matches) unfound - leading to a Copyright claim.\n\nA program capable of an exhaustive comparison may be more useful than one that only discovers low hanging fruit. It's a matter of the intended end-use and the investment in the project necessary for the results that are expected to be had.\n\n",
