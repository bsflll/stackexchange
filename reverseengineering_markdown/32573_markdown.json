  "content": "I have decompiled an app that uses the Play integrity API.\n\nI attach the Frida-gadget and rebuild/resign the apk.\nAfter installing it on an unrooted phone (that passes the Play integrity API), the repacked app does not seems to pass it anymore (makes sense because the 'Genuine app binary' part of PI is broken).\nIn the Frida script I hook the following function to make it return com.android.vending\n\nBut still integrity fails. Is there any known method to pass integrity?\n\nI tried the same on a rooted phone with Play  Integrity Fix module (magisk) installed and have gotten the same result.\n\nAre there other function which are used to determine app integrity that I can hook?\n\n",

So I would expect that Google implemented the check at least in Play Services or even distributed between Play Services and some backend server.",

(In a simalar way that the Play Integrity Fix module fools the services on rooted phones to pass PI. I think that it might perhaps work when I fake the getPackageInfo.signatures result, I will try it when I find some time. The app should normally be installed from the Play Store (if not it gives a warning to do so).",

      "content": "You won't pass it as long as you tampered with the app ( signature is changed/ Signature integrity is broken )\n\nThat's the point of Google's App Integrity. It's a four way communication; between android app, app server, google play services & google servers.\n\nUnless you reverse engineer the play services, anti-tampering will be difficult to bypass. I'm not even sure if you can bypass it even after reverse engineering google play services.\n\nWhat is the solution ? How can I change the app's code/behavior ?\n\nDon't tamper with the app statically. Root your phone, and use frida or LSPosed to hook & tamper with the app. That will ensure that signature integrity isn't broken & you have actually modified the app code. Make sure your rooted phone passes Play Integrity.\n\nIf the amount of code you are changing is huge & hooking dynamically will slow the app down, then there are also ways to solve it.\n\nHow can I see this protection in action ?\n\nInstall \"Play Integrity API checker\" from play store. Open it and click \"Check\", and after the results, click on \"<>\" button to see the response. Take a screenshot or note it down.\n\nNow, just resign the app & install it. Try it again, it'll pass the tests again. Click on \"<>\" to see response and screenshot/note it down.\n\nNow, compare both responses. You'll notice that it'll fail some tests. \"UNRECOGNIZED_VERSION\", \"UNEVALUATED\" is what you'll see on some values instead of positive values. That's app integrity.\n\nSource code of both the app itself & server is available on Github. Try tampering with them (it should be easy now, right ? Since you have the source code now ) and try to pass those failed test. Spoilers: You won't be able to, because Google checks for the app's signature, not app itself.\n\nReference:\nhttps://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10183279\n\n",
