  "content": "I am using the websocket module for my client in python3, and I am trying to troubleshoot some errors I am getting that lead to the client disconnecting after seemingly random intervals.\nWhen I enabled trace with websocket.enableTrace(True) I can see some entries that I am not sure how to decrypt. Here is an example:\n\nThread-3:send: b'\\x88\\x82\\xc1$\\xf7\\xa6\\xc2\\xcc'\n\nAny idea how to decrypt the message and see if this could explain the source of my problem?\n\nThank you!\n\n",
