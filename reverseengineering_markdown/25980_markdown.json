  "content": "I was trying to extract data from an Android app which uses SQLcipher. SQLcipher is an extension of SQLite that encrypts database files with 256-bit AES.\n\nWithin the APK, the library lies in lib/libsqlcipher.so. I'm curious if I can extract the encryption key simply by modifying libsqlcipher.so(e.g. modify sqlite3_key function so that it logs the encryption key to file). The plan is to compile my own version of libsqlcipher.so, repack APK, install it, and run it on a device.\n\nWill this method work as expected? It sounds too easy to be true:)\n\n",
