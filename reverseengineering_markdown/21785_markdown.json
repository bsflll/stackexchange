  "content": "I do kernel debugging by using a virtual com port. One machine (host) is debugging the other machine. I have a remote machine that has IDA, and I wish to connect to the debugging session in the host machine.\n\nThe setup is as here \n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/remote-debugging-using-kd\n\nI also followed the guide here. \n\nSo I setup a server using .server tcp:port=5004 (on a kernel kd session). \n\nWhen I connect remotely by using cdb -remote tcp:Port=5004,Server=HOST\nit works. But when I try to connect using IDA, it doesn't work. \n\nI have IDA 7.0 x64. I tried to use windbg(x64) debugger with connection string tcp:Port=5004,Server=HOST and parameter -remote and many other variations. It failed to launch in all cases. \n\nIt usually types: \n\n```\nWindbg: using debugging tools from 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\Debuggers\\x64\\'\nConnecting in kernel mode with 'tcp:port=5004,server=HOST'\nConnect failed: The parameter is incorrect.\n\n```\nWhat did I do wrong?\n\nBTW, the version of the debugging tools of IDA and in the host machine is the same. \n\n",
