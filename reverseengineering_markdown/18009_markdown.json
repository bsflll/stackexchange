      "content": "Actually, there is no lea edx, [0x80490c8] for 64-bits addressing modes. Since, afaik, in all 64-bits addressing modes lea is a register relative opcode.\n\nAnyway, if you want to know the bytecodes that represent an instruction using radare2 you can use the pa command.\n\nIn 32-bits mode it'll look like this:\n\n```\n[0x00000000]> e asm.bits=32\n[0x00000000]> pa lea edx, [0x80490c8]\n8d15c8900408\n[0x00000000]> pad 8d15c8900408\nlea edx, [0x80490c8]\n\n```\nIn 64-bits mode it'll look like this:\n\n```\n[0x00000000]> e asm.bits=64\n[0x00000000]> pa lea edx, [0x80490c8]\n488d15c8900408\n[0x00000000]> pad 488d15c8900408\nlea rdx, [rip + 0x80490c8]\n\n```\nYou can see that radare2 knows that lea edx, [0x80490c8] can't be expressed in 64bits so it uses a RIP relative expression.\n\n",
