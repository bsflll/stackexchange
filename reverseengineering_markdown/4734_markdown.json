  "content": "I am trying to understand assembly and buffer overflows on a 64bit Intel i7 machine. I am having a lot of questions. I asked on SO but I don't have any satisfactory answers. I also don't get why there are MOV instructions to EEDI, ESI and EDI instead of PUSH instructions. Perhaps I should understand assembly on modern architectures first. Can anyone answer my qustions and point me to right learning resources for modern architectures? (I am asking here because people doing REing do have knowledge about assembly and are more targeted audience as compared to the broader audience on SO)\n\n",
