  "content": "I'm just learning to use IDA and according to the book, when using Search function (Search>text..., for example) I should see a window with the found results, like this:\n\n\nHowever, when the search is over, if something is found, I only see in the bottom Search completed text and if I scroll the IDA View-A window, I can see that the text is highlighted. Text string gethostbyname was searched here:\n\nI cannot see all the instances at the same time as expected. \n\nThe version I use is IDA 5.0, free version; it's the same version that the book was based on. How can I get the results to show? \n\n",
