  "content": "I have following code disassembled by ghidra:\n\n```\nPUSH      EBX\nPUSH      dword ptr [EBP + param_1]             wchar_t * _Format for swprintf\nPUSH      u_%s\\%s_0040eb88                      size_t _Count for swprintf\nPUSH      dword ptr [EBP + param_3]             wchar_t * _String for swprintf\nCALL      dword ptr [->MSVCRT.DLL::swprintf]\n\n```\nThe 2nd parameter is unicode string %s\\%s, but it should be size_t parameter, because swprintf function requires count parameter\n\nThis is another code which uses the same function:\n\n```\nLEA       EAX=>local_4dc,[0xfffffb28 + EBP]\nPUSH      EAX                                        wchar_t * _Format for swprintf\nLEA       EAX=>windowsDir,[0xfffffd30 + EBP]\nPUSH      _Count_0040f40c                            size_t _Count for swprintf\nPUSH      EAX                                        wchar_t * _String for swprintf\nCALL      EDI=>MSVCRT.DLL::swprintf\n\n```\nAgain, _Count_0040f40c is unicode string %/Program Data detected as _Count\n\nGhidra has correct function signature:\n\n```\nint swprintf (wchar_t * _String, size_t _Count, wchar_t * _Format, ...)\n\n```\nNormal count parameter is always missing, what Ghidra detects doesn't refer to number type variable. It looks like if all functions were compiled without it. All those memory variables ghidra detects as count parameters are actually format parameters. If there was actual count parameter every time swprintf was called, everything would be looking good.\n\n",
