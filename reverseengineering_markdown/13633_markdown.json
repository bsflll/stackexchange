  "content": "I'm using Rpetrich's Theos repository and I'm using tweak.xmi for making tweak on multiple files for easier in management.\n\nI can build and run successfully except one thing: I cannot use  hookf. Before that, when I put all source code inside one tweak.x, everything works normal. But now, everytime I compile, I meet this error:\n\n```\nerror: %orig found outside of hook or subclass \n\n```\nOne example of my hook is:\n\n```\n%hookf(int, uname, struct utsname *value) {\n    int ret = %orig;\n    strcpy(value->machine, getModelIdentifier());\n    strcpy(value->nodename, getHostname());\n    return ret;\n}\n\n```\nUpdate:\n\nHere is my tweak that using MSHookFunction\n\n```\n#import \"substrate.h\"\n\nstatic int (*original_gethostname)(char *, size_t);\n\nstatic int replace_gethostname(char *value, size_t valueLen) {\n    int ret = gethostname(value, valueLen);\n    if (value) strcpy(value, \"thao\");\n    return ret;\n}\n\n%ctor {\n    %init(_ungrouped)\n    MSHookFunction((void*)gethostname, (void*)replace_gethostname, (void**)&original_gethostname);\n}\n\n```\n",

If you just want to separate the hooks into different files, simply put all the *.xm/*.x and into the _FILES setting:\n\n```\ntweakname_FILES = first.x second.x third.x\n\n```\n",
