  "content": "While debugging and reverse-engineering my exe, I have found a very weird thing.\n\n```\ncall ds:GetModuleFileNameA\n\n```\nThis call instruction is formed with below hex bytes in IDA.\n\n```\nFF 15 24 C0 41 00\n\n```\n(I think that 0x41C024 means the index of Import Table)\n\nBut when I looked this call instruction while debugging it looks as follow.\n\n```\nFF 15 24 C0 1A 00\n\n```\n(Of course, image base is changed 190000 from 400000)\n\nBut what I don't understand is how OS (I use win10) automatically changed all offsets in code area.\n\nCan anybody explain?\n\n",

      "content": "It is Called Relocation\nEvery Executable has a section called .reloc  \n\nthis Section contains details about all addresses that needs to be patched if the imagebase changes \n\nthe loader uses this section to change all the modified base address \n\nfor example win7 x86 32 bit calc.exe \n\ndisassembly from cdb.exe (randomised image base )\n\n```\n002616a3 ff15f4132600    call    dword ptr [calc!_imp__LoadStringW (002613f4)]\n\n```\ndisassembly from dumpbin (default imagebase)\n\n```\nC:\\>dumpbin  /nologo c:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe /disasm /range:0x10016A2,0x10016b1\n\n  010016A2: 50                 push        eax\n  010016A3: FF 15 F4 13 00 01  call        dword ptr [__imp__LoadStringW@16]\n\n```\nif you look at the .reloca section you will notice a HIGHLOW entry for address \n6A5\n\n```\nOffset(h) 00 01\n\n000B9C00  00 10  ..\n000B9C02  00 00  ..\n000B9C04  B4 00  ´.\n000B9C06  00 00  ..\n000B9C08  41 36  A6\n000B9C0A  52 36  R6\n000B9C0C  A5 36  ¥6 <<<<<\n000B9C0E  B3 36  ³6\n\n```\nso the loader can patch the address at RVA ( ImageBase + base of Section + address ) \n\n```\nimagebase = 0x1000000 + base of section = 0x1000 + HIGHLOW address = 6a5 \n= 0x10016a5\n\n```\nat this address dumpbin has F4 13 00 01  whereas cdb has f4 13 26 00 \n\nthe loader has patched it according to the image base \n\nthis post of mine has more details about what is patched \n\nupdate wrt comment some exes dont have .reloc \n\nyes it is entirely possible to have exes without reloc\ninfact there is a msvc linker switch /FIXED if passed produces exes without relocations   \n\nin most of the cases exes can survive without relocations because they are the first to be loaded in Process Address Space\nso they tend to get their Preferred ImageBase always \n\nRelocations matter most with Dlls especially those dlls that woud be Dynamically Loaded or loaded as a dependency to another dll \n\nin this case clashes can happen and os needs a mechanism to relocate  the binary in question \n\nif windows cant relocate the dll it crashes the application with \n\n```\nC:\\>cdb -c \"!error c0000018;q\" cdb | tail -n 3\n0:000> cdb: Reading initial command '!error c0000018;q'\nError code: (NTSTATUS) 0xc0000018 (3221225496) - {Conflicting Address Range}  The specified address range conflicts with\n the address space.\nquit:\n\n```\n",
