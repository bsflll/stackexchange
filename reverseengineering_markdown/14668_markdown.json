  "content": "What I would like to know is whether or not I have sufficient information to determine a particular checksum algorithm being used.\n\nIn my case I have a very large stream of data with many frames of data and their respective checksums. Here is what I know:\n\nIs this a sufficient amount of information to determine a checksum algorithm? I also have many samples so I could try out a particular checksum algorithm on all the samples to see whether/not the algorithm will work in each case.\n\nHere is more information that may clarify things:\n\n",
