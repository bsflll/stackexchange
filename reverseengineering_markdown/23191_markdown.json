  "content": "I am reversing some Motorola 9s12 (68hc12) code and using IDA pro.\nI am having the strangest issue.\n\nThe code makes a call to a function:\n\n```\nROM:B300                 call    $BFF7, #$FE\n\n```\nwhen I go to the function and make it a function\nwith the P key (auto analysis does not pick this \nup as a function) \n\nROM:BFF7 sub_BFF7:\nROM:BFF7                 ldab    #$46 ; 'F'\nROM:BFF9                 stab    byte_3C\nROM:BFFB                 clrb\nROM:BFFC                 clra\nROM:BFFD                 rtc\n\nIDA fails to insert the function name \n(in this case sub_BFF7) into  the original call.\n\nWhat am I missing here?\n\nThe original call still reads:\n\n```\nROM:B300 sub_B300:\nROM:B300                 call    $BFF7, #$FE\n\n```\nSomehow the XREF'ing is not working.\n\n",
