  "content": "I overcame recent issues with a redefinition and finished my Plugin.\n\nIn short this plugin uses Hex-Rays Decompiler to decompile a given file, analyzes properties of the pseudocode and then appends the results to a .csv\n\nNow I tried to use this in batch mode, but was stumped as the following happened:\n\nCmd input to call IDA:\n\n```\nidaw -A -c -Srecompile.idc input_file\n\n```\nThe recompile.idc file:\n\n```\n#include <idc.idc>\nstatic main() {\nWait();\nMessage(\"Hello world from IDC!  \n\");\nRunPlugin(\"REcompile vs Hexrays\",0); \n//Exit(0);\n}\n\n```\nI obviously need to Wait() for Auto-Analysis. Exit() is commented since it's for use when this is all fixed.\n\nNow i do get the following output on execution:\n\n```\nThe initial autoanalysis has been finished.\nHello world from IDC!\n\nLoadLibrary(C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA\\plugins\\REcompile vs Hexrays.plw) error: Das angegebene Modul wurde nicht gefunden.\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\IDA\\plugins\\REcompile vs Hexrays.plw: can't load file\nHex-Rays Decompiler plugin has been loaded (v1.6.0.111005)\nHex-rays version 1.6.0.111005 has been detected, REcompile vs Hexrays ready to use\n\n```\nAs you can see the script is executed before the plugins are loaded. I assume this is the reason why I get the LoadLibrary Error.\n\nIf you have any other input or experience with plugin batch execution i'd be happy to hear from you.\n\nGreetings, \nViktor\n\n",
