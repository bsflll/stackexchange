  "content": "I have a library of ~65MB which uses this \"technique\" as a kind of PIC.\n\nFirst, it gets some kind of base address (it is always the same):\n\n```\n0x00708497      e800000000     call 0x70849c\n0x0070849c      5b             pop ebx\n0x0070849d      81c3ac442601   add ebx, 0x12644ac\n\n```\nAnd then it's used to reference strings or global variables:\n\n```\n0x007084bc      8d832e29a8ff   lea eax, [ebx - 0x57d6d2]\n\n```\nSo, is there any analysis command which could find these references?\n\n",
