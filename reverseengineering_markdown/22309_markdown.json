  "content": "I noticed that Hex-Ray have been keeping reward to people who find \"security vulnerabilities\" of IDA-Pro.:\n\nSo here is my question, how come a decompiler can have \"security vulnerabilities\"? And more importantly, is there any real-world example to attack decompilers or disassemblers? Or can I perform certain kind of \"malware evading attacks\" by abusing the decompiler bugs?\n\n",
