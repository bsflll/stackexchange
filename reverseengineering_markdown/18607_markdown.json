  "content": "Lets say an Android application sends out a traffic out to the server and expects a Json Response\n\nRequest:\n\n```\nhttps://server:port/userid=user1&token=randomstring7345\n\n```\nWe want to replicate the traffic using python library now, the 'randomstring7345' keeps changing everytime, there is a function logic inside the application which generates it on the fly.\n\nIf this was a web application we would have used chrome network tab to do a stack trace once the traffic is generated and then use technical breakpoints to find out the Javascript code which generates the 'randomstring7345'. How can we do the same in Android. first step would be to decompile the application apk I guess and then how do we proceed from there to find out the exact function/logic? \n\nwhat I am trying to do.\n\nfor sake of simplicity, lets say there is an flight reservation android app\n\nHere is the flow:\n\nThe traffic that goes out:\n\n```\nhttps://myflights.com:port/userid=user1&token=login_tokenID&accesstoken=8833456&from=A&to=b&date=2018-06-09\n\n```\nServer sends back Json\na. {Fail : Choose another date}\nb. {Success: confirmed}\n\nnote the flow here the app computes internally accesstoken=8833456 which it supplies in the request else server wont respond to it. I need to find exactly where this logic resides in the app so that I can replicate it.\n\n",

I get partial error while using dex2jar I got most code though but here and there it looks broken...  dex2jar classes.dex -> .\\classes-dex2jar.jar Detail Error Information in File .\\classes-error.zip Please report this file to code.google.com/p/dex2jar/issues/entry if possible.  What I am looking for is a way which can set up breakpoints on the code which stops when maybe when a button is clicked or all the function required to generate a traffic",

Setting up smalidea can be tricky so i wish you good luck. :)   btw. cant you just find the endpoint in the jd-gui search and read the app logic from there?",
