  "content": "I am trying to analyze and disassemble a raw binary that does not have an ELF header using IDA Pro.\n\nI have been trying to convert to code using MakeCode, but have not gotten anywhere as the binary is quite large.\n\nI know it is supposed to be a 32 bit LSB binary, and Ghidra decompiles the same raw binary without any problems. However, I do prefer the IDA decompiler to Ghidra which is why I am trying to make it work in IDA as well.\n\nThe main problem is that the list of functions is missing (due to missing headers of course), but this does not seem to be a problem for Ghidra.\n\nIs it possible to get the same result in IDA as I get in Ghidra? If so, how? What is the correct way to analyze raw binaries in IDA Pro / Hex-Rays?\n\n",

That should do the trick.\n\n",

I set the processor type to Intel 80686p to represent a somewhat similar CPU to Ghidras Intel/AMD 32-bit x86, and that somewhat worked, but after the analysis I had to convert certain labels to functions manually with p.   The pseudocode after decompilation in IDA is still lacking certain parts that Ghidra has though.",
