  "content": "Since the template classes are different between instantiation, it is extremely difficult for library recognition using universal patterns.\n\nBut the control flow graph and references to system call of those template functions should be almost the same.\n\nSo is there a good and reliable way to identify and recognize these STL classes ?\n\nNote: some classes using template like std::string is fixed. These classes can be recognized by FLAIR (Fast Library Acquisition for Identification and Recognition).\n\n",
