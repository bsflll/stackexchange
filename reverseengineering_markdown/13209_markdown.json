  "content": "I'm trying to get the hang of IDA and I try to reverse engineer some code with a similar code [not 100% the same] to help me, I'm just using it to check.\n\nThe problem is that I came accros this issue:\n\n \n\nHow could I convert this into a friendlier pointer format ?\nThis blocks me because this is not using the classic BASE+OFFSET format plus it's using two variables...\n\nThank you for your help.\n\n",
