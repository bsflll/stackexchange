  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/29138/how-to-make-sense-of-the-pointer-in-reversed-function-call",
  "content": "I have the code below, derived from the reversed function in the original application:\n\n```\ngladius::world::World::create(*(gladius::world::World**)(*(char*)(this + 0x5e8) + 0x50));\n\n```\nThe create function looks like this:\n\n```\nvoid __thiscall gladius::world::World::create(World *this) {\n\n```\nCould someone please describe the way the function is setup and may be simplify the notation above if possible?\n\nSo, this is a create function call, which takes as an argument the pointer to a particular address.\n\nThis is how it looks further in the code:\n\n```\n    this_01 = GUI::getWorld(*(GUI **)(this + 0x88));\n    gladius::world::World::create(this_01);\n\n```\nwhere GUI::getWorld(*(GUI **)(this + 0x88)); points to the following function:\n\n```\nWorld * __thiscall gladius::gui::GUI::getWorld(GUI *this)\n\n{\n  return *(World **)(*(longlong *)(this + 0x5e8) + 0x50);\n}\n\n```\nThis is where the address (this + 0x5e8) + 0x50) came from.\n\nI still don't understand the significance of these addresses, as create is a member function of World and it is called with an instance of that class as a parameter?\n\nAnd the address of that instance is stored in class GUI on the address: (this + 0x5e8) + 0x50)?\n\nOr I am confusing the above and this + 0x5e8 points to some structure in the World class, which must be somewhere at 58/4 or at 58/8 address and then within that structure I am looking at 50/4 member?\n\n",
