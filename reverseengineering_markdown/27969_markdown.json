So I began working on a tool that would emulate certain instructions (especially anything involved with the stack) then create my own \"virtual stack\" that would hold the same information the original program would. This actually worked, except I didn't account for many things, such as JCCs. The end result shown in my tool was over 60 JMPs and over 200 instructions in the final combined dump (this did not even including the multiple JCC branches which can easily have the same or more CF obfuscation). I feel like my attempt was aimed in the wrong direction.\n\nGuidance\n\nWell. Using my tool, I could probably just skim through the entire assembly and figure out what is going on after adding in conditional branch support, however I still feel unsatisfied. My original goal was to produce a completely optimized, decompilable dump, however I feel like I've hit a dead end due to my design flaws.\n\nI want to ask to everyone who has had the patience to read through this post, on their advice carrying forward, whether it's a library recommendation, or how to re-approach the deobfuscation process I had going here.\n\nFor context, I'm analyzing a unpacked dump of a process and using my tool coded in C++ using Zydis disassembler to decode and manually emulate some of the instructions.\n\n",

      "content": "Since this is obviously a pain to do statically or by hand in a dynamic fashion, I would suggest trying another approach.\n\nI personally would try to do it by writing a small emulator.\n\nSince it is mostly 'stack arithmetic' and junk code, this would be perfect. Take a look at the emulation framework named 'Unicorn'.\n\nWith this option, you don't have to re-implement anything, and it will support a lot more cases that a simple 'virtual stack' (as you call it).\n\nYou basically have to map the whole binary in memory, setup an initial stack frame, create a hook for every instructions, and maybe create a breakpoints system for debugging. You can then start the emulation, and inspect the program's behavior and the jmp that where taken.\n\nIf you want to make the code more readable, your hook routine may scan if the current instruction contains a reference to any stack pointer. And if, replace it with the content of the involved variable.\n\nIf you want to only focus on a small portion of code, this is also possible. But you'll have to setup the initial stack/registers state carefully and start at your custom entrypoint\n\n",
