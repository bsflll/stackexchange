  "content": "For some reason i'm not aware of ( some heap allocation limit ) while allocating memory for some classes, an application ( win64 ) raises this exception:\n\n```\nDumpedMini Result[0] Exception Code[EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION]\nFatal: Man.exe caused an EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION(ThdId:10172) in module WApi.dll WApi::COdbcCommand::COdbcCommand(), Source(Wapicodbc.inl:341)\n7FF9ED373847: The instruction at 0x7FF9ED373847 referenced memory at 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.

      "content": "It seems like you have an issue with dereferencing unallocated memory. I don't think that it's related to the heap in any way. It looks like the pointer address that is resolved by ptr [rcx+200h] is in fact points to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF address, and when trying to access this memory, the application crashes, because this page is not allocated.\n\nIn order to investigate the issue, try to understand what is the origin of the bad ecx register value that is used at 00007FF9ED373847 - just follow in the disassembly where is it defined, and what goes wrong in your specific scenario - for example, maybe it's origin a function call, that returned an error, but the return value wasn't checked against error codes.\n\n",
