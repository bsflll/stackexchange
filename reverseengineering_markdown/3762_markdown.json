  "content": "I use IDA Pro 6.1 to disassemble static linked binary on Windows 32bit\n\nSee, in the interactive screen, this subroutine (which is in one library function) can be found:\n\n\n\nBut as I use these two ways to generate asm code:\n\nIn both ways I can find this library function, but I can not find the definition of the subroutine $LN28_0. Which means in the generated asm code, all the jmp $LN28_0 is undefined.\n\nSo, I am wondering if it is a bug of IDA Pro? Or, do I need to configure some things? \n\n",
