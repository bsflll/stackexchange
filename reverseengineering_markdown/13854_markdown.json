  "content": "I am:\n\nI have the whole IDA server set up, I can attach to processes when a classes.dex is loaded into IDA but, when I load the .so file and try to attach, I get this message from IDA\n\nI see a problem with this because I have full root permission and I know for sure the process was not terminated.\n\nI read here that I may have to recompile the entire Android kernel, don't get me wrong, I love wasting hours compiling, but I was just wondering if you guys can help me find something to solve this pesky little situation of mine.\n\nEdit: This may be a dup but the dup wasn't answered and was from 2014. :/\n\n",

      "content": "OK, I'm not 100% sure what you're saying, but it SOUNDS like you're saying that you load the .SO into IDA, and then you're trying to attach to it.\n\nWell, the .SO isn't a PROCESS per se.  It's just a library loaded dynamically by something else.  What you probably need to do, is to load the game/application that USES that .SO, and set a breakpoint at the location where it calls the function(s) that you're interested in, and then just single step into the .SO to see what's going on.\n\n",
