  "content": "I am currently using cheat engine to hack a game. I used the pointer scanner to find some pointers to the pistol ammo memory location. I then went to look for pointers to the shotgun ammo memory location, which obviously is at a different address. Looking at the offset for the shotgun memory location it says is the same offset as the pistol ammo. How can I do a pointer scan for a memory location that has the same offset as another location in memory? I tried running a pointer scan to the shotgun ammo memory location using the same offset as the pistol ammo and it found nothing.\n\n",
