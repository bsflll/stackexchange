  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/3634/why-the-wait-in-idc-script-can-not-work-on-ida-pro",
  "content": "In my IDC script I open a log file, do some analysis, write in the file and close the file like this:\n\n```\nmain(){\nopen_log();\ndo_analysis();\nclose_log();\n}\n\n```\nCurrently I am using this script on command line, and I am trying to close the GUI after analysis(or be more exact, don't not open GUI while analyzing)\n\nHere is command line I use:\n\n```\n\"z:\\ida6.1\\idaq.exe -A -SfunctionEnumeration.idc z:\\Linux\\targetfile\"\n\n```\nI modified my script like this:\n\n```\nmain(){\nopen_log();\ndo_analysis();\nclose_log();\n\nWait();\nExit(0);\n}\n\n```\nCurrently it will generate the log file, but no content in it..\n\nIt seems that IDA Pro is closed before the write operation(or close operation)\non the log file, but I don't understand why because Wait() is called in my script...\n\nI read the IDC manual and haven't find anything useful...\n\nCould anyone give me some help? Thank you!\n\n",
