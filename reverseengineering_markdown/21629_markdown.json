  "content": "I am debugging an apk app that I do not have the sources for. I want to debug it on a smali level, not decompiled.\n\nI used to do this with apktool, but looking at their website, smali-debugging is deprecated and they point to SmaliIdea - a plugin for android studio. So I installed that, and indeed - it works fine: I can step, set breakpoints, view smali registers (v7,v8,v9 etc) when I set a watchpoint on them.\n\nWhat I cant do is actually modify those registers / local variables. I can see them when I set a watchpoint on them, but cant assign a value.\n\nLooking at \"planned features\" of SmaliIdea:\n\nIt doesnt say I cant modify a register at all right now, but doesnt exactly confirm it either.\n\nThis used to be possible with ancient apktool version though! A pretty hefty regression, I would say. (Going back is impractical, too much changed)\n\nQuestion: How can i modify those smali registers while debugging? is there a register view I am missing or something? How do other people debug APK on smali level?\n\n",
