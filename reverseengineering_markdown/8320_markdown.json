  "content": "In a 3rd party application I'm modifying by means of DLL injection, there's a chunk of code that throws an EXCEPTION_SINGLE_STEP exception if it detects changes to the code. To bypass this countermeasure, I wish to catch that exception and discard it completely. However, Windows keeps rethrowing it and therefore my exception handler is stuck in an endless loop.\n\nMy code currently:\n\n```\nLONG WINAPI VEH_Handler(struct _EXCEPTION_POINTERS *ExceptionInfo)\n{\n    printf(\"Got an exception %X at address %X  \n\", ExceptionInfo->ExceptionRecord->ExceptionCode, ExceptionInfo->ExceptionRecord->ExceptionAddress);\n\n    if (ExceptionInfo->ExceptionRecord->ExceptionCode == EXCEPTION_SINGLE_STEP)\n    {\n        return EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION;\n    }\n\n    return EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH;\n}\n\n//...\n\n//in DllMain\nAddVectoredExceptionHandler(1, VEH_Handler);\n\n```\nIs there a way for me to force Windows to forget about the exception and continue execution?\n\n",

      "content": "I assume this is a follow-up on this question.\n\nIf the program you're injecting the DLL into is setting the processor's trap flag, then returning from the exception will restore the trap flag as well, which would explain why the trap exception is thrown again and windows will keep calling your exception handler.\n\nYou might check the stack, find where the pushed flags from the exception are saved, and clear the trap flag before returning (*flagptr &= ~0x100).\n\nHowever, the fact that your application sets the trap flag in the first place might mean one of those two things:\n\nBoth possibilities probably mean that just ignoring the traps won't help you much; you should find the code that sets the trap flag, check why it's doing this, and continue your analysis from there.\n\n",
