  "content": "So basically I use a IDC script to dump the instructions one by one using IDA Pro 6.1, windows 32 bit. PE file format\n\nI use try to dump one opcode instructions like \n\n```\nstosd\nstosb\nstosq\nmovsd\n\n```\nin this way:\n\n```\nfor (addr = funcStart; addr != BADADDR; addr = NextHead(addr, funcEnd)) {\n ......\nauto code;\nline = GetDisasm(addr);\nmnem = GetMnem(addr);\n.......\nif (strstr(line, mnem) != 0) {\n        mnem = line;\n}\nline = form(\"%-8s\", mnem);\n\n```\nBut to my surprise, when meets one opcode instructions like those, mnem get things like\n\n```\nstos\nstos\nstos\nmovs\nmovs\nmovs\n\n```\nBy checking the directly dumped asm file ** File->Produce File->Create ASM File...**, I find those error instructions should be \n\n```\nstosd\nstosd\nstosd\nmovsd\nmovsd\nmovsd\n\n```\nWhich means the results API GetMnem generated is wrong...\n\nCould anyone give me some help? THank you! \n\n",
