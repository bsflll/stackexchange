Using IDA I'm able to identify network calls but when I try to reverse its caller using x shortcut after couple of callers I get stuck at this point:\n\n```\n.text:00407230                 dd offset sub_40600C\n.text:00407234                 dd offset sub_403C30\n.text:00407238                 dd offset nullsub_4\n.text:0040723C                 dd offset sub_40601C\n.text:00407240                 dd offset sub_4039BC\n.text:00407244                 dd offset sub_40C294\n\n```\nI would like to ask how I can proceed further. \n\n",
