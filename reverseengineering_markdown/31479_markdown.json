  "content": "I've been trying to patch a certain functionality of a jar file, that's essentially a GUI app. I've tried numerous java agents -as it seems to be the only viable option for java- for such a task, however quite a few limitations arose. Namely:\n\nI was wondering if there's a better approach -or an alternative that addresses those 'issues'- to go about dynamically analyse java executables, and not just instrumentation; as it seems to be geared more towards debugging during development rather than reverse engineering.\n\n",

It's more about understanding the obfuscated code, by interacting with certain functionalities at the app itself then simultaneously seeing which specific portions are getting called, and selectively inspect them (that's why i was asking for concurrent deobfuscation to omit this separate inspection stage). should be easier with Frida than using an JavaAgent.
