  "content": "It is common to set a breakpoint on oleaut32!DispCallFunc to catch the function call to the ActiveX component and it worked for me until recently. I tried to reverse engineer a ActiveX component I got from some web file storage site and IE does not stop on DispCallFunc. Any other tricks to catch function call to ActiveX ?\n\n",
