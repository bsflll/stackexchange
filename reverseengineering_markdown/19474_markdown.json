Why doesn't it work? And what are my options? \n\nI was also thinking of doing something like:\n\n```\nMOV ECX,DWORD PTR DS:[400400]\nMOV DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-30],ECX\n\n```\nBut I don't know how to add a new line of instruction in ollydbg I was also afraid it would change all the addresses.\n\n",

      "content": "Let's split this up a bit. I'll skip over some stuff that you might already understand, but we may need to expand this if some stuff is not clear.\n\nThe syntax is a bit wonky but we can understand that you want to encode a MOV with two memory operands.\nLet's take a look at some documentation\n\nRef: https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/MOV.html\n\nThere is no possible encoding for MOV that accepts m32,m32. With m32 understood to be a 32 bit pointer.\n\nIt's not obvious this is the case, but unfortunately it is.\n\nRef: https://stackoverflow.com/a/33799523/10279341\n\nThis is a good answer if you care about why, but it is supplemental reading only, not critical to this situation.\n\nSo, if we want to copy memory to memory with x86:\n\nRef: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1299094/10279341\n\nA commonly accepted solution is to use a register as a temporary value store.\n\nTake note that we need to save the state of the register we are using else we might accidentally alter the program state.\n\nSo this is on the right track. But we need to save ECX beforehand in case something else is using it.\n\n```\n0x00000000: 51                  push ecx\n0x00000001: 8b 0d 00 04 40 00   mov ecx, dword ptr [0x400400]\n0x00000007: 89 4d e2            mov dword ptr [ebp - 0x1e], ecx\n0x0000000a: 59                  pop ecx\n\n```\nThis should do that you want. We save ECX by pushing it onto the stack. Load the value at address 0x400400 into ECX. Then write the value of ECX into the memory at [EBP-0x1E], then restore ECX to it's previous value.\n\nSo how do we patch this into the binary image?\n\nThe above assembly is 11 bytes in length and our goal is to alter the instruction\n\n0:  c7 45 e2 4c 00 00 00    mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x1e],0x4c\n\nWhich we can see is 7 bytes long.\n\nWe can get these extra 4 bytes by use of a \"code cave\". We will redirect execution into an unused bit of memory, execute our code, then jump back.\n\nRef: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20240/The-Beginners-Guide-to-Codecaves\n\nIn short, we're looking \"empty space\" that is allocated/mapped within the exe image, preferably in the .text section, but are not used by the program under any circumstances. This will occur in nearly every executable image due to SectionAlignment in Windows PE being 4096 by default.\n\nThe easiest way to implement this is to find unused bytes in the same region of memory that we are trying to modify.\n\nA rudimentary way of finding/applying a code cave with ollydbg is shown here:\n\nhttps://medium.com/@vysec.private/backdoor-101-f318110e1fcb\n\nAfter finding suitable memory for our cave, patch in the shellcode:\n\n```\n0x00000000: 51                  push ecx\n0x00000001: 8b 0d 00 04 40 00   mov ecx, dword ptr [0x400400]\n0x00000007: 89 4d e2            mov dword ptr [ebp - 0x1e], ecx\n0x0000000a: 59                  pop ecx\n\n```\nusing ollydbg's assembler.\n\nThen change the original instruction of mov DWORD PTR [ebp-0x1e],0x4c to JMP x where x is your shellcode address, in the same module/image.\n\nOverwrite the rest of the instruction bytes with 0x90 (NOP) if you want. So that we end up with:\n\nc7 45 e2 4c 00 00 00 - Original instruction\n\ne9 xx xx xx xx 90 90 - JMP rel32 plus 2 NOPs\n\nRef for x86 JMP: https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_147.html\n\nafter pop ecx back in our code cave assemble: JMP y\n\nwhere y is the address of the instruction directly after mov DWORD PTR [ebp-0x1e],0x4c. You should end up skipping over the NOP instructions when jumping out of the code cave, which is why I said they were optional.\n\nSummary,\n\n",
