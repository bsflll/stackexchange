  "content": "In Windows Store application development for Windows 8, there is a class called remoteSettings that lets a developer store batches of data so that the user will have access to it across several machines, as long as they are logged in with the same account. \n\nI hooked up WireShark and discovered that the packet is stored in Azure, and is secured with TLS. I would like to MITM myself so that I can decrypt the packet and see if the data in encrypted on Azure.\n\nI obviously don't have the private key for Azure, so I'd like to know if anyone has an idea on how to accomplish that MITM analysis.\n\n",

      "content": "If the data is being passed as HTTPS you could try the classic Fiddler man-in-the-middle approach. I'm not sure whether the Windows store respects the proxy settings or whether it has a pinned certificate. If it does respect the proxy settings, which it should, and it doesn't have a pinned certificate you should be able to trivially man-in-the-middle it with Fiddler.\n\nIf the data isn't HTTPS and the cerificate isn't pinned, one option is to proxy the secure connection using SSLNetcat. What you do is that you change your hosts file so that the Store executable connects to SSLNetcat running locally, then you set up SSLNetcat such that it uses a cerificate for which you have the private key. Then you either just have SSLNetcat forward the data directly to a program of your choice or enter the private keys into Wireshark and use it to sniff the traffic.\n\nIf the data isn't HTTPS, if the cerificate in the binary is pinned and not stored in a file, you can either patch the Windows Store executable and replace the certificate with your own for which you have the private key. OpenSSL should be able to generate a replacement certificate for you easily. This private key can then be entered into Wireshark which will then decrypt the traffic.\n\nYou're fairly close to copy protection territory so you might run into a number of complications.\n\n",

It complicates matters a bit since you're more likely to run into pinned certificates, self verifying executables and even kernel level integrity checks.

      "content": "One other thing that you could do, which is perhaps overkill but is useful in other scenarios, is to intercept the creation of the 48-byte TLS master secret. For many Windows applications (including IE), this happens in lsass.exe in the following function (taken from Win7 SP1 32-bit):\n\n```\nCaller:  ncrypt!_Tls1ComputeMasterKey@32+0x57 \nEIP:     ncrypt!_PRF@40+0x11a\n\n```\nYou can then decrypt the captured packets after the fact in Wireshark by setting (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename in the SSL preferences to a file file that looks like:\n\n```\nRSA Session-ID:87492B3586DE289FAE1598B0A19CC7BCCB69371993F2C0DF32438034E06FE3FB\nMaster-Key:F58C0EFA2BF87602646B318400DFEB0C8CCDE59408C9F13C6D923F6208743BD34EA8BA17BCE02B9BD8DFED5A58036068\n\n```\nThe session ID here can be found in the TLS headers (unencrypted) for the stream you're interested in. (Don't be fooled by the RSA -- this works for all TLS connections regardless of the ciphersuite in use.)\n\nThe advantage of this method is that, since you're not doing a man in the middle, the client application doesn't have to trust your CA, which is especially handy if you're trying to reverse some malware that actually does crypto right.\n\nThe downside is that you need to be able to debug lsass.exe, which can be tricky; there's some information on how to do that here.\n\n",
