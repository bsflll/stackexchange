  "content": "Let's say I want to print the filenames on every call to NtCreateFile\n(With %any% exe loaded in IDA )\n\nThe first problem is to get the ntdll!NtCreateFile address\nTried to do it like this get_name_ea_simple('ntdll_NtCreateFile') but \"module 'ntdll' has no names\"\n\nAlthough the call get_name_ea_simple('kernel32_CreateFileW') works just fine: 0x770d08d0\n(if debugger paused on executable EP)\n\nAnd here is second problem - exec script commands after debugger loads all modules info.\nIf I do something like:\n\n```\nrun_to(get_inf_attr(INF_MIN_EA)) # start the debugger and execute to the entry point\nCreateFileW = get_name_ea_simple('kernel32_CreateFileW')\n    if CreateFileW == BADADDR:\n        warning('kernel32_CreateFileW is null')\n        return\n\n```\nI'll get my warning.\nSo how to do it right?\n\nIDA 7.5\n\nAdded\n\nI found out that if we stop at the entry point and manually load symbols for ntdll, then the following command works get_name_ea_simple('ZwCreateFile')\n\n",
