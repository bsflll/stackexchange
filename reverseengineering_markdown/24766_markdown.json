  "content": "I'm working with the firmware of SIP phone. I extracted the JFFS2 file system image from the firmware and mounted it using modprobe ike this:\n\n```\nsudo modprobe mtdram total_size=36360\nsudo modprobe mtdblock \nsudo modprobe jffs2\nsudo modprobe block2mtd\nsudo dd if=~/1C6A83.jffs2  of=/dev/mtdblock0\nsudo mount -t jffs2 /dev/mtdblock0 ~/mnt\n\n```\nHowever when I try to change files on the mounted device I get an error \"No space left on device\". What am I doing wrong? May be my device mtdblock0 is protected from writing?\n\n",
