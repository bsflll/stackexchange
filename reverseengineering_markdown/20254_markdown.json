  "content": "I am trying to reverse engineer / research a black box system, this is, a system for which there is no public information at all. Let's say the system is a modern handheld console.\n\nI have already gathered the followed information and data:\n\nSo, I have the memory dumps. What would be an efficient approach? \n\nFirst I believe loading it with IDA (or r2) could be helpful. But I don't know how to set up a raw dump in IDA, do i have to load it manually? am i missing something?\n\nSecondly. The dump is not encrypted. I can find strings, references to strings of programs that run in the system, etc... I guess I can also find code (like .text sections in PC but whatever are called in this system) which I should be able to reverse. Is this theory right? if so, how to put it in practice? how can I find pieces of code? I have tried entropy, which seems to be quite useful; code tends to have high entropy. Technically speaking, how would I load that code in IDA properly?\n\nEverything is welcome\n\nEDIT: Run binwalk over the ram dumps. Pretty interesting:\nhttps://gist.github.com/pedro-javierf/2476a1f4f0db72b785e414f77c273512\n\n",

The layout might be different.\n\nFew examples: \n\nHopefully you can provide further information about the target, that's sound interesting. :)\n\n",

Also some apps or small apps (applets) run in virtualized memory, while important applications, like system settings, updates.. run in the baremetal. Concerning your answer, this thing you say about retrieving page tables sounds very interesting, how would that work? Btw, my dumps are raw physical dumps of the RAM chip (actually a FCRam chip). I also have FCRam dumps done via exploit by other person and they are the same thing.",

Other devices (hmm for example the NAND memory, other flash memories, etc..) should be accessible through physical addresses, so obviously those contents are not in my dumps.

I can't provide a concrete example at the moment, sorry. Something easier: you could force to disassemble every words, trying with both Arm and Thumb.

The idea is just to see if there's code inside your dump. You will probably have to start from scratch and define code more precisely afterward. Regarding the image base, I'd suggest to find jump table (switch) and from the case code below and the jump table addresses you could figure the image base.",
