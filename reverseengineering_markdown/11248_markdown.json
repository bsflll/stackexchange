  "content": "Working on my Logitech G105 keyboard, to hopefully implement a userspace driver to activate some of its specialized features.\n\nI've captured the usb traffic it outputs when using a windows vm with the official logitech drivers, output of starting the software and setting the m1 led active are in this gist (usbmon-boot and usbmon-m1 respectively).\n\nReplaying the packets with in python with\ndev.ctrl_transfer(0x21, 0x09, 0x0200, 0x0000, 0x0001)\n\nand so on results in almost the exact results, however, the data words after = in usbmon are all 00, and the led on the keyboard does not activate.\n\n",
