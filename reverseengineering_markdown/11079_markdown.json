  "content": "I just received my buspirate, I now want to dump a flash (MX25L12845E).\nI tried the following command:\n\n```\nflashrom -V -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/tty.usbserial-AJ02XILF,spispeed=1M -r MX25L128.bin -c MX25L12835F/MX25L12845E/MX25L12865E\n\n```\nAnd get the following output:\n\n```\nflashrom v0.9.8-r1888 on Darwin 15.0.0 (x86_64)\nflashrom is free software, get the source code at http://www.flashrom.org\n\nflashrom was built with LLVM Clang 7.0.0 (clang-700.0.72), little endian\nCommand line (7 args): flashrom -V -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/tty.usbserial-AJ02XILF,spispeed=1M -r MX25L128.bin -c MX25L12835F/MX25L12845E/MX25L12865E\nCalibrating delay loop...

But works on Linux with default terminal. \n\n",
