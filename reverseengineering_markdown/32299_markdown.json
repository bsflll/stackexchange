  "content": "I am trying to debug a dex file from an APK file in IDA Pro. I set some breakpoints when launching the activity. When I start the process, the application waits for the debugger. After some time, IDA Pro shows this JDWP error: ABSENT_INFORMATION and breakpoint can not set. The application runs normally.\n\nWhat is wrong here?\n\n",
