  "content": "I've disassembled (dasmx 1.4) this 8051 firmware from device that has external program ROM and SRAM.\nThere are some lines I don't yet understand where they address to:\nWhat's IPC?\nWhere 'mov X0032,xxx\" is addressing to, and what does it move actually? I know 'movx @dptr,xxx\" is used for external RAM.\n\n```\nmov ipc,#010H\nmov dptr,#028A6H\nmov X0032,dph\nmov X0033,dpl\n\n```\nthen follows...\n\n```\nmov a,X0032\nmov dph,a\nmov a,X0033     \nmov dpl,a\nclr a\nmovc    a,@a+dptr\n\n```\nSo is it internal RAM due to direct addressing?\n\n",
