  "content": "How should I begin trying to reverse engineer this file format? The only thing I can think of is saving a simple file, and then dig in with a hex editor. But since the file format may be some kind of archive, that seems like the wrong approach. I've always been a little interested in the idea of reverse-engineering a file format, but I never actually attempted it. How should I begin?\n\nIn particular, I am interested in Smart Notebook which loads and saves data into .notebook files.  This is an undocumented proprietary file format. SMART is the leading manufacturer of white boards and their notebook software is therefore one of the most popular formats for educational (presentation) content. There is an open standard for whiteboard files and Open Sankore is an open source program that can open and save them.  However, Smart Notebook is not fully compatible with the open whiteboard format so I really would like to understand the .notebook file format so that I can write software that makes use of it. The open stand (.iwb files) are zip archives that contain images and SVG data. It occurs to me that .notebook files may also be compressed or at least contain a number of sub-files within it (like images and swf files).  \n\n",

      "content": "Well, obviously the particulars will very much depend on the particulars of the file format and what you expect to achieve in general. However, some steps will largely be the same. One thing you could do is:\n\nIf you understand the language in which the program from option 3 is written, no problem at all. If you don't have that or if you are faced with other challenges then you have to resort to the good old technique outlined in point 2, patching gaps with pieces you gather with method 1.\n\nThe point 2.1 should be obvious: you want to find out how recursive text is encoded? Type some text, format it, save, observe the change. Rinse, lather, repeat.\n\nPoint 2.2 will take a lot more effort and should likely be used sparsely to make sure you got details from 2.1 right.\n\n",

Are the .notebook files you were referring to different from this file? If so, could you upload a sample?\n\nI know this doesn't really go into the process behind reversing a proprietary file format, for which I apologise. Hopefully someone else can provide a more interesting answer in this respect.\n\n",
