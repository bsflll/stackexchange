  "content": "when trying to decompile some interrupt service routines done with Watcom, the __GETDS call at the beginning of the functions will break the decompiler output completely.\nHere's the disassembly:\n\n\nAnd here the decompiler output:\n\n\nWhat could be the reason for this? Is there a way to fix this? The only thing that worked for me was creating a separate function for the code below __GETDS, but that's not really satisfying.\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

      "content": "This happens because __GETDS is placed just after the entrypoint code and is initially detected by IDA as part of the start function:\n\n```\ncseg01:0001AAD1                 push    eax\ncseg01:0001AAD2                 mov     eax, 0\ncseg01:0001AAD7                 mov     edx, 0Fh\ncseg01:0001AADC                 call    __FiniRtns\ncseg01:0001AAE1                 pop     eax\ncseg01:0001AAE2                 mov     ah, 4Ch ; 'L'\ncseg01:0001AAE4                 int     21h             ; DOS - 2+ - QUIT WITH EXIT CODE (EXIT)\ncseg01:0001AAE4                                         ; AL = exit code\ncseg01:0001AAE6                 mov     eax, eax\ncseg01:0001AAE8\ncseg01:0001AAE8 __GETDS:                                ; CODE XREF: __int23_handler+A↓p\ncseg01:0001AAE8                                         ; __int_ctrl_break_handler+A↓p ...\ncseg01:0001AAE8 __GETDSStart_:\ncseg01:0001AAE8                 mov     ds, cs:word_1AAF1\ncseg01:0001AAF0                 retn\ncseg01:0001AAF0 start           endp\n\n```\nSince the call is to a middle of an existing function, IDA considers it to be non-returning and stops the code flow. The solution is to break start after the int 21h call (Set function end, or 'E' key) and create a proper function for __GETDS itself. Then you will need to reanalyze all call sites (and maybe recreate the functions) so that code flow is properly updated. \n\n",
