Now, I want to do the same on the linux platform for the iOS binaries, i.e. extract a given arch type from a fat iOS binary on a linux platform. However, lipo support is not available on Linux.\n\nAny suggestions how can I achieve the same? Any alternate of lipo for linux which does the same?\n\n",
