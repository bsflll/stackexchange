  "content": "I came across the Flyte STORY clock recently (link) and I’m stumped as to how it works.\nDoes anyone know how it holds the ball against gravity when it’s vertically upright?\n\n\n\nI asked Physics but they closed the question immediately. Hopefully this is the right place to ask!\n\nThis article touches on the subject, but provided only speculation and no detail.\n\n",
