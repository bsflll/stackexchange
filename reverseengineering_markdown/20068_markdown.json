  "content": "I updated a device over a firmware update software and sniffed the whole traffic with wireshark. There is a TCP Stream with ~30MB which I exported as raw data. The resulting file is Zip archived data but it has a CRC error when I try to extract it with binwalk/7zip.\n\nI also tried to export as hex dump and make xxd -r -p dump outfile.\n\nIn the pcap file are many TCP DUP ACK and TCP Out-Of-Order packets. \nI wonder if the exported binary takes over these dupes or out-of-order stuff.\n\nI also tried chaosreader -r dump.pcap still corrupt.\n\nExtracting the .exe with 7zip failed also with checksum error.\n\nAny of you have any idea what I'm doing wrong?\n\n",
