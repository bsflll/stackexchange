  "content": "Suppose I have self-compiled exe-file (aka portable executable), its source (c/c++) and generated pdb-file. And what if I want to get offset of its function (non-winapi function) in debugger (x64dbg, whatever) to set breakpoint on it? I would like to know/learn about existing reversing techniques to do it.\n\n",

      "text": "Two options. First one: you open up the binary in a disassembler (let's say IDA), you find the function you are interested in. Grab it's address, subtract it from the base address and you'll have the relative offset. Then fire up x64dbg, add this offset to the loaded base address and you can put a bp on it. Second option: load the binary in x64dbg, open the 'Symbols' tab, and search for your target function (if it have a meaningful name). You can also break on this and you are good to go :)",
