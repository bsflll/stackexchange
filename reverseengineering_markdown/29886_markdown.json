  "content": "In IDA Pro, when you create a custom struct, apply it to a local variable, and try to check every member of it in the decompiler mode, when you hover your mouse on the variable, it only prints limited number of values of struct members based on the screen size, so the rest of them go out of screen:\n\n\n\nHow can I view the value of every member of the struct then? When I hover to field_38 for example, it just prints its offset and doesn't tell me its value.\n\nUsing IDA Pro 7.6.\n\n",
