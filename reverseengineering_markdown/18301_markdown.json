  "content": "I'm working on reverse engineering an Android application where the native code opens TLS connections using a built-in copy of mbedtls with certificate pinning. I'd like to decrypt that traffic and log it.\n\nNormally, I would use LD_PRELOAD. In this case I cannot because mbedtls is embedded in the same dynamic library it is being called from, so traditional PLT/GOT hookers won't do.\n\n",
