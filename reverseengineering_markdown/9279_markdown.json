  "content": "There have been numerous sites stated in this wonderful post that one could retrieve malware samples. However, I am having a difficult time (sorry D:) locating Linux-specific malware from those sites as mostly are samples for Windows (I think). Where can I find and download these Linux samples that I seek?\n\nBTW, this is for learning to create ClamAV and YARA signatures.\n\n",
