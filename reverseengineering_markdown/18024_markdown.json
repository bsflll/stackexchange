  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/18024/rasm2-giving-different-output-each-time-for-x64",
  "content": "Disassembling is great but when trying to re-assemble to opcode it gives different results each time. Example:  \n\n```\nC:\\>rasm2 -a x86 -b 64 -d \"48898D80FEFFFF\"  \nmov qword [rbp - 0x180], rcx  \nC:\\>rasm2 -a x86 -b 64 \"mov qword [rbp - 0x180], rcx\"  \n49898d80feffff  \n\n```\nSee the difference? The first byte has been changed and it keep the same behavior each time. Another issue is, I couldn't get it to assemble this instruction with 8 bytes it only gives me 4 bytes:\n\n```\nC:\\>rasm2 -a x86 -b 64 -d \"C7458C0000803F\"  \nmov dword [rbp - 0x74], 0x3f800000  \nC:\\>rasm2 -a x86 -b 64 \"mov dword [rbp - 0x74], 0x3f800000\"  \n41c67400\n\n```\nBut when I remove the the bits flag and set the registers to 32 bit it gives me the correct opcodes!\n\n```\nC:\\>rasm2 -a x86 \"mov dword [ebp - 0x74], 0x3f800000\"  \nc7458c0000803f\n\n```\nWhy is it doing this and what did I do wrong?\n\nGitHub issue link for future reference.\n\n",
