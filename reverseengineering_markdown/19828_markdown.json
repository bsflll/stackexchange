  "content": "This question might sound very naive, however, I got stuck when one of my friends asked me where can I find the address of an initialized register in the stack.\n\nFor e.g., info registers in gdb gives us a list of registers and their corresponding values which are basically stored into it.\n\nIs there any command or way in which I could find the addresses where the registers are actually located? If yes could someone please direct me towards it.\n\nI am glad my friend asked me this question since it was something which I didn't notice earlier because there had not been a time where there was any need of the address where the registers are located.\n\n",

That is, while the registers comprise a big part of the state of a CPU, they are not on the stack (which is usually in memory). However, you may want to edit your question to explain better what you need. I have a hunch you may be interested in stuff like the return address on the stack or the push-ed register values (not registers). You really need to edit your question to make clear what you want.",

Which states that it is usually stored in memory and not on the stack.\n\nIt was a doubt and I am glad that I got a clarification. Thus would like to post it as an answer.\n\n",
