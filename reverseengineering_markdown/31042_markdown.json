  "content": "I'm trying to reverser a bin file with Ghidra, without success for the moment, I can't find any functions in the decompiled file.\nhe bin file is for an ARM 32bits, I'm pretty sure this is an stm32, so I've followed some tutorial for use Ghidra with stm32, this one for example\n\nbut I have no functions when I analysed the file. Any idea ? Encrypted firmware may be ? Here is the BIN file, I've also try ti work with binwalk, without success\n\n",
