  "content": "I'm facing a problem that i need to dump a large region of memory with IDA pro\n\nusing xdbg its easily done by going to memory map tab and just dumping a region, how can i do this in IDA pro? for example dump from address x to y\n\nI tried to use a simple IDApython script but if the size is large  IDA will just crash (I'm dumping a large region while remotely debugging a windows kernel)\n\n```\nfilename = AskFile(1, \"*.bin\", \"Output file name\")\naddress = startAddress\nsize = 0xFFFFFF\ndbgr = True\nwith open(filename, \"wb\") as out:\n    data = GetManyBytes(address, size, use_dbg=dbgr)\n    out.write(data)\n\n```\n",
