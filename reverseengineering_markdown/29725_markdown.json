  "content": "I'm debugging a iOS App by IDA, and I need to see the value of some var like v57 below.\nThrough the Locals panel know the value is 0x1137D0E00LL, but I want to see the real value or class.\n\nHow to get it?\nCan someone help?\n\nCode Here:\n\n```\nv57 = sub_10AA66818();\nv58 = (void *)objc_retainAutoreleasedReturnValue(v57);\nv59 = v58;\nv13 = v65;\nv60 = objc_msgSend(v58, (const char *)&loc_109CB2ABC + 1, v46, v29, v65);\n\n```\nsub_10AA66818() return a OC Singleton Object and Stored in v57:\n\n```\n__int64 sub_10AA66818()\n{\n  if ( qword_10DCB7038 != -1 )\n    dispatch_once(&qword_10DCB7038, &off_10BE41040);\n  return objc_retainAutoreleaseReturnValue(qword_10DCB7030);\n}\n\n```\nAccording to the second code box, that Singleton perform a selector to do something.\n\nIt's why I try to know what sub_10AA66818() return in debugging.\n\n",
