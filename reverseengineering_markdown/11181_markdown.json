  "content": "So i'm trying to add a custom toolbar to IDA 6.4 using their PySide download and the IDAAPI.  I've tried adding a toolbar by just creating one but since it doesn't have an exec_() method I can't get it on the screen and it looks like I need to be loading it into a window with something like\n\n```\nself.toolbar = self.addToolBar('var')\n\n```\nthough in this case the \"self\" is a window which makes me think I need a reference to IDA's main window.  Anyone know how i can get that reference?\n\n",

      "content": "New IDA 6.95 API\n\nPerhaps because they saw this question, maybe because of user requests, version 6.95 was released with two IDAPython API functions for creating a menu and a toolbar: create_menu and create_toolbar so now these can be done trivially.\n\nOld trick - Before 6.95\n\nA hack I've been using is finding the application's main window manually and then adding a toolbar directly using QT. IDA only has one main window.\n\nAdding a toolbar that way makes in completely recognizable by IDA as far as I can tell. You can tick it on and off, you can dock and un-dock it, changing to advanced mode automatically shows it as well. However, IDA won't let you add actions to it in IDA 6.7 and above (as described at hexblog.com/?p=886)\n\nA sample code can look something like that:\n\n```\n for widget in QtGui.qApp.topLevelWidgets():\n     if type(widget) == QtGui.QMainWindow:\n         mainWindow = widget\n         toolbar = mainWindow.addToolBar(\"My toolbar\")\n\n         # and now for adding stuff to our toolbar\n         toolbar.addSeparator()\n         toolbar.addWidget(...)\n\n```\nDisclaimer: Keep in mind finding the main window this way if risky, undocumented and might not always work. IDA might not like that you're changing stuff underneath it. I do use it and it is working, but YMMV and UAYOR.\n\nTwo additional tips for making this hack functional:\n\nEDIT:\n\nHere's a more complete example of how to hack a toolbar and a menu in from an IDA plugin, handling different loading modes and retying in case the IDA application is not fully set-up yet:\n\n```\n  def init(self):\n    self.setup()\n\n    return idaapi.PLUGIN_KEEP\n\n  def setup(self):\n    if not self.get_mainwindow():\n      self.delay_setup()\n      return\n\n    # Add a toolbar like OP requested\n    self.toolbar = self.get_mainwindow().addToolBar(\"My toolbar\")\n    self.toolbar.setIconSize(QtCore.QSize(16, 16))\n\n    # Bonus: add a menue\n    self.menu = QtGui.QMenu(\"My menu\")\n    self.get_mainwindow().menuWidget().addMenu(self.menu)\n\n  def delay_setup(self):\n    QtCore.QTimer.singleShot(1000, self.setup)\n\n  def get_mainwindow(self):\n    if self.mainwindow:\n      return self.mainwindow\n\n    app = QtGui.qApp\n    widgets = [app.focusWidget(), app.activeWindow()] + app.topLevelWidgets()\n    mainwidgets = filter(None, map(self.search_mainwindow, widgets))\n\n    if mainwidgets:\n      self.mainwindow = mainwidgets[0]\n\n    return self.mainwindow\n\n  def search_mainwindow(self, widget):\n    while widget != None:\n      if isinstance(widget, QtGui.QMainWindow):\n        return widget\n      widget = widget.parent()\n    return None\n\n```\n",
