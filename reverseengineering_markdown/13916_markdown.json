      "content": "Many images in OS X applications live in the bundle.  Meaning they are linked with the application, but not compiled into the binary.  One exception to this would be if the application is using an asset catalog which compiles images into a binary format for quick lookup at runtime.\n\nTake a look at Calculator.app that ships with OS X.  In the application bundle, you will see a Resources directory (full path: Calculator.app/Contents/Resources).  This is where all of the images are stored in the application.  In the case of Calculator.app, there are a bunch of tiff images which represent the keys:\n\n\n\nI'd experiment with replacing or modifying images in the Resources folder of the application.\n\n",
