      "text": "Native method implementations can be contained in any loaded .so file. They just have to be present (loaded) when the native method is called. I would first check the .so files for exported methods that match the JNI method naming scheme (start with Java_ and the package and class name). Note that AFAIK it is also possible to define native methods in an .so e.g. in JNI_OnLoad, therefore native method implementations are not always exported functions.",
