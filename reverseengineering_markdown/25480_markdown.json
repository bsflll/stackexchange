Please confirm If I have understand:  1) First create a c++ dll empty project, compile and put on game folder.  2) Download ProxiFy codeproject.com/Articles/1179147/â€¦ 3) Select the dll empty project with ProxiFy that will create .def file that contain the definitions to include on my final dll. 4) Before compile my hook.dll (32 bit) include .def file in the linker. 5) Now my hook.dll will be called by the game.
