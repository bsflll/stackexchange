  "content": "Ok so let's say that a program obfuscated its IAT and i can't see it in IDA Pro. In OllyDbg there is a plugin where you press Ctrl+G you can search for a library function and set a breakpoint even though that function is not listed in the IAT. My question is how can i do this in IDA Pro?\n\nThanks\n\n",
