  "content": "I recently discovered a binary container file in a GameCube video game which I cannot unpack!\n\nI asked around, and I was told that it is an archive with this exact file structure:\n\n```\nchar Signature[8];\nuint32 FileCount;\nuint32 Size;\nchar Padding?[16];\nFileDesc Files[FileCount];\n\nstruct FileDesc\n{\nchar Filename[32];\nuint32 Offset;\nuint32 Size;\nchar Padding?[24];\n};\n\n```\nBut I cannot figure out how to write a working script in Python which can unpack this file!\n\nLiterally all I want is to unpack the archive and retrieve the files inside!\n\nHere is the file in question.\n\n",
