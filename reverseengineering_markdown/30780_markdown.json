      "content": "You seem to have correctly identified the point where the decryption is invoked. It seems like a1 (the first argument of that function) is a this pointer, pointing to some kind of game engine wrapper object. At (a1+40), there is a pointer to the key, and (a1+48) contains the length of the key. The initialization of those members happens somewhere else, likely in the constructor or some initialization function of the engine wrapper object.\n\n",

If you need to stay in \"static analysis land\", you need to find the function that initiliazes the key, which might be tricky. You likely look for a function initializing a structure member at offset 40 by a pointer directly followed by initializing a 32-bit number at offset 48 with the length of an XXTEA key. Finding that function might prove tedious.",
