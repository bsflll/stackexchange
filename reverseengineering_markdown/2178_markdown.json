  "content": "I manage my structures in C files, the header might look like this:\n\n```\n#pragma pack(0)\n\ntypedef struct\n{\n    short important_value;\n    char  _A[2]; // unknown\n    int   interesting_value;\n} STRUCT;\n\n```\nI loaded this into IDA via Ctrl+F9. Now I find out more about the structure, seeing that _A contains short imaginary_value.\n\nWhen I try to reload this in IDA via Ctrl+F9, nothing happens. When I delete the structure in IDA, parse the C file and re-create the structure, I see the new structure, however all instances of STRUCT in the database are deleted.\n\nSo the question is, how do I reload the structure without removing all instances from the database.\n\n",
