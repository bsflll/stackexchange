  "content": "There is a structure with size of 16-Bytes, and an array of it is defined.\nThe disassembly code for navigation through the array is:\n\n```\nMOV     i, i,LSL#4\nLDR     R4, =arr_of_struct \nADD     i, i, R4\nLDR     var, [i] \n\n```\nBut the decompiled code is:\n\n```\nvar = arr_of_struct[4 * i];\n\n```\nWhich is wrong and should be:\n\n```\nvar = arr_of_struct[4 * i].field_0;\n\n```\nI think the problem is in first line of disassembly MOV   i, i,LSL#4. Obviously it is multiplying the array index by 16 which is the size of my struct. But IDA translated this line to [4 * i] !!!\n\nSo the first question is what's the reason of this behavior in IDA?\nAnd the second is how can I fix this?\n\nEDIT:\nMore information:\n\n\n\n",
