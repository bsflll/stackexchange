  "content": "I'm working on a windows program which is walking PEB Ldr list. the related types are as follows:\n\n```\nstruct LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY {\n    LIST_ENTRY InLoadOrderLinks;         // offset = 0, size = 0x10\n    LIST_ENTRY InMemoryOrderLinks;   // offset = 0x10, size = 0x10\n    // ...\n    UNICODE_STRING FullDllName;       // offset = 0x48, size = 0x10\n    UNICODE_STRING BaseDllName;     // offset = 0x58, size = 0x10\n};\n\n```\nthe pseudocode IDA generated is like that:\n\n```\ni = (LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY *)NtCurrentPeb()->Ldr->InMemoryOrderModuleList.Flink;\nCurDllName = i->FullDllName.Buffer;     // FullDllName should be BaseDllName!\nCurDllNameLength = i->FullDllName.Length;\n\n```\nThe problem is, i->FullDllName should be i->BaseDllName, because i is not LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY * but actually LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY * + 0x10 (address of LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY.InMemoryOrderLinks).\n\nThe correct output should be like that:\n\n```\ni = NtCurrentPeb()->Ldr->InMemoryOrderModuleList.Flink;\nLDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY *Node = CONTAINING_RECORD(i, LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY, InMemoryOrderLinks);\nCurDllName = Node->BaseDllName.Buffer;\nCurDllNameLength = Node->BaseDllName.Length;\n\n```\nIn case i is an offset, Is there any way I can do to change type of i to something correct (like struct members) or just add the variable Node in IDA? The Node pointer I wrote here seems to be optimized out.\n\nI tried CONTAINING_RECORD but it seems not applicable here.\n\n",
