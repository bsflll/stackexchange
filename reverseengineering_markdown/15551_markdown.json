The Dependency Walker returns no exported functions. IDA Pro Free shows only one module\nMy question:\nHow do I debug this .dll file?\n\nKindly regards\n\n",

      "content": "As mentioned by the answer before me decrypter.dll is a .NET dll, If you want you can debug it by writing a simple .NET program that references it and calls the same function/method you need, get-decrypt in your case, a nice tool to use for debugging of such a .NET program that can step into its dependency dlls is dnSpy which can be found and downloaded here.\n\n",
