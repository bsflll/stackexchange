  "content": "this is Easy_ELF from Reversing.Kr\n\nRight now R2 displays absolute address for a character inside of a string:\n\n```\n  [0x08048454]> pdf\n  ...\n  0x08048454      0fb60521a004.  movzx eax, byte [0x804a021] \n\n```\nI already made a flag for global buffer\n\n```\n f glob.passwordBuf 16 @ 0x0804a020 \n\n```\nhow to apply offset from it to make R2 to display something like\n\n```\n 0x08048454      0fb60521a004.  movzx eax, byte [glob.passwordBuf + 1] \n\n```\n? I.e. I want disassembler to use  what fd 0x804a021 returns (which is glob.passwordBuf + 1)\n\nI tried to reanalyze the function, but it didn't help.\n\n",
