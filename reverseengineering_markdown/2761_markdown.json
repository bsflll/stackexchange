After this I see the file is about to be either written or updated (offset:length).\n\nHow can I reveal the content that is about to be written or updated in this file using Ollydbg?\nIs there a tutorial or something similar? And how to specify the function on Ollydbg? \n\nIn process monitor, I see WriteFile, but in Ollydbg, what is the function?\n\n",

And if you want to see what is writes you will have to have where the pointers are stored for the function in question.\n\nThis has a lot to do with calling conventions, cdecl and stdcall and knowing about them is important for this..\n\nI am going to try to explain using the writeFile function.\n\nFirst we look at the WriteFile declaration (taken from MSDN)\n\n```\nBOOL WINAPI WriteFile(\n  _In_         HANDLE hFile,\n  _In_         LPCVOID lpBuffer,\n  _In_         DWORD nNumberOfBytesToWrite,\n  _Out_opt_    LPDWORD lpNumberOfBytesWritten,\n  _Inout_opt_  LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped\n);\n\n```\nNow when we assume that Windows has stdcall (win32api has). We can figure out where we can find the variables. (for more about the stdcall see Wikipedia).\n\nDue to our wikipedia article we a few things:\n\nNow we have everything we need to figure out where we can find the location of the information you need.\nWhen a breakpoint is placed on the function call you'll know that all the variables are stored on the stsck. LPCVOID is a Pointer, all that is left is to follow it and read the data.\n\n",
