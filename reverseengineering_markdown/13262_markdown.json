      "content": "According to the main developer of Binwalk, you can't and this is not a feature they will implement anytime soon. From the link:\n\nNow unfortunately, firmware-mod-kit hasn't been updated for a while, but is probably your closest bet. Otherwise, you may want to use the output of binwalk and try to \"cut and paste\" original and modified sections of the firmware file using the dd. Note that this will likely work only with very simple firmware images, as anything with checksums and sections/file length will have to be modified manually. I was able to make it happen in very limited cases where the firmware was mostly a header with a file system appended to it.\n\n",
