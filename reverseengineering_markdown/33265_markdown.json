  "content": "Initially I have in IDA value in hex:\n\n```\n0003EF9B  A1 DC F3 12 00\n\n```\nBut the I looked in hex editor same offset and its different:\n\n```\nA1-DC-F3-06-00\n\n```\nBut it is half problem.\n\nIn hex editor I trying change the values:\n\n```\n0003EF9B  A1 DC F3 12 00\n\n```\nto:\n\n```\nB8 80 02 00 00\n\n```\n(i.e. I need load to eax value 0x280)\n\nAfter editing in hex editor, I opened corrected file in IDA, and have difference:\n\n```\n0003EF9B  B8 DC F3 12 00\n\n```\nWhere 0003EF9B its address in IDA.\n\nI.e. same values (same address) is different in hex editor and IDA.\n\nIts ms dos code and uses dos4gw. Program run under dosbox.\n\nWhy there is difference?\n\nUPDATED\n\n1)BEFORE changes\n\nBefore I made changes in hex editor:\nhttps://i.ibb.co/gjRxW9g/hex1.jpg\n\nBefore I made changes in IDA (disassembled view):\nhttps://i.ibb.co/qxVhZrN/ida11.jpg\n\nBefore I made changes in IDA (hex view):\nhttps://i.ibb.co/Qp0qc8M/ida12.jpg\n\n2)AFTER changes\n\nAfter I made changes in hex editor:\nhttps://i.ibb.co/NVCd34M/hex2.jpg\n\nAfter I made changes in IDA (disassembled view):\nhttps://i.ibb.co/TYytDjL/ida21.jpg\n\nAfter I made changes in IDA (hex view):\nhttps://i.ibb.co/zJ1fcNK/ida22.jpg\n\n",

Have you checked if all prior and post bytes match  apart from these 5 bytes...... .......if the address is correct in  both. And relocations are accounted for then the bytes MUST be same",

As for you second IDA screenshots - did you created new IDA database after editing file in hex-editor? As long as I know IDA will not automatically reflect changes - it creates database and later works only with it, you can even delete source EXE file - no problem for IDA.",
