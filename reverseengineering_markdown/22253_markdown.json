  "content": "How do I calculate the location of the string in this sample located at offset 0x1CAD8?\n\nThe instruction at 0x140001A97 in the sample is:\n\n```\n0x140001A97   F2 0F1005 39C60100   movsd xmm0, qword [rip + str..exe]\n\n```\nThe opcode has 0x39C60100 which is 0x1C639. If I add that to rip, I don't land on the address of the string:\n\n```\n0x140001A97 -> offset = 0xE97\n\n```\n```\n0xE97 + 0x8 + 0x1C639 = 0x1D4D8\n\n```\nThe string's offset is 0x1CAD8 not 0x1D4D8\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nThe sample is Ryuk:\n18faf22d7b96bfdb5fd806d4fe6fd9124b665b571d89cb53975bc3e23dd75ff1\nIf you need a copy of the sample, a base64 encoded passworded zip archive with the sample is located here:\nhttps://pastebin.com/aKskMXY7\n\nThe password for that zip file is reseinfected. If you need something to decode base64 quickly, use this cyberchef recipe:\n\n```\nFrom_Base64('A-Za-z0-9+/=',true)\n\n```\n",
