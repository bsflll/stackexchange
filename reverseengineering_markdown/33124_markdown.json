  "content": "I have a fairly large function that I'm trying to decompile in Ghidra. There's a local variable (that either I have incorrectly typed, or Ghidra did it itself) that I try to retype to int. They are the same size in memory. It has some incorrect enum type.\n\nI right-click on it and select \"Retype variable\" and then type \"int\" and click OK:\n\n\n\nGhidra starts churning something and then after a second or two ... nothing changes.\n\nWhy is it refusing to change the type this local variable?\n\n",

If you do take that route, please include a link to the issue in this post. It's also possible there's a related issue there already, I haven't checked.",
