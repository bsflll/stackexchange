  "content": "AMD's BIOS and Kernel Developerâ€™s Guide (BKDG) documents GMM registers and access to them:\n\nD1F0x18 has the following structure (I also add a column with values that I get):\n\nHow to properly access registers in the GMM space?\n\nThere are three base address fields in the D1F0x18 register, and the guide doesn't explain any further how to compile the base address. I tried to read memory (in Linux with root privileges) at the following memory offsets, but all of them return me Segmentation fault error.\n\n```\nprintf(\"%02x  \n\", (unsigned)*(unsigned char*)0x3c08); // Base address itself\nprintf(\"%02x  \n\", (unsigned)*(unsigned char*)0x4378); // 0x3c08+0x770 (GMMx770)\nprintf(\"%02x  \n\", (unsigned)*(unsigned char*)0x4381); // 0x3c08+0x770+3\n\nprintf(\"%02x  \n\", (unsigned)*(unsigned char*)0x3c080000); // Base address appended with zeroes\nprintf(\"%02x  \n\", (unsigned)*(unsigned char*)0x3c080770); // plus GMMx770 offset\nprintf(\"%02x  \n\", (unsigned)*(unsigned char*)0x3c080773); // plus size of the GMMx770\n\nprintf(\"%02x  \n\", (unsigned)*(unsigned char*)0xf0200000); // 0x3c08 shifted left by 2 bits (so that to align 31:18 field to 16 bits)\nprintf(\"%02x  \n\", (unsigned)*(unsigned char*)0xf0200770); // plus GMMx770 offset\nprintf(\"%02x  \n\", (unsigned)*(unsigned char*)0xf0200773); // plus size GMMx770 offset\n\n\n```\nThere is a source code of the Coreboot project available on the Internet. There are clear footprints that they implement access to the GMM space, but I couldn't extract the method from their code either. The code gives some clues:\n\n```\nunsigned long __readfsdword(const unsigned long Offset)\n{\n    unsigned long value;\n    __asm__ __volatile__(\"movl %%fs:%a[Offset], %k[value]\" : [value] \"=r\" (value) : [Offset] \"ir\" (Offset));\n    return value;\n}\n\n```\n",
