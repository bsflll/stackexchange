But there's no problem with choosing that encoding to be a special case of the operands for another opcode, like add x0, x0, x0 on a CPU like RISC-V where x0 is a zero register.  Maybe a tiny bit in terms of the combinatorial logic in the decoders to not have a NOP also match the opcode for something else.",

This is because today's architectures are mostly von Neumann architectures that happily mix data in between code. My guess is that 0x00 is the most common data value as it is used to initialize newly allocated memory and most default values for integers are also probably zero.\n\nIn code injection exploits you usually inject executable code as data and then trigger a bug to make the CPU execute this injected data.\nIf most data bytes are a NOP when (mis)used as instruction, most of the data becomes a so-called nop slide.\n\nA nop slide is very useful for an attacker as he might not be sure at which point exactly his injected code is in memory.\nWhen everything before his injected code are NOPs, he just needs to be lucky and hit somewhere into the nop slide which will then lead the CPU to execute the attacker’s injected code at the end.\nThat's why NOP slides can be used to defeat protections like ASLR, which loads memory at random positions.\n\nI don't think all these security considerations where made at the point they designed the instruction set, but maybe they had a guess that its not a good idea to make the default value for most data also a NOP when interpreted as instruction.\n\n",

The choice to have the \"mode\" bits of the ModR/M byte use 00 as a memory addressing mode (rather than register direct) was probably arbitrary, since 8086 doesn't have memory protection so a memory destination isn't going to fault and help you debug a bad jump target.  Only with protected mode did that become an advantage vs. if it had decoded as add al, al which isn't a NOP but won't fault either.",

So it works as a NOP sled, allowing execution to reach whatever's after the padding as long as it lands somewhere in it.  Modern designs like RISC-V and AArch64 avoid that, with RISC-V I think even guaranteeing that the all-zero encoding will definitely fault, not usable as an extension.
