      "content": "IANAL; If this is done by a company, you need to consult a lawyer that specializes in the field of computer law before taking any action.\n\nMost reverse engineering restrictions actually come from the EULA/Terms of service and other contractual binding agreements between the software provider and the user.\n\nOften times Clean room methodologies are used to circumvent any limitations imposed by the software provider. That is where the reverse engineer(s) create a so-called \"requirements document\" and avoid any code/design tasks, which are performed independently by designated developers whom never performed reverse engineering on target or related products. That way there was no reverse engineering done to a program in the process of producing the \"original code\" of the replica. \n\nBecause no knowledge of the original invention is used while creating the replica implementation (note the subtle difference, as knowledge is used while defining the requirements) the clean room approach is a valid approach to circumvent copyright infringement but cannot be bypass patent law.  \n\nAccording to Wikipedia EU Directive 2009/24, is the most relevant to the question of legality of reverse engineering under EU laws. Keep in mind any contractual agreements with the software company will also affect the legality of reverse engineering their software (and such actions are usually explicitly forbidden there).\n\nThis is the excerpt from EU Directive 2009/24:\n\nThis EFF FAQ is also a good start, although I think it mostly addressed USA laws, some of the recommendations are of value anywhere around the globe.\n\n",
