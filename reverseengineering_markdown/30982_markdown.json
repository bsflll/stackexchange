  "content": "I intercepted a gRPC network request from an application, and I intend to modify the contents and resend the message programmatically. As no tools (except for MitmProxy, see below) were able to decode the protobuf data I wanted to know why that is.\n\nThe gRPC payload sent from the client:\n\n```\ngRPC header       | Protobuf data\n[00] [00 00 00 22] [12 12 09 c3 8d 09 16 c3 93 2a c2 a5 4d 40 11 14 39 c3 ab 6b c2 a2 c3 b3 31 40 1a 05 65 6e 2d 53 45 1a 05 73 76 2d 53 45]\n ^^       ^^ Payload length\nCompressed flag\n\n```\nMitmProxy was able to decode the data to the following:\n\n```\ngRPC message 0 (compressed False)\n[message]    2\n[fixed64]    2.1   4633543028839346763\n[fixed64]    2.2   4625748902140211098\n[message]    3\n[fixed32]    3.12  1163079022\n[string]     3     sv-SE\n\n```\n```\n[message]\n00010 010 00010010\n  2   LEN    18\n\n[fixed64]\n00001 001 [11000011 10001101 00001001 00010110 11000011 10010011 00101010 11000010]\n  1   I64                            13991157658477498000\n\n[fixed32]\n10100 101 [01001101 01000000 00010001 00010100]\n  20  I32              336674893\n\n[fixed64]\n00111 001 [11000011 10101011 01101011 11000010 10100010 11000011 10110011 00110001]\n  7   I64                            3581421232503631000\n\n[unknown]\n01000 000 [00011010 00000101]\n  8  VARINT       ???\n\n[message]\n00011 010 00000101 \n  3   LEN    5\n\n[fixed32]\n01100 101 [01101110 00101101 01010011 01000101]\n 12   I32              1163079022\n\n[string]\n00011 010 00000101 [01110011 01110110 00101101 01010011 01000101]\n  3   LEN    7         s         v       -        S         E\n\n```\nI decoded it using the google documentation as reference: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding. However, I am not familiar with gRPC or protobuf so I have likely have gaps in my knowledge.\n\nWorth noting:\n\n",
