  "content": "I was trying to understand the IsDebuggerPresent() function exported by kernelbase.dll by importing the file on Ghidra. But Ghidra can't show me the proper disassembly or decompilation of function even though disassembly works fine in PE Bear? What could be the issue? I don't know if this is the proper place to post this so please guide me to a place if it isn't. Thanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n",
