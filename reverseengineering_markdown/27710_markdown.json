  "content": "Got into the hands of such a task. There are two dlls. As the second file was explained to me (new.dll) this is a new release of the first file (old.dll). Both files are compiled for x64. I need to find what a few functions from have turned into old.dll in new.dll. Below is an example of one of the functions. Please express your thoughts about my approach to finding a new version of the code: I started by using rdare2 to find all the functions in old.dll (more than 40 thousand), created a file with signatures and set it on a new file. In the end, nothing was found. I conclude that the changes are more than cosmetic. Next, I decided to search as follows:\n\nWhich of the listed search approaches is utopia, and which is not? Maybe there are more proven options?\n\n",
