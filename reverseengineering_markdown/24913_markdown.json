  "content": "So lets say i have these type of instructions in functions :\n\nx == constant value\n\nx = constant value\n\nx > constant value\n\nno matter if its just an assignment or compare or anything, i want to get the constant values in all functions from main onward  \n\ntried googling but couldn't find anything that helps me with this, is this possible? \n\n",

      "content": "There are probably better answers I'd love to know about but let's say you're looking for instructions that have 0x10 as second operand like:\n\n```\ncmp eax, 10\nmov esi, 10\n\n```\nYou could do something like:\n\n```\nfor func in idautils.Functions():\n    flags = idc.get_func_attr(func, FUNCATTR_FLAGS)\n    if flags & FUNC_LIB or flags & FUNC_THUNK:\n        continue\n    dism_addr = list(idautils.FuncItems(func))\n    for cur in dism_addr:\n        if \"10h\" in idc.print_operand(cur, 1):\n            print \"0x%x\" % cur, idc.generate_disasm_line(cur, 0)\n\n```\nAs IDA disassembles 0x10 as 10h, this would work for any instruction where this constant appears. If you need to check other operands I think it's easy to start from the code above. You could also match the mnemonic (CMP, MOV, etc) using idc.print_insn_mnem(cur) if needed.\n\nAdditionally, I've included a check to make sure the code ignores library and thunk functions as you're probably not interested on them. Feel free to remove the check if you want. ;-)\n\n",
