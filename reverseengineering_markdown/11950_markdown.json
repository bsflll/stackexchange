  "content": "Is there any way to add instructions to a library in IDA? My predicament is that there is no room in a game library (.so ELF, android) to fit my own code. There is an empty bss segment but IDA doesn't like to write to it, and I believe the game needs it for it's variables. \n\nI've tried adding additional bytes to the end of the file with a hex editor, and then opening it with IDA, but IDA will not show it possibly because it's not in a segment.\n\nCan I make my own library / modify the existing one so that the code segment is larger? My own library would need to be imported by the other library in order to work, I believe, because it needs functions and such from the original library.\n\nThanks.\n\n",

There are basically 3 ways to do it, and it seems you're already mentioning all of them in your question :\n\nNow depending on what exactly you're trying to inject and how you're reaching it, each method has its specific pro/cons and will require a different approach. They should all be fairly well documented on the Internet.\n\n(Without more context/details about what you're trying to do, it's hard to tell you which one to pick though)\n\n",
