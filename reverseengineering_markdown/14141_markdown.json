  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/14141/ollydbg-break-on-memory-allocation",
  "content": "In OllyDbg, is there a way to break when memory is allocated?  \n\nNormally, I would just find a malloc call and set the break there, but that's not always available in the case of packed/encrypted/obfuscated code.\n\nThe memory map seems to only allow breaks on already allocated memory.\n\nIf not Ollydbg, is there another tool that can do this?\n\nThanks,\n\nGeoff\n\n",
