For example it's well possible to use DialogBoxIndirect() and DialogBox() and their variants without having to resort FindResource(). And while internally something like FindResource() will be employed to look up the resource, this call won't happen from that executable but somewhere in the opaque part of the call path. Also the internal version will likely not be FindResource() but something like LdrFindResource_U() ...",
