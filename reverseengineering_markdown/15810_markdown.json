  "content": "I am working on a reverse engineering task, in which I need to recover function prototype (including number of parameters, type of each parameter) from the input binary (ELF binary on 64-bit Linux).\n\nWhile IDA-Pro can be guided to recover function prototype for functions defined inside the binary code, I am trapped in recovering library functions invoked inside the binary code. \n\nFor example:\n\n```\nmov str_pointer, %rdi\ncall puts  <---- Library function \n\n```\nSo here is my question: \n\nThanks\n\n",

Often you will need to fix things manually. However, I can assure these ways work because I actually use them almost daily.\n\n",
