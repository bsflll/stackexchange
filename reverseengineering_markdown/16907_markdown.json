  "content": "I was trying to figure out if there is a way I can get the address for a function name that has random characters in it.\nFor example the function name is \"Player_GetStats_m29275\" here the \"m292755\"\nis random characters. So I want to search the name of the function by just \"Player_GetStats\" so it gives me the address of the function.\n\nget_name_ea is not good for doing this. I can search the function with find_text but it's too slow and takes a lot of time even if I mention the segment.\n\n",

      "content": "As far as I know, IDA doesn't have a function_name_to_address() that gets a pattern and returns an address. You can iterate over all the functions and check if their name matches the one you want. It should not take too long.  \n\n```\nfrom idautils import *\nfrom idaapi import *\nfrom idc import *\n\nea = BeginEA()\nfor funcAddr in Functions(SegStart(ea), SegEnd(ea)):\n    funcName = GetFunctionName(funcAddr)\n    # Check if the function name starts with \"Player_GetStats\"\n    if funcName.startswith(\"Player_GetStats\"):\n        print \"Function %s is at 0x%x\" % (funcName, funcAddr)\n\n```\nAlternatively you can use regular expression to match the name you want:\n\n```\nimport re\n\nfuncName = \"Player_GetStats_m29275\"\nre.compile(\"^Player_GetStats_\\w\\d{5}$\")\nif pattern.match(funcName):\n   \"%s match the pattern\" % funcName\n\n```\nExplanation:\n\n",
