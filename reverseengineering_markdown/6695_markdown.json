  "content": "I use this site http://www.showmycode.com/ to decompile the swf below\nhttp://kwcdn.000dn.com/swfs/8b/23440heisesm/bg.swf\n\nBut the code only shows the link for a video but I can not get the image in the background. Where and how is that image is embedded in the swf? How can I retrieve that image?\n\nLong story short, I want to search which game is it, from an ads in a Chinese site, but I can not read any Chinese, and the ads is a fake lead to a fake game. So the easiest way is to decompile the swf and use the image in google search hoping for some results. The decomplied code is shown below:\n\n```\nfunction video_replay()\n{\n    my_ns.seek(0);\n}\nvar str_url = \"http://kwflvcdn.000dn.com/swfs/17/23308hssm/hesm.flv\";\nvar my_nc = new netconnection();\nmy_nc.connect(null);\nvar my_ns = new netstream(my_nc);\nmy_ns.setbuffertime(0);\nvar my_video;\nmy_video.attachvideo(my_ns);\nmy_video.smoothing = true;\nmy_ns.play(str_url);\nvar m_iErrorCount = 0;\nmy_ns.onstatus = function (infoObject)\n{\n    if ((infoObject.level == \"error\") && (m_iErrorCount < 2))\n    {\n        m_iErrorCount++;\n        var _local2 = setTimeout(video_replay, 3);\n    }\n    else if (infoObject.code == \"NetStream.Play.Stop\")\n    {\n        var _local2 = setTimeout(video_replay, 0);\n    }\n    else if (infoObject.code == \"NetStream.Buffer.Flush\")\n    {\n         trace(my_ns.time);\n    }\n};\n\n```\n",

There should be a link to an image near/in the \"flashvars\" code.\n\nHope this helps at least a bit.\n\n",
