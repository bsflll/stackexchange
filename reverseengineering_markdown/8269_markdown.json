  "content": "According to Wikipedia, there are 3 class loaders.\n\nThe Boot Class-Loader which loads everything in RT.jar and /../jre/lib\n\nThen the extensions class loader and the system class loader.\n\nI'm only interested in the Boot class loader because I want to hook it and redefine a class in RT.jar without all the legality issues that come with -Xbootclasspath:/p. \n\nDocs: http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13150_01/jrockit_jvm/jrockit/jrdocs/refman/optionX.html\n\nAnd the license here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre-6u21-license-159054.txt\n\nstates:\n\nSo I'm thinking that if I can hook the boot class loader from native code via C++, I can replace a class in by hooking the JVM_DefineClass function from JVM.dll without any legal trouble.\n\nThe function has the signature: \n\nJNIEXPORT jclass JNICALL JVM_DefineClass(JNIEnv *env, const char *name, jobject _loader, const jbyte *buf, jsize len, jobject pd)\n\n",

It also calls Java_lang_lang_DefineClassX from Java.dll where X is a number from 0 to 2 inclusive. Replacing the bytes with your own allows you to redefine any class. Of course, Xbootclasspath is easier though.",
