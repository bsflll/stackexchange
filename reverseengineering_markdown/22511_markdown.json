But there is no possible instruction I got to decompile a file.\nI want to know what are the possibility of getting a decompiled source code from the compiled version?\nAre there any methodology or tools that would help in making it possible?\nPlease share your insights.\n\n",

      "content": "No. In most cases, you cannot obtain the actual source code just because you have the compiler available.\n\nHowever, it depends on the language. If the source code was written in .NET, for example, a decompiler such as dnSpy or ILSpy can produce relatively accurate source code. However, if it was written in C/C++, for instance, then it will be harder to decompile and the decompiled result will not be as close to the original source code. Some decompilers that work for C/C++ are retdec and Ghidra. \n\n",
