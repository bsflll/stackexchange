  "content": "I trying solve some https://crackmes.one/ simple quests. I newbie on it. But after export binary file (even without any changes), when I run the program in the terminal, I get the message \"segmentation fault\".\n\nI use ghidra 9.1.2 in Kali Linux in VBox with 5 CPUs and 8 Gb RAM. Host: Ryzen 5 3600, 16 Gb DDR4.\n\nI have record a video with demo of reproducing this issue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4RKXHRBNM8\\\n\nBut I don't have such problems when I try solve windows exe crackmes on my host Windows 10 machine.\n\nAlso I note that after analysis in bookmarks appeared message with description: Non-Returning Function Identified with any crackmes.\n\n",
