Also, can you recommend any book/resource to learn from? \n(I have found some resources about reversing from The Legend of R4ndom. What do you think about these?)\n\n",

      "content": "Knowledge on assembly is all you really need to get started. To reverse executables on Window learn the Disassembler (IDA) and Debuggers (WinDbg, OllyDbg) as well as the Windows API , if you plan to reverse Windows specific software. Crackmes and keygens are great resource for learning and I would recommend crackme.de, as it contains lots of windows executables.\n\n",
