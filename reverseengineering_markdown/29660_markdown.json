  "content": "I need to make a dominator tree where I need to tell a function(a) dominates function(b). There is an API in GraphAlgorithms which needs GDirected graph and \"vertex from\" parameters, but I am having trouble figuring out how to make that graph. Can anyone help with this problem?\n\nIn the dominance tree, I need to find a particular function or basic blocks is a dominator.(either of them will work)\n\nThe GdirectedGraph has parameters V and E, I don't know what to put in these parameters.\n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated.\n\np.s. dominance :\na node 'a' dominates node 'b' if all paths from start to 'b' contain 'a'; a node always dominates itself (except in 'strict dominance', which is all dominators except for itself)\n\n",
