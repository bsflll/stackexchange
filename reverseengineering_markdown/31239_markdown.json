  "content": "Decided to write out a list of still unsolved fundamental problems in the field of reverse engineering.\n\nThis means that today - there is no easy solution to these problems, or problems that can only be solved manually with a lot of effort and time.\n\nAll these problems are mainly related to the lack of debugging information in pe-executables, therefore, I did not separate them into separate topics-questions.\n\nLet me know if there is already a solution for at least one of these problems.\n\n",
