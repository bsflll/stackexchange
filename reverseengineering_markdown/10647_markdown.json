  "content": "I have a laptop that I recently lost the BIOS Admin password for. I contacted the manufacturer and, after giving them some information about my BIOS (version, uuid), they sent me a file, smc.bin to put on a USB stick and boot in order to reset the BIOS password.\n\nI'm interested in how this works and what the binary file is. I'm skilled with linux, but don't know much about reverse-engineering. What tools can I use to examine this binary? What's a introductory thought-process to determine what a binary file like this is?\n\n",
