  "content": "I know that pointer to the security cookie in Load Configuration Directory is 4 bytes long for 32-bit exe and 8 bytes long for 64-bit one (source), but what is the size of the security cookie itself?\n\nEdit: the accepted answer links to a long article, here's the quote from it:\n\nAnd since I can't find any official source for gs_cookie.c online here's the important part, which also shows the default values:\n\n```\n#ifdef _WIN64\n#define DEFAULT_SECURITY_COOKIE ((UINT_PTR)0x00002B992DDFA232)\n#else  /* _WIN64 */\n#define DEFAULT_SECURITY_COOKIE ((UINT_PTR)0xBB40E64E)\n#endif  /* _WIN64 */\n\nUINT_PTR __security_cookie = DEFAULT_SECURITY_COOKIE;\n\n```\nAnd just for completeness the documentation for UINT_PTR shows it's just int for 32-bit and __int64 for 64-bit (both unsigned).\n\n",
