      "text": "Generally, without knowing what specifically is being looked for, you can list the string references for cmd.exe (there can be multiple), find the command you want, and set a breakpoint on the instructions that reference it. Once you resume the process, type the command you want (which should trigger one of your breakpoints). If you traverse up the callstack some number of frames, you should find a function that contains the scope for the \"processing of the commands\". If you're looking for the parser, specifically, there's another (similar) pattern you can use.",
