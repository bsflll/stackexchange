  "content": "I'm curious if it's possible to reverse engineer the hat positioning and control of the StackExchange winter bash.\n\nThey offer the \"show controls\" checkbox, but it's still all mouse-based; when you try to get as large a hat and as far off as possible, it simply starts shrinking, and it's difficult to go back.  Any idea if it's possible to get around that?  (The controls only seem to change the alignment, and are not too helpful.)\n\n",
