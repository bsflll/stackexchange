  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/21833/how-can-i-retrieve-image-files-embedded-compressed-in-a-mpl-file",
  "content": "There are some images hidden somewhere in a PE I have, I can't figure out how to extract them. \n\nThis PE is from around 1997 (I think it's 32 bit) and I believe it contains some 3D model renders from the game Shadow Warrior as .PICT files. Using PE Explorer, I was able to see the section headers: [![Headers][1]][1]\nHowever, I see no way to actually unpack the data.\n\nAny help would be appreciated\n\nEDIT3: I am now almost certain that all the images are actually stored within this file: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4rmr0e545a8vova/GW_SW.MPL?dl=0\nIt's a MPL file, which usually doesn't hold images, but looking at file sizes, it seems to be the only likely candidate.\n\nI believe the program is supposed to extract and uncompress some audio and picture from inside this MPL, but I have no idea how to do that myself.\n\nThe program only runs under old operating systems, so if there was a way to take the images out of memory as the program was uncompressing, I don't think I can do that here on my newer pc. However, I do have access to a few DLL files that I can extract from the START.EXE.\n\n",
