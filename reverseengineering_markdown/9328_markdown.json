  "content": "I'm fairly new to the RE world, started right around a week and have gotten my hands dirty with some really good stuff on this website. Pardon my naive knowledge.\n\nCurrently, I'm trying to reverse a DLL file of a certain EXE. \nThe EXE makes calls to functions of this DLL for looking up certain values which I plan to patch eventually.\n\nHow do I go about debugging the DLL while the application is running? \n\nI would like to be able to place a break point in my DLL and get a hit in IDA Pro while the call is made from the application.\n\nRight now, I patch the DLL by simply hoping for it to work, but I'm pretty sure that there exists a much productive method.\n\nI'm using IDA Pro as my flavor of tool.\nYou could suggest me if some other disassembler can help me achieve the same.\n\nCould someone be kind enough to guide me around this task?\n\n",
