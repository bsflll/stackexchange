  "content": "There are lots of programs I seen that can locate a swf running in memory, capture it and return source code. Usually the AS byte code is generated as well.\n\nWhat I looking to do is the opposite, I'm trying to match a section of Action Script byte-code to a section of disassembly from a Shockwave Flash program. \n\nBasically match p-code to disassembly.\n\nIs there any good techniques or software that can do this.\n\n",

      "content": "This is how it works at .NET. When the method is compiled a table is generated that contains the information (including offset, length) to match MSIL code to their machine code counterparts. However not all MSIL instructions have meaningful machine code counterpart, instead the table contains the info to match a sequence of MSIL instructions (block) to the machine counterparts.\n\nYou can access the table via Debugging or Profiler interface, or as I did, you can reverse engineer.\n\nI'm not sure if such table exists in Flash, and if so is there a way to get it via documented function calls. But this should be one technique to consider.\n\n",
