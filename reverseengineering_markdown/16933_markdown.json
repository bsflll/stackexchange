  "content": "may anyone explain to me why most of the debuggers don't auto recognize functions?\n\nThis is a feature I only found in IDA and ollydbg, any other debugger I tried just don't analyze the functions as IDA and olly do.\n\nI understand that this could be a performance issue to justify don't set this feature as the default behaviour, but why debuggers like x64dbg seems to just don't have the feature?\n\nThanks.\n\n",

Even if a list of instructions-to-be-executed is displayed, there is no guarantee at all that that is going to happen in that order and with those instructions.",

      "content": "As assembly instruction sets are reasonably complex, properly figuring out a function boundaries inside a big executable binaries is a somewhat difficult task. Even IDA, which specializes in that, has quite a few mistakes and misses in certain scenarios.\n\nThis goes back to disassembly strategies, which are basically the algorithm used to provide disassembly listings for given stream of binary. They're often divided to two categories:\n\nThey both have their pros and cons although Linear sweep is considered simpler to implement and recursive disassembly to yield better results.\n\nMost debuggers don't focus too much on the disassembly task because usually, instruction pointer registers will point to the correct function to disassemble and the need to disassemble big binary blobs and recognise functions is rare. Additionally, as mostly static analysis tool IDA puts a lot more focus into exposure of the \"whole picture\", where debuggers tend to shine a light on only a small piece of the executable at a time.\n\nP.S.\n\nx64dbg is another debugger (considered an ollydbg replacement by some) with decent function discovery.\n\n",
