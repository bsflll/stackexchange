  "content": "TL;DR: is there any chance of decoding custom picture format in case I have sufficient amount of data? Please see examples at end.\n\nI have binary files of an old DOS diskmag (late 90's). After couple of weeks playing with 010 Editor, Kaitai Struct and Python I managed to get somehow structured data from these files. It was eventually quite easy, files are innerly indexed and contains all pieces - something like Doom WAD, nothing unexpected for that years.\n\nSo now I can extract texts (stored as plaintext), sounds (stored mostly as PCM), music (MOD, XM), fonts (bitmaps) and pictures. Some pictures are stored as simple bitmap (not BMP with header and so, just raw pixel data), some pictures are compressed with PCX-like RLE algorithm, which was not a problem for me.\n\nBut there is also some other compression I do not recognize. Let's say that for every unknown picture i have:\n\nIt seems to me that sizes of blobs depends on picture complexity and unique used colors. Also I guess that first blob is a dictionary of some kind (or maybe a Huffman tree?), whereas second blob contains compressed picture content itself.\n\nAbove that I suspect there is some weird home-made lossy compression, due easily recognisable artifacts around edges and even 8x8 quantization blocks in gradient-filled areas. See below for examples, I have thousands of them.\n\nSo my question: is there any chance of decoding these pictures? Do I have enough of data, or am I missing something? I think that everything I need is to recognize compression algorithm. Can anybody help me with it? I belive I can do the rest of work in Python as usually.\n\n(Sorry for not linking binary blobs directly, I don't have enough of reputation here...)\n\nEdit 1: Added example 06-04002-0004 - the smallest picture I've found (212x160 px).\n\nEdit 2: I've realized that diskmag EXE have debug symbols inside! Some interesting function names are:\n\nI can not say if it is more likely for decoding videos (yes, diskmag engine have his own format for videos too, I'm not that far yet), but maybe it will help?\n\nEdit 3: Diskmag EXE for download: https://filebin.ca/3kL3kgNAqlJI\n\nExample 06-04002-0004\n\n\n\nExample 06-05000-0004\n\n\n\nExample 06-05050-0004\n\n\n\nExample 06-05483-0004\n\n\n\nExample 06-07011-0004\n\n\n\n",
