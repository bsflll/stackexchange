  "link": "https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/22955/hex-ray-decompiler-inline-function-not-recognized",
  "content": "While trying to decompile an application with Hex-Ray 7.0, I stumbled upon the problem that in nearly all cases, what seems to be a certain inline function will not be recognised, which bloats the code base and makes it really hard to read.\nThe function seems to be strcpy or something similar. Is there a way to have the Decompiler change the mentioned parts to an inline function? Or can I do it manually somehow?\nHere's a screenshot to illustrate my issue:\n\nThanks a lot in advance!\n\n",
